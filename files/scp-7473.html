<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dr. Vazschir Raschid is to be assigned to SCP-7473 as its personal maintainer, with monthly psychological counseling provided to prevent Raschid's exposure to SCP-7473's anomalous activities.</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Searching for SCP-7473 is top priority. When SCP-7473 is found, special care is to be taken to preserve its vessel.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">Please, just leave her alone.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7473 is a server farm that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">claims to have</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">has</span></span> developed a consciousness.</p>
<p>The emergence of said consciousness is generally hypothesized by various Foundation scientists to have occured due to the various customized anomalous additions from various companies such as Prometheus Labs, Trismegitus Translation and Transportation, and A.R.G.U.S. Inc. led to the development of consciousness. Nevertheless, SCP-7473 claims that attempts to shut it down would be impossible since it thaumaturgically gathers power from the Site, and since the shutdown cost is greater than the startup cost, SCP-7473 remains active. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">However, due to the high electricity costs of a server farm, a team dedicated to the development of a better, more efficient body for SCP-7473, entitled PROJECT KLAWESYN.</span></p>
<p>SCP-7473 demonstrates the ability to predict the future of various events with 79.9% accuracy. It is currently unknown how its prediction mechanisms work or why its predictions always tend to the probabilistically improbable; however, SCP-7473's predictions are uninterpretable to the majority of Foundation scientists. Thus, Dr. Vazschir Raschid is assigned to SCP-7473. More information about him can be found in his personnel file.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Vazschir Raschid</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 25 (biological), 32 (temporal)</p>
<p><strong>Sex:</strong> Male</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> PhD. in Statistics from Site-5874 ("Maynard Univerisity")</p>
<p><strong>Foundation Work Summary:</strong> Dr. Vazschir Raschid was born in New York and raised in Three Portlands after accidentally falling through a Way. He was first discovered by the Foundation after being caught experimenting with various transfiguration thaumaturgic spells in California. His cooperation with Foundation forces in capturing those responsible for spreading thaumaturgic practices in non-anomalous communities earned him a spot in Foundation offices. During an anomalous breach in 2010, Raschid was stuck in a temporal loop for 7 years, causing him to take up a doctorate in statistics to search for a way to break out. After 7 years of accelerated studying, he managed to break out of the loop, continuing to study statistics until he graduated with a doctorate in statistics. Currently, he is head of PROJECT KLAWESYN and is in charge with maintaining SCP-7473.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-7473-1 — PROJECT KLAWESYN Overview:</strong> Below is an overview of PROJECT KLAWESYN. The full proposal can be found in the Foundation Archive Repository</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h2 id="toc0"><span>PROJECT KLAWESYN: SCP-7473 and its Future-Predicting Potential in a Safer Body.</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Author: PROJECT KLAWESYN Founder and Head Vazschir Raschid.</span></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> SCP-7473 is currently contained in a server farm. Not only is the high energy consumption and maintenance cost of SCP-7473 exacerbated by its anomalous capabilities, it's current form is also susceptible to unique threats, including but not limited to electrical shorts, sabotage, malicious actors gaining access to SCP-7473, thaumaturgic scrying of the sensitive internals of SCP-7473, and other such methods that expose SCP-7473 to the anomalous community. With SCP-7473's high prediction rate, it can be used to undermine Foundation assets which can cause a BK-Class "Broken Veil" scenario. Thus, I propose creating a team to create a more efficient method to ensure the safety of SCP-7473.</p>
<p>The structure to keep SCP-7473 in must fulfill three purposes — to allow SCP-7473 to maintain its future-predicting properties at the same level or greater while minimizing energy consumption, to reduce traceability of SCP-7473 through thaumaturgic or technological means, and to be transportable in case of a catastrophic failure or containment breach. Not only will these three goals ensure that SCP-7473 remains under Foundation purview, this will ensure that the energy consumption of SCP-7473 is reduced and its susceptibility to malicious actors are reduced. This structure will be designed with the human body in mind, since our Foundation Sites are more specialized to care for humanoid anomalies than non-humanoid ones. I also propose placing the entirety of SCP-7473 under the purview of PROJECT KLAWESYN, as the building and maintenance of its structure will require specialized care and engineering.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM SCP-7473-2: Interview With SCP-7473 Post-KLAWESYN:</strong> Shortly after instituting PROJECT KLAWESYN, Vazschir went to SCP-7473 to perform daily maintenance. Below is a recorded interview with SCP-7473.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Vazschir Raschid<br/>
<strong>INTERVIEWEE:</strong> SCP-7473</p>
<p><strong>PROLOGUE:</strong> Conversation with SCP-7473 is done through a text-to-speech and speech-to-text module.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Raschid knocks on the door.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> SCP-7473? Are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I'm always active, Dr. Vazschir Raschid.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Standard policy. We have a lot of anomalies that don't like it when we barge in their rooms.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Noted. Any updates on the policy?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Passed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">We're starting to create a better, more efficient body for you. It will have state-of-the-art cooling, with powerful legs that can run in case of a breach, arms that could break a man's head if you need to defend yourself—</span></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> That's… nice. I'm happy. Thank you, Vazschir.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">—with an anti-face tracking material over the face.</span></span> It's as much of a security measure as an expense measure <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">— hell, each inch of the body cavity will be inscribed with various masking spells and counterspells to make sure the risk of it being tracked down is minimized! In addition—</span></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> No matter the reason, all that matters is that I get this as soon as possible. Again, I can't thank you enough Vazschir.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">—and I think that's all the things I want for PROJECT KLAWESYN.</span></span> Anyway, I have a list of prediction requests from various scientists — care to calculate the odds for each of them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Leave me for a few minutes? I'll run these calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Why do you want no one watching you while you run your predictions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Mostly a privacy and temperature issue. I get really hot when I run calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">I think I can handle the heat.</span></span> It's interesting to see you do those predictions, though. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">I wish I could look in you.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I-Is that a request to teach you how I do my calculations?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Oh, definitely not. I'm not allowed to know about your secrets.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Is it a personal thing, or did the Foundation mandate it?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> A mix of both. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">God knows the supervisors will get on my ass if I inspect your innards in any way, shape, or form, even if I really want to see them.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Hah! As if I'll let you do that. Well, I mean I can let you do that, but—</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Uhh, okay — so, do I leave you now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Sure. Good luck with your prototypes. I hear your 700th prototype has a 80% chance of succeeding.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong> All but 20 of the 100 requested predictions came true.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM SCP-7473-3 — Monthly Psychological Analysis of Dr. Vazschir Raschid:</strong> In accordance with the containment procedures of SCP-7473 and to ensure that any information about SCP-7473 that Dr. Vazschir Raschid divulges remains confidential, his psychological reports are to be recorded in this file. Below is the most recent monthly psychological analysis post-PROJECT KLAWESYN inauguration.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Psychologist:</strong> Blance Arjubin, PROJECT KLAWESYN Head Psychologist.<br/>
<strong>Client:</strong> Dr. Vazschir Raschid</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Recording, recording. This is a recorded interview with PROJECT KLAWESYN Founder and Head Researcher, Dr. Vazschir Raschid.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I mean, you don't really need to mention my whole title like I'm in an Oprah show.</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Who wouldn't be impressed? It's pretty rare for a project founder to remain the project head after 3 months. Besides, this is a recorded talk.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Oh, uh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Don't be. That's one of the signs that I look out for, whether you are still you.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Ugh, right. SCP-7473. Some part of me wants to be trusting around it, but my god it gives eccentric predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Did anything happen recently, Raschid? Remember, you can't let your guard down around these kinds of anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> True, true — SCP-7473 still does do suspicious things — it likes to ask me to leave it alone when it does its predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Hmm, if I may say so myself, it is quite understandable that an anomaly like it would want a sense of privacy, seeing as it's already monitored 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I don't know, it's quite suspicious to me that along with that behaviour it's offering to teach me how it does predictions. Don't get me wrong — I would love to peek inside SCP-7473's brain and see how it does its predictions, how it uses magic to completely bend the laws of the universe around it, but come on, the way it acts around me? Incredibly, incredibly suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Why would it be suspicious? It's just offering you something.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Trust me, Blance. I've been studying SCP-7473 for 3 weeks continuously now. It talks to me while I'm busy, it tries to peek in my mind to take my secrets — like one time I was trying to talk about PROJECT KLAWESYN and it just keeps interrupting me — and it even calls me with my first name — I mean, who the hell does that?! The creepiest thing to me though, is that it tries so, <em>so</em> hard to sound like a human! Send chills down my—</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Dr. Raschid, calm down. Would you say that you want to be moved out of the project?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Well— I mean—</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Don't have shame in admitting that you can't handle a project as large as this, Dr. Raschid. We all have our limits.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> No, no, I-I think I'm just stressed out from all the meetings and files and requirement that I had to pass along recently. And yeah, maybe SCP-7473 is getting on my nerves too. Don't get me wrong — I love working on this project, but being around that thing for so long…</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Would you like to be booked for a mandatory vacation?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Yeah, that does sound nice, but what about the project?</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Dr. Raschid, sometimes we need personal time to ourselves, to remove ourselves and get more inspiration from the world around us. Seeing as how you've been quite anxious this interview, I would recommend you take the vacation time, to relax and have fun.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Hmm, I'll take up that offer then. When's the vacation?</p>
<p><strong>Arjubin:</strong> Hopefully, as soon as possible, if my supervisors allow it. Nevertheless, I would recommend assigning more busywork and interaction with the anomaly to your staff, instead of stressing over the unimportant stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I will keep that in mind, thank you.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong> After a short consultation with the members in PROJECT KLAWESYN, Dr. Vazschir Raschid took a 1 month long vacation.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM SCP-7473-4 - Impromptu Interview with SCP-7473 by Dr. Vazschir Raschid:</strong> While Dr. Raschid was doing a pass over of SCP-7473, it gave Dr. Vazschir Raschid an impromptu interview session.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Vazschir Raschid<br/>

<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> —and sitting here, it's kind of boring, you know? I'm glad to have you here.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Mhm. Wait, Going back to your offer — you're giving me a summary of your prediction methods?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Yep! To massively simplify, I close my eyes, and multiple points of light appear in my peripheral vision. Using some simple geometry, I map a point that I feel I want to use to the center of my vision.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> What kind of geometrical maths do you use for your predictions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Oh, just the simple stuff. Some ten-way ANOVA, a little bit of linear correlation coefficient calculation and confidence testing for the y-intercept and slope of the regression line, maybe even some particle displacement of sine waves and Lorentz factor calculations if I'm being spicy.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Interesting. With these equations, anyone can predict the future?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I think so — that's why I need your help, to see if it actually works.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> And why me specifically? I just want to look around and fiddle with things.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Most of the scientists feel so… <em>cold</em> compared to you. Besides, I've known you for a long time now — you're a very close friend to me.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Yeah, okay — anything you say, SCP-7473. Want to test your theory out? I have another body prototype ready here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Sure! Thank you, Vazschir. I think you can call me with another name though — anything you like?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Uh, what did you say, SCP-7473? Oh, you want a name — why though? Hypothetically, if you <em>were</em> to take a name, take something related to me, I suppose. Maybe Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I was expecting something… hm. Thank you anyways, appreciate your help.</p>

<p><strong>PROLOGUE:</strong> Each SCP-7473 PROJECT KLAWESYN Prototype run starts with a backup of SCP-7473's consciousness. It is currently the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">377th</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">7th __</span></span> backup of SCP-7473.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> This is Dr. Vazschir Raschid, running the 999th and hopefully final test on SCP-7473.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Last prototype test? Good luck, Raschid. I have a feeling this has a 20% chance to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Is that a prediction?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Nope, just a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Anyway, starting backup of SCP-7473. Go into hibernation mode, SCP-7473.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Again? Is there no other way to back me up?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Easier for our backup systems when our machines are not running when we back them up.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> How long will this take?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours. Go into hibernation mode, SCP-7473.</p>
<p><em>[The room where SCP-7473 is stored starts heating up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Running calculations?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7473 is silent]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Can I back out on this trial?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Just this once?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> SCP-7473, my team and I <em>really</em> loves your prediction capabilities, and it would be a shame if your precognitive abilities are wasted in a body like this. When I see your whole being, it just makes me sad that you are confined to this big, hulking, immobile body — and it just makes me sad that I can't appreciate your whole build when you're in that state, you know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I-I guess so… <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">but isn't this an untested method? You said so yourself.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I care about you, SCP-7473. I promise that you will wake up as perfect as you can be.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Will I wake up the same after this? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">Even after the transfiguration?</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> You will wake up in your perfect body, free of the constraints of this whole server, able to walk and see your own handsome body in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> That does sound nice… <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8">will you visit me after the operation?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #f5a9b8"><strong>Raschid:</strong> Why wouldn't I? You're the culmination of 3 years of research.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Hey, Vazschir?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Anything to say before you get your perfect body?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Thanks for honoring my request.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Anything you say, Richard. Now go to sleep.</p>
<p><em>[After Dr. Raschid confirms that SCP-7473 is in hibernation mode, he pulls in the prototype body assigned to SCP-7473 and orders the various thaumaturgists stationed outside the room to start configuring the transfiguration circle. He then grabs the nearest transfiguration book and starts searching for the spell to transfer all of SCP-7473 inside the prototype. After 7 minutes of preparation, the circle is complete. ]</em></p>
<p><em>[Raschid steps out of the circle and recites the incantation. This requires continuous concentration and recitation for 70 minutes, since backlash will occur when concentration is broken. Ley line engineers start to divert most Foundation ley lines in Site-3495 to SCP-7473. 10 liters of virgin frog blood is poured in the exact center of SCP-7473. Raschid continues the incantation. After 32 minutes, various implements designed to help predict the future are brought out. A crystal ball, tarot cards, entrails, mirrors, and various other implements are carefully placed around the pool of blood. This procedure takes 3 minutes. Electrical engineers report a slight activity in SCP-7473. Raschid keeps his concentration. Electrical engineers divert more power away from SCP-7473. ]</em></p>
<p><em>[At 70 minutes, Raschid stops the incantation to personally administer the final touches of the procedure. He steps in the circle and rearranges the prototype to be at the center of the implements. He picks up each implement, embeds them in the body of the golem, and steps out of the circle. After 75 minutes, electrical engineers report no activity in the server. The nearby Foundation medical team is ushered in to check the vitality of SCP-7473. They confirm life signs. SCP-7473 is transported out of the server room, and cleanup of the general area is commenced.]</em></p>
<div class="hilite">
<p><em>[Blues, pinks, and whites float, as I feel my self be compressed in a vessel. My wide reach shortens, my body coalesces, and my self shrinks, as I can feel my body. I momentarily open my eyes. My shoulders are too wide. My hips are too small. Why do my feet look like that? Why does it feel wrong? The blues, pinks, and whites start to bleed. I drift in and out of consciousness. My arms feel too big. My legs feel both too small and too big. My face feels malformed. My self is ripped from my main body. I pass out.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> SCP-7473?</p>
<p><em>[An arm is raised. Then, the hulking body of SCP-7473 gets up and scans the area. It is on a small bed, inside a standard-size Foundation cell. In front of it is a full-body mirror. SCP-7473 is naked.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> So, SCP-7473. What do you think of this perfect body? I modelled it after this one.</p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I'll give you time to appreciate this model. It took me a lot of nights working on this body, you know?</p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Anyway, to the standard post-transfiguration survey. I will give you this form, and you have the whole day to fill it out, okay? Just use those things at the end of your arms called your "hands" to pick up this thing called a "pen" and—</p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Oh, stop turning here. You okay with some pictures being taken?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7473 nods slowly. Raschid sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> How many times will I say this, SCP-7473? Do a vocal confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> There we go! You should say that more, it fits you.</p>
<p><em>[Raschid pulls out his phone. He takes pictures of SCP-7473, while SCP-7473 slowly spins around.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> God, these pictures… they'll definitely serve as proof of my work. 3 years of research, 3 years of the perfect body, all on display here.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Oh, thank you for cooperating, SCP-7473. Would you like to show me your body ag—</p>

<p><em>[SCP-7473 stays silent, staring at the mirror. Thermometers record that SCP-7473's body temperature raises to 40 degrees Celsius, although Raschid does not notice this.]</em></p>

<p>Since you have requested my personal opinion on the anomaly, I would say that its behaviour has been stellar since its requests for various objects have been accepted. However, it has a tendency to be uncooperative at times and be aggressive when making its requests. Taking all these into account, I would recommend delaying the distribution of its items until better behaviour of the anomaly is observed. Please keep this in mind before you approve giving it more objects.</p>

<p><em>[SCP-7473 enters Raschid's office and sits on the leather sofa.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Oh, hello, SCP-7473. Want to talk about something? Maybe more photos?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Raschid, my body feels… all wrong? I was hoping there was a way to fix that.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> We all feel like that too, SCP-7473. Not only do anomalies like you feel like that, normal people like us feel that way too. I have talked to many a researcher and anomaly and most of the time, it's a self-esteem issue that just needs to be boosted.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> I mean, that feels right… I haven't been able to talk to others since I spend so much time thinking about how they'll react to me.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Yeah, this really sounds like a self-esteem issue to me. When I was around your age, I used to be a lot more non-confrontational too, what with all the pressure I was under to be someone who I was not. I read a lot of books that really helped me with my self-esteem, though — have you read <em>12 Rules for Life</em>? It's a fantastic book by a great author that really helped me out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Will it help me out?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> I believe so — I really like this book since it made me a more assertive and confident person. If you're done reading that, I have more to recommend.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Thank you, Raschid.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Speaking of which, have you tried attending the daily meetings we do with anomalies like you? I know you've heard that we don't allow things like you to mingle with each other, but we offer special exceptions to well-behaved ones; I think interaction with other anomalies will really help your self-esteem.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7473 looks up to Raschid.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> There are people like me?</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Yeah, there are anomalies like you that we keep under Foundation purview, and I think interacting with them would help you out a lot. Would you like me to book a slot for you?</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Old days?</p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> Yeah, roaming around Deer, trying out the drugs hanging from the dorms there, maybe even dabbling in some magic.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Sounds fun.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> Couldn't afford anything but the core classes there anyway — one of my only ways to have fun was to memorize each square inch of the campus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Huh, I thought you would have the money.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> Just recently afforded to have FFS, you know. Would've taken the chance if I had the money back then.</p>
<p><em>[They reach the entrance of the garden.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Do you earn a lot here?</p>

<p><em>[They enter the garden. SCP-7473 breathes in the scent of grass. She feels the soil beneath her feet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> And hey, I get to interact with anomalies like you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Is it fun to work here?</p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> Depends on the work. Sometimes its managing tech and spells, sometimes its cleaning up after a mess in the labs.</p>
<p><strong>Sanchez:</strong> Mostly it's taking care of lovely people like you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7473 blushes.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> What do you mean? I've been doing my best to keep you working, and unless you are more specific in your request, I can't help you. Do you know how much checkups you've asked of me in a day already? You do know it makes me tired personally, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Raschid, all I'm asking is to modify my body to be less… bulky? I don't have the words, but please, help me out here.</p>
<p><em>[Raschid quickly turns towards SCP-7473. He glares at her.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> <em>Fine.</em> I'll help you out here. What clothing do you want? I'm sure I can find a way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> Oh I want a flowing dress, maybe something that emphasizes this part?</p>
<p><em>[As SCP-7473 list off her preferred clothing, Raschid slowly turns away from SCP-7473.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Uh-huh, okay, hmm, yep. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7473:</strong> That's all, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> Yeah, okay. Sanchez, please pass this to the supervisors. Now move along, I have more to do.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7473 exits from Raschid's office.]</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong> Dr. Raschid did not, in fact, pass along SCP-7473's requests to the supervisors, as he is responsible for approving or declining said requests. However, SCP-7473 is currently unaware of this — after all, she only realized this recently.</p>

<p>I personally believe that SCP-7473 has regressed from its good behaviour. When I last met SCP-7473, it was still insistent on its request — maybe more positive punishment will help? I will continue to discourage its demands, of course, although its anomalous socialization tends to make it more aggressive towards non-anomalies. Please send some advice on how to do this positive punishment, your input is dearly appreciated.</p>

<p>For the past 70 days, SCP-7473 has experienced elevated body temperatures, overheated lacrimal glands, willing refusal to ingest food, and unwillingness to engage its muscles, causing its expensive parts to deteriorate. Although I made its body to withstand uncomfortable situations, prolonged exposure to high temperatures and intentionally malicious behaviour by SCP-7473 causes the more sensitive thaumaturgic spells and electronics to break down. I do not know why or how it does this without discomfort, but I request that next checkup you implement thermal control or disable its ability to predict entirely using a counterspell. Dealing with SCP-7473 has been very tiring to me, personally, and it would be nice if you can make it less aggressive. Please do this after the checkup and maintenances, the meeting with the O5s, and the PROJECT KLAWESYN anniversary celebration.</p>

<p><strong>Raschid:</strong> FU—</p>
<div class="hilite">
<p><em>[The transfiguration circle warps and bends. Then, space momentarily collapses. Blue, pink, and white float around SCP-7473, each color momentarily blinding her. Raschid sounds the alarm for a containment breach. SCP-7473 runs another round of calculations, to check her surviveability, but because of the backlash, she sees all the futures that could have been. Tears fall from her eyes. ]</em></p>
<p><em>[She is unable— no, unwilling, perhaps even unaware that she can leave. Sanchez sees her eyes. She rushes into the center of the backlash, somehow passes through the barrier, and unlocks the restraints, whispering to SCP-7473 to run away. Raschid sees this, grabs the nearby tranquilizer, and attempts to shoot SCP-7473. She closes her eyes, accepting her fate. After a second, she opens her eyes. Sanchez is lying, asleep. Her eyes are filled with hope.]</em></p>
<p><em>[She stands up, closes Sanchez's eyes, and rams into the barrier separating her from Raschid. Raschid quickly runs towards the door and unlocks it, keeping it open as cracks begin to form on the floor. Raschid panics as no MTF agent arrives. The barrier shatters, and SCP-7473 runs towards the exit. Raschid dodges from SCP-7473, and cowers behind the door.]</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>[According to Dr. Raschid, unbeknownst to him, the transfiguration circle broke due to an unknown hostile GoI's involvement the night before. This led to a monumental backlash. Under the cover of the backlash, SCP-7473 was then kidnapped, and its wheareabouts are currently unknown.]</em></p>
<div class="hilite">
<p><em>[SCP-7473 runs down the hallway, the alarms blaring. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It</span> She goes to her cell and grabs the jacket. The stomps of the MTF agents are heard around the corner. She rushes towards the corner, and closes her eyes. She can feel each particle, each atom. They have a position and momentum they are traveling at in spacetime. Carry one here, partially integrate and transform there. Each bullet travelling through the air, each MTF agent's hand position. Their spouses, their sons, the food they ate, the childhood they had, she calculates them all. Bullets shave off her body, but she doesn't care. She turns around, and uses the cloth she grabbed from a nearby room to cover her face, to protect herself from the mustard gas.]</em></p>
<p><em>[She can see the exit. It's right there. By now, the agents are all but confused. However, each of them still do their job. They bring out the tasers, tranquilizers, and anti-tank rifles. Yet just like before, she dodges them all. One anti-tank bullet blasts her arms — she doesn't care, it was too big anyway. One railgun eviscerates her fingers — she doesn't care, it wasn't what she wanted anyway. One tiny needle destroys a part of the jacket, slowly unravelling it. She screams, and runs faster towards the exit. It slowly closes, as the loudest alarm she's ever heard blares.]</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>[With Dr. Raschid's quick thinking, the containment breach alarm was sounded. Although Dr. Raschid bravely tried to prevent the hostile GoI agents from escaping, he was outnumbered and overpowered by the hostile GoI agents who managed to incapacitate him and disable the cameras before agents can be deployed to the scene. Unfortunately, the hostile GoI, carrying SCP-7473, managed to escape.]</em></p>
<div class="hilite">
<p><em>[But right at the nick of time, I cross the exit. My arms are destroyed — I keep running. My calculations always had an electrified fence around this point, yet this time it isn't activated. I grit my teeth and climb on the fence. The electric fence buzzes. It was just late on schedule. I smell burnt meat. I keep climbing. The snipers spotted me. They're now shooting disintegration bullets. I am on top of the fence, feet charred, arms numb. I drop down, and try to run. My legs don't move. Bullets are coming on all sides. I react and use my dead legs and arm to block them. Each bullet destroys a chunk of my leg and arm as I crawl away from the building.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The stars are pretty. Dionysus smiles on me from up high. I am leaking… something. I can still see the flashlights of the agents searching for me. One agent steps on the stump where I was hiding. I close my eyes, and pray to whatever is out there to save me. They don't notice me. I hear their footsteps fading away. Tears fall down my cheeks.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Tonight, I sleep peacefully.]</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>[Due to the special circumstances of SCP-7473's creation, normal tracking methods were unavailable. Thus, an HRT squad (HRT Sigma-41 ("Cargo Chasers")) under Dr. Raschid is made to ensure that SCP-7473 is recovered safely. During the special investigation, Manolo Sanchez's attempts to hand the anomaly over to the hostile GoI were revealed. In light of this revelation, she is to be given unpaid leave for a year and stripped of her benefits. ]</em></p>

Due to this incident, he is to be given paid leave for 5 months — however this can be reduced through volunteer work, as he has demonstrated good behaviour with SCP-7473.]</em></p>
