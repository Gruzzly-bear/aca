            <h1>SCP-8164</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8164</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8164 can be kept in a low-risk humanoid containment cell with standard amenities. No attempts to communicate with SCP-8164 are to be made outside of testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8164 is a 38-year-old human female in good health. Whenever an individual attempts to communicate with SCP-8164 in any fashion, both subjects will instead engage in a question-and-answer dialogue (detailed in Appendix A). The contents of this dialogue are identical every time, except when interrupted by an external force. Subjects report being conscious during the interaction, but unable to control their actions.</p>
<p>SCP-8164's skull is occupied by a solid white object (designated SCP-8164-1) similar in size, shape, and mass to a human brain. SCP-8164-1 is apparently impervious to physical force, as well as all tested non-invasive scans. While the rest of SCP-8164's nervous system functions normally, SCP-8164-1 displays no electrical activity of its own. SCP-8164 is seemingly immune to telepathy and mind-altering techniques.</p>
<p>SCP-8164's head contains seven gunshot wounds of varying nature, ranging from nine to twenty-one years in the past. In each case, evidence suggests that the bullet ricocheted off of SCP-8164-1 or shattered on impact. SCP-8164's medical history is otherwise unremarkable.</p>
<p>SCP-8164 has not communicated with personnel or divulged information of its own volition. It appears to be satisfied with the conditions of its containment.</p>
