<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>Due to the currently un<span style="color: #c40233">confirmed</span> status of SCP-7894, and the estimated size of the affected area, all containment efforts are to be focused on archival of collected evidence for review.</p>
<p>Any staff found spreading rumours involving SCP-7894 are reminded that sharing false <span style="color: #c40233">information</span> about an anomaly, regardless of how <span style="color: #c40233">dangerous</span> it is understood to be, may result in severe consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-7894 is an as of yet unproven phenomenon or <span style="color: #c40233">entity</span> hypothesised to be affecting the entirety of Site-61. SCP-7894 has been reported to manifest as typical 'poltergeist' activity, with SCP-7894 incidents including the movement or disappearance of items, inexplicable noises, and disembodied voices. These sounds have been reported to mimic speech, environmental noises, conversations, recordings, and even specific individual's voices. Those affected by SCP-7894 have also reported persistent feelings of being watched, but have stated they <span style="color: #c40233">can't explain</span> or identify a source.</p>
<p>To date, SCP-7894 has not shown to cause any major disruptions on site. Staff have been encouraged to document potential evidence for SCP-7894 activity for research purposes.</p>
<p>A partial list of various missing items attributed to SCP-7894 are as follows;</p>
<p>- Seven phones of different models.<br/>
- Three separate lightbulbs illuminating the East wing.<br/>
- <span style="color: #c40233">Over one-hundred</span> mundane documents relating to security camera observations.<br/>
- An entire lockbox filled with tape recordings.<br/>
- Over thirty more classified reports relating to civilian and <span style="color: #c40233">Foundation casualties</span>.<br/>
- The entire contents of the East wing's security room.<br/>
- Fifteen security cameras across three offices.<br/>
- One standard issue Foundation lab coat covered in crude drawings.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40233">It is not</span> known how many items have been lost in total. While some misplaced items attributed to SCP-7894 may be the result of <span style="color: #c40233">human</span> error, the volume of missing materials seem to suggest anomalous activity.</p>
<p>No trigger or discernible pattern for SCP-7894 occurrences has been discovered as of yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 7894-1: Outbound Requests</strong></p>
<p>Due to the nature of SCP-7894 a number of requests have been made to replace lost equipment and documentation, as well as various requests for tools, staff, or other actions to be taken. All requests have been reviewed by acquisition staff on Site-61.</p>
<p>Requests are as follows:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">

<th>Purpose</th>
<th>Outcome</th>

<p>"Is this recording? Oh, awesome. Alright…"</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Twenty seconds of silence.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"Sorry. Just trying to hype myself up for this."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Ten seconds of silence.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"Ok, my name is Junior Researcher Daniel Hargreaves. I am part of the team dedicated to researching SCP-7894's recorded 'poltergeist' activity and archiving it accordingly. Over the past several months we have had no major leads regarding the activity on site, and we are content to simply file it as a low risk anomaly."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves shuffles in his chair.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"We weren't sure if it was anomalous to begin with but uh, it has definitely proven us wrong! The Director has even sent out a really important message every day as a reminder to report potential evidence, you know? But uh, s-some of the stuff we reported just made things more complicated."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Ten seconds of silence.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"In the end, we had to really be careful what was filed away. We could get in big trouble with our bosses if we filed the wrong thing or wrote something the wrong way. They're quite the sticklers here! If they decided you shared the wrong thing, or even shared too much, you could be terminated. And the others, God, before they all… made mistakes, they even tried filing personal mail as evidence. Letters to loved ones, requests for assistance, self termination letters. Y-you know, things like that? It didn't matter in the end though, they've all been… erased now."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves begins to audibly sob.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"B-but anyway! The uh… th-the SCP in question has been keeping us all here around the clock! It- I mean the ones in charge just w-won't let us leave. Hours are long and, well, we all miss our families a lot. Including me. God I really do."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves begins to sniff and continues crying.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"B-but I get it! Gotta keep these things contained no matter what, huh? Some of them, hoo boy they are… they are super dangerous. Like, if they got out? End-of-the-world type dangerous."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves lets out a forced laugh. Light knocking can be heard at the door.<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></em></p>
<p>"So w-what we do, we do to keep the world s-safe! What I'm doing is to keep the world safe. Keep everyone safe. Keep Jacob safe."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves voice begins to crack and waver</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Jacob, I'm so s-sorry. I won't be able to take you out to see your s-sister this weekend. I won't be able to see Mr. Monocles again e-either. And I really wish I could see you, see you both, god, even just spend one more night together. Just to hear your voice, hear Monocles' little meows. Just to fall asleep in your arms one more time. Just us, our little happy family. Just one m-more t-time."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves' sobs grow louder.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"Please just be happy o-ok? I love you so much. More than anything. M-more than… everything."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves' can be heard crying for 20 seconds before breathing in sharply.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>A-and, if any Foundation personnel are reading this right now as well, please, just know…"</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves breathes out slowly.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>"… I'm so, so fucking sorry."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Researcher Hargreaves begins shouting.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c40233">"Do not come to Site-61! They can't be stopped! They can't be contained! They don't die!"</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>The knocking turns to loud banging as glass can be heard shattering.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c40233">"Information is the key! They know when you know! Don't let them spread! Don't look at them! Don't talk about them! Don't write about them! Please, just keep this place contained! Keep them contained! There's no one left! Don't send anyone here! I-"</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>A loud cracking and banging sound can be heard followed by voices matching multiple Site-61 staff shouting randomly constructed sentences and laughing.<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></em></p>
