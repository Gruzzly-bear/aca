            <h1>SCP-8949</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8949</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Anomalous Excavation Site G-77 has reached a depth of 1800 km, as of 16/09/2017. Foundation staff without pre-approval from their designated Site directors must use at least 1/3 of their PTO to aid in excavation. Site-77‘s excavation team is to continue to use removed spoils to supply civilians affected by SCP-8949 with adequate digging material. Site-77‘s demolitions team is to continue simulating regular minor volcanic activity to dissuade the local populace and the US government from investigating the area around Excavation Site G-77.</p>
<p>Standard amnestics have been shown to provide substantial reduction in SCP-8949 compulsory effects. Given that effects will wear off in a matter of days, further research into preventative measures has been deemed unnecessary. As this phenomenon has relatively low anomalous effect on civilian populations, resources have been diverted to better contain SCP-8949-A.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It is unknown whether proximity to SCP-8949-A increases the severity of SCP-8949 effects.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8949 is a memetic phenomenon in which sapient individuals are compelled to dig a hole at the nearest available location. Affected individuals typically will not engage in dangerous activities to satisfy this compulsion, but they have been recorded as traveling up to 400 km to find a suitable digging location. Subjects will dig until mild exhaustion, at which point they will return to their previous engagements until compelled by SCP-8949 again. These holes reach an average depth of 1.95 meters.</p>
<p>After testing multiple methods of excavation, it was discovered that only manual forms of excavation (ex: shovels, drills, explosives equal or less than .3 kg of TNT) would completely satisfy the compulsory effect of SCP-8949.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has a slight preference for males, at a roughly 60/40 split for affected humans. Foundation researchers have discovered the presence of SCP-8949 in octopi, as well as several sapient <a href="scp-1000.html">anomalous species</a>. As of 21/07/2017, there have been 5 fatalities involving SCP-8949. Each of these has been non-anomalous in nature and due to unrelated circumstances.</p>
<p>Extensive analysis of these holes revealed that roughly 93% are angled towards a point 1000 km below Haleakalā in Maui, Hawaii. Site-77 was established on the mainland to better investigate.</p>
<p>SCP-8949-A is an extra-dimensional space located within Excavation Site G-77. It is currently a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1000</span> 1800 km deep hole on the East Maui Shield. Most forms of heavy machinery are rendered inoperable within a 2 km radius of SCP-8949-A by phenomena theorized to be a secondary effect of SCP-8949. This has lead to the construction of an auxiliary Command center to supply Site staff with the requisite supplies. Soil and sediments removed from SCP-8949-A do not match any currently known location on Earth, though the approximate date of origin may be obtained using traditional archaeological techniques, such as radioactive dating. Temperatures and pressures are uniform throughout SCP-8949-A, despite its apparent location deep within the Earth‘s mantle.</p>

<p>Following a routine audit of Site-77, it was discovered that 98% of Site staff were currently assigned to excavation within SCP-8949. Several MTFs were needed to recover many of the items described in the catalogue kept by Site Director Juni. Site-77 is currently scheduled for demolition.</p>

</div>
<p>All resources previously designated to Site-77 shall be reassigned to Site-34‘s Amnestics Research Wing. Containment of SCP-8949 has been elevated to high priority.</p>
<p>Site-77 is to be considered lost and all personnel deceased. All requests to repurpose Site-77 into an anomalous abatement center will be rejected.</p>
