<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4818 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit in the low-security wing of Site 17 with standard privileges and amenities, contingent on its continued cooperation and good behaviour. SCP-4818 is permitted to retain the graphic novel collection it accumulated prior to containment, and is allowed up to twelve active graphic novel subscriptions.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-4818 becomes hostile, it is to be subdued with the use of a four square meter sheet coated in commercially available vantablack paint, modified to be fired from a net launcher, and held within a completely dark containment cell after being searched for any light generating objects. SCP-4818's release may be authorized by Site 17's Head of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology, should their assessment deem the risk of further violence to be minimal. Multiple or severe hostile incidents will result in SCP-4818 being transferred to a more secure facility.</p>
<p>SCP-4818 is to be regularly assessed by an attache from Mobile Task Force Alpha-9 "Last Hope", and is permitted to engage in its training assignments in designated areas.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4818 is an adolescent female of mixed European and Middle-Eastern descent. Any photons which make contact with SCP-4818's skin can be induced to form photonic molecules<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-4818 can form and dissolve photonic matter at will, so long as it is exposed to light. Objects composed of this photonic matter possess a crystalline lattice structure and an appearance similar to luminescent faceted gems.</p>
<p>The photonic matter SCP-4818 produces does not break, scratch, tear, or deform under stress like regular matter, however it does gradually shed photons until it has entirely dissipated. Physical shocks have been demonstrated to accelerate this deterioration. Photonic constructs typically fade at a rate of 100 lumens per hour, and dissipate completely upon reaching zero lumens. Applying approximately 1000 newtons of force to a photonic construct will also cause it to lose 100 lumens.</p>
<p>SCP-4818 is capable of restoring, maintaining, or increasing the luminosity of photonic constructs by maintaining skin contact.</p>
<p>At the time of recovery, SCP-4818 was only capable of generating small photonic jewels and figurines, as well as inflexible photonic armour over exposed skin.</p>

<hr/></div>
<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Dr. Luna Valdez
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-4818</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 is curled up in a defensive position in its chair, possibly unconscious. Dr. Valdez gently taps on the interview room's partition.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Hello. Excuse me. Are you awake?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 looks at Dr. Valdez with apparent hostility, but does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Good. I'm Dr. Luna Valdez, I'm here to do an intake interview. But first, have you been fed yet? You're supposed to be fed before we do these. It makes everything go a lot smoother.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Have you had water at least? I can't let you get dehydrated. It doesn't have to be water. I can get you juice, or even hot chocolate, or -</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(interrupting)</em> I know what you're doing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> You have your damn goons tackle me to the ground, tie me up in a sack, haul me off in the back of a van for hours, lock me up in a dark cell, and then you show up all sweet asking if I want hot chocolate? That's how you brainwash prisoners, by having one of their keepers pretend to be nice so they'll start to trust them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> They tackled you to the ground? I'm sorry they were rough with you, that was clearly unjustified in your case. I assure you the Task Force that brought you in will at the very least be reprimanded. This is not a prison, and we don't tolerate any abuse from our security staff. Everyone else will treat you the same as I do.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818's eyes begin to tear up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> How long are you going to keep me here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Well, most of our residents are here indefinitely, but it does depend on various -</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(sobs)</em> What are you going to tell my parents?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> That depends on the specifics of your circumstances, but the cover story is usually whatever will cause the least suspicion. Most likely, they'll just be led to believe you've gone missing and -</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 begins crying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Sweetie, please at least drink something. We don't want you getting sick.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 does not comply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Do you know why you're here at least?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(nods)</em> Because of my power.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> We use the term anomalies, but yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> Anomalies, plural? So, I'm not the only one then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> No. As you can probably guess by your ID number, we have thousands of them in containment, and god knows how many there are in the wild.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I thought I might be the only one. And I didn't think you guys were real.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Well that's good. It means we're doing our job. Can you tell me about your anomaly? When did it start?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I've always been able to feel the light on my skin. I didn't even know it wasn't something other people couldn't feel. One day when I was eight or nine I just started really focusing on it, trying to hold it there, and it started growing on my arm like a layer of ice. I've been practicing and experimenting since then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Can you show me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 nods. It holds out its palm, and an approximately ten centimeter tall, 400 lumen figurine of the Marvel Comics character Captain Marvel forms over several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> That's incredible.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> No, it's a sideshow act. I want to do more with it. I want to actually get good enough to use my power effectively, as an actual superhero.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> I'm not saying you can't use your anomaly, but you need to know we won't tolerate any violence. You got lucky getting assigned to Site 17. This is one of, if not the most comfortable sites for anomalous humanoids in our entire organization. If you don't behave yourself, you're going to end up somewhere a lot less comfortable. No superhero business. Is that understood?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 nods tearfully.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Good. I can see you're still distraught. I want you to eat some food, drink some fluids, and get some rest, and we'll resume our discussion tomorrow. Maybe even try to fill out some of those forms we gave you in case our background check missed something. Okay?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 nods dejectedly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Good girl. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> This interview was conducted after SCP-4818 had a panic attack during its first supervised contact with another on-site SCP.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Are you feeling better now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I guess I'm calmer, but I wouldn't say I'm better.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Good. If you're calm, then we can talk. Please, tell me what happened from your perspective.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> My perspective? From my perspective, you brought in a trolley with mutated, stillborn fetuses that started talking! Then singing! Why the fuck would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> I explained that to you. We don't want to keep you locked up in your room. That's not good for you, and it's not good for us. We want you to be able to go into the common areas and interact with the other residents, but before we can do that you have to meet them one on one so we can rule out any possible effects of exposing you to other anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> But why them? Why on earth would those freaks be the first thing you showed me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Because they're harmless. Dr. Glass did recommend I start off with <a href="/scp-527">Mr. Fish</a>, but frankly, I thought <a href="/scp-3717">3717</a> would be less intimidating since they're so small and stuck in jars.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 stares at Dr. Valdez in apparent disbelief.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> They're horrifying!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> I told you what they were before I brought them in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> You said they were cute!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> I said kind of cute.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> They're not fucking cute! They're monsters! You said there were people like me here, and that's what you meant? That's what I am to you? Something to be shelved alongside demonic fetuses and fish people?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 buries its face in its hands and begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(muffled)</em> This is just a place for freaks and monsters, isn't it? I don't want to be here. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Please, sweetie, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression with 3717 but -</p>
<p><em>SCP-4818 screams, withdraws to the corner of the interview chamber and collapses into a fetal position. It does not respond to further questioning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> I'm sorry. I'm going to make this up to you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> I take full responsibility for the disastrous first attempt to integrate SCP-4818 into Site 17's residential community. I chose SCP-3717 because they were low risk, but I neglected to consider the psychological impact they might have on a person unaccustomed to the anomalous. My description of SCP-3717 to SCP-4818 was also arguably too polite to have properly prepared her for them.</em></p>
<p><em>It seems that prior to containment, SCP-4818 heavily identified with pop cultural depictions of superheroes, and her experiences in containment thus far have been heavily detrimental to that self-image.</em></p>
<p><em>For this reason, I've chosen <a href="/scp-073">SCP-073</a> as the next Site 17 resident to meet SCP-4818. I'm confident she'll have a better opinion of him.</em></p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> This interview was conducted shortly after SCP-4818's supervised meeting with SCP-073.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Hello! You're looking better.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I'm feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Your meeting with 073 went well then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> Yeah <em>(smiles)</em>. He was awesome. He let me try to hit him. Every single blow just came right back at me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> You didn't hurt yourself, did you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> No, it's cool. And his bionic arms, he can move them just like real ones! How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> If we knew that, they wouldn't be anomalous.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> He says they don't even need upkeep. They're as invincible as the rest of him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> They'd have to be, otherwise he'd have worn them out long ago.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> You believe him then? That he's as old as he says he is, that he's lived through reality changing events with his memory intact?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> The consensus among the researchers is that he's trustworthy. But I already know all I need to know about him. Tell me, do you view yourself as more like him than the SCPs from your previous introduction?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I… I wish. I collapsed into a ball because of something that looked like a cheap Halloween decoration. Cain's fought actual demons.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Remember that 073 is indestructible. It's easy for him to be brave. You're a young woman who's been taken away from everything she's ever known, and I shoved three deformed homunculi in your face. I'm sorry I did that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> No, it's cool. They were harmless, so it was probably a better idea than putting me in the same room with an invincible, ancient cyborg.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> There's that, and the fact that his anomaly actually affects his environment. Did he mention that at all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> He did. He told me he hasn't held a plant in thousands of years without it disintegrating. I thought that was kind of sad, so I made him a flower with my light. He's a little hard to read, but I think he liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> That was very kind of you. I'm glad you got along so well.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> Yeah, I never thought I'd ever meet someone as cool as that. I'm glad that at least some of the anomalies here are more… super, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Well, if you can cooperate and get through the rest of the supervised introductions without incident, then you'll be able to go into the common areas and speak with him some more. I'm sure he has lots more stories that you'd love to hear.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(nods)</em> I'd like that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> Wonderful! You know, I've been thinking about what you said during our first interview. About wanting to make better use of your anomaly. We do have a program here that's meant to utilize anomalous humanoids like <a href="/scp-076">076</a>, er, three. Like you. I can't promise anything, but if you were interested, I could recommend you to them. They'd evaluate you, train you, and maybe even deploy you one day.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> You, you mean I could actually be a, a -</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valdez:</strong> An agent, for us. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valez:</strong> Great! We'll push through the rest of the introductions as quickly as we can, and you'll be hearing more of Cain's old yarns in no time. Just remember you have to be polite to the Fuller kids too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4818:</strong> I'll be good. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Valez:</strong> I wouldn't expect anything less from a superhero.</p>

<strong>Lead Researcher's Update:</strong> SCP-4818's enrollment in Alpha-9 has notably improved her morale and loyalty to the Foundation. Her skills with her own anomalous abilities have also been greatly enhanced by the training she's received. She can now generate filaments of photonic matter and weave them into flexible clothing, as well as extend photonic matter generated on exposed skin over clothed areas.
<p>She has successfully created statues of photonic matter nearly two meters tall and ten thousand lumens in luminosity. For combat training, she most frequently generates swords, whips, shields, and throwing stars. She aspires to create more complex constructs, and hopes to one day create photonic machines.</p>
<p>Alpha-9's commander tells me that they are also testing to see if she can learn to focus light into laser beams or re-release it at ionizing frequencies, but nothing has come of this so far.</p>
<p>Outside of her Alpha-9 activities, SCP-4818 is a model site resident. She has never used her newly developed skills to harm staff or residents, is extremely cordial and often volunteers to assist others in any way she can. Overall, her presence has greatly brightened up the site, both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p><em>~ Researcher Luna Valdez</em></p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-4818 has demonstrated the ability to produce a pair of photonic wings, which computer simulations indicate are capable of sustaining powered flight. It has requested that it be allowed to test these under safe conditions, and receive flight training should they prove effective.</p>
<p>Permission from Alpha-9 commander is pending.</p>
