            <h1>SCP-9060</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9060</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-9060-1 are to be contained in separate airtight containment cells with one-way windows should they wish to look outside. Daily checks are to be made for the structural integrity of these cells. No video monitoring of any kind is to be made inside these cells.</p>
<p>SCP-9060-1 instances may roam low-security areas of the facility and interact with others, so long as they wear a specially designed mask that cannot be removed without a key. Any SCP-9060-1 instances that attempt to remove this mask or expose their face to others are to be reprimanded and returned to their cells indefinitely.</p>
<p>Should an SCP-9060-2 instance be created, its corresponding SCP-9060-1 instance must be allowed to find it and given a path clear of civilian monitoring handled by MTF Zulu-8 ("See Something, Say Something"). SCP-9060-1 instances are not to be terminated without prior authorization.</p>
<p>Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor social media websites for images of SCP-9060-1 instances, with particular focus on their friends, relatives, and associates. Any photos, videos, or recordings of SCP-9060-1 instances are to be destroyed unless authorized by the project lead Dr. Al-Zahar.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9060 refers to a viral cognitohazardous phenomenon that causes a person (designated SCP-9060-1) to enter a violent state when their full face is viewed by another human (designated SCP-9060-2), whether directly, via video recording, photography, or on social media platforms.</p>
<p>SCP-9060-1 instances will display signs of emotional distress, including crying, screaming and incoherent speech, as they pursue SCP-9060-2. Subjects will only move in a straight line toward their target, regardless of potential for physical damage, death, or further exposure. In this state, SCP-9060-1 instances display heightened speed and strength, running up to 100 km/h and lifting up to 200 kilograms.</p>
<p>Once SCP-9060-1 makes contact with SCP-9060-2, it will attempt to kill and consume SCP-9060-2, until no trace of the victim is left behind. Once these activities are complete, SCP-9060-1 subjects return to their normal state of mind, with full awareness of their actions despite an inability to rationalize them.</p>
<p>Should an instance of SCP-9060-1 expire before it kills and consumes all instances of SCP-9060-2, all instances of SCP-9060-2 become instances of SCP-9060-1.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Al-Zahar</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-9060-1-2 (Marie Blonsky)</p>
<p><em>On 10/09/2024, a 911 call was placed by Marie Blonsky. Two officers arrived on the scene, and radioed for back-up before Mrs. Blonsky, by this point an instance of SCP-9060-1, killed and consumed them. Foundation Agents intercepted and subdued Mrs. Blonsky. She was placed in a temporary holding cell and given a ski mask to wear before her interview.</em></p>

<p><strong>&lt; Begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> And we’re recording. State your name for the record, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> Marie Blonsky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Tell me what happened that night.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> Should I have a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> You’re not in any trouble, ma’am. Just tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> We were getting ready for dinner. Tommy was up in his room, Bill was cooking. Burgers. He wanted to grill, but I didn’t like the look of the weather… sorry. I called Tommy down, but I guess he was on his computer or whatever. And then Bill just started screaming.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Did he seem strange to you at all before then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> He seemed normal. He was just looking at his mountaineering pictures all day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Okay. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> I tried to get him to talk, but I didn’t understand him. I thought he burned his hand or something. I got him an icepack from the garage. But when I came back out, he was looking at me like… like an animal. And he came at me. Put his hands around my neck. I grabbed a lamp and hit him. And I tried to barricade myself in the garage, but he tore through the door like it was paper. Lucky we kept a hunting rifle in there.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9060-1-2 pauses here, then starts to cry. She moves for her mask.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Ma’am, please keep the mask on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> I’m sorry, it’s just getting wet –</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> I know. Continue your story.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> I did what you’re supposed to do. I told Tommy to stay in his room. I called the police. I just stayed in the garage with Bill until they came to the door. When I opened it, I… oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Please describe it to me. As best you can.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> I… felt like my face was being ripped off my skull. And I tried to keep it in place. It hurt so bad, I never felt anything like it. I screamed for help, and the two officers came toward me. And I knew they were responsible. I know they weren’t. But I was so certain, and I grabbed the nearest one and just kept hitting him off the door frame until his head caved in. The other one tried to run, but Jesus Christ I was on him so fast. And they tasted awful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Al-Zahar:</strong> Would you say you lost control?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> No. I knew everything I was doing. When it was over, I knew what I’d done. I was horrified. And then I knew Tommy had looked at a picture of a family fishing trip –</p>
<p><em>SCP-9060-1-2 quiets. She removes her mask and vomits. Dr. Al-Zahar avoids seeing her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9060-1-2:</strong> I’m sorry! I –</p>
<p><em>Dr. Al-Zahar terminates the interview.</em></p>

<p>Foundation webcrawlers quickly moved to remove images of Mrs. Blonsky from the internet while MTF Zulu-8 destroyed images in the homes of friends and family. A further six people would become instances of SCP-9060-2, though Zulu-8 was able to terminate them before Mrs. Blonsky could do so.</p>
<p>In the four minutes Mr. Blonsky was an SCP-9060-1 instance, three people viewed his Facebook profile and became further SCP-9060-1 instances. These instances were contained after the deaths of fourteen individuals.</p>
<p>Foundation agents are working to contain the situation.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc1"><span><strong>Addendum: Incident 9060-1-A</strong></span></h3>
</div>
<br/>
Containment efforts failed on the evening of 20 October 2024.
<p>While SCP-9060-1-17 (formerly Mr. Kyle McLaughlin) used his showering privileges, he began screeching and wailing. Later discoveries would determine this to be the result of a cousin of SCP-9060-1-17, Lucy McLaughlin, had discovered a picture from 2017 of a family gathering that included SCP-9060-1-17 in her photos, making her an instance of SCP-9060-2.</p>
<p>On-site security attempted to contain this instance to its cell. While security was successful in preventing on-site exposure, they were unable to delay SCP-9060-1-17 from breaching the site. MTF Zulu-8 enacted emergency procedures and attempted to clear the instance's path.</p>
<p>During this time, Ms. McLaughlin shared the photo on her Instagram profile. Foundation webcrawlers were automatically alerted to the post, but because SCP-9060-1-17 was deep in the background, they were unable to detect him. It was only after Dr. Al-Zahar viewed the image that he became aware of SCP-9060-1-17's presence in the picture. In the three minutes before the photo was taken down, three people, including Dr. Al-Zahar, became instances of SCP-9060-2.</p>
<p>SCP-9060-1-17 made an unexpected deviation from its path toward a civilian highway, likely seeking closer instances of SCP-9060-2. MTF Zulu-8 quickly moved to clear traffic, but were unable to prevent SCP-9060-1-17 from being struck and killed by an unsecured civilian vehicle.</p>
<p>By this time, SCP-9060-1-31 (formerly Dr. Al-Zahar) had moved into self-quarantine. A contingent of MTF Zulu-8 was dispatched to the home of SCP-9060-1-32 (formerly Ms. McLaughlin). Two other instances of SCP-9060-1 were determined to be Ms. McLaughlin's sister, Arlene Thomson, and her husband Neil Thomson, who were at this time in Miami, Florida as VIP attendees to a concert performance by American singer-songwriter and pop star Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>According to witness testimony, Mr. and Mrs. Thomson (respectively SCP-9060-1-33 and SCP-9060-1-34) engaged in a violent altercation backstage, resulting in the death of Mrs. Thomson and the severe maiming of Mr. Thomson. Witness testimony would later indicate Ms. Swift had interacted with them just before their altercation. As such, upon their deaths, Taylor Swift would be designated SCP-9060-1-35 before walking on stage to 183,000 attendees.</p>
<p>Upon exposure, Ms. Swift covered her face and screamed for thirty-seven seconds. She then lunged into her audience, killing and consuming 107 attendees over the course of seven minutes. By this time, Swift had become engorged to the point that her stomach had burst, although she continued her pursuit of concertgoers. Local police on the scene intervened, initially attempting to detain Swift. Because of her volatility, several officers were killed before they opened fire, killing Swift and causing almost all 183,000 concert attendees to become instances of SCP-9060-1.</p>
<p>SCP-9060-1 instances turned on each other, causing the deaths of over 100,000 people before Foundation agents arrived to subdue the situation. Several instances of SCP-9060-1 escaped the stadium. Acting Project Lead Dr. Tina Zhou (Dr. Al-Zahir had shot himself in quarantine) vetoed the termination of these subjects to avoid the creation of further SCP-9060-1 instances, and instead had MTF Agents focus on clearing civilian pathways for these instances to reach their SCP-9060-2. A further 763 people were killed and consumed by these escaped SCP-9060-1 instances.</p>
<p>Because of Swift’s public status, her attack was broadcast live, creating an unknown number of SCP-9060-2 instances estimated to be in the hundreds of millions. Upon Swift’s termination, these would also become SCP-9060-1 instances, causing a massive chain reaction that led to the creation of four billion SCP-9060-1 instances and an unknown number of SCP-9060-2 instances.</p>
<p>An emergency meeting of the O5 Council was held along with Acting Project Lead Dr. Zhou, who proposed a mass amnesticization using Class-C amnestic gas. The plan was approved, and Foundation jets gassed high-population areas, with agents following to administer proper amnestics to potential SCP-9060-2 instances. This proved successful in placating SCP-9060-1 instances, keeping the death toll to roughly 1,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Following this containment breach and out of concern for public safety, the O5 Council initiated the Lifted Veil Protocol, informing the public of the phenomenon and instructing them to hide their faces. Enforcement of these protocols is ongoing.</p>

<p><em>They made the table special for it. Had to, they didn’t have anything big enough for it otherwise. Strapped it down with a dozen belts and metal clasps screwed in tight. It could have easily broken through, but it didn’t.</em></p>
<p><em>For nearly two decades, this confused Dr. Dan. Why couldn’t it remain quiet like this all the time? Or why not act now when it was clearly in danger? But none of these questions mattered. Too many sacrifices had brought him here to keep asking questions.</em></p>
<p><em>With the bag over its head, the doctor found it difficult to slip the syringe beneath its eye. He believed it would be docile while he struggled to find it. He was right. He always was. And in time, the syringe found its mark, and he pressed the plunger in. Enough to kill an elephant.</em></p>
<p><em>For fifteen agonizing minutes, he watched its chest rise and fall with no issue. He would never tell anyone, and no one would care, but for the briefest moment, he felt a pang of worry that it would know and take its revenge.</em></p>
<p><em>But the heart monitor sounded the alarm. The rise and fall of its chest slowed as its functions failed. Every two minutes, it rose and fell again. Then every five. Every ten. And after an hour, the monitor flatlined completely. The doctor breathed his own sigh of relief.</em></p>
<p><em>He waited another hour before approaching it again. He instructed everyone watching to look away. He would be the only guinea pig now. They obliged him. He pulled the bag off its head and stared into its eyes. It did not move.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096">So that’s what it looks like.</a></em></p>
