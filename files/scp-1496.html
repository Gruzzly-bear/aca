            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1496</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized (formerly Safe)</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1496 is to be kept in a small-item locker in Site-102. At this time, SCP-1496 is believed neutralized. Nonetheless, it is to remain in Safe-class containment until neutralization can be definitively confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1496 is a place setting, comprising a plate and several items of silverware. It no longer displays any ongoing anomalous properties, although records it has affected in the past remain in their affected state.</p>
<p>SCP-1496 was recovered in a raid on the offices of an urban literary collective in Quebec, Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1496</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1496 is to be kept in an unremarkable small-item locker at Site-102. As the item is so profoundly uninteresting, it is envisaged that few will ever bother to test it. However, should no drying paint be available for viewing, SCP-1496 may be placed in a humanoid containment cell along with whichever unfortunate drew the short straw as the participant. Something to put on SCP-1496-1 may be thrown in, if you must. Note that no living being is to be placed on SCP-1496-1 without Senior Researcher approval, which is the only approval SCP-1496 will ever get.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1496, which is a "place setting," is comprised of a grubby, chipped old plate (SCP-1496-1) and a couple of cheap plastic utensils of the type found in bottom-of-the-barrel fast food establishments.</p>
<p>SCP-1496 displays several pedestrian anomalous properties. Firstly, it compels anyone seated before it to construct an opinionated review of anything placed on SCP-1496-1. Inevitably, these reviews will match the participant's usual tone and voice. Participants subsequently asked about their review will not be able to remember anything about it save for having strong opinions; this is possibly a memetic effect caused by SCP-1496 being so forgettable.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make SCP-1496 interesting in any way. Also, it is impossible to make any sort of record of SCP-1496 that does not have the flavor of an opinionated review. Basic details, such as SCP-1496-1 being roughly circular, will remain unchanged; other information, such as description of the pathetic little prongs on the so-called forks, may not.</p>
<p>Reviews produced via SCP-1496 seem to exist in a state of superposition or flux. There is a probability of 0.5 that an observer will experience a review as either very enthusiastic or sarcastically dismissive. There is no record of any other sort of review being produced. It is theorized that this would require too much effort.</p>
<p>SCP-1496 was dragged out of the refuse of a raid on the office of a low-class radical "literary" collective in Quebec, Canada, after its effects became apparent in their written output.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Results of Experiment Series SCP-1496-E5:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experiment: 1496-E5q</strong><br/>
<strong>Participant:</strong> Dr. Katzen<br/>
<strong>Object used:</strong> One meatloaf sandwich from Site-102 cafeteria<br/>
<strong>Medium of response:</strong> Dictated to observing personnel<br/>
<strong>Excerpts from result:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"…But the really hard task is deciding which is more awful: the rank stench of the revolting mystery meat that was thrown together as this facsimile of food, or the sad little puddle of grease befouling what was already a sorry excuse for a bread roll…"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"…Did the Site cafeteria actually serve this? To employees? I wouldn't inflict this on a D-class. Termination would be a mercy."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment: 1496-E5a</strong><br/>
<strong>Participant:</strong> Dr. Trebuchet<br/>
<strong>Object used:</strong> Nothing (SCP-1496-1 empty)<br/>
<strong>Medium of response:</strong> Dr. Trebuchet made entries in her laboratory notebook, per her usual experimental practice.<br/>
<strong>Result (translated from French):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observed plate, per procedure. Nothing of interest. Upon closer inspection, grease stains, dirt, and damage apparent. Poor quality object. Touched dirty/chipped areas with bare skin, but no negative effects observed. Supposition: bacteria satisfied with mediocrity / too lazy to be invasive or destructive? Note: overcome by inability to care about this item. (Not anomalous effect.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 1496-E5s</strong><br/>
<strong>Participant:</strong> D-6464, who has a developmental age of circa 6yo and has expressed a mild dislike of vegetables.<br/>
<strong>Object used:</strong> Raw carrot<br/>
<strong>Medium of response:</strong> Drawing/text, using provided photocopier paper and marker pens<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong></p>
