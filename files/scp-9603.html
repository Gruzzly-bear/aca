</div>
<h4><span>1.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Initial Discovery and Progress Report</span></span></h4>
<p>Following the approval for <strong>OPERATION BLANKSHOT</strong>, <span class="style03-plaintext animation03" style='--content: "informant Executive 37Z";'>informant Executive 37Z</span> detailed the location of Substance 55.03 and Substance 51.11. Located at Site-19 of SCPF International, initial assessments have ruled out any overt military action, as the facility is heavily fortified, armed, and within reach of other similar facilities of SCPF International. Several proposals are to be considered.</p>
<h5><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal 1</span></span></h5>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Major S. Anderson<br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A general assault at 2200 and 2400 hours. Current observations reveal these hours to be the least occupied, and an assault will allow a greater degree of freedom for assaulting troops. The general mitigation of harm to unarmed employees will earn goodwill in certain factions of the GOC and provide a semi-strong diplomatic cover against NAI 02.<br/>
<strong>Outline:</strong> An initial aerial assault, comprised of fast-moving F-15s, will draw SCPF aerial assets away from Site-19. A second fleet is to approach on the opposing side and provide ground cover, forcing armed SCPF assets to engage the fleet. A ground assault concentrated on the west and south sides will storm the facility to retrieve assets. Upon capture, all ground assets are to quickly withdraw and conceal themselves within the desert. Aerial assets will return to base.<br/>
<strong>DECISION:</strong> <span style="color: rgb(148, 26, 29)">REJECTED</span><br/>
<span style="color: transparent">.</span></p>
<h5><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal 2</span></span></h5>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Lt. Colonel A. Shah<br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A simultaneous attack on multiple SCPF facilities, followed by a large-scale assault on Site-19. Due to the remote locations of some SCPF facilities, conventional military planners are to be told of a large-scale military drill. The regular army will serve as a means to distract SCPF forces while PENTAGRAM forces take Site-19.<br/>
<strong>Outline:</strong> The general assault on Site-19 will follow the start of military “drills” on other sites.<br/>
<strong>DECISION:</strong> <span style="color: rgb(148, 26, 29)">REJECTED</span> <sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-97366-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-97366-3')">3</a></sup><br/>
<span style="color: transparent">.</span></p>
<h5><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal 3</span></span></h5>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Major R. Bahri &amp; <span class="style03-plaintext animation03" style='--content: "informant Executive 37Z";'>informant Executive 37Z</span><br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A coordinated strike against Site-19 with NSA 11, the Chaos Insurgency, and NSA 05, the Global Occult Coalition. PENTAGRAM will provide transport and arm the Insurgents. The informant has agreed to release information about completed and developing Foundation eigenweapons, which will be brought to the next GOC Physics Briefing. While the GOC engages SCPF, Insurgents will attempt to raid the site. PENTAGRAM will covertly enter and seize the assets.<br/>
<strong>Outline:</strong> A small, rapid, heavy force is to circumvent the few remaining SCPF forces not engaged with the Insurgents or the Coalition. This force is to quickly overwhelm any remaining defenses, seize the assets, and make a hasty retreat into the desert. They will make their way to Area-52 for the eventual safekeeping of the assets.<br/>
<strong>Additional Notes:</strong> It is of utmost importance that the GOC remain unaware of PENTAGRAM’s involvement on all fronts, including the arming of designated terrorists. It is also of high concern how our informant has access to high-level information without garnering suspicion. Caution should be exercised accordingly.<br/>
<strong>DECISION:</strong> <span style="color: green">ACCEPTED</span></p>

<h2><span>EVENT NEG 55.88</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> The following meeting was between NSA 1121, "Aetheric Engineers," a leading member of the GOC's engineering division. NSA 1121 are particularly close allies of NSA 2231, "Servants of the Silicon Nornir," a group that holds significant sway in the Council of 108. There is an expectation of close rapport between the two groups.
<p><strong>Parties Present:</strong><br/>
<em>Dr. Elizabeth Malcom — PENTAGRAM Representative</em><br/>
<em>Divine-Tester Villa Berciu — Aetheric Engineers Representative</em></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br/>
<em>The event was informal, engineered to make the opposing party believe that Ms. Malcom was acting rogue and in her own interest.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> Good afternoon, Ms. Berciu.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> And bless you, Ms. Malcom. I haven't seen you in so long, my dear. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> I'm doing better, Ma'am. Took your advice. Just concluded the divorce a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> Oh, how wonderful! You deserve a good man. Don't let anyone tell you any less, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> I promise, Ma'am. May we move on to business?</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> Of course. I wasn't told much. Would you mind explaining what you require from us?</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> We received some information from an informant last week. It appears to be blueprints for—if you'll forgive me—a weapon of some kind. From what our engineers have been able to ascertain, it is a kinetic weapon, but we aren't completely sure. We were hoping you could lend a hand.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> You know we don't do weapons, my dear. Personally, I frankly don't like the idea of weaponizing information. We know our motto.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> Of course, and I wouldn't have asked unless it was dire. If we can, let's keep this off the record. I am not allowed to disclose this, but the higher-ups believe it is to be used against our citizens. I… I just can't keep a lid on it anymore. I have nieces and nephews to consider. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> I suppose a glance won't hurt. Let me have a look.</p>
<p><em>She stares at it for 4 minutes in silence. Her breathing grows more ragged, occasionally going still before resuming. At the 3-minute mark, her eyes widen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> Ma'am?</p>
<p><em>Berciu does not look up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> Ma'am? Ms. Berciu?!</p>
<p><em>Berciu shoots up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> I'm sorry, my dear. Forgive me, but are you sure these are the plans you received? Please say it isn't so.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> It is. Is everything alright? Do you want water? Let me go call a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> No, I'm alright. Would you mind if I take a copy of sorts with me? I'd like to show some of my peers.</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> Yes, of course. This one is a copy anyway. Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> May I ask why PENTAGRAM can't act on this?</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> The machinery is in Foundation custody, and if we're right, they engineered it. No one will admit it, of course—no one wants to break any good ties we have left with them—but it's become an open secret.</p>
<p><strong>Berciu:</strong> Do you have a location, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>Malcom:</strong> You didn't hear this from me, but the facility known as Site-19. I have to go.</p>

<h2><span>TRANSMISSION 9877</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following transmission was received by the GOC on 10/12/2025. Timeline has progressed accordingly.</p>
<div class="gocWarning">
<h3><span>TO PENTAGRAM WARFARE HIGH COMMAND</span></h3>

<br/>
This is a message from the <span style="color:#5C95E6"><strong>COUNCIL OF 108</strong></span> .<br/>
<span style="color: transparent">.</span><br/>
We have reliable information of a developing eigenweapon stored at SCP Foundation Facility 19. This is a violation of <span style="color:#424248"><strong>UN-GOC resolution 23-B</strong></span> . We also have reliable knowledge that PENTAGRAM has knowledge of the weapon's existence.
<p>UNGOC High Command after reviewing circumstances has decided to launch <span style="color:#275495"><strong>OPERATION TEAL SWAN</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Several STRIKE TEAMS will engage SCPF forces on 31.10.2025 to</p>
<ol>
<li>Destroy eigenweapon 11Z</li>
<li>Destroy all knowledge of eigenweapon 11Z from SCPF archives</li>
<li>Detain any individual suspected of any knowledge pertaining to the operation of eigenweapon 11Z</li>
<li>THE CAPTURE OF FACILITY DIRECTOR <span style="color:rgb(0, 100, 55);"><strong>TILDA MOOSE</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>We expect PENTAGRAM's full cooperation to evacuate all settlements nearby and to redirect the general public away from the area of operation.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Incident Afterward:</strong> PENTAGRAM has responded with confirmation. Civilians and non-veiled assets are currently being evacuated.</p>

<strong>Action Afterward:</strong> Following the discreet influx of cash flow and raw materials to the manufacturing brand Calculated Industries, a distributer supplier of school and medical supply and known Insurgency front, the following transmission suddenly appeared on Employee 33612 screen.<br/>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Document Type</strong></span>: Private Announcement</p>
<p>From oppressive breath the beast stirs. For how long can the backs of the overworked be broken before reconstruction is but a dream? The choices made are the choices best, and the ones made today are forever sealed in the minds of those above. The tyrant disguises itself as a savior. A false hope.</p>
<p>Unlike those who have pressed their boots on our necks, our word is our bond. The stronghold will fall and in its ashes the rest will tumble. Allies we are not, but friends we could be. Let the Coalition stomp their boots and play the hero. To be righteous and magnificent, but heroes do not win against overlords.</p>
<p>You have our word as you have given our support. We understand that you may not be brazen today, but perhaps tomorrow. The engineer will remember you well.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Action Afterward:</strong> How the Insurgents can manipulate electronics to this degree is unknown. Investigations are ongoing and the temporary paid leave of said employee.</div>

<p><strong>Bravo-1:</strong> Let me get a look.</p>

<p><strong>Bravo-2:</strong> Done and done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Several explosions go off in the far distance. Believed to be GOC ordinance and return fire from SCPF forces.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ten minutes pass. Several war cries can be heard in the distance during this time. Visual confirms GOC ground offensive has begun.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Insurgents open fire from their vehicles. A small team of security staff amass by the door returning fire.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Two security staff suddenly retreat to the entrance. They open fire on the rest of the staff.</em></p>

<p><strong>Bravo-1:</strong> Gear up. We move.</p>
<p><strong>Bravo-3:</strong> Four take the front. I'll take the rear. Two, you got supplies.</p>

<h4><span>REPORT:</span></h4>
<p>Bravo Team successfully lifted Substance 55.03 from Facility 19 during Coalition OPERATION TEAL SWAN. During OPERATION BLANKSHOT, there were no casualties on either side. Additionally, any trace of PENTAGRAM has been removed by the Chaos Insurgency, seemingly without any price or demand. The relationship between PENTAGRAM and the Chaos Insurgency must be reassessed. Disinformation was successful, as neither the SCP Foundation nor the Global Occult Coalition have made any public statements regarding PENTAGRAM.</p>
<p>Substance 51.11 was not recovered. Due to an intelligence oversight, proper tracking of 51.11 was never conducted under the assumption that both items were stored together. Bravo Team was forced to retreat following the entry of heavy SCPF military forces.</p>

<h2><span>POST ACTION REPORT 55.03A</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<br/>
OPERATION BLANKSHOT has yielded partial results and the seizure of what is now referred to as Item #334. While extensive research into the item is ongoing and promising, the lack of additional items prevents its full use. Currently, Substance 51.11 is considered lost, and all efforts to locate it have been halted. While it is assumed the SCP Foundation still retains Substance 51.11, after OPERATION TEAL SWAN this cannot be verified.
<p>Insurgency forces retreated in the early morning hours of November 1st and have seemingly vanished. Coalition teams followed three hours later. The Secretary-General has publicly announced the destruction of 11Z, as well as a sanction on the flow of materials into SCPF from Coalition members, barring Goldbaker Reinz. Several of the more progressive members have also cited human rights violations in SCPF’s treatment of lesser humanoid anomalies.</p>

<h3><span>EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM</span></h3>

<br/>
This is a message from the <span style="color:#5C95E6"><strong>SECRETARY-GENERAL</strong></span> .<br/>
<span style="color: transparent">.</span><br/>
On 4.11.2025, GOC High Command received its first communication from their counterparts at the SCP Foundation since <strong>OPERATION TEAL SWAN</strong>. This transmission included a number of files which PTOLOMY has now confirmed are genuine and unaltered since 3.18.2025.
<p>We now know that Eigenweapon 11Z was not developed by the Foundation but rather one that was contained by it. Captured Foundation personnel have also corroborated this story, claiming to be deconstructing the machine. These personnel have been released into Foundation custody with a formal apology.</p>
<p>Over the last four weeks, the Foundation has expelled all PSYCHE Ambassadors and Special Observers even under the threat of escalation. Recent communications with other unveiled organizations has revealed the recall of nearly all Foundation diplomats and assets and the suspension of cooperation with these organizations.</p>
<p>At this time, the Foundation has refused to hail any communications from any external party. This includes the GOC and other world bodies and governments.</p>
<p><span style="color:#275495"><strong>High Command hereby declares a THREAT LEVEL 3 EMERGENCY</strong></span></p>
<p>As first order of business, all members are to maintain a united diplomatic front and to reestablish communication with the Foundation. Any operatives are to regardless Foundation assets and personnel with extreme caution.</p>
