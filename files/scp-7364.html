<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7364-1, SCP-7364-2, and SCP-7364-3 are currently contained in Tape Vault E, shelf UT, box #10544 in the recorded media section of the Site-73 Archives. The SCP-7364 property has been placed under Foundation care with standard trespassing deterrents implemented. Due to its neutralized state, the SCP-7364 property is not currently believed to present any future risk to public safety or the Veil.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7364 is the collective designation for a small rental property in Great Falls, Montana, along with three films submitted to the Ravenbrook Film Festival in 2021, 2022, and 2023. At the time of initial containment, SCP-7364-1 was being rented out by amateur filmmaker Eduard Greyson.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7364 first came to the attention of Foundation personnel when an unmarked film, designated as SCP-7364-1, was played at the Ravenbrook Film Festival. This film portrayed the deaths of various characters recognizable to members of the local film community in such gruesome detail that multiple spectators called law enforcement to the address displayed in the film itself. Upon arrival, law enforcement found the bodies of several theatre students enrolled at Great Falls College–Montana State University mutilated and strewn about the building, with the causes of death matching what had been depicted in the film.</p>
<p>This case was initially passed to local law enforcement for investigation. However, the following year, a second film was entered into the festival. This film, designated as SCP-7364-2, depicted the deaths of the same students in different, more violent ways. In the wake of this discovery, Foundation agents were brought onsite to investigate future instances.</p>
<p>The contents of SCP-7364 and its effects are documented in the addenda below:</p>

<h3 id="toc2"><span><strong>Addendum SCP-7364-C – MTF investigation</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 10/21/2022, after being reported as a potential paranormal event centred on the house, an initial team of three agents were dispatched to check things out. Shortly after arriving at the scene, all contact with the deployed team ceased and recovery efforts of bodies and equipment have thus far been unsuccessful.</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><span><strong>Addendum SCP-7364-D – Final Film</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 10/23/2023, Foundation personnel were able to intercept another unidentified film submission to the Ravenbrook Film Festival. This film notably was twice the length of the prior instances and is the only one to include footage of persons outside the original cast.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>00:00-43:18</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SCP-7364-3 begins with the same opening shots as the two prior instances: the four teens arrive at the house together in a 2016 Toyota Camry filled with cardboard boxes and backpacks. A continuous shot moves through SCP-7364, showcasing the many rooms as they unpack and move in, establishing that they are all moving into SCP-7364 for college. In contrast to prior instances, however, each actor appears to be shaking and looking around nervously, although they do not deviate from their tasks at hand.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-7364-3 proceeds in this way for the next 40 minutes as their main character archetypes are established: Angela Dawson is presented as the “popular girl”, Theodore Butler the “jock”, Vivian Pearson the “innocent one”, and Tommy Griffith as the “nerd”. Footage appears to have been reused from SCP-7364-1 and SCP-7364-2 throughout this segment, but is interspersed with scenes of each character crying in close-ups during particularly tense moments. At roughly the 43-minute mark, there is a crashing sound heard in the basement.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>43:18-46:42</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angela Dawson:</strong> What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>Theodore Butler:</strong> I have no idea… Was there something down there last time?</p>
<p><em>All characters turn to look towards Tommy, whose eyes are transfixed on the basement door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tommy Griffith:</strong> No. There was- There isn't supposed to be anything down there…</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> So this is-</p>
<p><strong>Tommy:</strong> A deviation from the script, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Angela:</strong> So what do we do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Vivian Pearson:</strong> I guess we should go check it out? What if it's Eddy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Over the next few minutes, the group agrees to check out the basement and makes their way down the dim hallway. Upon reaching the door, the perspective switches to that of a view from the basement stairs looking up. A pair of eyes can be seen in the void space between two steps with withered hands grasping at the supports. The door slowly opens and the entity beneath the stairs fades away as light trickles in from the main floor.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The stairs creak and groan as the four slowly move downwards.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Male Voice:</strong> Who's there?!</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Eddy?</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Male Voice:</strong> Wait. You're, uhh, that one girl, right? Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Vivian.</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified Male Voice:</strong> Vivian! Yes! So that must mean the other steps are Thomas, Theodore, and Angela, right?</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> How do you-?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Lance Johnston:</strong> It's okay! We are here to help! My name is Agent Lance Johnston. I'm here on behalf of the Foundation with my colleagues to help you. Is anyone hurt yet?</p>
<p><strong>Angela:</strong> What do you mean <em>"yet"</em>?</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>46:42-51:24</strong></p>
<p><em>As the group reaches the bottom of the stairs to find the three Foundation Agents in the middle of the room on the ground, Agent Johnston explains the situation to the group.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Meanwhile, Agents Megan Gill and Hugh Barnett regain consciousness and move to stand up. In the process of standing, Agent Gill reaches up and finds a chain hanging from the ceiling and pulls, lighting a small circle in the middle of the room around the combined group.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tommy, Theodore, Vivian, and Angela:</strong> No!! <em>Never</em> turn on the lights!</p>
<p><em>As soon as the light above them flickers to life, the window in the far side of the room explodes open, sending a blast of shattered glass inwards. As everyone crouches defensively, protecting their faces and necks from the shrapnel, several large shards are shown embedding themselves down Angela's back and legs as the one closest to the window. She screams out in pain as the room darkens and the lights begin to flicker.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, the perspective begins to spin around the group frantically as several shots are interspersed of shadowy hands reaching out on the floor beneath them. In the chaotic movement of the basement lights swinging around, the hands flinch and pull back every few moments until one small, thin hand reaches the group. Suddenly, Tommy is pulled down at his ankles and begins to be dragged towards the darkness. He cries out as he thuds to the ground, flips himself onto his stomach, and attempts to grab at the smooth concrete floor for a way to stop his movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Tommy! They've got Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Megan Gill:</strong> Move!</p>
<p><em>Agent Gill grabs Vivian and with one quick, smooth movement places herself between her and Tommy as she draws her firearm from her belt and aims towards Tommy's ankle at the clasped claw and squeezes the trigger. Agent Barnett and Theodore reach out to Tommy and grab his hands, slowing his movement slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Let go you freaks!</p>
<p><em>Three bullets make contact with the area of the hand but pass right through into Tommy's ankle, sending an inordinate amount of blood and flesh into the darkness. Several more shadows reach out and grab Tommy's legs and waist to pull at him faster.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Hugh Barnett:</strong> Don't shoot at them! It's the light!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> What?!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> Use your mounted light!</p>
<p><em>Agent Gill moves to switch on her flashlight but is too late. Tens of hands shoot out from the darkness and cover Tommy's back, lifting him into the air as he reaches the edge of the light, the speed of which pulls him out of Agent Barnett and Theodore's hands. Suddenly, he is yanked backwards by his waist, folding him in half with the force of the movement until he disappears into the shadows. After a moment of quiet, a torrent of blood shoots out from the darkness towards the group, coating Agent Gill and Vivian completely in red. The room falls silent as the group wipes the blood from their eyes and find that in the moments of blindness, the room has returned to normal, apart from a pool of blood draining into the middle of the room from the direction of the dryers - reflecting brightly in the steady light of Agent Gill's aimed pistol. Additionally, Angela is nowhere to be seen.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>51:24-55:30</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Several minutes are devoted to the newly combined group moving upstairs into the living room and discussing the making of SCP-7364-1 and the events of SCP-7364-2 from both perspectives as agents Barnett and Gill are sent out to explore the house offscreen for Angela. A transcript has been prepared for further analysis, although no new pertinent information is shared. Based on the information shared in this scene, SCP-7364-1's creation appears to have been paranormally uneventful.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>55:30-57:10</strong></p>
<p><em>A scream from upstairs rings out throughout the house, causing Agent Gill and Theodore to jump to their feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> That was Angela's voice!</p>
<p><em>Agent Gill reaches over and grabs Theodore's arm as he goes to take a step towards the stairs in the direction of the scream.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Hold on! You don't actually know-</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Yes I do! That's her!</p>
<p><em>In one swift movement, Theodore pulls out of Agent Gill's grip and runs towards, and then up, the stairs in the direction of the master bedroom, leaving Agent Gill and Vivian behind in the living room.</em></p>
<p><em>Upstairs, Theodore arrives at the master bedroom and swings the door open. Inside, Agent Johnston whips his head back to lock eyes with Theodore and shouts in a hushed tone:</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Quiet! Something isn't right…</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><em>Theodore quietly moves closer to Agent Johnston.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> What do you mean <em>"something isn't right"</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> In preparation for this job, agents are required to know as much as possible about potential threats.</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Which, in this case, meant watching the films until we could almost recite it from memory.</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Yeah, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> So I have memorized every view and angle of this house, mapped it out, built models of it-</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Just fucking tell me already!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> And I know for sure that there isn't, and has never been, an en suite bathroom in this room…</p>
<p><em>As Agent Johnston finishes his sentence, he points up and the camera pans over to a slightly open door in the nearby corner of the room. From behind the door, Angela can be heard crying softly and begging for someone to help her.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>57:10-1:06:17</strong></p>
<p><em>Agent Johnston raises his finger to his mouth and looks towards Theodore, signalling him to keep quiet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Angela?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Angela is that you?</p>
<p><em>Angela continues to cry and does not acknowledge the questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Angela, it's me; Lance. I'm going to come towards you, okay? I'm here to help you.</p>
<p><em>Agent Johnston begins to move slowly towards the bathroom door and grabs the doorknob. Before beginning to pull, he turns back towards Theodore and motions for him to wait in place. Theodore crouches down and nods.</em></p>
<p><em>Slowly, Agent Johnston pulls on the doorknob. The door groans as it opens wider.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Alright, Angela, I'm here. It will all be okay. Where are you hiding?</p>
<p><em>As Agent Johnston creeps further into the bathroom, the camera angle shifts to an above view of the whole room. Agent Johnston moves throughout the room slowly but efficiently, checking the cabinets and bathroom closet as he goes. In the reflection of the mirror, Angela is observed to be seated on the floor beside the toilet - no corresponding entity is observed in that location outside of the mirror.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Johnston continues to move forward until he reaches the shower curtain and quickly draws it open. This sudden motion is reflected in the mirror and causes Angela to startle and look around. Upon noticing Agent Johnston in the mirror, she stands and runs over to the mirror and begins to hit the glass in an attempt to get his attention. Behind him, an entity apparates unstably beside the toilet where Angela's reflection originally was. Agent Johnston, complete with his search, goes to leave by turning past the toilet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Jesus fuck!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Sorry! I thought I- Never mind. Are you okay? Are you hurt?</p>
<p><em>The entity continues to cry and does not acknowledge the questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Look, we need to get back to the others. I don't know if any of this is getting through to you, but in case it is, I'm going to check your wounds and pick you up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> I thought so.</p>
<p><em>Agent Johnston leans down and assesses the entity's back and legs for injury. He runs his hands gently over her back and legs where she had previously been hit by the glass, finding ripped clothing but no open wounds. He scrunches his brow and then shakes his head before moving to lift her up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity:</strong> Agent? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> Oh! Yes, it is. I'm-</p>
<p><strong>Entity:</strong> It is you… Come to me. Save me. Isn't that why you're in this film?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> In this-? We aren't in a film. Angela, this is real life.</p>
<p><strong>Entity:</strong> Not in the film? Then I guess you have to go…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Johnston:</strong> I- What?</p>
<p><em>At that moment, Agent Johnston looks up and sees the real Angela banging on the glass from inside the mirror, open wounds on her hands spreading blood across the bathroom with each hit. Beneath him, the entity flashes rapidly and appears standing in front of him. It grabs the sides of his head as electricity shoots through his temples and into his brain, spreading Lichtenberg burns out from the sides of his head and across his face. Agent Johnston falls to his knees in pain, attempting to let out a scream but no air flows.</em></p>
<p><em>The shot changes to a close-up view of agent Johnston's face as his eyes bubble and burst before collapsing to the ground in a thud. Behind him, Angela cries out from inside the mirror in terror.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> What was that?! Agent? Angela? What's happening?!</p>
<p><em>View shifts to an over-the-shoulder shot of Theodore's perspective as he moves towards the bathroom. Slowly, he creeps forward until he is just outside the door when a pale hand shoots out of the right side abruptly, grabs Theodore's neck, and pulls him inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> Oh no you don't!</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, the bathroom door explodes inwards as Agent Barnett blasts through with a power slide. The perspective switches rapidly as Agent Barnett grips a pipe tightly and swings it toward the entity. Upon contact, the entity explodes into ash and smoke, dropping Theodore while the glass in the mirror begins to crack. In one swift movement, Agent Barnett catches Theodore midway through his fall and sprints back out of the room while Angela, unseen by Agent Barnett, stumbles backwards in fear as the cracks in the glass move towards the edges of the mirror. Suddenly, the mirror bursts, sending glass shards raining over Theodore and Agent Barnett as they run out of the bathroom, and Angela is no longer able to be seen.</em></p>
<p><em>The scene cuts to a view of the bedroom as Agent Barnett and Theodore escape the bathroom and turn towards the hallway entrance. Behind them, the bathroom door begins to shake before collapsing inwards. Shattered glass is sent flying throughout the bedroom as Agent Johnston's corpse is flung out, tumbling across the floor before crashing into the far wall and slumping over. Agent Barnett continues to run while carrying Theodore into the hallway and back down into the living room.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1:06:17-1:17:20</strong></p>
<p><em>Scene follows agent Barnett down into the living room where he sets a comatose Theodore down on the couch across from Vivian.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Okay. Hold on, everyone. Group up. We can't just keep chasing our asses here. Hugh, you're the one here with some time on Mu-13, right? So tell us what to do. How do we deal with this asshole?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> Well, the best way to exorcize a violent spirit like this is to complete their unfinished business, burn the corpse, or, well, survive beyond their activity, which-</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Which doesn't seem likely…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> Exactly. So, if it can at all be avoided, let's <em>not</em> make our top option blue balling a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Right. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> So, Vivian, what do you actually know about this Eduard fellow?</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Not much. He only really ever talked about how one day he would be this huge director and 'change the face of cinema', but…</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Well, he wasn't very good…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Yeah, that much was clear from what we saw…</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Right. He relied way too much on tropes to carry his work. Kept telling us that "tropes are tropes because they work so well" any time he was challenged.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> Yeah, well, that isn't really the kind of thing that creates hauntings, but I guess that's good to know… Might help us survive the night then if we just avoid the typical horror situations and stick to-</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Who are you calling "typical"?</p>
<p><em>In that moment, Theodore begins to rise off the couch into the air. Around them, books begin to fly off the shelves, cabinet doors swing open and slam shut, and, from the edges of the ceiling, blood begins to trickle down and drip over the furniture and pictures placed throughout the living room.</em></p>
<p><em>Agents Barnett and Gill turn quickly towards the couch where Theodore was placed and aim their sidearms at him. Several books and decorations fly out from the shelves around the room and collide with their backs and arms as they try to remain steady and focused on Theodore.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> You ruined Everything!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Eduard, I presume?</p>
<p><em>As though speaking through two mouths, Theodore and Eduard's voices overlap into one synchronized entity and he begins to shout at the group.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore/Eduard:</strong> This was my chance! I was finally able to get a convincing performance from these <em>amateurs</em> and you three have to come in and ruin it! Nobody wants a horror movie like this! You've ruined all my scares!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Scares?! These are real people! Real people that you have trapped in this schlock-</p>
<p><strong>Theodore/Eduard:</strong> No! They are not real people! They are actors! Actors who have so much to give! So much… Potential! We could have been the next big thing! Vivian, don't you see we could have been a cult classic if we just made it through those imbecile judges!</p>
<p><em>Behind Theodore, the room begins to darken and the shadowy hands start to reach out into the room. Agent Gill grabs Vivian's hand and motions her to start slowly moving backwards towards the entry between the living room and the front hallway. With Agent Gill taking a step backwards, Agent Barnett's eyes dart to look at her and they catch each others' attention. With a quick moment of recognition between them, both make a subtle nod and Agent Barnett raises three fingers against his extended firearm then lowers one, two, then three.</em></p>
<p><em>At the dropping of the final finger, Agent Gill turns to grab Vivian and yanks her towards the hallway in a full sprint.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore/Eduard:</strong> Where are you-</p>
<p><em>Still in the living room, Agent Barnett pulls out a flash grenade from inside his jacket and tosses it towards the shadowy hands. The device ignites and fills the room with a flash of blinding light, sending Theodore up into the ceiling and causing the hands to burn up into smoke. Meanwhile, Agent Barnett jumps forward and grabs Theodore, pulling him back down to the floor. He aims his pistol towards the nearby outlet, shoots, and jams his iron pipe into the sparking wiring with his right hand as he holds Theodore to the ground with his left.</em></p>
<p><em>With electricity flowing through Agent Barnett and into Theodore, an unstable apparition of Eduard begins to seize and rise out of Theodore's body with both sets of eyes erupting with light. Shots shift around the room between Theodore/Eduard crying out in pain, agent Barnett tensing with the flow of electricity, and the wall around the outlet catching on fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theodore/Eduard:</strong> You stupid grunt! This is just prolonging your inevitable fate!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Barnett:</strong> The-Then I g-guess I'll j-just have to do th-th-this again next time!</p>
<p><em>The scene cuts to a view from outside as agent Gill and Vivian burst out the front door and collapse onto the front lawn. Behind them, light flashes in the windows throughout the house as it quickly catches on fire. Windows burst outwards, flames engulf the living room and upstairs, and, from within, Eduard can be heard crying out in a whispy screech. On the lawn, Agent Gill and Vivian stand once more and run further away from the house.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1:17:20-1:21:32</strong></p>
<p><em>After a few moments of destruction, the perspective fades to what appears to be the morning as the sun rises behind the house. Agent Gill sits beside Vivian on the back of the car in the driveway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> Do you think it's really-?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Unfortunately, you never really know.</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> So what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> I guess we just wait. Wait and hope my friends back at the Foundation find some way to get us out of here…</p>
<p><strong>Vivian:</strong> And what are the chances of that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Honestly? They are pretty good at this kind of thing. If they can't do something to get this asshole the win then I'm sure they'll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> They always do.</p>
<p><em>At that moment, the sound of vehicle tires screeching and doors slamming can be heard from behind the camera as lights flash up into agent Gill and Vivian's faces. Vivian shields herself behind Agent Gill as Agent Gill covers her eyes with her hand, revealing several open wounds and embedded glass shards. She raises her hand slightly and, from beneath her arm's shadow, gives off a slight smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gill:</strong> Right on cue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>After Action Report</strong></p>
<p>Agent Megan Gill and Vivian Pearson were recovered outside SCP-7364 on 10/23/2023 at 06:43 after notice was given to Foundation personnel of a fire in the area. Bodies of Agent Lance Johnston, Tommy Griffith, and Theodore Butler were recovered within the ruins of SCP-7364. Agent Hugh Barnett was transferred to Site-10 for medical treatment after being found unconscious and covered nearly completely in electrical burns. The body of Angela Dawson was not present during initial recovery efforts.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">+++ <strong>Addendum SCP-7364-E – Containment Status Update</strong></p>
<p>A disinformation campaign was implemented throughout 2023 by embedded Foundation personnel that all deaths and rumours of police investigation were an elaborate attempt at marketing by the film's director. As a result, judges of the Ravenbrook Film Festival voted for SCP-7364-3 to win the year's best amateur picture after being impressed by the ingenuity of going through such an effort to make the film's experience "so immersive". However, due to there being no name on the submitted film and nobody claiming the award at the final ceremony, the award was given to the second-place winner. Since then, all physical evidence of SCP-7364 has become corrupted and SCP-7364 has not reappeared. It is believed that SCP-7364 is, for all intents and purposes, neutralized.</p>
<p>Full reclassification is, however, awaiting the results of tests aiming to extract Angela Dawson from a large shard of glass recovered at the scene during cleanup.</p>
