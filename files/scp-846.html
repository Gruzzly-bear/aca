<p>SCP-846 in its dormant state.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-846</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-846 is to be contained in a reinforced steel safe, located in Storage Unit █ at Site ██. SCP-846's containment area is to be guarded by three (3) security personnel at all times. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to access SCP-846 are to be taken into custody and interrogated by on-site security.</p>
<p>Activation of SCP-846 must be authorized by at least three (3) Level 4 personnel. Any testing of SCP-846 is to take place at an on-site firing range.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-846 is a plastic toy robot measuring twenty (20) centimeters in height and five (5) centimeters in width. The bottom of SCP-846's right foot bears the text 'Robo-Dude® (Now with Voice Command Action), by Dr. Wondertainment!' Signs of paint chipping and minor damage to SCP-846 indicate that it is roughly ten (10) years old, although attempts to question SCP-846 on this have been ignored. (See Interview 846-1)</p>
<p>SCP-846 is operated using a small 'controller' featuring an 'On/Off' button, a 'Speak' button and a small microphone. SCP-846 is activated using the 'On/Off' button, and verbal communication can be facilitated using the 'Speak' button. SCP-846 appears to be extremely well programmed, if not sentient, and will respond to most questions posed to it.</p>
<p>SCP-846 identifies itself as 'Robo-Dude' and claims that it possesses three hundred and fifty (350) 'Robo-Accessories'. When asked to use one of these accessories, the torso of SCP-846 slides open, revealing the desired accessory, which it then proceeds to utilize. The interior of SCP-846 appears to change completely each time it is asked to utilize an accessory. SCP-846 seems to be unable to utilize these accessories without being instructed to do so.</p>
<p>SCP-846 has claimed to possess, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 'Fire Drill'. (Tested, functioned as a flamethrower.)</li>
<li>An 'Energy Laser' (Tested, functioned as a pistol.)</li>
<li>A 'Boom Ray' (Tested, functioned as a rocket launcher.)</li>
<li>A 'Melt-o-Tron 5000' (Tested, sprayed acid at target)</li>
<li>An 'Ultra Plasma Rifle' (Tested, functioned as an assault rifle)</li>
<li>A 'Hydrogen Cannon' (Tested, functioned as a children's water gun)</li>
<li>'Bug Spray' (Tested, released unidentified organisms that consumed the wooden target.)</li>
<li>A 'Ray Gun' (Tested, released a stream of gamma radiation)</li>
<li>An 'Atomic Grenade' (Testing strictly forbidden.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-846 was brought into containment after an unknown individual delivered it in a sealed package to [REDACTED], a front company for the SCP Foundation. The label of the package simply read 'MERRY CHRISTMAS'. Agents, upon learning of SCP-846's unusual properties, informed their superiors. SCP-846 was subsequently taken into Foundation custody.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Hello, SCP-846. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DUDE IS FUNCTIONING AT FULL CAPACITY, ROBO-PAL.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> That's nice. I'd just like to ask you a few questions, SCP-846. Where were you produced?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DUDE IS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Alright. When were you made?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DUDE IS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> (Sighs) Okay, SCP-846 -</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> THIS UNIT IS DESIGNATED ROBO-DUDE. PLEASE REFER TO ROBO-DUDE AS ROBO-DUDE.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> No. Please tell me about yourself, SCP-846.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> No thank you, SCP-846, I'd like to -</p>
<p>(At this point, SCP-846 began a 'Robo-Dance', which lasted twenty-three (23) minutes. SCP-846 ignored all questions during this time period.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DANCE IS COMPLETE, ROBO-PAL.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> How do you access new weapons, SCP-846? There's no way they could all fit inside of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DUDE IS EQUIPPED WITH 'INTERIOR SHIFT', AN INNOVATIVE NEW ROBO-FEATURE FROM DR. WONDERTAINMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Interesting. How are you responding to my questions, have you been programmed to do so?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> ROBO-DUDE IS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> SCP-846, tell me why you are able to respond to questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-846:</strong> DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE.</p>
