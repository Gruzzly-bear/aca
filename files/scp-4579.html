<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4579 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17, equipped with two mirrors in highly visible areas. As SCP-4579 is not aware of its anomalous capabilities, personnel are forbidden from discussing anomalous activity in its presence.</p>
<p>Testing on SCP-4579 is open to all personnel with Level 2 or higher clearance. SCP-4579 is permitted to visit the Site-17 high-security courtyard for no more than two hours a week, provided it is escorted by at least one guard.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4579 is an entity capable of changing form based on observation method. When observed directly by any entity, SCP-4579 appears to be a Caucasian male approximately 20-25 years of age, 180 centimetres in height, and 70 kilograms in weight. Direct observation includes all forms of sensory perception, most commonly visual contact.</p>
<p>When observed indirectly through any means, SCP-4579 appears to be a plush toy resembling a stylised duckling. In this form, SCP-4579 is incapable of speech or locomotion. Tested methods include the usage of mirrors, videos, real-time renderings, and translucent materials.</p>
<p>No further forms of SCP-4579 have been reported, and all forms have remained consistent across viewings. SCP-4579's humanoid form does not possess any memories of time spent in inanimate form. It is unknown what form it assumes while unobserved. While photographs may be taken of SCP-4579, they do not constitute a form of observation.</p>
<p>Fur, skin, hair, and blood samples removed from SCP-4579 do not inherit its properties, and testing has confirmed them to be completely non-anomalous. SCP-4579 has not been able to provide any information on the origin of its anomalous capabilities.</p>
<p>SCP-4579 was initially brought to Foundation attention when UIU operatives in Cobb County, Georgia reported an increased amount of anomalous activity in the region. The activity was traced to SCP-4579, and Foundation operatives apprehended it at its residence without incident. After assessment, SCP-4579 was brought to Site-17 for research and long-term containment.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12/08/2017</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4579</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Reino Jokela</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted shortly after SCP-4579 was brought into Foundation custody.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Hello, SCP-4579. I'm going to be asking you a series of questions. Please answer them to the best of your ability.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Okay.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jokela:</strong> What's your full name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Derek. Derek Marcus Wolanski.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> What do you believe is the reason you're here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Nobody's told me anything. I dunno what I did sir, but I'm not a criminal.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jokela:</strong> Thank you. Do you have any recollections of abilities beyond what most would consider 'normal'?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I can't do anything like shoot lasers outta my armpits, if that's what you're on about.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Alright then. Do you have anything unusual of note?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Like medical stuff? I get these holes in my memory sometimes. Was gonna see a doc actually, but then you guys turned up.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> How long have you had these memory gaps?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I've had them pretty much my whole life, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Alright. When do you believe you were born?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Says January 19th, 1994 on my birth certificate.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Does this picture mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Now hold on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Look sir, I've just been yanked out of my house and plopped into this… what is this place, anyways? A prison? I want some answers, and all you're giving me is questions. I just wanna know when I can go home.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> [pause] This isn't a prison. It's a research facility. We're studying your memory problems, in order to help you. Once we're done with that, you're free to head home. Does that answer your questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> That's all I'm getting, huh? How come nobody asked me about this?</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> We did. [pause] You forgot.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Back to the question. Do you recognise anything in this picture?</p>
<p><em>Researcher Jokela produces a picture of SCP-4579's inanimate form.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Yeah, it was my favourite toy as a kid. Took it everywhere. Where'd you get the picture?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jokela:</strong> It's a memory test.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><strong>Jokela:</strong> Thank you for your cooperation. A guard will be here to escort you back to your cell shortly.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> A valid United States passport was recovered within SCP-4579's residence with matching details. Further records were also found.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 21/09/2017:</strong> On 21/09/2017, SCP-4579 attempted to breach containment while on a scheduled visit to the Site-17 courtyard. Utilising previously undocumented anomalous capabilities, SCP-4579 evaded its guards and traveled through the Euclid wing of the facility before being caught on thermal imaging cameras outside another cell. While it was quickly re-contained, SCP-4579 admitted to purposefully deceiving Foundation personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 21/09/2017</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4579</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Amara Valenta, SCP-4579 Research Head</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted immediately after the breach.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Valenta:</strong> Hello, SCP-4579.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Valenta:</strong> During your breach attempt, you demonstrated a variety of new capabilities. While we could find them out through testing, it would help us greatly if you informed us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Why would I want to <em>help</em> you contain me?</p>
<p><strong>Valenta:</strong> You're being contained regardless. This simply makes the process smoother.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> And if I don't?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Valenta:</strong> Cooperating helps both of us, SCP-4579.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Helps you a hell of a lot more than me.</p>
<p><strong>Valenta:</strong> Very well. This interview is over, we will continue when you've calmed down enough to cooperate. Consider all your privileges rescinded until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-4579's refusal to cooperate was expected. Testing was scheduled for the following week, however on 29/09/2017 SCP-4579 requested a second interview.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 29/09/2017</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4579</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Logan Kozel</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Second interview after the breach.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> [static]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> [static]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> [static] Don't touch that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Mic budget's that limited, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> Back to the topic at hand —</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 interrupts.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4579:</strong> This isn't going to work. You can't make me tell you.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> We're giving you a chance here. You can help us find out, or we can do it the hard way. I assure you, the first option is far more preferable.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4579:</strong> And what do I get?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> We're prepared to discuss certain privileges if you cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Like?</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> That can be discussed afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I have to say what?</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> You don't have to say anything, we just need to see—</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 interrupts.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I mean — never mind. Wanna see what I can do?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 disappears as a stuffed toy duck appears on the interview desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> And that's basically it. You like it? You can pet it if you want.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 reappears as the duck vanishes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Only the duck?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I've tried other inanimate stuff. Did a hairbrush once, didn't work too well. The duck's the only one that really works.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> No.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kozel:</strong> No?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> [pause] I can tell when someone's observing me, and how they're doing it. I know you've got a guy watching me through that camera right now. I know that —</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 gestures towards the one-way glass mounted on the east wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Isn't really a mirror, and you've got a bunch of other guys looking at me through it. The guy on the left isn't paying attention. Happy now?</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Thank you. A guard will be here shortly to escort you back to your cell, and we'll send someone down to discuss the status of your privileges.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-4579 was provided a selection of pre-screened reading material in exchange for future cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4579</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Logan Kozel</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted as a follow-up of the previous interview.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Back again, are we?</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> We are. First question — why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Why what?</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> The deception.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 shifts in its chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Easier to escape.</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> That's your only reason?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> It is, I swear. I didn't really expect it to work.</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Are you <em>sure</em>?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Look, before you guys locked me up here I scammed people for a living. Not a very good living, mind you. Messing with people is second nature to me. If you're looking for some deep philosophical answer, you've got the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Very well. Second question — were you given any outside help?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Alright. Finally, what were you planning to do if your escape were to be successful?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> I… do I look like I thought that far ahead? I'm a guy that lives in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Kozel:</strong> Noted. Thank you for your cooperation, a guard will —</p>
<p><em>SCP-4579 interrupts.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4579:</strong> Be here shortly to escort me back to my cell, I know.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4579 is to be kept within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. Two thermal imaging cameras are to be placed within the cell, to be activated if SCP-4579 utilises its anomalous abilities without notification. Testing on SCP-4579 requires the express permission of two Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4579 is an entity capable of projecting a three-dimensional image of a plush toy resembling a juvenile duck onto any location within its line of sight. SCP-4579 is also capable of projecting a variety of other inanimate objects, with varying fidelity corresponding with its degree of familiarity with the item. The tangibility of projected items is affected by the amount of effort SCP-4579 exerts, ranging from intangible to indistinguishable from a non-projected object.</p>
<p>While utilising this ability, SCP-4579 disappears from the visible light spectrum, but remains visible on infrared or thermal imaging. While not utilising its ability, SCP-4579 appears to be a human male between 20 and 25 years of age.</p>
<p>Additionally, SCP-4579 also possesses the secondary ability to perceive when it is being observed and the means it is being observed by. Both abilities were employed extensively during the subject's initial containment to deliberately mislead Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>While it is somewhat cooperative with Foundation personnel, SCP-4579 has a history of manipulative and deceptive behaviour. Extraneous discussion with it is heavily discouraged.</p>
