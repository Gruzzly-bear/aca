<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Potential events involving SCP-9163 are to be portrayed as hoaxes on social media. If necessary, webcrawlers may be deployed to manipulate internet traffic to minimize their spread.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9163 is the name given to a phenomenon reported on social media on the morning of 01/14/26 in [REDACTED], a town in the province of Perugia, Italy.</p>
<p>According to a viral video shot by a passerby, a man (identified as Riccardo Rossi<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and hereafter referred to as SCP-9163-1) attempted suicide by jumping from the roof of an apartment building.</p>
<p>However, once SCP-9163-1 jumped off of the roof railing, an unidentified force held him suspended in the air, arresting his fall, and forced him back onto the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9163 came to the attention of the Foundation after the aforementioned video went viral. After the authenticity of what was shown was confirmed and SCP-9163-1 was identified, Site-77 agents intervened to ascertain the nature of the event and understand SCP-9163-1's role in what occurred. Agents Pollini and Sergione were assigned to approach SCP-9163-1 at his residence undercover as law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>The agents recorded the encounter with SCP-9163-1 on 01/17/26 via hidden body cameras. The following log is a transcript<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> of the event.</p>

<p><strong>Interwieved:</strong> SCP-9163-1</p>
<p><strong>Interwiewers:</strong> Agent Pollini, Agent Sergione</p>
<p><strong>Date and time:</strong> 01/16/26 - 7:30 am</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Start Log]</strong></p>
<p><em>[The camera shot shows an old house in the countryside.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> <em>(Leaning towards the body cam)</em> Okay, we confirm that the address in the SCP-9163-1 files matches the domicile we reached. Sergione and I are operational and we are about to interact with the subject.</p>
<p><em>[The officer presses the intercom button near the entrance. A male voice is heard.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> Who is it? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> Mr. Rossi, we are the Municipal Police of [REDACTED]. Your name has been reported to us fo-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> The roof.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> Exactly. A gesture like this certainly doesn't go unnoticed, and we're worried about your health.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> If you let us in, we can discuss it together. Otherwise you know that in these cases we could be forced to proceed with involuntary hospitalization in a psychiatric ward, as required by the law.</p>
<p><em>[The rusty gate opens with a dull electric vibration.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> <em>(in a low voice)</em> Well, so far everything is going smoothly.</p>
<p><em>[The two officers cross the courtyard of the house. Old furniture is scattered across the overgrown grass. The two apple trees near the entrance to the house are nearly bare, with several rotten and dried-out apples on the ground. A broken rope hangs slowly from one of the branches.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> <em>(in a low voice)</em> Christ…</p>
<p><em>[The door to the house opens and the man identified as SCP-9163-1 appears. The old man appears gaunt, emaciated, and with several gauze bandages on his head and hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> <em>(Murmuring)</em> Come on in.</p>
<p><em>[The interior of the house appears dilapidated: the sparse furniture in the foyer and adjacent living room appears heavily damaged or completely destroyed. Numerous impact marks are visible on the walls.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 gestures for them to follow him and heads toward the living room, where only an old couch and a couple of chairs remain intact. The man sits on one of the chairs, almost slumping. The agents take their places on the couch opposite him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> <em>(Clearing his throat.)</em> Well, Mr. Rossi, if you're ready to talk, we're here to listen and help. If something's bothering you, we're in touch with the right people to—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> <em>(Whispering and shivering.)</em> Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll tell you everything. Maybe you really have the means to help me…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> Tell us everything, don't worry about anything. We're here for you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 begins breathing heavily and slowly moves his head toward the living room door. The man turns his gaze back to the agents, running his hands over his face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> I hated her, you know? I hated that bitch. Just me and her in this house, everyday just the two of us, and she was always asking, asking, asking. I'd leave at dawn to go to work at the factory, and when I came back in the evening, she'd be waiting for me to continue tormenting me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> And what did it matter to her anyway? She did nothing at home, always thinking of herself, always hungry, always asking for new things to buy, while the house remained dirty and the filthy dishes on the table attracted flies and shit.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 begins to alternate between sobbing and laughing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> But I knew how to correct her, how to make her understand her role as the woman of the house. <em>(He starts pounding his fist into the palm of his other hand.)</em> But no, that bitch was stupid and stubborn as a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> And one day, that bitch comes over and says she wants to leave, that her friends are worried about the bruises. And in that moment I felt like I was dying inside. Had she dared to talk about our business, about what's happening at our house, <em>(inhales)</em> to strangers?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 snaps his head toward the the living room doorway: his eyes appear to dilate, while his features harden into a slight grimace.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> Mr. Rossi, are you okay?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 slowly turns his face towards the agents. His expression seems almost blank.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> <em>(Muttering.)</em> I… yes… I'm fine, she was… I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> She was?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> She's dead.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> That night I locked the bedroom door while I was in the kitchen drinking. Then I heard a noise, went upstairs, and when I opened the door, I saw her. A bag in a hand, a foot on the floor and one on the window. She was about to run away. I couldn't let her do that.<br/>
<strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> But as I approached her, she lost her balance and fell. When I leaned out the window, she looked like a puppet without strings, staring at the sky.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 swallows and clears his throat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> I hid her bag and told the police and the rest of the family that she had just fallen by mistake. They didn't put handcuffs on me, and from then on I was alone in this house. Until that day. Until that day…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 falls silent and remains motionless with his head in his hands. His own hands appear to be increasingly clenched against his ears.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> Mr Ross-</p>
<p><em>[At Agent Sergione's words, SCP-9163-1 suddenly stands up, screaming, clutching at his hair. The two agents rise from the couch and step back, ready to draw their issued pistols.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> Those sons of bitches had to dig up those damn bones, had to pull them out of that damn hole and that dead bitch came back to me!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> <em>(With a firm and decisive tone.)</em> Mr. Rossi, please. Calm down and sit down again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> <em>(Screaming.)</em> That rotten corpse started following me, clinging to me every second! Her rancid breath on my face, the sound of that strangled breathing and her tears every day, every night, always clinging to me! She doesn't want to leave anymore, I can't push her away! And she stares at me, the damn thing, she stares at me with those rotten eyes and she won't stop crying!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> Please calm down, sir. There's no one here, it's just us, no one will hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> Hurt me? She won't let me! She won't let me die and escape from her! I tried so many times!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> Even that day, while I tried to jump off the tallest and closest building nearby, hoping I could do it quickly enough, she found me and stopped me again.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 lowers his hands to his chest, revealing bloody strands of hair between his fingers. The man begins to sob.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> Christ Almighty, can't you see it? It's there, it's there…</p>
<p><em>[The man points to the living room doorway. There is no one in the frame.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> <em>(In a reassuring tone.)</em> It's like my colleague says: there's no one there, Mr. Rossi. We're alone. Everything's fine. If you come with us now, we can take you somewhere where they can take care of you and treat your wounds.</p>
<p><em>[The two agents slowly approach the man.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9163-1:</strong> <em>(Murmuring.)</em> Go? Go where? She'll follow me…No, no, there's something I need to do now, once for all…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9163-1 attempts to lunge at Agent Sergione with the intent of grabbing his gun, but before the two agents can intervene, the man is thrown against the wall by an unseen force.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> Carlo, are you okay? What the fuck happened?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sergione:</strong> I'm fine, I'm fine, that old bastard caught me off guard but didn't have time to do anything. God, look.</p>
<p><em>[The agent points to the wall, where SCP-9163-1 lies unconscious. A trickle of blood is dripping from his forehead.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Pollini:</strong> Christ, I'd like to leave him there to die. Call 77 and have a medical team come immediately. It's their responsibility now.</p>
<p><strong>[End Log]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> A medical team arrived at Agent Sergione's call, providing first aid. After determining that there were no serious injuries, SCP-9163-1 was transported to Site-77.</p>
<p>Based on informations gathered during and after the interview about the entity that attacked SCP-9163-1, and which is presumably responsible for the events displayed during SCP-9163, it was deemed necessary to update the file relating to the anomaly.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The past events involving SCP-9163 are to be portrayed as hoaxes on social media. If necessary, webcrawlers may be deployed to manipulate internet traffic and minimise their spread.</p>
<p>To maintain SCP-9163-2's inactive state, SCP-9163-1 must be kept under constant monitoring in his holding cell in the Humanoid Anomaly Wing to prevent any self-harming or potentially suicidal behavior. All measures have been deemed acceptable for the survival and containment of SCP-9163-1, including but not limited to the usage of cot restraints and feeding via intravenous tubes.</p>
<p>However, to minimize the risk of altering SCP-9163-2's Infestation pattern, any psychotherapeutic or psychiatric intervention aimed at improving SCP-9163-1's mental health is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE - 01/23/26]:</strong> Humanoid Anomaly Wing staff has been granted the use of Personal Protective Equipment (noise-canceling headphones) while in SCP-9163-1 and SCP-9163-2's cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9163 is the name given to the metapsychic bond between SCP-9163-1 and SCP-9163-2, a living being (Riccardo Rossi, age 72) and a Spectral Entity (identified as Nina Rossi, deceased on 06/16/1983), respectively, which falls under the standard definition of a "Haunting of a Living Being"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SCP-9163-2 is a Class III Humanoid Apparition that possesses telekinetic abilities which are used to prevent SCP-9163-1 from committing suicide, often violently. According to SCP-9163-1's testimony, SCP-9163-2 appears by taking the form of its own corpse, however, no physical embodiments of the Spectral Entity have been reported to date. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether SCP-9163-2's abilities include manipulation of SCP-9163-1's sensory perceptions or abilities that preclude observation by anyone other than SCP-9163-1 itself.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the familial bond between the two instances (See Addendum) and SCP-9163-1's role in the traumatic death of SCP-9163-2, it was deemed impossible to take the known measures to separate the Spectral Entity from the Object of its Infestation activity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to minimize any parakinetic activity towards SCP-9163-1 and above all, the risk of the Spectral Entity's activity involving Site staff, it has been deemed acceptable by the ethics committee to keep SCP-9163-1 in a permanent state of isolation, in part due to its age and health<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Once SCP-9163-1 expires from natural causes, it is theorized that SCP-9163-2 will permanently separate itself from the physical world, at which point the anomaly should be reclassified as Neutralized. With the current treatments adopted, it has been calculated that spontaneous neutralization of the anomaly will occur no earlier than ██ years.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The discrepancy between the date of SCP-9163-2's death and the start of its Infestation activity has been studied, leading to two hypotheses:</p>
<p>1. An initial state of "Cognitive Torpor" due to the traumatic manner of death;</p>
<p>2. The Spectral Entity was too weak to pass through the metal layer of common burial systems<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Agent Pollini was dispatched on 01/19/26 to investigate the location and condition of SCP-9163-2's remains to better understand the phenomena that led to SCP-9163-2's metapsychic awakening.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the [REDACTED] Cemetery undercover as a regional official for a standard inspection, the agent was notified by municipal employees on duty that numerous graves had recently been moved to a shared ossuary due to the shortage of space in the site.</p>
<p>Among the gravestones still to be demolished, the agent was able to find the one belonging to SCP-9163-2's previous burial site.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription and translation of the gravestone:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here lies</p>
<p>Nina Rossi</p>
<p>15/7/72 - 16/6/83</p>
<p>"Taken prematurely from her beloved father Riccardo."</p>
