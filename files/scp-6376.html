<p>SCP-6376 upon discovery, 04/03/2013</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6376</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation Outpost-6376 has been constructed around SCP-6376's original location. SCP-6376 is contained in a locked garden within Outpost-6376. Approximately every 2 weeks, 10 liters of human blood is to be poured on the soil and roots surrounding SCP-6376.</p>
<p>Ritual-6376 is forbidden without express approval by the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6376 is a tree of an unknown species with bright red leaves. SCP-6376 requires regular feeding of human blood to survive but has no other environmental requirements. SCP-6376 does not lose its leaves through the changing of seasons, nor does it noticeably grow. Any individual that attempts to harm SCP-6376, through cutting it down or carving into the bark, will hear a voice warning them not to do so, and will receive a debilitating vision if they continue to pursue harming the object.</p>
<p>SCP-6376's "voice" is an auditory hallucination resembling human speech that the object produces under certain circumstances, such as Ritual-6376 or if a person attempts to damage it. This hallucination occurs for every human or animal within a 30-meter radius and is not impacted by walls. Individuals who have heard this voice have described it as a deep androgynous voice with gravitas, and an amused tone.</p>
<p>Ritual-6376 is a ritual through which SCP-6376 may be communicated with. SCP-6376 appears to be prophetic and has provided useful information to the Foundation in the past. As such, it has received the Thaumiel classification.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1: Ritual-6376</strong></p>
<p>Ritual-6376 is a method of gaining information from SCP-6376. To start, a sacrifice must be performed by the ritualist. The method of achieving this sacrifice may differ, but it should always involve the body part of a human (such as blood, bone, or hair). Depending on how valuable the sacrifice is to the ritualist, the more valuable the information one gains from SCP-6376 will be.</p>
<p>After the sacrifice is performed, it should be lain on the roots of SCP-6376. SCP-6376's roots will then move, pulling the sacrifice under itself. Once the sacrifice has been accepted, the ritualist must ask a question. If the sacrifice is deemed satisfactory in comparison to the value of the question, SCP-6376 will respond. If the sacrifice is unworthy, SCP-6376 will request more.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3: Incident-6376</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident #:</strong> 6376<br/>
<strong>Incident Date:</strong> 09/28/2013</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident Report:</strong> At 03:41, Senior Researcher Richard Holmes entered SCP-6376's garden, and barricaded himself in. He then attempted to damage SCP-6376 with an axe. The following transcript details security footage taken within SCP-6376's enclosure. Notably, since SCP-6376 communicates mentally, its side of the conversation is unknown.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes enters the garden and barricades the door.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Holmes:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes walks towards SCP-6376.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Holmes:</strong> You lied. You promised me success. You promised me happiness. Then you killed my family!</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes swings his axe at SCP-6376. He stops partway through the swing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Holmes:</strong> I know. Don't care.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes swings the axe back, and collapses screaming.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes closes his eyes and grabs the axe, swinging around blindly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes screams.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Holmes:</strong> No! No! No! No! No!</p>
<p><em>[The axe makes contact with SCP-6376, dislodging a small amount of bark. A red sap indistinguishable from blood leaks out.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes stops swinging and drops the axe.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes collapses on the roots of SCP-6376, and begins sobbing.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes shakes, then stills. He stops sobbing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Holmes:</strong> …Oh.</p>
<p><em>[The roots of SCP-6376 reach up to grab Dr. Holmes. Dr. Holmes does not fight this.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Fifteen seconds of corrupted footage.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Holmes lies limp in SCP-6376's roots. He is pulled beneath the earth.]</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Access to SCP-6376 is now forbidden to everyone without express order of the Outpost Director. Security surrounding SCP-6376's garden has been increased to prevent further break-ins.</p>
