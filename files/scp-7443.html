<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7443 material is to be kept in a standard anomalous item locker in the research wing of Site-73. Clearance above Level-3 is required to access samples of SCP-7443. Technology developed with SCP-7443, upon being approved, is to be used primarily by MTF Alpha-1, as dictated by an O5-Council vote following Incident-7443-1.</p>
<p>Public information regarding Incident-7443-1 is to be monitored by Foundation webcrawlers and agents. Deliberate information is to be spread to manufacture artificial uncertainty regarding the validity of information spread pertaining to Incident-7443-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7443 is a metallic material with an unknown atomic composition that maintains perfect energy retention, which when touching the uncovered body of a subject, will result in a drastic rise in subject's stamina, strength, endurance, resistance, intelligence, and physical healing for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p>SCP-7443 has a tensile strength of 964 MPa, with a density of 10.24 g/cm³. SCP-7443's effects amplify when a high amount of kinetic energy is rapidly applied to the material. Excess kinetic energy exerted on SCP-7443 material will be rapidly expelled in the direction in which the force was applied. Approximately 154.891 kG of SCP-7443 is currently in Foundation possession.</p>

<hr/></div>
<p>On June 14th, 1995, MTF Iota-10, "Damn Feds", intercepted reports from the Los Angeles Police Department concerning an armed assault on an S&amp;C-P<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> armored car, resulting in the expiration of one civilian and the serious injury of another.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Recovered Witness Log-7443</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<p><strong>Civilian Witness:</strong> Daniela Wreden</p>
<p><strong>Interrogator:</strong> Johnathan Joaquim</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> Clearly state what you witnessed to the recording device.</p>
<p><em>A small tap is heard as Joaquim sets the device in front of Wreden.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wreden:</strong> God, it was all so fast. I was just pulling into the gas station to fill my car, and I heard gunshots behind me.</p>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> Did you get a good glimpse of the assailants?</p>
<p><strong>Wreden:</strong> No. No, I didn't. They were wearing armor and I was trying to run into the store. They moved like a blur whenever I looked at them.</p>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> They were wearing armor and fast?</p>
<p><strong>Wreden:</strong> Yeah, while one was aiming at us and telling us to get inside the other ripping apart the truck. Then when the other started firing they pretty quickly got in.</p>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> And you can attest that the suspects in question shot both guards present?</p>
<p><strong>Wreden:</strong> Yeah. One of the guards got behind him and shot into his helmet from a few feet away. I didn't even see them turn around to shoot him by the time he was on the ground. I tried to look away but-</p>
<p><em>Silence is heard for 7 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> What about the second guard?</p>
<p><strong>Wreden:</strong> I think they fired at him after. I don't know, a cashier dragged me into the store to get away. All I remember is whatever armor they were wearing being marked "DGS".</p>
<p><strong>Joaquim:</strong> All right. Thank you for your time. Medical personnel from the Survivor Comfort Program will administer some medicine soon to help alleviate the memories of what occurred.</p>
<p><em>The device is turned off.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Seized security footage was altered to exclude potential anomalous visual information being leaked. Due to the number of civilian witnesses, a cover story was devised that the incident was a standard armed robbery.</p>
</div>
<p>Two further incidents were recorded including both PoI's involving the robbery of two separate S&amp;C-P locations within Los Angeles. Both incidents were suspected to be committed by the same individuals by the identical armor worn, and the style of a robbery conducted within the span of a few minutes. Despite initial detainment efforts, both PoI's were able to escape Foundation efforts due to the speed in which their robberies occurred. Search efforts were relaxed in November 1995, and containment teams were relocated from the area.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incident-7443-1</span></strong></span></h1>
<hr/></div>
<p>On Febuary 28th, 1996, a Foundation agent withdrawing personal finances from a S&amp;C-P location in Northern Hollywood, California, United States, witnessed both PoI's entering said S&amp;C-P location whilst wearing SCP-7443.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>The following is a transcription of a radio call sent to Area-09 by Agent Felix Kampstra.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Kampstra:</strong> Two PoI's have been spotted entering a S&amp;C-P facility at the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Archwood Street! Believed to be 7443-A and -B! They are heavily armed and gunfire has been heard from within the location. Requesting the immediate deployment of any personnel in the area to aid in the containment of both PoI's and the securing of a perimeter close to the location.</p>
<p><strong>Area-09 Command:</strong> Nearby assets have been liquidated to assist in containment. Further forces are being placed on stand-by.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The majority of S&amp;C-P employees are unaware of the existence of the Foundation and consist of civilians. As such, no armed personnel were present at the location at the time.</p>
</div>
<p>Post the conclusion of Incident-7443-1, any and all security/media footage containing the incident was seized and analyzed prior to being altered and re-released to the public.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Security Footage | 09:16 A.M. P.D.T.</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<p><em>PoI-7443-A grabs a civilian and throws them to the floor before shooting into the ceiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-A:</strong> This is a holdup! Get down!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7443-B runs to the teller door and shoots the lock off before grabbing the assistant manager, Brady Bachmann.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> Show me where the vault is!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7443-B walks towards the vault. The vault is opened and lockboxes are shown. Bachman and PoI-7443-B empty $750,000 into various bags.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> Where's the rest of the money?</p>
<p><strong>Bachmann:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> No funny shit. We know there was a shipment of money earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Bachmann:</strong> There isn't- there isn't none- I mean is no money here- here right now.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> Shut the fuck up and give me the money!</p>
<p><em>As PoI-7443-B attempts to extort further money from Bachmann, PoI-7443-A secures hostages within the lobby. PoI-7443-A approaches a security guard. PoI-7443-A places a gun on the back of the guard's head.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-A:</strong> Whenever I tell you to, you are going to lead everyone in here to the vault and stay there.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7443-B walks into the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> Shipment didn't arrive today.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-A:</strong> Try the ATM's. We just need to hurry up. Hey, you!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7443-A aims his gun at the security guard.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-A:</strong> Do what I told you.</p>
<p><em>The security guard escorts the hostages to the vault while both PoI's exit the bank.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>At 09:24, Foundation agents assumed defensive positions around the bank and prepared for an altercation with both PoI's.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>PoI-7443-B attempts to destroy ATMs located on the exterior of the bank to recover further funding. PoI-7443-A witnesses armed Foundation agents and opens fire. All agents take cover and do not expose their positions to open fire at the PoI's. Five agents and twelve civilians are struck in the initial fire by PoI-7443-A. After four minutes of continuous fire, both PoI-7443-A and PoI-7443-B begin firing at Foundation agents and proceed to the car over the next three minutes. Both PoI's take turns providing covering fire to allow the other to proceed to the parking lot. Dye packets placed within the bags detonate, covering the majority of the money in a red dye.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> God dammit!</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-A:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7443-B:</strong> The money has dye packets in them. Just went off.</p>
<p><em>Both PoI's drop the moneybags and turn around the corner to the parking lot, where coverage of the conversations and actions of both PoI's is not recorded by the bank security cameras.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Approximately 14 Foundation agents were initially dispatched in the primary detainment efforts. Due to the lack of prior awareness of the incident, and the lack of armed personnel present, agents were armed mostly with standard handguns and wearing LAPD uniforms.</p>

As more agents arrived at the scene, they were accordingly designated "TTFA-X".</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Stay down! Stay down! Shots fired!</p>
<p><em>TTFA-8 fires at PoI-7443-A. PoI-7443-B fires at the car that TTFA-8 is taking cover with.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Can't do shit to them with these.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-4:</strong> There is a gun store 'round here somewhere that we can take weapons from!</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-14:</strong> Is it worth using civie weapons?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-10:</strong> Look at what they are using. We need firepower!</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> 4, 5, get some weapons from there.</p>
<p><em>As TTFA-4 and TTFA-5 exit, the exchange of gunfire between them and the PoI's continues. Gunfire hits TTFA-9 and TTFA-6. Both enter a civilian dentist's office to receive emergency treatment.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Shit. We're losing men!</p>
<p><em>TTFA-1 reaches for his radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Area-09, agents are down! We need help! PoI's are opening heavy fire! I repeat, PoI's are opening heavy fire! Dispatch reinforcements!</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Should we switch to the shotguns?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Not worth the risk retrieving them. Difference would be minimal.</p>
<p><em>TTFA-12 is injured in the leg, and retreats to the dentist's office with TTFA-9 and TTFA-6. TTFA-1 fires a shot at PoI-7443-B, striking a direct-hit on his head. PoI-7443-B is seen clutching his head and leaning against a car, leaving bloody hand-prints against the car, confirming the direct hit on his head. PoI-7443-B ceases firing at agents and enters the car both PoI's were using. PoI-7443-A opens the car trunk and restocks his ammo, while maintaining fire at Agents.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Why isn't the car running?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-14:</strong> Engine damage?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-13:</strong> Soon as they go it's practically a free shot outa here. Sure as shit don't have enough firepower.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-4:</strong> Time to fix that.</p>
<p><em>TTFA-4 and TTFA-5 approach two clusters of Foundation agents and hand them rifles and semi-automatic weaponry.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Hand those out to as many personnel as you safely can.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7443-A reaches into the car for an unknown reason, however, upon several agents opening fire PoI-7443-A is struck in the arm, and is prevented from utilizing it to aim at TTFA agents. PoI-7443-A uses his arm for the remainder of the fight to lay the gun against and raise it.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Gunfire continued between the PoI's and agents for 20 minutes as agents continued to fire at PoI-7443-A while approximately 24 reinforcements arrived. Foundation paramedics entered the zone to provide first-aid to injured agents, despite orders to remain back due to the risk of injury from either PoI.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>TTFA-14 would enter close in proximity to PoI-7443-A and take cover behind a cement wall that separates the bank from a nearby neighborhood. PoI-7443-A began to fire rapidly at TTFA-14, securing two shots on TTFA-14's person while TTFA-14 hit PoI-7443-A's armor three times, including one shot in an unprotected gap in his armor along his waist, prior to a successful retreat. PoI-7443-A would continue to ignore the direct hits.</p>
<p>After 14 minutes, the O5-2 and O5-4 approved the temporary emergency deployment of some members of MTF-Alpha-1, "The Red Right Hand", in order to assist in the detainment/neutralization of the PoI's.</p>

<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Does anyone have a clear shot?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> I do.</p>
<p><em>After 28 seconds, TTFA-1 moves to the other side of PoI-7443-B's vehicle and hits him 3 times in the chest until PoI-7443-B returns fire. TTFA-1 takes cover under the vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> You okay 1?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Affirmative. I have a visual on hostile's legs! Maintain rapid fire!</p>
<p><em>TTFA agents maintain rapid fire on PoI-7443-B for 8 seconds until TTFA-1 begins fire at PoI-7443-B. PoI-7443-B notices and aims the gun down to return fire, striking TTFA-1 8 times. TTFA-1 makes several effective hits against PoI-7443-B's legs, until successfully striking his hand and forcing PoI-7443-B to drop the AR-15. PoI-7443-B raises his arms and goes on his knees in surrender, however, TTFA-1 maintains fire at PoI-7443-B for 14 seconds striking him 6 additional times in the buttocks and leg.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> -B has surrendered! Cease fire! Cease fire!</p>
<p><em>TTFA members close in on PoI-7443-B while paramedics and TTFA-2 approach TTFA-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> -B's detained?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Yeah. How much have you been hit?</p>
<p><em>TTFA-1 coughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Hell if I know.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Stay focused, okay? Stay awake.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-1:</strong> Few hit my chest.</p>

<hr/>
<p>After the retrieval of TTFA-1, all paramedics and non-TTFA members were isolated from the area as it was believed there may have been the risk of a third PoI. Paramedics only began to enter the scene at 10:12 A.M. P.D.T.</p>
<p>Foundation paramedics on scene were given an according designation of "PM-X".</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> Area safe yet?</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Probably not. But we need to help the injured civs!</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> And if there's still shooters present? What happens if they shoot at us?</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> There most likely aren't any.</p>
<p><em>PM-1 through PM-4 enter the area.</em></p>
<p><strong>PM-3:</strong> B even alive anymore?</p>
<p><strong>PM-2:</strong> He's just… Lying there.</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Considering how much he was shot probably not. We'll keep an eye on him, but 3, 2, go to the houses to see if any civilians need help.</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> Then you and me?</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Help anyone around here.</p>
<p><em>PM-2 and PM-4 depart to nearby houses as PM-1 and PM-4 head to assist a bleeding civilian.</em></p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> What's your name?</p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> James Koike.</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Alright James, do you have any injuries other than the cuts on your face?</p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> Nah.</p>
<p><em>Koike winces as the blood is cleaned from his face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> Hurts like a bitch though.</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> What happened?</p>
<p><em>Koike points to PoI-7443-B.</em></p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> That asshole.</p>
<p><em>Koike points to PoI-7443-B. PoI-7443-B remains still.</em></p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> Was trying to steal my car then made some glass break over my face.</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> No other injuries?</p>
<p><em>Koike shakes his head. The PM's treat Koike for his wounds over the next 254 seconds before noticing PoI-7443-B slightly moving.</em></p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> B's still alive.</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> He's moving.</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Shit! Okay. James, will you be okay?</p>
<p><strong>Koike:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Both PM's move towards PoI-7443-B. As they approach, TTFA-2 and TTFA-13 draw their guns from their holsters.</em></p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> What're you doing?</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> Moving to help B.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> It's not safe around here. There is a high likelihood of a third PoI coming back to try to free -B.</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> If we don't treat B he might expire.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> We will not risk losing manpower to save him. Especially not after they killed 1.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-13:</strong> The civilian also seems to have life-threatening injuries. You should probably focus on saving him first, even after everything you already did. That's what the "P" stands for. "Protect".</p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> And what if B bleeds out?</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> Is it worth it?</p>
<p><em>PM-1 turns to PM-4.</em></p>
<p><strong>PM-1:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> If we treat B and a third PoI comes out to attack us, not only do our own lives get risked but if they kill us we won't be able to treat any more civilians.</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-13:</strong> Look at the hostile. Do you really think you can save his life?</p>
<p><strong>PM-4:</strong> Is it worth potentially saving one life if we risk several more?</p>
<p><strong>TTFA-2:</strong> Just take the civilian and move him away from the zone.</p>
<p><em>PM-1 and PM-4 take Koike and leave the area.</em></p>

</div>
<p>PoI-7443-B expired at 10:51 P.M. P.D.T. from bloodloss sustained via gunshot wounds. Due to the perceived danger in the area at the time, and the corresponding testimony of all TTFA and PM personnel on-scene, it was deemed unavoidable to comply with procedure and prevent PoI-7443-B's expiration. TTFA-1's medical condition stabilized approximately 14 hours and 11 minutes later, at which point a process of recovery began.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>It was the only thing we could do.<br/>
We all know it turned out to be false, but the risk was why we did not intervene. It was simply too high, all for a murdering gunnut who injured 41 people, Foundation or civilian. Keep in mind that prior to this event, the two PoI's had brutally murdered a civilian all for a bit of money. The world is better off without these two threatening those whom we try our hardest to serve.</em><br/>

<p>Despite immediate search efforts conducted by Alpha-1 to find a potential third PoI, involving the commendable rapid dismantling of potential barricades established in nearby civilian homes, no third PoI was located. All properties owned by either PoI were seized and searched for SCP-7443 and possible exterior anomalous connections. Numerous illegal-weapon-manufacturing laboratories were discovered, although no anomalous material was located.</p>
<p>The following note was discovered at PoI-7443-B's personal residence.</p>

<p>In the hours prior to the seizure of further personal properties of both PoI's, civilian witnesses attested that unidentified persons were seen entering the each premises and remaining for an unspecified period of time prior to exiting while carrying cardboard boxes. Further investigation into the researchers, and the, "Do-Good Society", is ongoing.</p>

<hr/></div>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Let's keep this short. We've had quite a few meetings about what occurred in February already. Closing thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> The best way to deal with a threat is not to hold back. It is to use as much as we can to neutralize it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> Why hold back?</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Because it creates an unnecessary risk to the veil, missions, and informational retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> I call the dozens injured a larger risk.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> A risk caused by us moving experienced personnel outside of the city.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Because we have so few that well armed available!</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Enough. We are not here to debate, we are here to cast our votes.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> And ignore that they let a valuable asset bleed to death for nearly an hour?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We are not here to discuss that either, 11.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> And so I suppose that you soon shall reward the boy whom burnt down the house with enough fire to let the village alight.</p>
