            <h1>SCP-2804</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2804
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <tt>UPDATED 2021-05-05</tt></p>
<p>SCP-2804 is expected to have a profound effect on normalcy over the following 55 years; SCP-2804's containment strategy is thus oriented towards preventing the public recognition of its anomalous properties and the minimization of SCP-2804's disruptive effects. The exact containment strategy will thus vary with the frequency of affected structures and the number of potential witnesses.</p>
<p>The Foundation must coordinate with local and state governments to ensure that no buildings are constructed in SCP-2804-B's path, either by acquiring the land in question or arranging for alternative uses. In the case of pre-existing buildings, the optimal strategy will be determined by SCP-2804's containment team.</p>
<p>Buildings in SCP-2804-B's path should not be demolished sooner than necessary, and should be reconstructed or replaced after it has passed. This requirement may be waived if it would require excessive budgetary expenditures.</p>
<p>SCP-2804-A1 through -A3 are contained at their original locations and surrounded by false buildings and barbed wire fences. Access is restricted to specially authorized personnel.</p>
<p>PoI-2804-1 is under Level 2 observation at all times. It will be taken into Foundation custody for testing should it become associated with any further anomalous activity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2804 is a phenomenon in which a wooden deck will instantaneously appear attached to a building. This is preceded by the appearance of red chalk graffiti reading "Where's the deck? — Fly" on the building. Eleven hours and thirteen minutes pass between the appearance of this graffiti and the materialization of the deck. Removal of the graffiti has no effect on SCP-2804.</p>
<p>Decks created by SCP-2804 typically match modern architectural and construction sensibilities and will not cross property lines. These decks will not exhibit anomalous properties unless the property on which a building resides is too small or irregularly shaped to contain a conventional deck. Anomalous products of SCP-2804 are designated SCP-2804-A.</p>
<p>SCP-2804-B is a theoretical point that moves 3.4m per day, or 1.25km per year, with a bearing roughly 34° North of East. Any building that SCP-2804-B passes through will be affected by SCP-2804. Assuming that SCP-2804-B has maintained its current speed and heading since creation, its origin can be placed at ████ Dyson Avenue in ████████, South Carolina. ████ Dyson Avenue is the home of PoI-2804-1, Floyd "Fly" Whitacre, the owner of █████████ Construction Company.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2804-2:</strong> Catalog of SCP-2804-A.</p>
<p>Two instances of SCP-2804-A were created prior to containment. Once the requirements for their creation were understood, a third was created via experimentation. Restricting a property in the same way multiple times does not appear to create identical anomalies.</p>
<p>SCP-2804-A1 [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p>SCP-2804-A2 extends 64 meters vertically up the back of a suburban house in ████████, SC. In all respects other than its orientation, it is constructed like a conventional deck. SCP-2804-A2 is classified as "Indestructible" under standard destructibility guidelines. Any solid object that touches SCP-2804-A2 will immediately be rotated 90° with respect to the ground and then crushed against SCP-2804-A2 with a force in excess of one million Newtons. This is invariably lethal to living organisms.</p>
<p>SCP-2804-A3 is, in an inactive state, a number of wooden planks located on █████ Beach, SC. Individuals exiting the back door of an SCP-2804-affected apartment building in ████████, SC are transported to SCP-2804-A3's location. When approached by a live human, the planks of SCP-2804-A3 will float into the air and arrange themselves to form a staircase. When an individual climbs to the top stair of SCP-2804-A3, the planks forming lower stairs will exit formation to create more stairs above the subject. SCP-2804-A3 will return to its inactive state when any individual falls off of it.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2804-3:</strong> Excerpt from an interview with PoI-2804-1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> Mr. Whitacre —</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> <em>&lt;Interrupting&gt;</em> You can call me Fly if you want. Don't sweat it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> Right, then. Fly, do you remember what you were doing the evening of December 10, 2016<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Well, that was about four months ago, and I can barely remember what I had for lunch. <em>&lt;Laughs&gt;</em> Give me a refresher, will you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> That was a Saturday. The weather was… sunny. You stopped at a gas station at 3:14 and bought a few six-packs and two bags of tortilla chips.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Oh, I must have had the boys over for cards. That's been a pretty regular thing since my wife died<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>… yeah, they'd probably show up around six, we shoot the shit for a few hours, Don loses whatever he came with, and a few of us are drunk by the end of the night.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> I see. Sorry for your loss. Does anything about that night stand out to you at all?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Whitey and Clarence got into it. Clarence smacked Whitey right across the face. Damn near broke his jaw, too. Clarence isn't invited to poker night any more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> Right. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Well… hm. I think on the way home from dropping off Whitey, I passed the Wilkinson place<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and wrote something on their garage door. In chalk, you know. It'd wash away. That's about all I can think of.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> Hm. And I can see from this document here that you did some construction work for the Wilkinsons back in 2004, correct?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> <em>&lt;Nods&gt;</em> That's how I know them. That was my first project since I took over the business, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> Were you aware that they removed the deck you installed back in May?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> The Wilkinsons got rid of their deck and built a patio instead.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> I'm… not sure I understand… <em>&lt;Frowns&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> What don't you understand?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Well it's like — it's — all of those words make sense on their own, you know? Most of them, at least. But put together it's just… <em>&lt;Trails off&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> What words don't you understand?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Well, 'deck', for one. I mean, I know what it is as in decking someone <em>&lt;Mimes punching with left hand&gt;</em>, or a deck of cards, but I don't see how either of those would apply.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> You're not familiar with the concept of a deck as an outdoor platform, connected to a house, and traditionally made of wood or wood-like materials? You've overseen the construction of many decks. Is there some other word you use for them?</p>
<p><em>&lt;PoI-2804-1 looks blankly at Dr. Hamon for twenty seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> … interesting. Well, whatever you built for the Wilkinsons, they removed it. Did you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> I'm sorry, Dr. Hamon, I just can't get a grip on what you're saying. Maybe I'm having a stroke?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> You're not having a stroke, don't worry. <em>&lt;Writes on notepad for forty-five seconds.&gt;</em> Hypothetically, if someone wanted to build an addition to their house, but one of your projects was in the way, what would they have to do?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Well, that's… just… it's certainly a pickle, isn't it? <em>&lt;Laughs&gt;</em> I imagine they'd have to give up on their changes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hamon:</strong> I see… and suppose a natural disaster of some sort were to completely decimate someone's house, like absolutely obliterate it and everything in a five-mile radius. What would happen to the additions you made?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2804-1:</strong> Why would anything happen to them?</p>
