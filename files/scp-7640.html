<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7640 designates a series of windows that spontaneously materialize within the living quarters assigned to O5 Council personnel. Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 immediately undergoes a cognitohazardous effect, causing their immediate resignation. Inhabitants of the same room as SCP-7640 universally display a heightened curiosity towards it; however, it remains undetermined whether this response is anomalous. Those who peer through SCP-7640 provide disparate accounts of the visual contents on the opposing side. Presented below are selected examples of reported observations.</p>

In order to better understand SCP-7640, and the effects it has on O5 Council members, the Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews. These interviews aimed to acquire additional details about the effects of SCP-7640. The following log contains a transcription of the last interview conducted between O5-9 and Dr. Rosanne.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> O5-9</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Rosanne</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was conducted shortly after O5-9 viewed SCP-7640 and shortly before he was terminated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>O5-9 walks into the room and sits in an office chair. He appears upset.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Well, I wasn't expecting someone like you to be, uh… you know. Aren't you worried those shoes of yours will carry the stain?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean. What stain?</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Oh, you're the interviewer. Forget I said anything, classified Council business.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I'll try to ignore that. Are you O5-9?</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> I would say something along the lines of "the one and only" but I've read the file, you've read the file, so we both know I am definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Am I missing something? What did you see in 7640?</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Would it matter? Would telling you stop anything? All of this will end up in a report that will be handed to the committee, and nobody will do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Even if you don't think your statement will do anything to stop the anomaly, it's your duty to say something.</p>
<p><strong><em>O5-9 stands up and begins pacing around the room.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> "Duty" my ass. Have you noticed any connections yet? You're an interviewer, and you've talked to us all. Review your notes that you've been scratching in that little book this whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> It's not my job to make connections. I'm not a researcher, so-</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> But you care, don't you? Look at the notes, and tell me what you think.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Rosanne looks down at her notepad.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, -13 saw a therapist office, -2 saw dolphins, and -5 saw a hospital. I don't see any similarities.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Shit. Of <em>course</em> you don't, you don't know- didn't know them. -13? He had a degree in psychology. -2? Marine biology. -5? She was a nurse before coming here. You really want to know what I saw? Myself, sitting on a back porch, looking over a nicely trimmed lawn. My wife<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> beside me. Both of us were enjoying the… the crisp morning air before the kids woke up. It was exactly what I had before this place took it all away!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I- I'm so sorry about that. Um, I don't know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> There's nothing you can say. You want my opinions on 7640? It… never mind, cut it, this interview is over.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> But you can't-</p>
<p><strong><em>O5-9 storms out of the room, shortly before being terminated.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7640 currently remains uncontained. The discovery of an instance of SCP-7640 should be promptly reported to Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 "Red Right Hand." Upon confirmation of its manifestation, the impacted wall is to be expeditiously demolished and replaced.</p>
<p>O5 Council members who observe SCP-7640 are to be immediately terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7640 designates a series of windows that spontaneously materialize within the living quarters assigned to O5 Council personnel. Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 views an alternate world where an alternate version of themself performs activities that they enjoyed before becoming a member of the O5 Council. In 100% of cases where an instance of SCP-7640 is viewed, the O5 Council member attempts to resign. It is currently unknown if this is part of its anomalous effect, or a natural response to viewing such imagery.</p>
Additionally, amnestication has proven ineffective in suppressing memories of SCP-7640.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup><br/>
