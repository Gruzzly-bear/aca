<p>SCP-7769</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Existing procedures for the containment of SCP-7769 have been proven insufficient to ensure containment and resulted in predatory behaviour displayed towards Foundation personnel. As such, they have been removed until revised Containment Procedures are proposed and ratified by the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6368" target="_blank">Departed Department</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7769 is a physio-phantasmal entity, as classified by the SCP Foundation's Departed Department. The visual appearance of SCP-7769 is inconsistent but frequently described as resembling one or more adult male humans sharing the same physical space. Viewers note a difficulty in recognizing or describing consistent facial features and typically express seeing an 'overlapping' multitude of human faces when examining the entity.</p>
<p>SCP-7769 is capable of alternating between corporeal and incorporeal states, presumably at will, and is most frequently documented doing so while displaying predatory behaviour towards living humans. Prior to its containment, SCP-7769 has been repetitively documented approaching individuals in isolated places between the hours of 7:00 pm - 5:00 am (local). SCP-7769 will then subsequently attempt to embrace the individual, whereupon it will begin rapidly oscillating between corporal and incorporeal states. This effect causes an immediate violent destabilization of the target's physical form, characterized by the rapid expulsion of bodily fluids, gasses, and pulverized musculature, skin, and bone. SCP-7769's embrace results in severe exsanguination and extensive damage to the target's organs and body tissues, typically resulting in death.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> During transfer along the Atlantic City Expressway, SCP-7769 displayed the previously unseen ability to phase through inorganic matter, escaping its restraints and breaching the containment vehicle. It proceeded to rapidly and severely injure the escorting Foundation personnel and began moving towards the nearby urban center of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest#atlantic-city" target="_blank">Atlantic City (Nexus 36)</a>. As local Foundation units were deemed unfit to respond, they were not initially notified and a remote surveillance drone was dispatched to monitor SCP-7769's progress. It became evident that the entity was moving along a direct path towards <strong><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-333" target="_blank">Site-333</a></strong>. An emergency notice was subsequently forwarded to site personnel. However, due to a suspected system error, no confirmation of receipt has been received.</p>
<p>It is unclear if SCP-7769 is displaying conscious, malicious intent toward Foundation personnel, or if its current movement towards Site-333 is influenced by the Nexus's properties.<br/>

<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> So, are we supposed to just be okay with this?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I know, I hate working late.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> No, I mean the ghost-thing that's coming here to kill us.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh, right. Yeah to be honest not feeling great about it. But like, these things have to happen sometimes, right? Beside, I'm sure they're sending someone to take care of it.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> And we're just supposed to what, sit here and lock the doors until they do? Are you sure we shouldn't like, split up and go home?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Have you ever seen a horror movie?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, that's the last of the storm shutters put up.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Well that's a huge relief. I'm sure nailing 2-by-4s over the windows is going to stop a ghost that walks through walls. Or an actual storm for that matter. Shouldn't we have some sort of metal shutter system or something?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You just pointed out that it walks through walls.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, don't remind me. I meant for hurricanes though.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We were going to, but Vincent said that 'technology can fail us when we need it most and 'I don't want any of you feeling too safe, you'll get complacent,' and 'it costs <em>how</em> much? I can get a few pallets to break down for like, a buck or two.' So here we are.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Where is he anyway? I swear to god, if he left us here and took off.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh yee of little faith. I'm just driving in, had some important business to take care of. Sounds like we could be here for a while.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Running to the 7/11 during an emergency doesn't count as important business.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Look, I'm the one responsible for all of your safety in emergency situations. That's a lot of responsibility and not the sort of thing they train you for. So the last thing I need to be doing is making those on an empty stomach.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> That seems like the exact sort of thing they would train a Site Director for.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span> Besides, don't blame me for going. It's Noah's fault that he wouldn't share.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I told you, those were from my grandmother.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span> Well tell the lady to bake some more.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Why is no one else stressed about this? Vincent, are you sure you should be texting and driving?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh come on, Leonora. I'm not an idiot. I'm using speech-to-text, it's perfectly saf— agnaj;k shuoebg</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Dammit, who designed Cheetos to fit perfectly in the human windpipe.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, I rounded up whatever weapons I could find. They're in the breakroom.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> See, we're all taking this seriously, Leonora.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Why do we have a baseball bat with nails in it?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Dibs</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Dibs</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Ah, fuck. That sounds cool as hell.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We also have a stun gun? I think.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Is it working?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I don't know, do you need to charge it? I can't find a cord with prongs that fit the holes on the front.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Keep looking, let me know when you find one to try.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Vincent don't you dare, this isn't funny. The last thing we need to deal with is an unconscious Patel.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I don't know. I mean if it's going to get one of us…</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Ah, right, yeah. The ghost. I skimmed the thing they sent in the checkout line. Sounds like a nasty piece of work. Oh hang on, there's also a gun in my office. It's in the closet. The key is in the top-left desk drawer.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I'll go get it.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Top-left, Noah. TOP-LEFT. Do not look in the top-right. Seriously, Noah, I'm not joking about that.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Man, this fog really came in quick, I can't see past the hood of the car.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You sure you should be on your phone, Vincent?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We already covered this, I'm not even typing on it. Not like I could be if I wanted and juggling this slushie.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> This it?</p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Jesus Christ, Vincent. This thing is ancient! Where did you even get this?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> At an auction from some guy named Chekhov. It was pretty cheap too.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> How long have you had this in your office? <em>Why</em> have you had this in your office?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Would you accept 'in case of ghosts?' And you know what, if you don't, too bad. I don't need to explain myself to any of you.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I'm pretty sure the Foundation has rules about properly storing firearms.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, well I'm pretty sure they have rules about pets in the office, and showing up to work on time, and the need for functioning fire extinguishers, but I don't hear any of you complaining about that.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We have literally all complained about that. Can we focus on the current situation though?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Look I'm a busy guy, I only read the complaints that mention me by name.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, so just to recap: we've barricaded ourselves in here, Vincent's on his way back, we have a gun from the 40s, a taser that might not be working, and a baseball bat. And we're trying to fend off a ghost that can walk through walls and explode you. Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Noah, isn't that <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7703" target="_blank">hole in your head</a> supposed to help with ghosts and spirits and stuff? Can you tell where it is?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> No. But I really wish you guys would stop using the microwave, it makes my vision go all fuzzy.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Still, isn't this your deal, Noah? Cryptids and things that go bump in the night.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I don't know. I didn't have a chance to look at the file. But typically they're just little guys.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> What?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You know, they're just kind of creepy little things that hang out. With like, big eyes or long legs. They don't actually <em>do</em> anything.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Well this one is a bit of a human blender.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You really haven't come across anything like this?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> As in it blends human — not, anyway, never mind.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Not really. I've mostly been focused on the Jersey Devil. But there's a whole bunch of different cryptids: Mothman, for example, or Bigfoot. Oh and the Crawler's been making a lot of waves recently.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Where do you find this stuff?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh, there's a big community for it on the internet, messageboards mostly, like <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/parawatch-hub" target="_blank">Parawatch</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Isn't that a Foundation-run honeypot?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> That's a baseless conspiracy.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> So you have no experience with the sort of monster that is, by all accounts, in the process of actively hunting us down to kill us?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Honestly, no. I haven't heard anything about monsters that want to kill people. They can't be that common. It's probably just the way they're presented in the media. As I said, most of them just kind of hangout out of the frame of security cameras or beside roads at night. They're harmless!</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Noah, this is a possibly-intangible revenant that's harmed or killed several people today. This isn't a shark, there's no unfair societal bias here.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Huh, this is interesting.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> So when they sent us the 7769 file, they opened up Site-333's access to the broader scipnet. Normally they keep us out after we uploaded that virus by accident in 2013.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You're thinking of 2007. 2013 was when they told us to stop using the fax machine.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Right, anyway, maybe there's others like this? If Noah doesn't know anything we could take a look at what they have on record, see if there's anything useful.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I really doubt there will be much, as I said, these things are typically harmless.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, well we'll see. Jesus, there are several thousand files. I thought we just gave out four-digit numbers randomly.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh, my god. Where do we even start with this?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Probably best to start from the beginning, right?</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I'm trying that, but 001 doesn't seem to be loading.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Just pick one at random then.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> What are the odds that will help?</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Fucking, hell. What is this thing? Read this:</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> "<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096" target="_blank">SCP-096</a> will proceed to kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-096-1. 100% of cases have left no traces of SCP-096-1."</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> What the fuck.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I know, right? They don't even say what it does to you. But get this: "Due to the possibility of a mass chain reaction, including breach of Foundation secrecy and large civilian loss of life, retrieval of subject should be considered Alpha priority."</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, that has to be a fluke. No way are there multiple things like that running around. Try a different one.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> "Following the injection of its paralytic venom, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-631" target="_blank">SCP-631</a> will remain in this position for 2-3 minutes while the victim expires. Then, it will quickly consume the victim's internal organs, replacing them with fertilized eggs produced via its tail."</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Fuck that. Leonora, you know about animals and stuff, this ring a bell for you?</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I'm tracking abnormally social seagulls, not… whatever that is.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> No, this isn't right! Cryptids are… they're our friends! We may not understand them, but that's okay! They wouldn't want to hurt us, not like this!</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> "<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-939" target="_blank">SCP-939</a>'s primary method of luring prey is the imitation of human speech in the voices of prior victims […] SCP-939 vocalizations often imply significant distress."</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> No! They wouldn't do that!</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Look at this. These fucking things must be all around us.</p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We haven't been able to contact anyone outside the site, so not looking too good there.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I just threw up.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, I want the gun. Vincent, how do you load this thing?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Everyone calm down. Tony, stop scaring everyone. Leonora, I'll show you how it works when I get there. Noah, no one really pays attention to what you do, so I don't even get what you're so worked up about.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> So let's just chill out, people. I'm almost at the site now. Honestly, I think this whole thing is — OH OH OH FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK SHIT. Fucking-shit-fucking shit.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Jesus.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh no oh on oh no.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> I think I heard a car screeching outside. Vincent, that you?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Fuck. I think I hit something.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Fuck if I know. Dammit. I'll go and check.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Oh my god, Vincent.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Look, I know. I know, okay? Jeez, I really should have auto insurance. The front of the car is all fucked up.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> What about the person?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> We don't know it's a person! It could be uh — like a big raccoon or a seagull or something.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> You gotta go take a look.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, no shit. Aww, damn. Okay that uh — that looks like a person. They aren't moving.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Holy shit.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Okay, well. Huh.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano</strong></span><strong>:</strong> What?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Are they dead?</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Vincent, what's going on?</p>
