            <h1>SCP-8241</h1>
            <div class='image-header'><img alt="header3.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-style-resource/header3.png"/></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8241</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized (Formerly Keter)</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No active containment procedures are required at this time.</p>
<p>Given the historical and cultural significance of SCP-8241 to the US and its people, its remains have been donated to the United States Government and are currently on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Relations is to issue statements to the American press regarding SCP-8241, Incident 8241-PH, or any information pertaining to the Foundation or anomalous phenomena in general.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8241 was an amphibious reptilian megafauna measuring 49.4 meters in height when standing upright and weighing an estimated 900 metric tons. Morphologically, it resembled theropod dinosaurs, most closely a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>. It possessed a keratinized dermal armor, prominent dorsal spines, and a muscular, laterally compressed tail adapted for aquatic propulsion.</p>
<p>SCP-8241’s primary offensive capability consisted of the sustained, directed exhalation of fire, with recorded temperatures reaching up to 1,200 °C. It additionally demonstrated extreme physical strength, exceptional durability, and pronounced aggression toward man-made structures.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> The existence of SCP-8241 became apparent during its involvement in Incident 8241-PH.</p>
<p>At approximately 07:48 HST, SCP-8241 surfaced ~1.5 nautical miles south of Ford Island, coinciding with the Imperial Japanese Navy’s aerial assault on Pearl Harbor. SCP-8241 then proceeded to engage US naval assets directly, resulting in a total of 6,216 casualties. This event served as the main catalyst for the 1942 BK-Class (“Broken Masquerade”) Scenario, during which the existence of SCP-8241, along with that of multiple major players in the anomalous world, was publicly acknowledged by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Following this, SCP-8241 was intermittently sighted across the Pacific Ocean between 1946 and 1977, generally avoiding populated areas but occasionally targeting maritime infrastructure. Multiple attempts by US military forces to locate and destroy SCP-8241 during the late 1940s and 1950s failed, with the weapons of the era proving ineffective against its dermal armor.</p>
<p>On 4 October 1977, Foundation monitoring satellites detected SCP-8241 surfacing approximately 480 kilometers northeast of Wake Island. The US Department of Defense subsequently initiated Operation Nemesis, a retaliatory strike utilizing carrier-based aircraft and submarine-launched torpedoes. The attack inflicted only superficial injuries and failed to significantly impede SCP-8241's advance or harm it.</p>
<p>Fifteen days later, SCP-8241 was observed swimming erratically before beaching itself on an uninhabited atoll. Foundation teams found the entity deceased, with no external trauma sufficient to explain its death.</p>
<p>The remains of SCP-8241 were seized by Foundation assets and transported to Biological Research Area-12 for study. An autopsy determined that the cause of death was systemic organ failure consistent with senescence. Skeletal analysis suggested SCP-8241 was between 180 and 220 years old at the time of death.</p>
<p>After having been reclassified as Neutralized, the Foundation contacted the United States Government and offered to transfer ownership of SCP-8241’s corpse to it. The offer was accepted, and the remains of SCP-8241 were extracted from Area-12 and transported to Pentagram Facility Charlie-Delta, after which they were moved to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.</p>
<p>In years following Incident 8241-PH and World War 2, accounts of SCP-8241’s appearance and abilities became widely known within both anomalous and non-anomalous communities. These accounts directly inspired the 1954 Japanese kaiju film <em>Gojira</em> (released in Western countries as <em>Godzilla</em>), produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd.</p>
