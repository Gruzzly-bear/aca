<ul>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Shape</li>
<li>Texture</li>
<li>Emotion</li>
<li>Depth</li>
<li>Paint</li>

<p>Personnel are not to feed SCP-6454 if it requests food in a manner that could be considered <strong>impolite</strong>— like screaming, telekinetically yanking some poor sod's limbs off, or devouring the entire facility again.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">It can never keep us down, mind. Like a children's toy from any fast food restaurant, Site-⌘ is a choking hazard.</span> If SCP-6454 requests food <em>politely</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">As it is a painting and cannot speak, a "polite request" is composed of pleasing weather patterns and freeform jazz.</span> it is to be fed immediately.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6454 is a 1.5 meter by 1 meter canvas painting<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">See attached image to the right.</span> that was discovered on 07/28/2017 in the center of a ~59.65 km<sup>2</sup> expanse that previously held the landscape of Paris, Texas. It is not currently known how SCP-6454 was created, who/what created it, or how arrived in Paris.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Investigators claim that it's probably not important anyway and that they'd like to see <em>you</em> try, if you're so smart.</span></p>
<p>All that is currently known about this event is that when SCP-6454 ate Paris, it only left behind 9-year-old Mary Ashling's handmade lemonade stand.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">See attached image above.</span> Ashling is currently in Foundation custody, pending interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6454+1: MTF Logs</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after Paris, Texas' disappearance was made known to the Foundation, Mobile Task Force ⌘-0.25 ("Doomed Patrol") was dispatched to retrieve SCP-6454 and ascertain the whereabouts of Paris' inhabitants.</p>

<p>Greetings and saluditations, fellow reprobates!</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>I must say, I am rather disappointed with you! Here I thought this "Department of Surrealistics" shared our ideals— when it turns out you're just like the rest of those fun-hating Foundation fuddy-duddies.</p>
<p>You really ought to loosen up. Life's a party, after all, and we're all invited! Live a little! Take a risk! Steal from your workplace! Feed a city full of thinking, feeling people to a malevolent painting!</p>
<p>We were going to invite you to our semi-annual barbecue &amp; knitting tournament, you know. I had a roast pig stored in my cold oven<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">An appliance that people who are <em>wrong</em> call a "fridge."</span> just for you!<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Oh, but I do enjoy these footnotes!</span></p>
<p>There's no need to worry about hard or harmed feelings, however. We meant to send the painting to that <em>other</em> Paris, but <em>someone</em> who's about to lose their job (among many, <em>many</em> other things) got the aim wrong. If anything, <em>we</em> owe <em>you</em> for cleaning up our mistake! You can keep the painting— consider it my gift to you.</p>
