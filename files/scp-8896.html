            <h1>SCP-8896</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8896</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Location 8896 has been purchased by the Foundation and closed indefinitely. Surveillance cameras have been installed on-premises to monitor SCP-8896 activity. A safety barrier is placed at Location 8896’s entrance to dissuade public access. The store's window blinds are to be remain drawn.</p>
<p>The location’s convenience store should be operated solely by PoI-8896 during the hours of 00:00 and 05:00 local time. No other lifeforms are permitted inside during this time, as to maintain continued patronage from SCP-8896.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8896 collectively refers to the various entities regularly manifesting at Location 8896, a gas station located on the [REDACTED] freeway, outside the town of Lambar, Kansas, United States. Location 8896 is constructed on a crossroad-point in space time, granting cross-dimensional entities access to and from baseline reality.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8896 will usually vary from each other significantly in appearance and biology. All recorded instances have so-far appeared sized for traversing the gas station’s convenience store without damaging the property or its contents. Residue samples taken from instance’s manifestation points show to be extra-dimensional in nature (This residue has proven harmless, and may be cleaned up by PoI-8896). Instances react negatively to the presence of other lifeforms (Barring PoI-8896), by either exiting baseline reality or responding with hostility when threatened.</p>
<p>SCP-8896 instances manifest in-store between the hours of 00:00 and 04:30. Instances will frequent the aisles, before eventually de-manifesting through the surface which they first emerged (Floor, wall, or ceiling). Instances may purchase items in-store, taking such products with them when leaving. PoI-8896 reports that instances used to attempt purchasing items using currency made out of varying unidentified metals. Instances later switched to mundane United States currency upon her request.</p>
<p>Location 8896’s sole nightshift employee was Riley Kenton, a twenty-five year old college graduate<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> who had been employed at the gas station for four years. Ms. Kenton noted SCP-8896 instances manifesting in-store three months into her employment, however this did not concern her. Ms. Kenton remained employed at the store until its shutdown, resulting from an increase in SCP-8896 activity witnessed by locals.</p>
<p><strong>Interview Log:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> It's just hard to understand.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> What’s there to understand?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Everything to be frank.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Then enlighten me… Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Ok then. So you worked there for three months?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Every nightshift you were alone, correct?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Yeah. There was a junior who showed up for the first week before quitting though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> And you noticed nothing out of the ordinary during this time?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Outside the usual? No. All I ever did was serve the occasional drunk or chase off the 3am weirdoes that showed up in nothing but shorts and face paint.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> But then you encountered your first instance of SCP-8896, the one you referred to as…</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Mr. Skin fingers? Yeah. The guy with skin too long for his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> …And abnormally tall with no face?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Oh Yeah. Sorry. Was thinking of a different guy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> And how did they behave again?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> They stood in the corner for about an hour silently.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> And then?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Bought some chips. Then they levitated back through the ceiling. Shit was nasty to clean up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> …Do you see the issue with this situation?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> I mean… to be completely honest I thought that I was hallucinating. I was sleep deprived most of the time when I first began working at that place. Didn’t really get into the knack of things until a few weeks later when I finally landed a permanent placement there. I was just glad to ditch my other job at the factory.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Any reason you chose a nightshift role?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> College already forced me into becoming a night owl. Figured I'd take advantage of that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Hmm, true. But you didn’t report any of the other entities?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> I mean, who'd believed me, anyway? Plus, the manager was too cheap to fit the store with actual surveillance cameras. I think you guys were the first to actually do that. And leaving that ooze behind would've gotten me reprimanded. Got enough of that at my old kitchen job…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> You weren't panicked? Or even tempted to call the authorities?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> No. I just convinced myself that it was from a combination of fatigue and whatever I’d taken to get through my shift.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> So if I’m to understand, you were convinced that these entities were hallucinations brought on from sleep deprivation and narcotics?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Yeah. Well… partly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> You’re taking all of this exceptionally calmly.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> What was I supposed to even do? Eventually I accepted that they weren’t hallucinations. But by then I’d served enough of them to know that they weren’t a threat, so I stayed. My only other options were to either get put in a straightjacket or quit. Plus, they started showing up more frequently than before because, well… I think they have social anxiety, and I empathised with what, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> All those guys that come into the store aren’t human, but you know when you start to pick up on someone’s mood after spending enough time with them?</p>
<p>Like the woman with three heads and six shoulders. She seemed pretty shy every time she came in, so I made extra sure to address her politely and quietly. Then there’s the one with eyes growing out of their teeth that always gives me a big smile, so I always smile back.</p>
<p>Most of them never even purchased anything in-store for the first few months either. Always kept their distance from me. But over time they started buying stuff off the shelves. Then in a few weeks they started using the slurpy machines and taking hot food from the self-service station.</p>
<p>I think word got out of my stellar customer service and all those ghouls decided that this was a good place to frequent. I assume most stores wouldn’t welcome someone with a horse head and twelve gorilla arms spilling out off their trench coat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Have any ever attempted to communicate with you?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Can’t really tell, maybe? Most of them don’t even seem capable of talking. But their grunts and screams seem polite enough. Maybe that’s just how they say “Thank-you”. Most of my social time consists of Discord and browsing random forums…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> And you’re certain you feel safe in their presence?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> I’ve had to chase off actual cultists before. And at least these guys don’t come in to play Yu-Gi-Oh till 2:00am. None of them come in brandishing an obvious magnum in their holster, either.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> Ok then. Out of curiosity, what do your "customers" primarily purchase?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Takis.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Agnew:</strong> The humans or the anomalies?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-8896:</strong> Both.</p>
