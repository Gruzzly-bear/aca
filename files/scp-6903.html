<p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6903 is to be kept in an 8x8x5 research bay located on Site ██. Research bay door should meet a Level II hazard control rating (steel door, reinforced hinges, SCPassport keycard access with manual override). Any instances of SCP-6903-2 exiting SCP-6903 are to be contained and interrogated. SCP-6903 must be kept under constant video surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6903 is a mirror measuring 1.7 meters in height and 0.7 meters in width. SCP-6903 presents the reflections of only non-anomalous objects and entities. Otherwise non-anomalous entities that have been altered by anomalous effects are also observed to be reflected in SCP-6903. Objects or entities that seemed to have exhibited paranormal behavior but that did possess reflections in SCP-6903 have consistently been revealed to operate through natural means and according to classical physical laws of reality.</p>
<p>Entities that are not reflected in SCP-6903 are able to pass through SCP-6903 into a non-euclidean space that mirrors SCP-6903's surroundings. Objects within SCP-6903 can be retrieved, though only by entities capable of passing within the mirror's boundary. Objects retrieved, which are three dimensional reflections of objects placed in front of SCP-6903, are nearly always observed to possess anomalous qualities.</p>
<p>When an object is retrieved from SCP-6903, its counterpart outside the mirror no longer possesses a reflection in SCP-6903. Retrieved reflections of objects, or instances of SCP-6903-1, typically possess anomalous properties. A list of items retrieved from SCP-6903 is listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A knife capable of cutting through any solid object with little force.</li>
<li>A pencil that can only be used to write factually correct statements.</li>
<li>A U.S. $5 bank note that regularly produces copies of itself. (currently missing)</li>
<li>A chair that has not yet been observed to possess any anomalous properties.</li>
<li>An instant print camera that when used, prints a photo of what its user most desires in that moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflections of a sentient entities retrieved from SCP-6903 have in each recorded instance deceased immediately upon exiting SCP-6903. In some instances, entities with no external counterpart have exited SCP-6903 themselves. These entities, labeled as SCP-6903-2, possess no shared or consistent qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 1:</strong> ██/██/████ 11:03<br/>
An instance of SCP-6903-2, SCP-6903-2-A was recorded exiting SCP-6903. The entity was vaguely humanoid, and measured over 2 meters in height. Security footage depicts the entity phasing through the test chamber walls and reentering 48 minutes later. SCP-6903-2-A then reentered SCP-6903. No other information is available.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 2:</strong> ██/██/████ 21:43<br/>
3 instances of SCP-6903-2 exited SCP-6903, all human and wearing SCP Foundation Task Force uniforms. The entities looked around the test chamber for a moment appearing confused as if they had forgotten why they had entered the room. The instances of SCP-6903-2 then reentered SCP-6903.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6903 Expedition 1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Expedition Supervisor:</strong> Dr. █████<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-9405. Has been recently exposed to the anomalous effects of <a href="scp-884.html">SCP-884</a> and has lost reflection in SCP-6903.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> A camera previously affected by <a href="scp-895.html">SCP-895</a> was used to make entry into SCP-6903 possible.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Upon entering SCP-6903, D-9405 reported feeling disoriented but confirmed that the interior space mirrored the layout of Site ██. The environment appeared as a perfect yet empty reflection, devoid of personnel, activity, or sounds. At approximately 5 minutes into the exploration, D-9405 noted slight structural changes in the site's layout. The subject also noted an ambient sound that was not present outside the mirror, described as a faint "whispering" echo. At 13 minutes, the camera transmission began to distort, displaying intermittent static. Just before the signal cut out completely, the last visual captured depicted a group of humanoid figures (presumably instances of SCP-6903-2) observing D-9405 from a distance. Communication with D-9405 ceased, and attempts to re-establish contact have been unsuccessful. Recovery efforts to retrieve D-9405 are ongoing, though no further reflections or instances of D-9405 have reemerged from SCP-6903.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6903-1: Discovery and Initial Research</strong><br/>
SCP-6903 was brought to the Foundation’s attention after a peculiar incident involving a regular customer at █████ Antiques. The store owner reported that an individual, ████ ██████, noticed their reflection was missing from SCP-6903. According to the store owner, ████ had seemed oddly unsurprised by the situation. After witnessing the anomaly, the store owner contacted local authorities, suspecting that they had witnessed a vampire. Foundation personnel intercepted the report and launched an investigation.</p>
<p>Testing with D-Class personnel and select items confirmed SCP-6903’s selective reflection properties: non-anomalous objects reflected normally, while anomalous items did not. Following these findings, SCP-6903 was secured and transferred to Site ██ for further research.</p>
