<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Ongoing research is being conducted by the Department of Pharmacology in order to find a potential cure to SCP-9150. Foundation staff affected by the anomaly must undergo mandated therapy until the anomalous effect is no longer present.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Treatment-R9KL is to be synthesized and sold at Foundation-owned pharmacies under the common name of ██████ ████.</span></p>
<p>SCP-9150 is to be left uncontained. Treatment-R9KL is available for all Foundation staff on request. (See Addendum 9150.1)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9150 refers to an anomaly that is present in the mind of every living <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>The anomalous effects of SCP-9150 are triggered when a person experiences a high concentration of negative emotions, and the anomaly will last until the individual has fully recovered from the trigger event. During SCP-9150, the individual will progressively lose a specific memory or concept, with the effect intensifying when the individual speak, thinks, or otherwise directly acknowledge the concept. The effects of SCP-9150 can be categorized into <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">4</span> 5 distinct stages, and a single affected individual can inhabit multiple stages of SCP-9150 for different memories. An advancement of the anomaly will also be accompanied by a specific activation event.</p>

<p>From various Foundation records, there exists numerous evidence to SCP-9150 having been present in the human history for an indeterminate amount of time, presumably since the first emergence of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. The fact that the anomaly was only recently classified as SCP-9150 by the Foundation suggests that the anomaly was retroactively introduced into the collective noosphere.</p>
<p>To date, there has been a total of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">4</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">12</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">63</span> 221 recorded instances of individuals progressing to Stage 5 of the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Foundation became aware of SCP-9150 on 5/7/2020 when Junior Researcher Sasha F. Hiller reported having problems with remembering specific details about their assigned research. Hiller was initially prescribed countertop medications, which were ineffective. After reports of similar symptoms in Foundation personnel, and reports from various Foundation-owned public hospitals of the same illness being present in the general populace, the anomaly was designated as SCP-9150, and the Paramedical Department was assigned for further research on the anomaly and its effects.</p>

<p>During experimentation, various Foundation employees that have reported symptoms attributed to SCP-9150 were interviewed in order to learn more about its effects.

PoI-9150-1 was the first civilian to be interviewed by the Paramedical Department as part of Experiment-9150.A, under the guise of a therapy session. PoI-9150-1 was a witness in Incident-8232-Alpha, the containment breach of an anomaly that lead to approximately 253 civilian casualties during the time period between 3/9/1988 to 11/3/2011 before the anomaly was eventually contained by the Foundation on 12/3/2011.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> PoI-9150-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Field Agent Sophie S. Smitten</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The interview was conducted in ███████ Clinic, Surrey, England. Field Agent Smitten was substituted in place of PoI-9150-1's assigned therapist.</p>

<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> <em>Ahem.</em> Good afternoon, Mr. Pedro Ivor.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh um, hi!</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Uh, sorry. I just thought I would be meeting my usual today. You know, Miss Guinness? Did something ha-</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Oh right. Apologies for the sudden change. She couldn't come to work today for personal reasons. At least that's what she told me.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh… that's a bummer.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> But don't worry! She already gave me all the relevant information I need for this session, and she said she'll be able to return next session. And we can end it early or find a different substitute if you don't feel comfortable talkin-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> No no no it's fine! I just…</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> …Never mind. Anyway, um, you can start…?</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Of course, let's go over some basic things first. How have your daily life been, lately?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> It's actually quite great lately! I just got a new job at the local Mcdonalds and my first shift will start around next Monday. And I think that-</p>

</div>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> -well, I mean… <em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> I still think about it from time to time…</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Hm? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh, you know… that day…</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> It's just, something is missing from my head! I know something happened on that day, but I just… I just can't remember it! Why can't I remember it? Why can't I remember… him?</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> "Him"? Could you perhaps elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> I… well… I. I can't. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> It's just… I think I used to know him. But… it's all gone now.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> I see… It seems whatever happened then, it was traumatic enough to have affected your long-term memory.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Actually, I remember now… There was another person there. A friend of mine?</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Wyman. Wyman Slate. They were also there. We used to be close friends along with… uhm…</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Interesting. Do you still remain in contact with this individ- sorry, friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> No… after that day, we just… drifted apart, I guess. I think they might have took it worse than I did.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> The last thing I remember… was them talking about trying to "solve the mystery," or something like that. <em>Sigh.</em> I just really hope that, no matter where they are, they're doing alright.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> I'm sorry for that.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh, it's fine. It's just been quite a long time by now. As they say, no need to linger on the past!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Alright, I think that will be all for today. I hope that this was an enjoyable session for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh! Since you're not coming back again, I just wanted to say… um, thank you, for being here with me. You're a very sweet person.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> It's my pleasure, Mr. Ivor. And who knows? Maybe someday we'll get to have another session together again. <em>Although hopefully it won't be a substitute like this time.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Right. Uh, then, I'll be going now. Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> To you, too.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> PoI-9150-1 mentioned another witness to Incident-8232-Alpha that was previously unaccounted for. Further investigation is needed to find and amnesticize this individual.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[18:44]</span>&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Greetings, Mr. Ivor.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Hello! It's nice to see you again since last time.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> The feeling's mutual, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> So, I assume you have heard what this interview will be about, correct?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Right. This will be about… my… amnesia? If I remember correctly?</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Correct. Using the information I have collected from our last session together, I have discussed with other medical professionals, and the conclusion is that you were experiencing a rare kind of trauma-induced amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh. Uh. Well, how does it work?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> -so, in order for us to definitively determine your current health, we'll need as much information about the source of the trauma that we can find, and we hoped that you might possess something that will be useful for further research.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> And, it's fine if you do not want to cooperate. I understand that you might not want your personal information to be seen by oth-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh, uh, I mean, I think I have something.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Well, I don't have it on me, but I know that it's in my house… somewhere… I think. Is it fine if I give it to you tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Of course. It is no hurry.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Alright…</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Thank you. Now, let's get back to our usual talk, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Right! Of course.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> -you know, like, to spite him. He totally hates cats.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> Actually, I've been wanting to ask something, if you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>Field Agent Smitten:</strong> How was your friend, Wyman Slate, like? From our sessions, it seems that you two had been close for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> Oh! Well, they're like, the nerd of the group. They've always been obsessed with studying and researching and other stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-1:</strong> But also, they're super passionate with adventuring! I remember when they brought us to stea-</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>Look who just got a brand new notebook! Like my last diary I'm just gonna write stuff whenever something interesting happens. Slate thought it was stupid how I always talk to my diaries but they just don't get the vibe honestly.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm excited to start writing more random shit tomorrow.</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>To be honest, I really can't believe it's already been a year since all three of us moved in here. I still remember as teens when we used to wander around the town doing buttfuck nothing all day, but now that we all got jobs to do, and a place to live, it just kinda feels like stuff changed, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Slate said that they're planning a special surprise for the gang. Not sure what the hell they're planning but it sounds neat, so I'm into it. And of course, Bower's also planning something. Now it just seems like I'm a bad friend for not having anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, other than that, today was a very… eventful day. I did went some parties but I didn't really get to participate much in any of them. idk maybe I'm just a bit burnt out. I just wanna stay home with the gang I guess.</p>
<p>That's basically all, I think. See yall tomorrow.</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>The news are in, apparently Slate was planning a hiking trip for the whole team (well technically they said that they needed to get whatever nerdy research stuff on the trip so it's actually "for academic purposes" but i know what they really meant) and now everybody's hyped for the climb. I don't really like spending stamina of stuff like this but the two of them are really excited and shit so I really have no choice.</p>
<p>Also Bower said they found a new gig as a bar stage performer. Honestly that sounds fuckin stupid but I'm a bit curious how his performance would look like. He said there would be one in a week so I really need to be there.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Ivor out!<br/>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>Went to the bar that Bower was performing in. Everyone was cheering him on although I don't really get the appeal. He just sits on a stool and tell puns and everyone is just laughing. idk maybe I just don't have a sense of humor or somthing.</p>
<p>That's really all that happened today. Not very interesting.</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>The date's set. Tomorrow will be the day of the hike, and we're going to ████████ █████ since apparently that's the "most awesome forest of all time," whatever the fuck that means. Bower also said that he will reveal the "big surprise" during the hike, so that's to look out for. (its probably gonna be some stupid punny gift as per usual but i like them so its fine)</p>
<p>Today I'm gonna get a nice big rest in preparation for tomorrow. I've already packed most of my stuff so it'll just be waking and dressing myself up for the walk.</p>

<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>We've arrived at the base of the mountain. (Bower said he's gonna set up camp here first before ascending up to the summit.) Overall, the atmosphere here isn't too bad. Actually it's quite nice. I guess Slate wasn't kidding when they said the know a place.</p>
<p>Before going to bed Bower also decided to bring back the good ol tradition of spooky stories before bed. Of course it's the usual "rahh evil murder monster murders people in the woods" for the hundredth time. Honestly it's kinda silly how Slate is so serious about this topic, like he actually believes something stupid like this exists.</p>
<p>Welp, tomorrow's gonna be a long day of walking, so I'm gonna go now. Ivor out.<br/>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/4/2022</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> PoI-9150-23</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Stephanie Allen</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview was conducted at Site-95's Multipurpose Interview Chamber #23. Prior to interview, PoI-9150-23 was sedated in order to aid with capturing.</p>

<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Interview starts now. Greeti-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Wh- where am I?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> <em>Ahem.</em> Greetings Wyman Slate. You're currently under the legal custody of our Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> What do you mean "foundation"? What the hell are you all planning to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Do not be alarmed, Mx. Slate. You are safe here. We can assure it</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Well I sure as hell don't feel safe. And you didn't even answer my question! What the hell am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Let me get into the specifics. So, for the past few decades, you have been suffering from a certain illness, correct?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Oh good. This fucking shit again. I'm fine! I've always been fine! That stupid amnesia crap doesn't bother me anymore! I'm FINE.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Of course, I do not doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> But, we here at the Foundation have been assigned a job, which is to find more information about your "amnesia". And we're certain that whatever you're currently suffering from, is not normal.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Well, I DON'T want to be here. Get me out. Find some other duds to be your lab rats.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Unfortunately, you are not permitted to leave until we've gathered enough information. I'm sorry, but it's just part of the protocol.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> …Are you fucking serious?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> But I assure you, we'll do out best to make your temporary life here enjoyable. I promise it.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> …Whatever. It's not like I have any choice in the matter anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Thank you for your cooperation. After this interview, we'll escort you to your living quarters. I know you've had a rough day today, so it's best you get a nice rest.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> <em>Psh.</em></p>

<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Uh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Excuse me, is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> No! Uh. I mean.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> I'm not sure what I'm supposed to refer you as… well I guess… interviewer?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Oh! I'm so sorry. I can't believe I really forgot to introduce myself yesterday. I guess I should properly do it now.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> <em>Ahem.</em> My name is Stephanie Allen, but you can just call me Ms. Allen if you want.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> So… what are we going to be doing today?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Well… we have… two things on the schedule. I think it'll be better to do them in order.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> First. I've noticed you've become a lot more… calm, today.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Okay well last time we talked I was just kidnapped and thrown into some random ass lab building I was being very rational.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Ah. Yes. We apologize for any… bad experiences you got from that.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> But also, I'm curious about your thoughts on this facility, since you have spent a full day in here.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Hm. It's alright.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> The bedroom was nice. Better than concrete at least. Although right now I really could use some Mittens right now.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Mittens?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> My cat. Found him as a little kitten on the street one day. It's looking hideous so I just took it. Eventually- ah wait I'm rambling again. Sorry. I'll get back to the topic now.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> It's fine if you want to talk about anything? We can continue for as much time as you need.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Hm. The food was also alright. Kinda wished there were more variety in the meals, though, I can't imagin-</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>…</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> -then. Ah! I think now is the perfect time to move on to our second objective of today. I'll be asking you some questions regarding your past, if that's fine with you.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Uh… sure?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Good. Now, let's start with a simple one. Hm…</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> So, where were you born?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> I dunno. I was in an orphanage. Forgot the name exactly but it's somewhere in the south of this country. Eventually I grew up and got into school and shit. And then I got expelled because of that time I went to th<br/>
⠀<br/>
⠀<br/>
<strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Hm? Because of what?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Uh. After that I just started living in the streets. Not that I'm poor or anything I'm just conserving my funds for the futu-</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> I'm sorry, Slate. Could you please go back to the event that got you expelled?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Oh, sorry? It was when we went to the mou<br/>
⠀<br/>
⠀<br/>
<strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Um. What?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Never mind. Let's just continue to our next topic. Do you have any close friends currently?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> Hm… not really. I guess there are those lab nerds, but I haven't really talked to them much. Well actually there's als<br/>
⠀<br/>
⠀<br/>
<strong>PoI-9150-23:</strong> So, yeah, no friends right now.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Allen:</strong> Do you know of Porterson? Porterson Bower, to be clear.</p>

<p><strong>Subjects: PoI-9150-1 (Ivor), PoI-9150-23 (Slate)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Oh my god oh my god oh my god. It really is you.</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Oh! Uh, hello!</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Eyy it's been so long since we've last talked! How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Well… I got a new cat?</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> WOW I did not expect you to be a cat person. I still remember when you swore to "eliminate" all cats after that one time Bower's little kit scratched you in the face. Honestly, in hindsight it was hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> And uh, other than that… I'm not doing quite good, but thanks for asking anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Damn… well, I'm also not doing well, so we're basically the same!</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Oh uh haha! Ha.</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Yeah… we're… um…</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Hm? Is something wrong? Something on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Nono it's just.</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Just… I don't want to tell it to someone I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> …Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Wait no I didn't mea-</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> What do you mean "someone you don't know"?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Um… I mean…</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Do… do you not..?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> It's not that! It's just…</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Come one! It's me! Your best bud Ivor! Pedro Ivor!</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Iv<br/>
⠀<br/>
⠀<br/>
<strong>Slate:</strong> Huh? Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> …what? Do… do you not remember? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Sorry. My memory is… not the brightest. Can you um… remind me…</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Who are you again?</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Huh? This is a joke, right? Do you not remember me? I-I'm your friend! From since we were both dumb children! Don't you remember all the stuff we used to do together?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Uh, right! My childhood. I was with B<br/>
⠀<br/>
⠀<br/>
<strong>Slate:</strong> And um. Kinda..?</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> No. This isn't real. You're… you…</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Oh god. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Okay at this point I don't even know man a lot happened the last few da-</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Nononono this isn't you. This can't be. There's no way. There's…</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> I… I don't have anything else to say. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> Oh. Uh. I'm really sorry for… ruining this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> No it's not your fault it's just… <em>sigh.</em> I'll just… go now. I can't…</p>
<p><strong>Slate:</strong> …okay. so. goodbye, um… friend?</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Goodbye, Sla-</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Ivor:</strong> Goodbye, friend. See you later.</p>

<p>Although tempting, due to the cost and time needed to synthesize Treatment-R9KL, wide application across the whole Foundation is neither feasible with our current resources, nor worth the effort. Other methods of reducing the risk of SCP-9150 in Foundation personnel should be considered as an alternative to anomalous drugs.</p>

<p>The anomalous effects of SCP-9150 poses a sizable risk to our most important personnel, therefore, many of our important duties, which can further lead to potentially catastrophic consequences later down the line. Although tedious, this is a necessary step that we'll have to take if we want our knowledge to be secured, contained, and protected.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> As an alternative to Treatment-R9KL, more funding is to be allocated for the general well-being of Foundation personnel. Primarily focusing on the Department of Health and Security, Department of Human Resources, Department of Psychiatry, and more.</p>

<p>Look, this isn't a problem that can be solved with drugs. This anomaly, no matter how many drugs you throw at it, will not go away. We need to look further than just the surface level. Further than the symptoms. Further than the activation events. Further than the anomaly itself.</p>
<p>And then you'll see it.</p>
<p>There's no happy ending, so let's just try our best to make things better.</p>
