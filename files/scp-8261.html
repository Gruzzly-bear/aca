</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Though SCP-8261-1 cannot be contained, SCP-8261-2 instances can be. If an SCP-8261-2 instance has been recovered, it should immediately be imported to floor 33, section E of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-88" target="_blank">Site-88</a> for research purposes. When not in use for tests, contain all SCP-8261-2 instances inside the vault on the same floor. Every safe deposit box should contain 500 grams worth of SCP-8261-2 at most to prevent a repeat of Incident 8261-1 (see below). SCP-8261-3 instances should also be contained on the same floor in an adaptable confinement.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8261-1 is a near-Earth object classified as an Earth trojan, one of the only two discovered along with the non-anomalous (614689) 2020 XL<sub>5</sub>. It is made of anomalous rhodochrosite crystals that give SCP-8261 its properties. It has a mean diameter of 379 meters. To the general public, its permanent designation is 706765 and its provisional designation is 2010 TK<sub>7</sub>, so it is referred to as (706765) 2010 TK<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="Single_rhodochrosite_crystal.png" class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Single_rhodochrosite_crystal.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A non-anomalous rhodochrosite crystal with a similar appearance to an SCP-8261-2 instance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8261-2 instances are smaller, cuboid-shaped crystals that have separated from SCP-8261-1 and landed down on Earth. SCP-8261-2 instances differ in weight from 100 grams to 400 grams. A instance's power increases linearly, proportional to the instance's weight. When two instances are placed together, the powers of their anomalous properties "merge", acting as one. Because of this, storing too many instances unseparated can be very dangerous. Powdered SCP-8261-2 and SCP-8261-2 instances of under 1 milligram in weight are non-anomalous rhodochrosite and are deemed safe.</p>
<p>SCP-8261-2 instances have anomalous properties that can alter the minds of people and animals of the clade Tetrapoda. When slightly exposed, SCP-8261-2 can induce irrational behavior, especially anger, fear, or sadness. When mildly exposed, instances induce even worse behavior while also distorting the physical appearance and form of exposed creatures. When highly exposed, instances can disfigure animals into flesh monsters and increase their size. These are instances of SCP-8261-3A, hostile creatures that are not inherently anomalous. SCP-8261-3B instances, however, are stronger and larger versions of SCP-8261-3A instances that have an anomalous SCP-8261-2 instance integrated in their bodies. Together, they are collectively referred to simply as SCP-8261-3 instances.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident 8261-1:</strong> On June 11, 1981 at 11:03 AM CDT, a group of employees at Site-88 recovered 4 kilograms worth of SCP-8261-2 that had fallen across Baldwin County, Alabama. The employees stated that the lives of 11 employees had been lost in the effort, most of which to SCP-8261-3 instances. At 11:34 AM, the SCP-8261-2 instances were brought to floor 33 where they were contained. However, due to improper and improvised containment procedures, the SCP-8261-2 was still active and 23 employees at Site-88 were turned into SCP-8261-3A instances. Another 117 employees were emotionally affected by SCP-8261-2 and the chaos resulted in a mass slaughter that took the lives of 206 people, including those turned into SCP-8261-3A. 348 more were injured. Containment procedures were changed to prevent another incident like this from happening.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 8261-2:</strong> On May 30, 2000 at 2:08 PM PDT, a woman was brought into the NorthBay Medical Center in Fairville, California suffering from an unusual illness. She looked as if she was in her 80s. Her skin had melted, and bloody subcutaneous fat could be seen in some places. According to her husband, she was only 41, had rapidly aged, and was now "rotting" while she was still alive and conscious. When her husband was asked, he said it had begun shortly after they married in 1991, when the two of them were in their 30s. She had bought a cheap rhodochrosite wedding ring for herself that she wore every day for the next 9 years until the hospital visit. The rhodochrosite on the ring was an instance of SCP-8261-2 she had bought the week before the wedding. This incident had to be censored before the public learned about her death later that month. The SCP-8261-2 instance that was part of the ring is currently inside the vault on floor 33 of Site-88. The rest of the ring was given back to the woman's husband.</p>

<td>14-04-1980</td>
<td>A D-class (aged 34, male) was exposed to an SCP-8261-2 instance. Only four seconds after it was placed in the room, the D-class had begun hyperventilating. After seven seconds, he had begun to back up away from the crystal. When he was backed into a corner, he had begun expressing irrational anger. After twelve seconds, he had begun crying. The experiment was concluded after one minute of exposure. The D-class had to be put in solitary confinement for the next seven days.</td>

<td>A D-class (aged 32, female) was exposed to an SCP-8261-2 instance. After six seconds, she begun to have a mental breakdown. It got worse the longer she was exposed to it. After seventeen seconds, she begun banging on the door, trying to get out of the room. After the experiment was concluded, she had attacked multiple SCP employees. Two SCP employees had to be hospitalized and ten more got minor injuries.</td>

<td>A D-class (aged 37, male) was exposed to an SCP-8261-2 instance. After five seconds, he had become frozen in fear. After eleven seconds, he began screaming. After twelve seconds, he began spasming. The experiment was concluded early. The D-class was hospitalized and died after three weeks. Experimentation was temporarily suspended.</td>

<td>A D-class (aged 41, female) was forced to wear an SCP-8261-2 instance on a necklace. The D-class was rapidly transformed into an SCP-8261-3B instance. During the transformation, the D-class screamed incredibly loud until her vocal cords melted together. The SCP-8261-3B instance was confined and the SCP-8261-2 instance was removed, turning the SCP-8261-3B instance into an SCP-8261-3A instance. Eventually, it had died and was autopsied. The autopsy showed that her trachea and esophagus had melted together and her heart was shaped into a wrinkled mass.</td>

<tr>
<td>29-06-1981</td>
<td>A D-class (aged 39, male) was forced to hold a large SCP-8261-2 instance in his hand. The crystal melted into his hand, which mutated into a club alike to that of an <em>Ankylosaurus</em>. The rest of his body then melted into a reptilian-esque SCP-8261-3B instance. When the experiment ended, the SCP-8261-3B instance ████ ██ █ ███████, killing ██ ██████████ █████████. It was eventually neutralized and the autopsy revealed that the small intestine had melted into a giant chamber. The club-like hand is non-anomalous, but is also held inside the vault on floor 33 of Site-88. Experimentation was permanently suspended.</td>
