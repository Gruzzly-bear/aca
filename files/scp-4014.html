<p>SCP-4014 is to be discontinued from use. Publicly, a cover story involving failing solar arrays and a rapidly decaying orbit is to be circulated by NASA as the reason for the cessation of further missions.</p>
<p>Observation of SCP-4014 is to be done with orbital satellite MIMIR-1. Information gathered is to be shared with NASA at the discretion of the O5 Council.</p>
<p>Various scientific periodicals are to publish fictitious reports describing a recently discovered solar phenomenon in which artificial satellites are temporarily obscured from observation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4014 is the American space station Skylab, launched in 1973 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for conducting manned experiments in Earth's orbit. SCP-4014 was designed to house up to three crew-members.</p>
<p>SCP-4014 is host to a variety of anomalous activity with no apparent source. The anomalous activity serves as the onset for a Phase-Event, in which SCP-4014 will disappear from its orbit around the Earth. Phase-Events occur with no set timing, and typically last for several days to weeks.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of a Phase-Event, SCP-4014 will return to its projected orbital path. In all cases, the crew on board will not be present upon its return. In all observed cases, the reentry module or space capsule will also be missing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: Neutralization</p>
<p>Following the events of Incident_4014_10 [<strong>See Below</strong>], all planned missions to SCP-4014 were cancelled, and SCP-4014 was considered abandoned by NASA.</p>
<p>Over the next few years SCP-4014 continued to experience Phase-Events, albeit with decreased frequency. In 1978, NASA confirmed that SCP-4014 had experienced rapid orbital decay beyond expected projections, and was slated to reenter Earth's atmosphere around July 11th, 1979.</p>
<p>As predicted, SCP-4014 entered the Earth's atmosphere on July 11th, breaking up over the Pacific Ocean. A combined Foundation/NASA operation was able to secure 97% of the wreckage, which was deemed non-anomalous in nature. After observation, the remains of SCP-4014 were re-classified as Neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Reported SCP-4014 Incidents_1_8<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>May 30th, 1973</strong><br/>
The crew of SCP-4014 reports a repetitive knocking sound on the door of the airlock module, as well as the observation window. A source is never identified.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the incident is internally suppressed by various administrators within NASA.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 1st, 1973</strong><br/>
During a routine spacewalk, crew-member John Wilkins reports a pushing sensation on his back before he is ejected from SCP-4014. In the half hour it takes for his crew-mates to retract his emergency tether, John is seemingly tugged around in multiple directions as if by force.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 7th, 1973</strong><br/>
The Soviet Orion 2 space telescope experiences an almost total systems failure when its orbit approaches SCP-4014. The crew of the Orion 2 is reportedly killed when they attempt to evacuate. The incident is quickly covered up and covertly classified by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Political repercussions are avoided by the intervention of both the Foundation and GRU Division "P". Soviet leadership is given heavily redacted information regarding SCP-4014, expressly without approval of NASA or the United States.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 9th, 1973</strong><br/>
The crew of SCP-4014 reports they are unable to visually perceive planet Earth. This lasts for 24 hours.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 13th, 1973</strong><br/>
NASA loses contact with SCP-4014 for approximately 4 hours. Upon the reestablishment of radio contact, all on-board cameras are found to have stopped working.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 15th 1973</strong><br/>
Crew aboard SCP-4014 report the presence of a fourth crew-mate, but are unable to provide exact details regarding the individual. The unknown entity eventually opens the airlock module, steps inside, and is not reported again.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 19th, 1973</strong><br/>
President Richard Nixon is briefed on SCP-4014 and expresses concern over the mental health of those aboard, as well as the danger posed by the anomalous activity. Due to events unrelated to SCP-4014, communications between the Foundation and the White House break down, and Nixon orders those aboard SCP-4014 back to Earth.<br/>
|<br/>
<strong>June 22nd, 1973</strong><br/>
The crew of SCP-4014 prepares for departure. When the Command/Service Module detaches for reentry procedure, SCP-4014 undergoes a Phase-Event which lasts for two and a half hours. When the Phase-Event ends the module fails to return with the rest of SCP-4014. The crew is considered MIA.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Addendum</strong>: Incident_4014_9
<p>Following the loss of the original NASA astronaut crew, the Foundation drew up plans to conduct experiments with SCP-4014. Based on the assumption that the module had failed to return because it had been detached during the Phase-Event, the O5 Council voted in favor of conducting further manned missions.</p>
<p>Tensions between the Foundation and President Richard Nixon reached their height in August of 1973, partly in response to Foundation activity both for and against the United States as well as the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On August 23rd, President Nixon authorized NASA to carry out its second planned Skylab mission. Foundation requests for involvement were diplomatically ignored, and the mission commenced on August 25th with the launch of a Saturn IB rocket.</p>
<p>Ten minutes into the docking procedure, SCP-4014 became partly intangible, causing the Command/Service Module to drift into the space it formerly occupied. Radio transmissions from the crew indicated no adverse effects as a result. Approximately an hour after the start of the incident a Phase-Event occurred, lasting 26 days. The crew as well as the Service/Command Module were missing upon the return of SCP-4014.</p>
<p>President Nixon, in a diplomatic gesture, asked the Foundation to conduct cover-up operations, removing the record of the second Skylab mission from public knowledge. This was accomplished through a joint Foundation/UIU operation.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: Incident_4014_10</p>
<p>Due to the loss of two Command/Service Modules, NASA was unable to conduct further Skylab Missions. The Foundation reached out to the Soviet Union and made an agreement to reach SCP-4014 using a Russian Proton-K rocket in exchange for sharing any information gathered.</p>
<p>Three D-Class with military history were selected and given brief astronaut training:</p>
<ul>
<li>D-4K01</li>
<li>D-4K02</li>
<li>D-4K03</li>
</ul>
<p>On November 16th, 1973, the Proton-K successfully reached SCP-4014. The crew was ordered to prepare themselves for a Phase-Event and set up a series of cameras and audio devices.</p>
<p>Three days later, on November 19th, a Phase-Event occurred and contact with SCP-4014 was lost. The Phase-Event lasted for 39 days and resulted in further political turmoil between the Foundation, the White House, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Upon return, the crew of SCP-4014, as well as the Soyuz Descent Module, were reported missing.</p>
<p>On January 1st, 1980, a series of video recordings were transmitted to NASA Mission Control, and quickly secured by the Foundation. They have been transcribed below.</p>

<p><strong>8:47:</strong> The shape in the distance is now closer, and is confirmed to be a coastline. D-4K01 and D-4K02 are seen with makeshift paddles aboard an emergency raft.</p>
<p><strong>10:13:</strong> The coast takes up the majority of the camera frame. Off-camera, D-4K03 asks, "Now what?" to which there is no reply.</p>
