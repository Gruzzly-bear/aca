It's funny that they call me abnormal. Most of the page is gibberish, by the way.<br/>
Oh, and I was supposed to be in my containment room, but it wasn't even locked. The guy who was supposed to guard me didn't even show up, and I just snatched this paper from some researcher, who is now reading the air that she's holding.</p>
<p>Luckily the lights still work, cause they don't have windows here. I can't imagine what is going to happen to the anomalies —</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>[The following was said with distinct sounds of intense footsteps]<br/>
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, may —</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-18" style="display:none">
<p>Scratch that last message, it's fine. Uh, correction, it's not fine. I am now even more perplexed. Whatever made everyone crazy, uh, made the anomalies, not crazy. They are all just normal things now. What the fuck?</p>
<p>I am in a room with something that was supposed to kill me, according to this paper. I am fine. Seeing that the world hasn't blown up, I assume it is the same everywhere else. I guess the whole foundation is meaningless now. There is nothing weird left in this world. Everything is normal.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe, maybe;<br/>
Maybe, maybe, maybe;<br/>
Maybe, maybe, maybe;<br/>
Maybe, maybe, maybe;<br/>
Maybe, maybe, maybe.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-19" style="display:none">
<p>Uh, it has been a year now since the last recording. Two years, maybe, since the start of the whole thing. I'm driving around the states in search of others like me. Empty handed, of course.<br/>
I'm making a recording because I found out I don't have to add those "maybes" into my recordings. Maybe I never needed to do it since a long time ago. I'm not sure why.<br/>
I adopted a dog. Like everyone out there, he is catatonic. Still better than talking to myself.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, I started to read a bunch of Foundation's secret documents I grabbed and began going through them to see if anything has to do with this. None of them were helpful. Though I do have a few theories on my own.<br/>
I think whatever happened 2 years ago has been turning the world back to normal. Everything that shouldn't have existed is being wiped away, like all of the anomalies.</p>
<p>And whatever is doing this has a different idea of what is normal than us. To them, maybe consciousness, and ultimately, life, are considered anomalies also.</p>
</div>

<div id="wiki-tab-0-21" style="display:none">
<p>Just listen.</p>
<p>[Around 15 seconds of hyperventilating, crying and screaming can be heard. The scream is repeatedly produced by multiple people, and consists of a single word, "Mom."]</p>
<p>What the fuck.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-22" style="display:none">
<p>[Screams can occasionally be heard in the background.]<br/>
I haven't been able to fall asleep. Everywhere people began to cry and scream. They drop all that they are doing and call for their Mom. They all sound so, frightful. It's as if they all finally realized what is happening to them, and all they can do is to cry.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-23" style="display:none">
<p>I can't hear the screams anymore. Most of their voices are dead. They are still trying to yell with their strained vocal cords.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-24" style="display:none">
<p>No one screams anymore. No one moves also. The world is still.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-25" style="display:none">
<p>After standing still for days, people began to move around again. They have completely reverted to animals, in, uhh, more ways than one. I feel sad for them. I don't see anything left in those eyes.<br/>
The dog I adopted had died. His body did not even decompose, most bacteria died a long time ago.<br/>
I think sapience is the first to go, if there is any, then it is life. If dogs die about now, humans are not far behind.</p>
<p>I find myself losing focus on what I am doing more and more often. I am afraid I am being affected too, just slower than the rest. I can't find a clock that show what day or what year it is. Even if I find one, I can't trust it. I don't even trust the sun anymore. It could be midnight now and they could have moved the sun to the top of the sky.</p>
<p>[around 43 seconds of silence]</p>
<p>I- I uphold all of reality. I am the only sane person out here. If I fall asleep, who, who knows how many days might have passed?! All the, all the trees could have fallen, and only I can hear them! A year can be a thousand days long, and this is still 2015! The world has not always been like this. It can't be like this, I, I have to be kept awake, or I, I'll become those animals, the, the, those uh-</p>
<p>[3 minutes of unintelligible sobbing and rambling can be heard. Afterwards, 4 hours of slight movement can be heard.]</p>
<p>I have killed this world. I made it all up. Oh God. Oh God! I just, I just, I couldn't, ugh— It must have been me! My dream is smothering the world! Damn it! God damn it! I am the fucking problem, I have killed the world, I am sorry, I, I want to wake up, I wanna go home, I wanna go home…</p>
<p>[Around half a minute of rustling, and 20 minutes of silence excised.]</p>
<p>Oh, uh, um, that's weird. Did I leave the recorder on? I guess I was recording something.</p>
<p>So, the dog I adopted had died, and he did not decompose— Did I say that already? Um.</p>
<p>People are moving around again, and I began to test to see what I can do. Remember that SCP file of mine? I checked it again, everything turned into "The world has always been like this." If I show these texts to the people outside, they seem to know those words, and they look calmed down, even though they don't seem to understand language anymore.</p>
<p>The memetic property of these texts are the only concrete clue I have, and I don't think it is the whole picture. They can’t be causing all of this alone, and judged by themselves, they seem almost benevolent. If the world is being smothered, then these messages are just sweet lies of the smotherer.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-26" style="display:none">
<p>No, their plan won't be so easy to be foiled, a simple death isn't enough, it must be a, a, a, a train, and look, look at that, I-</p>
<p>[2 minutes of intense running skipped]</p>
I am sorry, really, really, really sorry. There is no joy in the world, no joy at all, overridden by pain, and I will not fucking give in, I feel that, I, I feel watched, but I am not seen… I can, uh, no one can hear me…<br/>

Yes, I have the aliens by the balls. I have them at their fucking balls! I have to kill myself to fuck over the aliens! Yes, yes, yes! Big day, big fucking day, woo! They must be shaking with fear! It's my day of fucking revenge!</p>
<p>If something is getting rid of the anomalies, then it would need a template of what to get rid of. And when, when you use regular expressions, that rex egg, reg ex, uh, to replace something, what is the one thing that is kept the same? The search pattern. And that's me! If I kill myself, humanity will be saved! Get rid of the search pattern, and the replacement stops working!</p>

<p>Andre Davis was found dead near a train track in The Dalles, Oregon, but not until his body had completely decomposed. Autopsy determined his death to have happened between July and September of 2018. His recordings (along with 9 other copies) were found scattered around the region.</p>
