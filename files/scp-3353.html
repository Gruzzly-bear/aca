</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3353</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation historians specializing in European folklore are to maintain a list of numerically-significant dates to predict future SCP-3353 manifestations. Locations that have been confirmed affected by SCP-3353 manifestations are to be investigated at least twice monthly, as per dates noted on the predictive list.</p>
<p>Should SCP-3353 manifest during a monitoring session, Foundation agents are to patrol the area and intercept any passersby who approach the location of manifestation too closely. Amnestics may be administered as necessary.</p>
<p>A disinformation team of at least ten researchers is to monitor social media outlets for reports of SCP-3353 sightings. SCP-3353 is to be explained as a low-attention public artistic project involving fairy tale enthusiasts attempting to “make people’s lives a little more magical!” To aid with this cover story, five SCP-3353 disinformation team members are to maintain several active artistic blog accounts, which regularly post a variety of mundane art content in addition to recipes and crafts instructions for making non-anomalous versions of the apples and desserts produced by SCP-3353.</p>
<p>Apples recovered from SCP-3353 events are to be kept for analysis in low-priority storage. Should the apples spoil, they can be disposed of in non-anomalous waste containers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3353 refers to a recurring anomalous phenomenon, which initially manifests with the spontaneous appearance of an intangible apple tree<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> within a public garden or park area. SCP-3353 events occur most commonly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, typically beginning at midnight and concluding after three hours. (Additional SCP-3353 sightings have been reported by social media accounts originating in Australia and Japan, but these cases are currently unconfirmed.)</p>
<p>Following the appearance of the apple tree, several apples will manifest beneath it. These apples appear non-anomalous, with the exception of not displaying on digital device screens when photographed or videotaped. Closer inspection will reveal the words “Tell me a secret” etched in neat handwriting into the skin of the apples, as if carved with a small knife.</p>
<p>Should a human individual voice a personal statement while holding an apple produced by SCP-3353, there is a chance that the apple will vanish and be replaced by a small dessert (biscuits, tarts, or small cakes). Desserts produced through this effect are universally enjoyed by any individuals who consume them, regardless of existing taste preferences, and appear otherwise non-anomalous. It is further noted that SCP-3353 desserts tend to spoil at a quicker rate than non-anomalous counterparts.</p>
<p>In rare cases, individuals who handle an apple produced by SCP-3353 but attempt to hide it on their person or otherwise refuse to speak to it will grow drowsy, eventually falling into a deep sleep for several hours. This effect seems to result in extreme disorientation upon awakening, but no lasting harm. Apples that were not handled during the SCP-3353 manifestation will revert to non-anomalous variants (with no etching) at the conclusion of the event.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the SCP-3353 manifestation, the apple tree will be replaced with a ring of mushrooms<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. The mushrooms produced are consistently local species and possess no anomalous qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-3353-1:</strong> The first recorded case of SCP-3353 manifestation occurred on 03/23/2013, when two Foundation personnel patrolling a privately-owned park during their routine duties noticed the unusual apple tree associated with the presence of SCP-3353. The personnel approached the tree, noting that both it and the surrounding apples on the ground did not display on the surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>After contacting the nearest Foundation Site, Researcher Dominic Harris (Doctor of Humanities, University of Cambridge) was authorized to further investigate the anomaly. He proceeded to interact with three apples<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> until the following results were produced (spoken words present in italics):</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<td><em>“I tell my mother that I like her cooking, but I really don’t.”</em></td>
<td>No change noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“I’m embarrassed by not knowing the difference between vegan and vegetarian, even though my girlfriend is vegetarian.”</em></td>
<td>Apple cracked in half, and transformed into a small cupcake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“When I was younger I smashed my friend’s toy car, because I secretly wanted them to pay more attention to me.”</em></td>
<td>No change noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“If I can get away with it, I won’t bathe for a few days in a row or I’ll only wash my body and not my hair because it feels like a chore and unnecessary too.”</em></td>
<td>No change noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“One time I mispronounced a word and people laughed at me, so I went home and looked up lists of mispronounced words and practiced them.”</em></td>
<td>Apple transformed into a Manchester tart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“I shave the hair on my knuckles every month.”</em></td>
<td>No change noted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“I feel really awkward when I eat too slow or can't finish a meal in public, so I pretend that I like home cooking to eat alone as often as possible.”</em></td>
<td>Apple transformed into a Manchester tart.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Researcher Harris later reported that he felt that the exchange was "not a fair trade, all things considered" and that the anomaly itself seemed to be "more of a prank than anything else".</p>
<p>The SCP-3353 research team is currently discussing how to assign personnel stationed in the United Kingdom for further investigation.</p>
