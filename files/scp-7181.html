<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7181 is a liminal dimension situated peripherally to the southern rim of the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lampeter-hub" target="_blank">Lampeter system</a>. SCP-7181 constitutes a dead end in the system and was discovered during a routine exploration of its southern part. Its coordinates are ███████████.</p>
<p>The mapped portion of SCP-7181 is characterized by a rough baseline Earth-like, albeit markedly different environment. Within a radius of 200 kilometers around the portal, there exists only an almost entirely flat, desert-like expanse comprised of gravel and highly ferruginous sand.</p>
<p>To date, no life has been found, neither macro- nor microbial, despite the presence of gaseous water and an atmosphere similar to Earth's, except for minor deviations.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is a weak magnetism-like effect that biological organisms generally have on the surrounding gravel and sand. A proximity of living tissue of up to ca. 5 centimeters to the ground attracts fine particles in a radius of also ca. 5 centimeters, comparable to the Lorentz force. An explanation for this has not yet been identified.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>Project Sisiphos is an attempt to utilize a central feature of SCP-7181 and the reason for its classification as Thaumiel.</p>
<p>This particular characteristic was first noticed during the first exploration on March 17th, ████, and has been excluded from the ACS description.</p>
<p>The recordings of the first exploration mission demonstrated severe disruptions in radio communication between team members, without apparent reason at the time. A later examination revealed that the interference was caused by a large number of radio transmissions and was not due to technical failure. Further testing demonstrated that SCP-7181 is permeable to radio transmissions from other dimensions, including from ones not adjacent to it.</p>
<p>The first mission alone counted 598 unique transmissions over a period of four hours. The highest measured number of transmissions within 24 hours is 24,388.</p>
<p>Remarkably, transmissions were recorded from universes in which interdimensional travel has been discovered and is being practiced, as well as some in which this does not appear to be the case.</p>
<p>Notably, the anomaly has allowed the Foundation to anticipate interdimensional movements of SCP-7005, track movements of the Serpent's Hand, and learn of ten new and strategically relevant Ways.</p>
<p>Following the project's approval, the Department of Transdimensional Studies was commissioned to establish a monitoring station in SCP-7181. This station comprises a hermetically sealable container and a radio telescope with a diameter of 25 meters - dubbed "The Argus Array" - which is able to cover a bandwidth of 120 MHz to 8.3 GHz.</p>

<p>With the project commencing on March 21st, ████, Research Assistant Gushiken Kuri was selected and deployed to the beforehand established Argus Array to oversee the Array, as detailed below<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. At that time, the facility was provisioned with supplies for a ██-day stay.</p>
<p>Research Assistant Gushiken was instructed to let himself be monitored by an Artificially Intelligent Conscript linked to the Argus Array. Active transmissions are prohibited.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>21.03.████ - 20:01:12 - Link.AIC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Hello, this is Researcher Assistant Gushiken Kuri. I was told several times to verify my identity first. I mean, why wouldn't it be, but… anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> My clearance is level 4, code 8078, I'm 32 years old, an only child, my favorite food is tapas, and I have technical training as a radio operator and research experience with SCP-3034, among other things… And I've never been to a desert until today.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Is it a desert? I don't know. Everything looks a bit redder than I'm used to. Like a constant sunset. It's warm. There's sand everywhere. Looks like a desert to me.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I arrived about two and a half hours ago and have settled in now. I took something to read and clothes with me. But most of what I'll need is already here. I have about 50 square meters of space available in this container. Reminds me of my first apartment in Sapporo. But more rustic. Almost like a steampunk setting.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I think I'll move the workstation to the northern window…</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> The Argus Array is in good condition. It's just outside the container. However, I have to admit that it does look a bit past its prime. I was expecting the Foundation to use the latest technology for this mission, but there's more than just one panel on this thing that's a little rusty. If I didn't know any better, I would say that the metal has been tarnished by sand, but that's hardly the case.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I asked how they got that huge thing here, but the portal technology is classified. Ran a few tests. You should be able to hear the static noise in the background right now. Some noises were audible earlier, but mostly some kind of tones.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I didn't even know about the multiverse until recently. At least not of Foundation activities there. It almost makes me think I'm very far away from civilization and not… well. Without the portal, I could probably walk as far as I want and still not come back. When I think about it, this is almost like a stage, but there's no curtain behind which is the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Well, this is real, just different. Is it?</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I wonder if astronauts on the ISS feel like this. But at least they can see the earth. I've never seen such a flat landscape. Or a horizon so undisturbed like this one.</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> So, I had expected another technician to come along. But that was canceled shortly before the start. As far as I can see, the project was only approved anyway because of the low cost and because this is considered a low-risk environment… A 140-kilowatt radio-telescope system. But additional staff was apparently too much. I told Dr. Byston I don't—.</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> [Sighs.] Whatever… I also managed to bring a class III AIC on a data carrier with me. Got that approved at least. I'll hook the thing into the Argus system and use it as an assistant. Basically, it will start a backup recording every time it 'thinks' something important is happening or being said. This way, I'll try and eliminate the factor of human error. It should also be able to keep me company.</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> [Sighs.] This is Researcher Assistant Gushiken Kuri. The Argus Array runs within acceptable parameters… However, I've just discovered that I've brought the wrong AI module. This unit will be able to do its job as planned, but it is not designed for social interaction. I've rummaged around in the system a bit, and there's nothing I can do. I'm not an AI expert, I can't design such a program myself. I am a radio technician for f— [Muffled].</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> This is… unexpected… But I guess I'll have to manage without much conversation. [Clears his throat.] The mission will not be affected by this. I…</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> This is the third time I've heard this sound. I assume that it comes from the multiverse, the system shows no malfunction.</p>

<p>[Sounds of movement on a metal ladder.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> All right, let's have a look.</p>
<p>[Footsteps on metal.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Hm… You're kinda rusty, actually, aren't you…?</p>
<p>[Scraping, then a yawn.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Oh, yeah. This is Researcher Assistant Gushiken Kuri. I thought I'd go and check on the Array first thing this morning. It's morning… At least according to my watch. I haven't really slept much. I had the blinds down… Maybe it's the stress. Yeah, well I should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> And yes. It is really me…</p>
<p>[Yawn.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I do have to say, though, that I would have preferred to have completely new equipment for this project. Which this system definitely isn't.</p>
<p>[Tapping. The sound reverberates through the satellite dish.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> If I didn't know any better… which I do, actually, I would say that the Array was corroded by the sand and has oxidized over a long period of time. Where did the department get this old thing?</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Honestly? I would have felt much better if I had had more time to prepare. I was supposed to be working with the Memetics Division to develop counter memes specifically for radio frequencies. I understand that this is important and needs a radio technician. But even Dr. Byston had that grim look on his face that he always gets when something is imposed on our department.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> The order came in, no discussion, then the check-ups started, the briefing and suddenly there was a department for transdimensional matters. Apologies for the pun but that was really a lot of rushing for…. well, literally nothing.</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Well, at least the view from up here is unique.</p>

<p>[Footsteps on sand.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p>[Quickening footsteps.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Oh, right… All clear. I almost forgot the sand here does this thing where it approaches living organisms in close proximity. Barely noticeable…</p>
<p>Quiet rinsing.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> It's a bit eerie, I admit.</p>
<p>[Quiet rinsing.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> It should only affect a radius of a few centimeters, right? Looks more like a meter to me… Let me just get a handfu— Ah! It's surprisingly hot. [Audible rubbing on skin.] Figures, I guess. With that constant sunshine…</p>

<p>[Movement on a metal ladder, then footsteps.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> [Deep breath, followed by a yawn.]</p>
<p>[Silence for one minute.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Alright. [Audible sipping.] Let's see. All systems are nominal. Looks like you're doing better than me Argus. God, I hate these bunk beds…</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> This is Researcher Assistant Gushiken Kuri… Obviously… I climbed back onto the Array. Maybe I'll make a routine of it. Helps me wake up. Didn't sleep very well again. I don't know if this is relevant, but I'm supposed to report anything I notice. I had some wild dreams, I don't remember exactly. When I woke up I thought the AC was broken. There was some weird hissing noise, but it eventually stopped.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> For sending me to an alternate universe, they could at least have designed the equipment a little better. I mean did they get this water treatment unit from the scrapyard? And the floor tiles also creak like—.</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Otherwise, everything is going according to plan. A few interesting transmissions have already come in. I don't seem to have clearance for all of them, but of course, I've known about the Serpent's Hand since my briefing. Tracking its movements should definitely help the Foundation.</p>
<p>[Siping.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> You know, that got me thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> The logistics really leave a lot to be desired. But maybe it's worth all the hassle after all. When I joined the Foundation, I quickly learned that you can't expect normal working conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I didn't ask for this assignment. But I know Dr. Byston gave it to me as a chance to prove myself. I could tell from the knowing look on his face when he saw how excited I was when he told me. At 32, most assistant researchers with Level 4 usually already have their own side-projects to manage, so it's high time for me… I even overheard some gossip that I had even been requested from higher up. That must be a good sign, right?</p>

<p>[Shuffling.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> This is Gushiken, confirming my continued existence [Laugh.] I left my microphone at my desk. Not that much has happened anyway…</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I wandered a bit away from the station and looked around during my break. There's nothing but flat plain. And sand. Really nothing. It's like there is so much space for <em>something</em> to be there, but there isn't. I'm a radio tech, so multiversal stuff isn't really my thing. But I'd think nature usually fills… vacuums. So why is there nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Well, I could actually still find traces of some previous expeditions. There were more than I expected. Someone appears to have lost a notepad. I didn't recognize the department logo, but I stored it away anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Got to say, there is something to the idea of finding that beaten path and then stepping off it. It's a bit like I'm Neil Amstrong. A small step for me… [Chuckle.]</p>
<p>[Pause]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> On the other hand, it was a very strange feeling. At some point, I turned around. Hand't realized how far I went, because most of the time, I tried to find any sort of shape or anything to break the horizon. And only then did I realize how small even the Array looked from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> But what really impresses me the most is the silence… Outside the station I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I once visited the Scottish Highlands. When sounds can't bounce off anything, everything seems quieter, as if you’re wrapped in cotton. It's the same here, but the silence feels… well, louder. I know a thing or two about soundproofing infrastructure, but this is different. The weather remains unchanged. No clouds, no temperature changes. Hardly any wind. Even the sand moves so subtly that I don't notice it when I walk over it.</p>
<p>[Pause]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Forgive my rambling but you just have too much time to think here. Nothing else distracts your senses and it just helps to hear a familiar voice, even if it is my own. You are really reduced to yourself and your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> The last time I felt a little like this was when I started my first job. SCP-3034. Terrible damn thing. Perhaps the worst part about it was that my passion for radios never felt entirely… innocent to myself again after that. You quickly learn how human you are in this line of work. And how finite.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> I wouldn't say that I'm experiencing a crisis of meaning or anything like that. I just try to focus on what I have to do. Dr. Byston taught me this. SCP-3034's mere existence was so cruel in itself, that it wore me out. But throwing all our knowledge and scientific methods against it. That helped.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Senior Staff often tell each other that just before you really climb the ladder, you're either broken by the pressure of the abnormal or you break the abnormal. And I like to think that I have a pretty good grip on myself. This extreme is just that. Another extreme. Quite an empty one…</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> If I really do become a project manager myself in the near future, I will have things very differently from how they have been done here. It all happened far too quickly. Ambition is no substitute for quality. Maybe I'll make some notes for the debriefing already…</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Is that? Why would it come from down there?</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> What?</p>
<p>[Pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Is this recording? Probably is… Gushiken here. I heard that rustling again. Tried to open the unit, but turns out it's actually not the AC. It's coming from down below. So I removed a tile and… I'm not sure but it looks like some sand has accumulated below the container. There are some little piles.</p>
<p>[Faint rustling.]</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Strange really. Maybe there are some micro-organisms on the floor and the sand reacts to them… I'll have an eye on it.</p>

<p><strong>Argus System:</strong> System on standby.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> Mhm. [Sip.] Maybe we should do a poll on this and broadcast it around the multiverse, eh? Yeah well, I'm not allowed to do that. A shame, really.</p>
<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> The desert tickles my imagination and I started thinking. I mean, not all places in the multiverse can be as empty as this one, right? So you'd have to have some places worth seeing, or strategically relevant ones for that matter. We probably shouldn't be broadcasting, like, into every corner, but this anomaly could actually be used to create a communication network… You know Argus, maybe I'll make something of you when I get my chance to work on my own project, heh.</p>

<p><strong>Gushiken:</strong> For such an empty place, there's quite a lot of activity here. In a way. A few transmissions are extremely short, like this last one. Others last for several hours. Much of it is unintelligible or in languages I have no clue about. Just incomprehensible mumbling. But at times, I can make out individual voices. Some stuff really makes your imagination run wild. So far the Cognito Hazard filters haven't been triggered. I check them every day…<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PROJECT SISIPHOS MISSION 1 - CLOSING STATEMENT</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>FROM:</strong> Dr. Byston</p>
<p><strong>TO:</strong> Department Head</p>
<p><strong>TOPIC:</strong> Project Sisiphos</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hello Dr. ███████████,</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that the first test of Project Sisiphos was a failure. In parts.</p>
<p>I say failure because the Argus Array worked - more or less - as expected and technically fulfilled its task, especially due to the automatic management of an AIC. However, unfortunately, I must report Researcher-Assistant Gushiken Kuri MIA. Furthermore, he also appears to have thoroughly demolished the Array before his disappearance.</p>
<p>Kuri did not report back to us for the first scheduled feedback. When, after an emergency transmission by the AIC, we decided to reopen the portal - despite the high energy costs - our team found no trace of Kuri, only a severely damaged Argus Array.</p>
<p>I would like to note my regret and the dismay of our entire team here. I knew Kuri as a very diligent, honest, and friendly person. He never turned down a task and was a quick thinker. Sometimes one had to stop him from overworking himself. I write this to make it clear that - despite the monetary damage caused by the loss of the Array - Kuri's death is an even greater loss.</p>
<p>In light of this, I must also point out that the promotion to level 5, which was announced to me this morning without comment, cannot be appropriate and must be an administrative error. I know that there were other applicants and in view of this mess it is clear what this means for mine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I must also mention that the circumstances of Kuri's disappearance are even more strange than they might initially appear.</p>
<p>In fact, Kuri had been working dutifully on the mission after some adjusting. That is until he received one transmission in particular. According to the AIC, Kuri expunged the log of that transmission. He had engaged in self-censorship a few times in the past. I think he wanted to come across as more professional. He was like that. But this project was everything to him. Completely expunging mission-related data - that is very much unlike him.</p>
<p>Said log really puzzled me and the team at first for another reason. Our analysis showed that it contained a rather short audio file: With Kuri's voice in it. That leaves us with only two plausible conclusions. Number one, the AIC made a mistake, or number two, transmission 15002 actually did contain Kuri's voice. There is no evidence that Kuri himself sent a message with the Array through SCP-7181.</p>
<p>I can't prove this, but I do believe the explanation that an alternate Gushiken Kuri sent this transmission is a plausible one. We could not find any signs of a temporal shift and I don't know how else Kuri's voice could have otherwise gotten into a transmission.</p>
<p>Whatever this message contained, after he received it, Kuri's behavior turned erratic. I can't imagine what could have been on 19 seconds of audio that affected him so much. Let alone from an alternative Kuri from another dimension. His psych-evals were always quite good and he had no history of mental health issues.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I am sure you will understand that I no longer wish to manage this project and am stepping down as head.</p>
<p>- Dr. Byston</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sisiphos Protocol</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Dear SCP Foundation,</p>
<p>We are addressing you with the utmost resolve and urgency. This is not a mistake.</p>
<p>Does the Black Moon howl? - Only when fire reaches for the stars and ash keeps the darkness at bay.</p>
<p>This message will - so we hope - reach you without complications and in good time. It is not the first time that it has been sent and it will not be the last, should you remain steadfast.</p>
<p>As this message is sent, you become a link. A link in a chain of senders and receivers, who together amount to nothing short of a shield.</p>
<p>All who join demonstrate that they are willing to do what is necessary so that we can uphold our motto - Secure. Contain. Protect. - to the very end. This is indeed our motto, for as telemetry should prove, we are merely an SCP foundation from an alternate universe. As you right now, we were stunned by this message as soon as it reached us. And like us, you will spare no expense or effort to pass it on once your work is done.</p>
<p>We and those who came before us are doing all this to tell you a story.</p>
<p>A long time ago, an unknowable number of realities away, a man pierced a hole into reality itself with an inconceivable power. It may have been a triumph after a lifetime of research, or perhaps the act of a madman or a desperate soul. Perhaps we would understand it if we were to learn the details lost to even the line of eager, knowledge-gathering Foundations. Perhaps we would fear it.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant.</p>
<p>But what we do know is the name behind this act that tore a universe apart and made reality itself revolt. This man was Gushiken Kuri.</p>
<p>Not the Gushiken Kuri you know, of course. Your Gushiken Kuri may be one of your coworkers, or he may be an ignorant civilian, happily or unhappily living behind the Veil. He may live a life as an artist, a teacher, or a politician.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant.</p>
<p>This is not yet all we know. We also know the place where whatever happened happened. An endless desert under a burning light, its silence a witness to the Big Bang unwound in reverse. A universe bereft of life. Haven't you wondered why the sand reacts to living organisms the way it does? And we also know the name that has been handed down to us: SCP-7181. You may already have such an anomaly, or perhaps you know much less.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Only one thing is relevant. SCP-7181 is not just a liminal, dead space. It is a wound. And if we do not close it, it will continue to tear open, fester, and devour any intact reality that is near it.</p>
<p>This is not just an affront to our principles; it is a danger to us all, no matter how far away. We cannot say how many realities have already fallen victim to this wound. But we can show you a way out.</p>
<p>However one ultimately wants to categorize and conceptualize SCP-7181, we know that it is not entirely empty. The Argus Array is the only structure ever known to exist in this place. Perhaps it was built by one of our predecessors, or perhaps it has always been there and is the place where everything began. We have made it our mission to preserve this place, a mission that now falls to you.</p>
<p>We regret what we are about to ask of you.</p>
<p>We cannot possibly tell how much trial and error it took, how many lost realities before us, to discover that SCP-7181, in all its emptiness, harbors a hatred. We would not know how else to describe it. This ravaged reality hates what happened to it so long ago, and all its hatred is directed at Gushiken Kuri.</p>
<p>It has been passed down to us that countless SCP-Foundations in equally countless universes have located their version of Gushiken Kuri and either recruited or apprehended him. Like you, each of these Foundations was carefully selected for their interdimensional capabilities, and due to the parameter that you have a version of Gushiken Kuri is well-versed in radio technology.</p>
<p>A simple way has been established to minimize disruptions and limit coercion, if possible.</p>
<p>You are to either prepare Gushiken Kuri under the strictest confidentiality or compel him to reach SCP-7181 in order for him to man the Argus Array. You are to - if possible - persuade him that it is a mission to monitor radio transmissions in the multiverse. You are to maintain the Array by whatever means necessary and to produce false documentation for Gushiken Kuri in advance.</p>
<p>Gushiken Kuri must remain alone in SCP-7181 for at least seven days. There is a high likelihood he will receive a message from himself, possibly from a previous iteration or maybe even the original Gushiken. He often reacts strongly to this, but under no circumstances can he be allowed to leave the anomaly.</p>
<p>We do not know what ultimately happens to him.</p>
<p>Some of our predecessors received distress calls or final transmissions. Unless they are not already laden with cognitohazards anyhow, we strongly advise against listening to them.</p>
<p>Gushiken Kuri will - so we assume - not survive this ordeal and will eventually disappear without a trace, like all versions before him.</p>
<p>We understand that this message and our demands of you are inhumane. However, we also trust that you recognize the greater good in sacrificing one to save multiple universes. For whatever reason, SCP-7181 does not expand further as long as the cycle - the Sisiphos Protocol - continues.</p>
<p>We implore you to bury your doubts, become part of our chain, and fulfill the duty imposed upon you. Execute the Sisiphos Protocol and find a successor for yourself in another universe.</p>
<p>Our part is done.</p>
<p>Objective completed.</p>
