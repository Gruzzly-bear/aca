<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8753 is to be held within a munitions shed at Subsite-WT53 until testing is complete. Following that, the crate holding SCP-8753 is to be moved to Site-323 for proper containment/storage. Subsite-WT53 is to be under constant guard rotation. Testing is to be done exclusively with the joint approval of both Dr. Allright (Head of The Department of Mytho-Archeology) and Supervisor Speros (Supervisor of The Department of General Arms).</p>

<div class="mobile-exit">✖</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8753 is a collection of 50 grenades styled after Byzantine fire bombs carved purely from marble. Instances of SCP-8753 have wings-motifs carved into their surfaces with eyes made of pure gold and silver embedded in-between each carved wing. The wings and eyes on SCP-8753 are reminiscent of depictions of Throne and Seraphim angels.</p>
<p>Subsite-WT45 staff viewing an instance of SCP-8753 feel a sense of intense judgment that cannot be shaken. According to claims of affected site staff, this effect has been known to persist for as long as one hour.</p>
<p>SCP-8753 has revealed that manually opening any of the 50 instances is impossible. CT scans have shown each instance of SCP-9753 is completely hollow.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8753 was initially recovered following an investigation and raid on GoI-21257<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> in the port of Piraeus, Greece. SCP-8753 was found amongst a large collection of anomalous and thaumaturgical weapons and munitions. Alongside SCP-8753, the remains of burned Christian prayer scripture that dated back to the 1400's were recovered. After further examination and extensive restorative work by The Department of Mytho-Archeology, the scripture was successfully restored and translated into the following excerpt.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Burned prayer scripture</strong></p>
<p>Let these weapons of the heavens meet the foes who siege The Queen of Cities.</p>
<p>Let their pilgrimage to the field of battle be unimpeded.</p>
<p>Let the light judge those who witness it, let the sinners be blinded before its purity.</p>
<p>Let the whirlwind lay low the ones who seek to climb her walls.</p>
<p>Let the wings break the earth beneath their feet, break those who besiege her walls.</p>
<p>Let the feathers cut through their armor and flesh with ease.</p>
<p>Let Byzantium stand eternal and unconquered.</p>
</div>
<p>Following extraction, the crate containing all instances of SCP-8753 was taken to Subsite-WT53 for testing. Dr. Newhart of the Department of Mytho-Archaeology and Quartermaster Verno of The Para-Weaponry Division<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> have been granted joint control of testing and operations at Subsite-WT 53.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INTERVIEW RECORDING</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 3/7/2016</p>
<p><strong>ASSIGNED RESEARCHER:</strong> Dr. Newhart</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Interview with PoI - █████, a smuggler associated with SCP-8753.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN RECORDING]</p>
<p><em>Audio cuts in as the sound of Dr. Newhart leaning back into his seat is picked up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> There we go, now we can properly get started Mr. █████.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong>….</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> C'mon, if you want us to help you then you need to tell us what you know about the seller.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong>….</p>
<p><em>Dr. Newhart sighs in annoyance, his chair creaking as his voice is picked up as he moved closer to the recorder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> You want my help right? If you don't want to rot in prison you need to give me something here. It's the only way I can help you. some semblance of a lead-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> He was off; I can't phrase it any better than that, always chipper'n always grinning. The few of us that met him hated how he looked at us; like someone buying meat at a butcher. Especially when our boss started to make a deal for what he was offering.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> You were a part of the deal?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> Simply stood guard in the room. But I could hear the deal making being made and was surprised he sold the grenades to us for dirt cheap like he did.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Newhart's chair creaks as he leans back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Do you know why he sold them so cheaply?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> No. He just popped out of nowhere. Our boss claimed he knew him. But none of us ever heard of him, not even the guys who'd been around forever. It's like he was a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Did he say anything noteworthy during the dealings?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> He warned us not to be foolish with them. He didn't care if we killed ourselves. But these weren't some standard grenades to toss. The captain didn't question it and figured some warlord would be happy to grab'em off us.</p>
<p><em>PoI-█████ is heard letting out nervous exhales as Dr. Newhart speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> I have a few more questions and we should be good to go here.</p>
<p><em>PoI-█████ nods</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Did the seller have any identifying features? Tattoos? Scars? Clot-</p>
<p><em>PoI-█████ cuts him off, his voice suddenly disgusted.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> Sulfur; fucking reeked of it. Stunk worse then spoilt meat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Sulfur?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-█████:</strong> Don't know why, but he fucking reeked of the stuff. Could barely breathe around him, even after he left. I can honestly still smell it now. He's not here, right? You're not with-</p>
<p><em>PoI-█████ begins hyperventilating</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> I think we are gonna call it here. I'll have our medical staff give you something to calm you down. I assure you, you are in one of the safest places you can be in. I'll make sure this comes up in your plea deal.</p>
<p>[RECORDING ENDS]</p>

<p><strong>Addendum #1:</strong> Testing would begin on the 14th of July to assess the full destructive capability of SCP-8753. This process would involve a series of tests against various targets and a mock-up environment.</p>

<div class="table_data" data-label="TESTING PARAMETERS">1 instance of SCP-8753 dropped via drone.</div>
<div class="table_data" data-label="EFFECTS">Upon impact, all cameras facing the explosion were fried by an intense blinding light. Cameras not directly facing the explosion capture large marble wings erupting from the light, smashing into the ground and flying into the air. No eyewitnesses were able to confirm any sign of wings. A large whirlwind began to form, launching marble feathers around the surrounding areas.
<p>At this time it isn't certain if they originate from the large wings that emerge from SCP-8753. As the light dissipated the wings caught in the camera feed disappeared from view, however the feathers persisted. The drone was found crushed, presumably by a wing.</p>
An Incident would occur following the test, as one of the security staff watched the explosion. Though Site 323 Medical staff have reported the affected personnel will recover partial sight, long term damage was confirmed.</div>
<div class="table_data" data-label="NOTES">We have a baseline of what to expect now when one of these goes off. Sending in a request to update protocol both for us testing SCP-8753 and the other staff at the testing site. The last thing we need is more folks ending up blind. - Dr. Newhart</div>

<div class="table_data" data-label="TESTING PARAMETERS">Test against a dozen ballistic dummies wearing a mix of standard Foundation MTF tactical gear and Thaumaturgically enhanced armor surplus. Previously damaged cameras were replaced and angled not to view the test directly.</div>
<div class="table_data" data-label="EFFECTS">Examination of all 12 dummies revealed they were cleanly cut apart or crushed despite both tactical gear and the enhanced armor being worn. Said gear gave little resistance to both forms of damage. The drone was destroyed in the process, being recovered embedded with feathers.</div>
<div class="table_data" data-label="NOTES">Well no one was blinded this time, so we are making progress on that front. Whatever is moving those wings has some power as one of the dummies was launched pretty far from the test. Almost gave one of the patrolling security staff a heart attack when he ran into it. We need to figure out a way to get the drone safely out of the way in time. The techs aren't keen on losing a drone every time we test one of these. - Dr. Newhart</div>

<div class="table_data" data-label="EFFECTS">Most of the vehicles held against the whirlwind and resisted impact from the wings, but the feathers left all the vehicles heavily damaged, cleanly breaching into the cabin.</div>
<div class="table_data" data-label="NOTES">Almost had to cancel this one. Weather is getting bad here and both Dr. Allright and Supervisor Speros are steadfast against testing any other way. Here's to hoping the next test goes better. - Dr. Newhart</div>

<p><strong>Incident Log:</strong> The night of 13/8/2016, SCP-8753 would be destroyed in a sudden explosion at Subsite-WT45. MTF Retarius on hand at Site-323 would be deployed. Initially believed to be a retaliatory strike from GoI-21257.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The phone call exchange between Dr. Newhart and QM Verno following Subsite-WT53's sudden destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Wh-what is it Verno? Do you know what time it is? Couldn't this have wait till tom-</p>
<p><strong>QM Verno:</strong> It's gone Doctor, the site is a goddamn crater!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> The hell do you mean it's gone Verno?</p>
<p><strong>QM Verno:</strong> All I know is that something caused SCP-8753 to go off. No clue if it was an accident or hostile action from someone, I'm driving over there with some MTF to secure what we can and look for any survivors. I've been trying to get in touch with you so you can get your ass down here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newhart:</strong> Christ… I'm getting ready now and will be on my way as soon as I can.</p>

<p>[END OF PHONE TRANSCRIPT]</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum #2:</strong> It would later be confirmed from weather data that a lone lightning strike hit the munitions shed holding SCP-8753. While it was believed initially the security staff who were in active rotation were killed in the destruction, all eight security staff members were found in states of confusion. It was was found that the security staff were just far enough from the explosion to be left unharmed beyond light injuries due to debris. When questioned, all eight guards explained they had caught sight of someone out of the corner of their eyes, but after that they have no recollection of what happened. Despite the heavy thunder storm that had persisted for two weeks, the strike that hit the munitions shed was the only lightning strike to happen during that time. Not long after the strike and destruction of Subsite-WT53 occurred, the thunderstorm broke up.</p>
