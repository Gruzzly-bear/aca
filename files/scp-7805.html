<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Containment Procedures:</span></strong> Access to SCP-7805-1α should be restricted to personnel with Level 4 or higher clearance and entry may only include on-site researchers and Class-D individuals.</p>
<p>Entry into SCP-7805-1ß should only occur during experimentation in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>While no anomalous beings or any passengers unaffiliated with the Foundation have alighted an SCP-7805-ß instance at SCP-7805-1α, agents from Site-549 are to stand guard at all times watching SCP-7805-1α in the case of this occurring.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Procedures (7/3/2016):</span> All personnel using SCP-7805 are to strictly adhere to the guidelines set by the Ethics Committee during experimentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personnel boarding SCP-7805-1ß must wear <em>specialised suits</em> at all times during research.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personnel are to pay the correct fare for boarding any instance of SCP-7805-ß.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interaction with passengers on SCP-7805-ß are to be limited and to only occur when it would otherwise result in creating hostility with the passenger(s).</strong></li>
<li><strong>All experiments on SCP-7805 must be recorded through cameras attached to the suits of boarding personnel.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: grey"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><em>Excerpt from <strong>Addendum #3</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Note that all personnel must use the SCP-7805-δ Communication Guide (<strong>Addendum #5</strong>) when travelling on SCP-7805-ß instances.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Procedures (14/5/2025):</span> All research on SCP-7805 is prohibited due to the immense risk further research may have on the structure of our universe and neighbouring universes (See <strong>Addendum #8</strong>). Containment procedures still apply.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong> SCP-7805 is the designation given to three main components which function together to cause anomalous effects, these being SCP-7805-α, SCP-7805-ß and SCP-7805-δ. SCP-7805-1 refers to the initial instance of SCP-7805. Further instances have been labelled in order of chronological appearance, however this system is regarded as heavily redundant due to the seemingly infinite appearances SCP-7805 can take thus referring to the anomaly as a whole is most appropriate and less confusing.</p>
<p>SCP-7805-1α is a run-down dark green shelter located 8km south-east of Site-549 which functions as a bus stop for SCP-7805-1ß. A bench is attached to the inside of the shelter and a simple white bike rack with worn-out paint is placed beside it. Significant markings include: 1) a green sign with text: "Bus Stop" located on the side of the roof, 2) a yellow sign with text: "Signal Driver" located to the right of the green sign, and 3) a four-digit number<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-1')">1</a></sup> with white lettering located on the outside-wall of the stop.</p>
<p>SCP-7805-1ß is a standard blue bus with a capacity of 58. It has no external markings besides the number twelve written in white lettering placed on the front of the bus underneath the front window. The inside of the bus contains grey walls, 43 grey seats, 15 blue handles for standing passengers, a driver's seat and standard driving components. SCP-7805-1ß appears to be solely controlled by SCP-7805-1δ and it is unknown whether or not this is the only way its anomalous effects can occur. This component's anomalous effects include the ability to evaporate targeted individuals, transportation to different dimensions and/or different locations in this universe and durability against significantly different climates and conditions.</p>
<p>SCP-7805-1δ appears to be a Caucasian, elderly male with balding white hair, hazel eyes and a blue driving uniform with the name: "Robert McZimmerman" sewn on the left lapel. SCP-7805-1δ is the driver of SCP-7805-1ß with no major anomalous abilities, besides the presumed ability to survive in a variety of different physical and atmospheric environments. Whether or not this is attributed to SCP-7805-1δ himself or to the inside of SCP-7805-1ß is unknown.</p>
<p>Descriptions of other instances of SCP-7805 can be read in <strong>Addendum #6</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery:</span></strong> SCP-7805 was brought to the Foundation's attention on 10/3/2016, when the lead researcher of <a href="/scp-7057">SCP-7057</a>: Dr. Romilly (henceforth referred to as Subject 7805-A), was reportedly "acting strange" by their fellow researchers and was hence sent to Site-549's medical infirmary and after 30 minutes of silence finally mentioned their coming into contact with an anomalous bus. Following an interview with Subject 7805-A, the location of SCP-7805-1α was reported and restricted access to SCP-7805-1α was established. As a result of SCP-7805 seemingly targeting Subject 7805-A after certain experimentation on SCP-7057, it has been noted that a connection between SCP-7057 and SCP-7805 may exist. The nature of this connection is still under documentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><tt>INTERVIEW BEGINS AT 12/3/2016, 20:33</tt><br/>
<em><strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> sits down</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Hello, Dr. Romilly. How are you today?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> (<em>quietly</em>) I'm…okay, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Do you think you're ready to talk about your experience with SCP-7805?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Um…I think so. What do you want to know?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> If you are comfortable doing so, I would like you to recount as much as you can about SCP-7805.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> (<em>Subject clears throat</em>) Ok, so I was coming home after doing an experiment on SCP-7057 and I-<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Hold that thought for a sec, Morgan. Which experiment was this?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> (<em>Subject looks confused</em>) Uh…how is this relevant?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Trust me, it is <em>very</em> crucial we get every detail about what happened that day. So, what tests did you do on SCP-7057?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Okay, um…so we started by [REDACTED]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Alright, thanks for being honest and aiding our knowledge on SCP-7805. So, go on. You were coming home from work when…<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> So…I, uh…was heading to the bus stop I would usually wait at when I saw one much closer to here so I though: "Hey, this might save me some time!" So then, I…<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> glances off into the distance</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Uh, Morgan? Will you be able to continue the interview?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Oh, uh…yeah, sure. I'm sorry. It's just quite overwhelming reliving it. So…I waited at this new stop when a bus stopped, like it usually would…and I didn't think too much of it, I just went on it like I usually do. Paid the fare, found a seat, dozed off a bit, you know, the usually things you do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Yes, that makes sense. Can you tell me anything about the driver of this so-called bus?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Uh…not much, other then he just seemed like a normal dude. Took my money and just started driving. Nothing unusual.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Yeah? Okay, interesting…anything abnormal about the journey?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> (<em>Subject takes a deep breath</em>) The, uh…first ride was pretty normal. You know…bus regularly stopping and starting as people leave and come on. Then…the, <em>clears throat</em>, the ride takes a turn. The outside seems to get much darker than it usually would at that time.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> And what time was this at, Dr. Romilly?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> I, uh…I'm not quite sure but it was around 16:04 when I boarded the bus and I'd say…20 minutes after when I started to notice something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Okay so you'd say it was about 16:25, then?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Yeah around then. Sun doesn't usually set till well after. So anyway, I look outside my window and I see a dark blue sky, not too abnormal but still not quite right given the time. (<em>Subject starts to speak faster</em>) So I get a bit spooked when all of a sudden I see these strange looking plants with like neon-yellow leaves and hexagonal-shaped red flowers and so I start to freak out and I press the stop button and the bus stops at the next stop and I exit the bus and the driver gives me a weird look as I get off and then there I am in the middle of this weird place with freaky plants with no way to get back home and my phone stops working and-<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Okay, okay, slow down, Dr. Romilly. Take a breather.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> takes a few deep breaths.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Okay, so I'm in this weird place and for a while I am freaking out. A few minutes pass and then I see a pair of headlights. And so I wave them down and see that it is another bus, however looks much more, let's say, steampunk-ish.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> What do you mean by that exactly?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Oh, you know. Cogs and gears everywhere. Exhaust pipes in places where they probably shouldn't be. Even the driver was steampunk, wearing those weird goggles.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Could you talk a bit more about the driver of this bus?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Uh, ye. Nothing much to say about her, except for she wouldn't let me on the bus unless I played double the fare. I mean, of course I paid it; I had no other way to get out of here. Now for this one, I was much more alert and noticed the weird passengers on this bus. Pretty much none of them looked the same as another. All different shapes and sizes. I think I mighta seen a talking pig.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Alright, interesting…now where did this bus take you?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Fortunately, it took me back to the first stop. I thanked the driver so much and was in tears. Right before the bus arrived I actually was starting to get eyed by a scary-looking owl creature. I pushed that stop button so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Would you say that is an extensive enough recount of your experience?<br/>
<br/>
<em>About 2 minutes pass before <strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> responds.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 7805-A:</strong> Uh…yeah. Anything else you want to hear?<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>Dr. Matthews</strong> pulls out a map of the local area.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Could you show me on this map around whereabouts you would say this bus stop is?</p>
<p><em><strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> points to location of SCP-7805-1α on map.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Right here?</p>
<p><em><strong>Subject 7805-A</strong> nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Matthews:</strong> Cool, we'll get our agents right on it. You're free to go.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;">One Class-D is told to enter SCP-7805-1ß without paying the bus fare</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">The Class-D disappears and is never seen again.<br/>
<tt>NOTE: Following this experiment, the number located on the outside wall of SCP-7805-1α changed from 2501 to 2502.</tt></td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">#02</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">One Class-D with a tracking device implanted into the back of his neck is told to enter SCP-7805-1ß and pay the fare. He is also informed to avoid interaction with any passengers on the bus and the driver of the bus and that he is to do the same with any subsequent instance of SCP-7805-ß.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">The tracking device works for around five (5) minutes until seemingly falling out of range, occurring around 4km away from SCP-7805-1α. Nearly 1 hour passes before the Class-D returns back to SCP-7805-1α, on a pink and yellow bus with a vastly different shape to standard buses (<tt>This has now been allocated designation SCP-7805-4ß</tt>). Class-D reportedly went on three (3) bus rides in total, with their fares each costing more than the previous one. Descriptions on the locations and other instances of SCP-7805 were documented (<tt>See <strong>Addendum #6</strong></tt>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">#03</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Three Class-D are told different instructions. First Subject (D-7805-3) is told to not pay the fare or interact with any passengers or drivers. Second Subject (D-7805-4) is told to pay the fare and not to interact with any passengers or drivers. Third Subject (D-7805-5) is told to pay the fare and to interact with all drivers and as many passengers as appropriate.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">D-7805-3 does not return. D-7805-4 and D-7805-5 do return after two bus rides, however the latter subject has a wounded left arm and a bruised right eye. According to recounts from both surviving subjects, SCP-7805-1δ pushed a special, blue button on the dashboard after D-7805-3 refused to pay the fare, causing the Subject to seemingly evaporate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-2')">2</a></sup> D-7805-4 mentioned that the fare for the second bus ride was more than the first, however for D-7805-5 the fare was actually lower than the first. Based on this information, it appears interacting with the driver of the bus has an impact on the price of the buses.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-3')">3</a></sup> D-7805-5's injuries occurred after he talked to a disgruntled creature with a deformed face. However, interaction with other passengers did result in both valuable conversation regarding the nature of SCP-7805 and D-7805-5's receiving of a decorated box.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-4')">4</a></sup> The key point of information that D-7805-5 found from conversing with passengers was that SCP-7805 is a large bus service-network with the ability to transport between different realities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">#04</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Two Class-D are given slightly different instructions. Both are told to pay the correct fare and to interact with the bus driver. One is told to only interact with SCP-7805-δs, while the other is told to interact with passengers as well.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Neither Subjects return. Reason unknown due to absence of documentation.<br/>
<tt>NOTE: The number on SCP-7805-1α changed from 2502 to 2504 after this incident.</tt><br/>
<strong><tt>EDIT: Further knowledge of this incident has been provided through the improved ability to communicate with the driver. Both were perfectly safe during the ride on SCP-7805-1ß. Health problems began when they entered a different reality (Dimension-7805-5) which, according to SCP-7805-1δ's testimony, seems to have had vastly different laws of physics to ours, causing their bodies to implode upon exiting SCP-7805-1ß.</tt></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">#05</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Two Class-D wearing <em>specialised suits</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-5')">5</a></sup> are given similar instructions. Both are told to pay the correct fare and to interact with only the bus driver. One is told to get off the bus normally (D-7805-8), while the other is told to stay on the bus as long as possible (D-7805-9).</td>

<hr/>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam of the Ethics Committee,</p>
<p>Attached is a document detailing experiments done to further understand the nature of SCP-7805. Each of these experiments required the use of Class-D personnel, with some of them unfortunately being either KIA or MIA. I would like to add that these casualties and injuries appear to be largely related to the misuse of SCP-7805 and hence blame could be accurately placed on the harmed individuals themselves. However, instruction from researchers given to these Class-D personnel may have influenced their actions to result in harm. Therefore, I propose experimentation with the use of Class-D subjects continue under measured regulation, ensuring as little harm is caused to them as possible. I think we're close to an important discovery, and this anomaly could definitely be useful in the capturing of dangerous and escaped anomalies.</p>

<p>Greetings Director Bradley,</p>
<p>Your request has been reviewed and your concerns addressed. As a result, the following conditions have been placed on the continued experimentation of SCP-7805:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personnel boarding SCP-7805-1ß must wear <em>specialised suits</em> at all times during research.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personnel are to pay the correct fare for boarding any instance of SCP-7805-ß.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interaction with passengers on SCP-7805-ß are to be limited and to only occur when it would otherwise result in creating hostility with the passenger(s).</strong></li>
<li><strong>All experiments on SCP-7805 must be recorded through cameras attached to the suits of boarding personnel.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Kind regards,<br/>
Ethics Committee.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;">Only one of the Class-D return, D-7805-12. She is unable to inform how the other Subject disappeared. To her knowledge, the two of them both said the same directions in-line with the Communication Guide. Reason for this complication is unknown.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">D-7805-12 returns with the correct photos of Dimension-7805-2 in 23 minutes. The other subject, D-7805-13, returns with the correct photos in 51 minutes. D-7805-13 informs that they figured out an alternate way to use the Communication Guide, which appears to be linked to each individual (<tt>For more information, see <strong>Addendum #5</strong></tt>).</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Only one subject returns, D-7805-29. He, quote: "Bolted the fuck away from those terrifying snake lovin' bitches". D-7805-28 was reportedly incapacitated by members of the Serpent's Hand<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-348548-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-348548-7')">7</a></sup> when looking for a rose-gold covered book, which D-7805-29 states is what SCP-7805-1δ said the book would look like. D-7805-27 and D-7805-29 were able to retreat to SCP-7805-13ß safely.

They proceeded to stab D-7805-27 a total of 34 times before SCP-7805-13ß arrived at SCP-7805-1α, where D-7805-29 exited the bus as hastily as possible.</td>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Addendum #7 - Status on the Classification of SCP-7805</span></strong></p>
<p>SCP-7805 has now been classified as belonging to Object Class:Aisna as of 26/8/2022 due to its ability to transport anomalous beings to any location they please, in effect producing them. Re-classification to Thaumiel has been denied due to the great risk these anomalies may cause especially if regularly used by Foundation personnel. It is unknown why no anomalous beings have exited the bus at SCP-7805-1a, however the leading theory may be that the majority of SCP-7805-ß riding anomalies have no desire to disrupt our planet.<br/></p>

Good afternoon Director Hoffman,
<p>I'm sending this email to request that we open up SCP-7805 to be used by Foundation agents to capture other anomalies. While there is the slight risk that dangerous anomalies may be passengers on these buses, and that seeing members wearing Foundation issued suits could provoke them, I think that this situation would be too rare to occur and that the risk is worth the benefit that this anomaly could provide. Hope you consider this change of classification.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
- Director Hugh Bradley</p>

Dear Dir. Bradley,
<p>Your request has been reviewed and we have decided to move to the next stage in classification. Nicole Farnham (RAISA Supervisor for Interdimensional Sites) has been CC'ed in this email and will begin testing of SCP-7805 on 22/8/2022.</p>

Director Hugh Bradley,
<p>Following testing on SCP-7805, SCP-7805 has been deemed unfit for use by Foundation personnel and hence classification as Thaumiel is rejected. After analysing the anomalies effects, we have decided that SCP-7805 is best pertaining to Object Class: Aisna due to its anomalous properties allowing it to contain other anomalies. We have edited SCP-7805's documentation accordingly.</p>
<p>Thanks for your coordination with this operation.<br/>

<h3><span>The appearance of objects other than SCP-7805-1ß emerging in front of SCP-7805-1α has indeed been observed at an increasing rate. We believe that this may be a sign that the convex point between our universe and others may be opening further, which could result in a collision with these realities. We have decided to label this the <span style="color: grey">Great Convergence (GC) K-Class Scenario</span> and have deemed it too dangerous to continue experimentation on SCP-7805 in hopes that this might slow down or even repair any damage done to the universal boundaries. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/1">Only time will tell</a>.</span></h3>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-348548-9"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-348548-9')">9</a>. This incident occurred during procedures prescribed in accordance with the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6296" target="_blank">EVERSOR Initiative</a>. During the process of neutralizing low-level anomalies at Site-549 and deconstructing their relative containment procedures, a miscalculation in the power allocation of the facility resulted in the corruption of some documents. Fortunately, documents affected appear to be of little value to the Foundation as a whole.</div>
