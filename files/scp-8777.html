<h5><span><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span></h5>
<p>Research into possible containment methods is ongoing under the purview of Research Team P<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ω</span>-K, assisted by Special Asset 4-N-SH (see Addendum A for details). The primary objectives of research into SCP-8777 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An accurately predictive model for the failure of Pellen-Vine Noospheric Entity Traps when applied to SCP-8777</li>
<li>An accurately predictive model for the failure of alternative Noospheric containment methods when applied to SCP-8777</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
In order to restrict the spread of the anomalous <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ω</span>-domain<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-173666-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-173666-1')">1</a></sup>, Foundation webcrawlers and social agents are to discourage the spread of American and West European culture into Eastern and Southeastern Asia. Reduction of the size of the currently extant anomalous <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ω</span>-domain is judged infeasible.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h5>
<p>SCP-8777 is a Class-IV Noospheric Entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-173666-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-173666-2')">2</a></sup>. Its <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ω</span>-domain currently contains most of the North American, and Oceanic Noospheric divisions and the European superdivision<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-173666-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-173666-3')">3</a></sup>. SCP-8777 is currently extant in the South American and Korean divisions, as well as the South Asian superdivision. Spread into the Chinese superdivision, the Japanese division, and the Southeast Asian superdivision is continuing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
As a Class-IV Noospheric Entity, SCP-8777 possesses a concrete location identifier. It is conceptually bound to this location, although it does not physically reside there. SCP-8777's concrete location identifier is believed to be near the magnetic North Pole. Exploration of location pending.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
In addition, SCP-8777 exhibits significantly increased activity on or just after the winter solstice, even in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Special Asset 4-N-SH</strong></span></h5>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>1. Overview:</strong> Special Asset 4-N-SH is a Noospheric-type ontokinetic deployed by the Foundation as a combat overwatch unit and a research asset. The asset is a human female, age 27. Instructions for proper usage of Special Asset 4-N-SH are detailed in Attached Document 14.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>2. Acquisition:</strong> Special Asset 4-N-SH was acquired following the events of Incident-G019-22.09.2011. During the incident, anomalous ontokinetic effects temporarily enclosed a portion of the town of ████, Russia (population: 15 000) in a Type-IX Noospheric Field. The portion of the town enclosed included Foundation Site-147. This caused a total communications blackout for 6 hours<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-173666-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-173666-4')">4</a></sup>, during which members of GoI-019 "The Serpent's Hand" entered Site-147 and removed SCP-███ from containment. It is believed that the members of GoI-019 were anomalously shielded against the field, or otherwise excluded from its effects. 1 hour 13 minutes after the theft was completed, the Noospheric field dissipated, allowing scrambled MTF teams to apprehend the source.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Large-scale use of amnestics was authorized by O5-8, following damage assessment by MTF Zeta-11 ("Dreamers Awake"). An estimated 63.6% of the town's population required amnesticization. An estimated 15.1% of the town's population required memory-rewrite procedures in order to reduce post-amnesticization PTSD response. An estimated 1.9% of the town's population was terminated due to unrecoverable mental/ideatic injury caused by excision from and subsequent reentry into conventional ideatic space. The remainder of the town's population did not require special amnestic intervention.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The cause of the Noospheric field was determined to be a natural Type-IV ("Noospheric/Ideatic") ontokinetic, human.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Following detainment by MTF Zeta-11, the subject was interviewed. Due to lack of interrogations personnel at Site-147, the interview was carried out by Dr. Emery Isleton.

<p><strong>[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Isleton:</strong> Please state your name and age for the record.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause. Subject appears uninterested.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Samira Hsu. Twenty-four.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Thank you. At 1900 on September 22, 2011, where were you?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Morgorodok apartment complex. The fourteenth floor.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> For what reason?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> I was providing overwatch and communications support to — to my teammates.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Subject appears to focus on an empty portion of the room.]</strong><br/>
<strong>[Pause. Dr. Isleton looks at their tablet.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Were you responsible for the Type-IX Noospheric field placed over the eastern portion of ████?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Type IX? You're the Jailers, then. I wasn't sure.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Please answer the question.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> I caused the temporary stratification of local ideatic space from the Noosphere. Yes. Noospheric field. Type IX. Class III. God, the jargon.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> What was the purpose of the assault on Foundation Site-147?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> There's this hospital. It looks like a castle, but it's a hospital. Half hospital. The other half is a mortuary. It's… somewhere in Eastern Europe, cloaked in perception-denying fog, some fifty square kilometres of fourteenth-century brickwork.<br/>
Inside the hospital — don't ask how we know — there are four thousand seven hundred and eighty nine people who by all means should be dead. Most of them from starvation, some from blood loss and shock and blunt force trauma, a few from hanging or beheading. One unlucky bastard was drawn and quartered. All of them are still alive, muscles twitching, eyeballs turn, pupils contracting in response to light. The ones with intact respiratory systems can speak, although what they speak is, as far as we can tell, nonsense. The ravings of the mad. And who wouldn't go mad? As far as we can tell, they feel every iota of pain a living body would feel in their state, and as best as we can determine, they have been in that state for almost six hundred years. Six hundred years of starvation-pangs. Six hundred years of beheading, of asphyxiation, of dismemberment.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause. Dr. Isleton shifts in their chair. Subject is leaning forward.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> That item we stole. SCP-████. It was meant to — to end it. Break the spell. Shatter the chains that bind them to this mortal coil.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause. Subject collapses backwards into chair. Subject is visibly distressed.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> It didn't work. They fucking- it didn't work. How many people did the field kill?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Security teams alerted to a possible information security breach.]</strong><br/>
<strong>[Additional Scranton Reality Anchors placed in interview chamber vicinity.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Nobody died outright, but we had to —<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Subject did not respond to questioning after this point. Interview terminated.]</strong><br/>
<strong>[END TRANSCRIPT]</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
Following this interview, interrogations specialists were transferred from Site-19. The extent of the subject's knowledge and ontokinetic abilities were ascertained.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
At the time, several hostile Groups of Interest were employing ontokinetic units against Foundation forces, to substantial effect. Therefore, as a preliminary proof-of-concept, the subject was offered a choice between containment by the Foundation and enlistment in an MTF. The subject chose the latter option, upon which decision it was fitted with a remotely-activated explosive collar.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
However, by order of the O5 Council, an MTF consisting of ontokinetics was deemed unacceptable, and no other ontokinetics were given this option. The subject was redesignated Special Asset 4-N-SH on 14/02/2012.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The "hospital" mentioned by the subject was located and designated LoI-7549 "Immortal Coil".<br/>

<strong>Special Asset 4-N-SH:</strong> What's this about?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Isleton:</strong> You submitted an official objection to the recent deployment on October 28th. Before the Foundation could respond, you retracted all objections.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4-N-SH:</strong> That's correct.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Why?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Special Asset 4-N-SH appears bemused.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4-N-SH:</strong> Why did I object? Why do you think?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Why did you retract your objections?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4-N-SH:</strong> I don't know. It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing, I guess. I didn't — what's the point? Really, what would an objection do?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause. Dr. Isleton waits, listening.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4-N-SH:</strong> Three years ago I would have said that — I would have said that even if I can't do anything about it, it's my responsibility to try. To resist — What? Immoral actions? What does that mean? What's the <em>point</em>?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4-N-SH:</strong> It's hard to believe that there truly is some moral standard, some measure by which we can be weighed and judged. That it's not — something we made up, so we can sleep at night.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Isleton:</strong> Isn't that enough?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
