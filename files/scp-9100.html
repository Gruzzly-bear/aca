<h3 id="toc0"><span>Special Containment Procedures</span></h3>
<p>SCP-9100 is the subject of an ongoing investigation. Field operatives will monitor local news, social media, and assisted living facilities in Akron, propagating a cover story attributing all symptoms to age-related cognitive decline and/or post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Description</span></h3>
<p>SCP-9100 is an anomaly speculated to account for rapid mental health decline in a subset of the Akron, OH population immediately following the 2014 Akron mid-air disaster. Affected individuals, primarily senior citizens, become convinced they have "skipped" several decades of their life, with no memory of the intervening years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of missing time varies between subjects, averaging 35 years.</li>
<li>The whereabouts of every subject during the relevant time periods are accounted for.</li>
<li>With prompting, subjects are eventually able to recall the missing memories, albeit with a lower fidelity commonly described as a “dream”.</li>
<li>Most subjects express dissociation from their own appearance, with deprecating comments about the state of their hands, skin, or teeth.</li>
<li>Subjects affected by SCP-9100 exhibit a drastically increased likelihood of compounding comorbid mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidal tendencies.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Discovery</span></h3>
<p>On <strong>3.1.2014</strong>, a Boeing 737-200 collided mid-air with a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 ascending from Akron-Fulton Airport. The 737 crashed in East Akron and the MD-80 in Goodyear Heights, killing all 112 aboard the two aircraft and 29 people on the ground. Scattered wreckage from the two planes set fire to several buildings and caused significant property damage.</p>
<p>During cleanup operations, Foundation personnel embedded with first responders became aware of a developing rumor that older members of the population had been unusually affected by the disaster. The extreme similarity of reported symptoms suggested anomalous phenomena.</p>
<p>28 Persons of Interest (PoI) have been identified with complaints matching the description of SCP-9100. All PoI were personally affected by the air crash, either by witnessing the event, suffering property loss, losing family members, or being directly injured by falling debris and resultant fires. SCP-9100-related complaints started immediately after these stressors occurred. Support networks (friends/family/caregivers) commonly reported this change as a sudden and unexplained shift in personality.</p>
<p>As SCP-9100 is presumed to pose a low risk to the public, it was assigned to the Minor Anomalies Unit at Site-86 in Medina County, OH.</p>

<p><strong>FACILITATORS:</strong> Drs Finlay and Vo</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Rhonda Barnes (76 y/o)</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Excerpt begins&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> I dropped my fork.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> My fork fell under the table, and I bent over to pick it up. That’s when it happened – that must have caused it, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Maybe we can start at the beginning, what–</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> <em>[Interrupting]</em> We were at dinner. A friend's house – Owen Parsons – for dinner. It was Andy – my husband, and Owen, and Lauren – that’s Owen’s wife – and his kids…</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Interrupting]</em> That’s okay ma’am, we don’t need everyone’s names. Just tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> We finished dinner, and we were talking about… football. I dropped my fork, I bent over to pick it up, and when I looked up there was a man, in a nurse uniform, in front of me. He was explaining that my husband had died. I thought, “that's not possible, he’s sitting right here.” And I looked around and realized I wasn't at dinner anymore. I was here.</p>
<p><em>[Subject gestures around the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> I asked where I was, and they said this was… well I don’t remember what they called it, but it’s a nursing home, isn't it? They tried to tell me I'd been here a while.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Yes, we were told you’ve been at Sunrise Crossing for a few years. But you’re saying that, for you, this change was instantaneous?</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Instantaneous. That's a good word for it. Yes. Like… walking through a door.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Ma'am, I’d like you to think carefully for a moment – do you remember anything, between grabbing the fork and waking up here?</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> No. I…</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Well, there is something. It was a dream. Some… long, complicated dream and there were… faces.</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording, lasting over a minute. Indistinct conversations are audible from the corridor outside.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> I suppose I do remember… people. That nurse, I remember him from my dream. So… what, I’ve been asleep, this whole time?</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> That’s what we hope to find out, Mrs. Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> And then you’ll fix it?</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Well, we–</p>
<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> <em>[Interrupting]</em> You have to. You can't leave me here. Look, this is all wrong– we only just moved in. Andy's going to paint the nursery… I can't be old already, it's not– well it isn't fair. I have to go back. How can I get back?</p>

<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> I request a team of stats and parapsych, and Talbot gives me one – <em>junior</em> – researcher. Marissa Vo, practically an intern.</p>
<p>Ha. All these years, and Talbot's still pissed. Nursing his wrath to keep it warm, and all that. Well. <em>He's</em> the one who fucked up – I just found it. It's his own fault they buried him here.</p>
<p>Site-86. <em>Minor</em> anomalies. The knackers yard.</p>
<p>Put <em>myself</em> here now, I suppose. Making trouble, as per. Well, teach me for giving a fuck.</p>
<p>Course, they always make out like it's a promotion. “In light of your years of stalwart service, you have been reassigned… to the middle of fucking nowhere."</p>
<p>But what are the chances I should land in the same shitheap as Talbot? He was fair beaming at the door when I arrived, still the same black dye-job and Buddy Holly glasses. Aye, no doubt that toffee-nosed git had something to do with it.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though – Vo is <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>First thing she says – "How come they call you Wee Rasputin?" Pure gallus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I told her it's on account of my shaggy beard and short stature.</p>
<p>Instincts are sound, though. Fourteen interviews in one week, and she led half of them – knows when to push, when to hush. Carries a wee notepad everywhere – good sign.</p>
<p>And she listens. Not just to them, but to me. Doesnae care for my language, but she doesnae moan about it either. Asks my advice, says she wants to be like <em>me</em> one day. Fuck's sake.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Distant]</em> Sorry Doctor – did you call me over?</p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Oh, eh – no that's alright there, Vo. All good for now. Back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Distant]</em> Will do.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> <em>[Whispered]</em> She wants to get into Parapsych, and they stuck her in the dump with us. This case will do her good though – fine chance to earn her stripes, do some proper science and help people who need it – that's what we're about.</p>
<p>Talbot didn't have a clue when he sent her to me – his kind of sick joke.

<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Retrospective longitudinal study of 28 subjects, noting each subject’s “onset date”: the last day they could clearly remember before experiencing an apparent time skip and “waking up” in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULTS:</strong> Life histories varied widely, but following their onset date all subjects led average, unremarkable lives with no distinguishing successes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite decades of employment, all subjects uniformly failed to achieve positions of significant responsibility or authority, nor did they achieve distinction in any particular field.</li>
<li>Performance reviews (where available) frequently contained descriptors signifying compliance, punctuality, and/or inconspicuousness.</li>
<li>Subjects scored within 3 points of the 50th percentile on standardized tests taken after their onset dates (where available), including:
<ul>
<li>Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS)</li>
<li>Aptitude Testing (ASVAB, DOT)</li>
<li>Military performance (DD214)</li>
<li>SAT, ACT, GED scores</li>

<p>Looking at the lives of 28 people, what stands out is how little <em>they</em> stood out. Average in every way. About what you'd expect of someone stuck in a daydream, away with the faeries. But their friends and family didn't notice anything strange, so whatever this thing is, it's subtle.</p>

<li>On May 15, 1916, William Zachery survived the collapse of the Crystal Restaurant in downton Akron, but was later hospitalized with psychatric concerns.

<li>On April 11, 1965, after an F4 tornado struck Pittsfield, OH, four people were admitted to psychiatric care with symptoms matching SCP-9100. One of these, Adrianne Sunderland, was the granddaughter of William Zachery.</li>

<p>She tried to hide it, but she'd stopped taking notes, hands were shaking. Soon as the interview's over, she belts it to the ladies room. Comes out half an hour later, barely keeping it together. She was pissed about it, angry at herself and all.</p>
<p>She’ll be fine.</p>

<p>Sent her to counseling. She tried to act tough and turn it down, said she wants to be like me, the “old robot”. Ha!</p>
<p>I was like, "how d’you think I survived thirty years? You take the fucking counseling. You get your shit straight, then you come back and do the work right, and never let it become personal."</p>
<p>We’ll never solve a thing if we let our feelings run away with us.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Identify one or more instances of SCP-9100-A.</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Review of existing case data.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULTS:</strong> Relevant information surfaced:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9100 has existed since at least 1874, and no cases have been identified outside of Ohio;</li>
<li>At least two subjects contaminated with SCP-9100 were related, but most were not;</li>
<li>Every PoI identified a specific onset date – none were born with the condition, and onset dates were not correlated with any specific age;</li>
<li>Every subject recalled their moment of onset clearly – the only consistent detail between the described scenes was the presence of at least one other person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> SCP-9100 is transmitted virally between humans by unknown means; each moment of onset marked the instant SCP-9100 was transmitted to the subject.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>REVISED OBJECTIVE:</strong> Locate all still-living persons named in PoI testimony; confirm via surveillance if they exhibit unusual behavior suggestive of SCP-9100.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>50 individuals were named in the testimony of the 29 PoIs;</li>
<li>12 of these are still living and were surveilled;</li>
<li>1 individual, Owen Parsons (age 65), was observed to exhibit abnormally consistent behavior:
<ul>
<li>Parsons walked from his private residence in Highland Square to a local bakery, departing at 9:14am and arriving at exactly 9:59am every morning for at least 5 days.</li>

<p>Site Director,</p>
<p>As you may recall, I'm a Junior Researcher working with Dr. Finlay. I'd like to request an opportunity to meet with you and review the case files for SCP-9100.</p>
<p>I understand budget constraints prevent us from investigating every anomaly we find, but I truly believe you may reconsider the relative priority if you'll allow me to talk you through the latest experiment data.</p>
<p>SCP-9100 presents a novel form of spectral activity that would be of great interest to the scientific community.</p>
<p>More importantly, we believe there may be many more contaminated civilians in the public. If so, the Foundation could act to significantly reduce the human suffering caused by SCP-9100 by enacting a public decontamination protocol.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> Site Dir. Harold Talbot<br/>

<p>Colleagues,</p>
<p>After a thorough review of the available data on SCP-9100, I have established Project-DAYDREAM: the development of a revolutionary human resource management tool, and a true paradigm shift for Foundation operations.</p>
<p>In short, SCP-9100 presents an unprecendented opportunity to address chronic inefficiencies with our D-Class program and other unskilled support staff.</p>
<p>DAYDREAM will transform our approach to behavior and performance and, thanks to the reduced fidelity of recovered memories, lessen our reliance on amnestics for information security.</p>
<p>Imagine a Foundation without workplace conflicts, violent incidents, or escape attempts, with unwavering adherence to the protocols and procedures that keep us all safe.</p>
<p>Now, let us build it together.</p>
<p>The road ahead won’t be easy. We have much to learn: we must define reliable decontamination procedures, and we must learn how to control the transmission of SCP-9100.</p>
<p>Senior leadership shares our excitement for this project, and new funding has been made available. We will spare no expense.</p>
<p>Above all, know this: Site-86 will be remembered as the site that ushered in a new era – a new Foundation, freed at last from the foibles of human error.</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> Marissa Vo<br/>
<strong>To:</strong> Research team, Director Talbot</p>
<p>Team,</p>
<p>I would never deny the human cost of prolonged SCP-9100 contamination. Dr. Finlay and I are closely acquainted with the suffering experienced by those who awaken from decades of sleepwalking. But somewhere along the path of research – of securing, containing and protecting – we have made ourselves jailers and torturers.</p>
<p>I have to question whether the “cure”, as we are defining it, will be better than the sickness. Might our subjects prefer to pass their lives in a daydream, than experience NAPEAGUE and its long-term effects?</p>
<p>How and when do we allow ourselves to ask that question, and are we even interested in the answer?</p>

<div class="section finlay-commentary">
<p>Vo has a theory for why the spectre is too weak to talk. Thinks these are the ghosts of sick children who died dreaming of a normal life… and this is their idea of what a normal life looks like.</p>
<p>So, consumptive Victorian bairns taking our brains for a joy ride?</p>
<p>Well. It would explain the low-intensity signal – undeveloped consciousness, more prone to degradation. And it would explain where these extra ghosts are coming from. "Synergistic terminal narratives" – something she picked up from Eckhart. When ghosts – when <em>spectres</em> – find a haunting pattern they like, it attracts others with the same narrative. So our joyriding Victorian kiddos are calling in their friends.</p>
<p>I'll buy it, <em>if</em> the data supports it. But I warned her against getting too attached. Can’t develop pet theories. Or you end up like Talbot.</p>

<p><strong>3.8.2017:</strong> Finlay’s team finalized Procedure 9100-NAPEAGUE, intended to provide a reliable and humane method of decontamination for SCP-9100.</p>
</div>
<div class="section memo">
<h5 id="toc25"><span>Procedure 817-NAPEAGUE</span></h5>
<p>NAPEAGUE is a set of decontamination methodologies for SCP-9100, organized into seven stages of escalating intensity. NAPEAGUE is to be enacted only by trained research staff, to ensure fidelity to the procedure and the wellbeing of the subject.</p>
<p>The procedure begins at Stage 1, with a methodology selected randomly from the collection. If decontamination fails at the first stage, practitioners proceed to the next, and so on until decontamination is achieved.</p>
<p>The methodologies in each stage are designed to arouse a psychological stress response in the subject, with the goal of heightening their awareness via sympathetic nervous system response to such a degree that the effect of SCP-9100 is nullified. NAPEAGUE currently maintains a 100% success rate, though the precise means by which this response nullifies SCP-9100 is still unknown.</p>
<p>Awareness of specific NAPEAGUE methodologies has been demonstrated to increase resistance to them. As such, it is imperative no single individual be made aware of all of the potential methodologies. To date, over 150 methodologies have been approved for NAPEAGUE, contributed by eight staff members.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that, in some cases, prior knowledge of the existence of NAPEAGUE, combined with deliberately vague public documentation of its methodologies, may be sufficient to cause spontaneous decontamination.</p>
<p>Following successful decontamination, all subjects are to receive rigorous psychological aftercare to minimize the likelihood or severity of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p><strong>NAPEAGUE Stages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> consists of informational stress, in which the subject is given information that should be highly distressing.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> entails enhanced informational and sensory distress. The subject is given information combined with sensory stimuli (visual, auditory and olfactory) sufficient to cause significant mental stress.</p>
<p><em>Note: During application of NAPEAGUE, researchers are temporarily excused from stipulations in the ethical code of conduct which prohibit lying to a contained subject.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> involves the application of cognitohazardous information<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-18" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-18')">18</a></sup> of sufficiently low intensity as to avoid long-term psychological damage. This stipulation greatly reduces the number of viable cognitohazards available.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Note: Due to the extreme risk posed to the subject, Stages 4 and 5 require the express approval of the relevant Site Director.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> introduces physical stress on the subject through a variety of means, including the application of force.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> enhances the techniques used in Stage 4 by combining them with methods of psychological manipulation, prolonged deprivation, and sensory assault.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Note: Stages 6 and 7 require express approval of the O4 Council.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stage 6</strong> intensifies the methods introduced in Stage 5 via use of anomalous tools, materials, and effects to impart psychological stresses that would not be possible in standard euclidean geometries and/or linear time.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 7</strong> is without description.</p>

<p><em>Note: Additional experimentation is required to validate these approaches.</em></p>

<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Trying out these voice memos. Finlay used to swear by them… and in them. He said it helped him think.</p>
<p>Everything about this is weird.</p>
<p>Today, they were moving his effects to long-term storage, and I saw his personal hard drive, and I appropriated it.</p>
<p>So now I have them – thousands of memos from decades of work. He should have saved them to the central database, but of course he didn't. It'd take me years to sort and file them all, and I… haven't had time to listen to any yet.</p>
<p>He used to burst into the room, clap his hands and say, “right!” in his big, booming voice. You could tell he loved making everybody jump, even though he never cracked a smile.</p>
<p>I'm sitting in his lab now, and I suppose I'm still waiting for him to slam open the doors, clap his hands, and tell me what to do.</p>
<p>Knowing that he's not dead, that he's sitting in a cell just down the hall, somehow only makes it worse.</p>
<p>Talbot set up another transfer offer to Parapsych. A second chance to say yes. I’m not so naive – he wants me out of the way. But I can’t let–</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p>I’m the best qualified to manage 9100.</p>
<p>Besides, REVEILLE will start soon. Its what Finlay and I fought for all these years – to get out there and actually cure people. It won’t be pleasant, applying NAPEAGUE methodologies to… civilians. But we’ll do what we have to.</p>
<p>And it’ll be good to be in the field again. I need to get out of this lab.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Eradicate SCP-9100 in the general public.</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Operation-REVEILLE is an attempt to decontaminate all 15,021 known or suspected SCP-9100-A instances.</p>
<p>Scalable elements of Procedure 118-NAPEAGUE were repurposed for field use. A target list was assembled, prioritizing ease-of-access and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>12 individuals were resistant to NAPEAGUE, establishing that SCP-9100-B is not unique.</p>
<p>Resistant individuals all had isolated lifestyles with few social connections, and various comorbid mental illnesses. During decontamination procedures, these subjects become less responsive over time, in contrast to the “awakening” typically observed.</p>

<p><strong>Vo:</strong> This came out of nowhere. Talbot loves Saturday surprises.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I thought about this case. I suppose I’d accepted we’d never get an answer.</p>
<p>Looking back at my memos, it's hard to say where the last seven years went. We've been busy here, and I fell into some kind of routine. His letters were like a clock – steady, dependable. Forgettable.</p>
<p>I know how that sounds… but I have an EMPSG camera in my office, and I step in front of it every week. I’m clean. I'm always clean.</p>
<p>Even so, this memo was a wake-up call. I tried to forget, and get back to work, but I can't. Everything at Site-20 feels… irrelevant.</p>
<p>If they send 9100-B back, and amnesticize him, he’s gone, and I’d – we’d lose decades of knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Not to mention it’s the best case of treatment-resistant contamination we’ve seen. He's key to solving that problem.</p>
<p>I need to act. I have to speak Talbot's language. Do something Finlay never could… never <em>would</em>, have done.</p>

<p>I can solve SCP-9100, if you'll give me the resources.</p>
<p>DAYDREAM was our shared vision; you can’t give up on it now. If we send them back, it's over. Ten years of work just to concede defeat.</p>
<p>But if we can truly understand what this entity is, and find a way to decontaminate SCP-9100-B, we can finish what we started, and you’ll finally get the recognition you deserve.</p>

<strong>From:</strong> Harry Talbot<br/>

<p>Marissa,</p>
<p>It's good to hear from you, and I’m pleased you haven’t lost your passion for DAYDREAM.</p>
<p>I’d be a fool not to question, though, whether this request is motivated by the project, or your residual loyalty to SCP-9100-B.</p>
<p>Finlay was a difficult man. He saw personal slights where there were none. He nurtured some personal vendetta against me, likely from our past in Dover, and he was blind to the ways I tried to help him.</p>
<p>As a case in point, I assigned him you: the brightest and best resource I could spare at the time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can understand what Finlay could not - DAYDREAM was never about recognition. It was about finance. I needed something to offset the exorbitant expenses Finlay was always happy to accrue.</p>
<p>The Head of Research role at Site-86 is currently filled, but you're welcome to rejoin us as a Senior.</p>
<p>Given your stated enthusiasm for DAYDREAM, I expect you'll lead the pitch when we sell the project to the O4 council. Make them understand the value of our "shared vision".</p>
<p>I’ll postpone the transfer. But I need those subjects off the books before fiscal year 2026 – you'll have one month.</p>
<p>And whatever happens, SCP-9100 stays at Site-86.</p>

<h5 id="toc37"><span>12.4.2025 – Experiment – Behavioral Testing</span></h5>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Routine re-testing of behavioral and performance metrics. O5-9 and retinue observing.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULT:</strong> Performance of all three individuals was found to be 18% higher on average than their previous test 6 months ago. This is the first significant change to these scores in nine years. Performance was still anomalously consistent, but at a new higher baseline.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>REVISED OBJECTIVE:</strong> Determine if the presence of senior leadership affected the previous test.</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Subjects were tested again one day later, in the absence of senior leadership.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULTS:</strong> Performance scores returned to their previous baseline.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>REVISED HYPOTHESIS:</strong> Subject’s performance matches the average of the local population, not the global average. Introducing high-performing staff members to Site-86 raised the local average significantly enough to be measurable. Therefore, some connection exists between SCP-9100 and the minds of uncontaminated humans.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Determine if information can travel between instances of SCP-9100-A through anomalous means (i.e. telepathy).</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> Contained subjects were isolated for a week, during which all Site-86 staff were instructed to use the phrase “kangaroos can't dance” as frequently as possible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-20" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-20')">20</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-9100-B and SCP-9100-A34 were then placed in a chamber together and allowed to converse freely.</p>
<p><strong>KEY RESULTS:</strong> Both subjects used the phrase “kangaroos can’t dance” during conversation. Whereas SCP-9100-A34 used it to express commiseration, SCP-9100-B used it as an exclamation of surprise. Neither remarked on this discrepancy.</p>
<div class="section vo-commentary">
<p>Confirmed. The subjects’s speech is influenced by the local population, just as their performance appears to be. They’re telepathically linked.</p>
<p>Telepathy requires extremely high menseme scores – an intense level of consciousness. But SCP-9100-A scores are extremely low. How is it possible?</p>
<p>As an aside, I analyzed SCP-9100-B’s speech patterns before and after contamination, and noticed a substantial reduction in the use of Scottish phrases, which backs this theory. How did I miss that?</p>

<p>I'll confess the difference in performance metrics was a concern, at first. You know I dislike surprises, especially with leadership on-site.</p>
<p>But your latest test reports are compelling. If we can manipulate the local average by introducing high-performing team members to a group of DAYDREAM subjects, we'll have a way of <em>increasing</em> productivity, not just standardizing it.</p>

<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Like I suspected, the scan matches.</p>
<p>This kills the ghost theory, finally. A human spectral imprint overlaid on a conscious mind – what we were seeing was an active telepathic link.</p>
<p>I have a hypothesis.</p>
<p>I dug through the archives for cases of low menseme telepathy. I found a case from the UK. A coma patient, nearly dead, but its dreams were a reflection of global consciousness, like a weather vane. Someone had been using it to predict the stock market.</p>
<p>Telepathy requires a higher intensity of consciousness to detect what’s happening in someone else’s brain. But that's because our own consciousness is so loud. It’s like doing astronomy in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>But if your own consciousness is dimmed… it’d be easier to detect, or be influenced by, others.</p>
<p>Our subjects aren’t being haunted. They’re telepathically linked, to… someone. Who?</p>

<p><em>[Rustling sound]</em></p>
<p><strong>Talbot:</strong> Easy now, we’ve got you. Look, sit down. We’ll get you some water. Finlay, take A-25 out of here and bring Ms. Manderley some water.</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>Manderley:</strong> <em>[Calmly]</em> Is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>Talbot:</strong> From what you’ve seen, do you think someone could be using this entity to monitor us?</p>
<p><strong>Manderley:</strong> I doubt it. What they’re tuned into… it isn’t a person. Not a <em>single</em> person, I mean. It’s <em>every</em> person. But it's impossible to say for sure. That’s just how it goes sometimes. You win some, you lose some.</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>Talbot:</strong> Oh, christ on a bike– that'll be all today, Sarah-Anne, let's get you out of here. Finlay, make sure you delete this recording. Understood?</p>

<p>He knew, for months, that Finlay was contaminated… and he buried it. Endangered the entire team to protect his project. Never mind how useful this info would have been to our research. Years wasted.</p>

<p>Marissa,</p>
<p>A mutual friend informed me you've found a file that does not belong to you.</p>
<p>If you assumed the letters you exchanged with SCP-9100-B were his only social contact in the last seven years, let me disabuse you: we speak often.</p>
<p>When I reassigned you this case, I did not grant you free reign to dig through deleted files beyond your clearance level. You are wholly beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Out of respect for our longstanding collaboration, I've chosen not to pursue disciplinary charges for your breach of information security. In return, I trust you know well enough to act with discretion. If I find that file where it should not be, you will answer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the O4 council has, just this morning, approved the use of NAPEAGUE Stage 6 and 7. Those procedures are currently underway, and Finlay will be decontaminated shortly.</p>
<p>I’m closing your investigation, effective immediately.</p>

<h5 id="toc46"><span>12.26.2025 – Voice Memo – Dr. Marissa Vo</span></h5>
<p><strong>Vo</strong>: Strange… I remember this interview. I remember ending it.</p>
<p>All the interviews that day, that whole week, just endless stories of suffering, and… loneliness, were filling something up inside me. I didn’t know it was there – I thought I was handling it – until suddenly it was overflowing.</p>
<p>I ran to the bathrooms. I had to keep smiling, keep the mask on, just long enough to keep the dam from bursting. When I got to the cubicle I didn’t even lock the door, just collapsed on the ground and cried so hard I almost threw up. My hands were shaking, my whole body – it felt like nothing would ever be okay again.</p>
<p>When I came outside, Finlay was there.</p>
<p>He didn’t… give me a hug, didn’t pat me on the shoulder or anything like that. He was just… there. Like a rock. Something to hold onto. And I knew that as long as he was there, I wasn’t going to drown.</p>
<p>He stood me up, and sent me for counseling. Made me go.</p>
<p>Foundation counseling was nothing like therapy. They were trying to somehow… harden my heart. Make me – okay – with everything I was seeing, so I could get back to work.</p>
<p>Just like Finlay. I wanted so badly to be like him. When you’re that low, you’d do anything to escape. You <em>want</em> to shut it off, shut <em>yourself</em> off, completely.</p>
<p>So I listened to him. Found ways to survive. I learned I could take notes, or <em>pretend</em> to take notes, so I didn’t have to see their faces.</p>
<p>It must have worked, because watching this recording, all these years later… it’s so distant. I barely recognize myself.</p>
<p>But that girl, crying on the bathroom floor, who was willing to do anything – give anything – to help those people… she’s still in here. The things in my life that I'm proudest of, I did because of her.</p>
<p>I never want to lose that part of me. Why did I let them convince me I should?</p>
<p>And what else was Finlay wrong about?</p>

<h5 id="toc48"><span>12.26.2025 – Experiment – Decontamination</span></h5>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Decontaminate SCP-9100-B.</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> It’ll work or it won’t matter.</p>
<p><em>[Vo enters the containment chamber hurriedly and closes the door. She stands facing the closed door for a few moments, hands on the doorframe, in an apparent attempt to calm herself.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-9100-B is sitting on the bed, staring at the opposite wall, and does not acknowledge her entrance.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Vo removes her notebook from her coat pocket, and throws it onto the table. She claps her hands together.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Loudly]</em> Right!</p>
<p><em>[The clap echoes in the chamber. Finlay does not react.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> We need to talk, Finlay.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9100-B:</strong> Yes, <span class="trigger">that's just how it goes.</span></p>
<p><em>[Vo begins to pace back and forth, staring at the floor. Finlay does not move.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I've come to realize you've been wrong about… a lot of things.</p>
<p><em>[Vo stops pacing while waiting for a response, but SCP-9100-B does not react. Vo is visibly counting on her fingers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I've been at Site-20 for seven years. They talk about “Wee Rasputin” there all the time. You’re a hero to them, too. But something stood out, a throwaway comment at lunch. “Finlay and Talbot,” they said. “Do they want to kill, or <em>fuck</em> each other?”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9100-B:</strong> <span class="trigger">Well, boys will be boys.</span></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I know it was a dumb comment. <em>Childish</em>. But it stuck with me.</p>
<p><em>[Vo begins to pace again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I was digging around in the old files just now, and a few things stood out.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. Vo is counting on both hands, still pacing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> You named the procedure for transmitting SCP-9100 "Dover", because you wanted to provoke Talbot. You spoke up in the hearing to stop DAYDREAM, when you could have submitted objections in writing. You pretend to keep things professional, but you enjoy your childish rivalry as much as he does.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9100-B:</strong> What can you do. <span class="trigger">It is what it is.</span></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Then I found the motion Talbot passed, to keep SCP-9100 here at Site-86, instead of going to Major Anomalies. Here, with so few resources, where we struggled to solve something so big with so little funding. Site-86's budget is small because it's the <em>Minor</em> Anomalies unit. It's not supposed to handle things like this. Talbot was trying to turn this site into something it isn't, because he had a personal agenda.</p>
<p>But Finlay… you co-signed his motion.</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9100-B:</strong> <span class="trigger">That’s just the way the–</span></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Interrupting]</em> You kept it here so <em>you</em> could work on it. You talked about “making sure the work gets done right”. But I think maybe you wanted a way out, just like Talbot. A big case to rescue your career. Get yourself the SCODA you always wanted.</p>
<p>I realized you're both stuck in your childish patterns. Neither of you will grow up.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. SCP-9100-B is still staring at the wall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Well?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9100-B:</strong> Many a mickle… maks… a muckle.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-21" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-21')">21</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Just trigger phrases, Finlay?</p>
<p><em>[Vo turns to look at SCP-9100-B for the first time. She approaches, and inspects him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> God, what did they do to you?</p>
<p><em>[Vo pulls the chair from the desk and sits directly in front of SCP-9100-B, looking down at her lap. SCP-9100-B does not react.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>[Quietly]</em> Look, you told me time and again, whatever happens, “never let it become personal”.</p>
<p>I understand why – the Foundation is a cold place. It doesn't know… doesn't <em>want</em> to know, about our feelings. We give up everything to work here. Family, friends. It’s full of people so detached, so… <em>professional</em>… they can think of a thousand ways to torture you, but they – literally cannot <em>imagine</em> how they might actually reach you.</p>
<p>You survived thirty years here because you learned to detach. You didn't care what happened to your body. But anyone could see what you were really afraid of – it was plain as day. It was in your gruff voice and your rudeness and your… just, <em>constant</em> swearing.</p>
<p><em>[Vo takes SCP-9100-B's hands in her own, and looks down at them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I didn't refuse my first transfer because of the work we were doing. I didn't save you from blinding out of academic interest. I didn’t write letters for seven years because I needed your input – I barely used the advice.</p>
<p>When I left, it was because… all those times you said I owed you nothing, to forget about you, that we're just… colleagues, <em>I believed you.</em></p>
<p>And you were <em>wrong.</em></p>
<p>I’m your friend, Finlay, and I’m tired of pretending otherwise. You inspired me. You made the work fun, even when it was horrifying. In the lab with you, I never doubted myself or… questioned what I was doing with my life.</p>
<p>Half of who I am is because of you. I’ll always be your friend, even when you’re an idiot. Even when you disappoint me.</p>
<p>"That Hallmark shite" is not weakness, Finlay. It's <em>how we survive</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Vo drops SCP-9100-B's hands, and places her hands on his shoulders, avoiding eye contact by staring at his chest.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> I know you're still in there. I know you’re afraid. So hold on to this: hold on to <em>me</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Vo locks eyes with SCP-9100-B. They do not move, or blink.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Twelve seconds pass in which neither party breaks eye contact.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Finlay blinks first.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Finlay looks around the room, then at his hands and the containment uniform he’s wearing. Vo releases his shoulders and leans back, breathing heavily. She rubs her eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> How long?</p>
<p><em>[Vo sighs, and smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Nine years.</p>
<p><em>[Finlay runs his hands through his hair.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Christ. You look old.</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> And you look… terrible.</p>
<p><em>[Finlay gestures to Vo’s ID badge, which is hanging from a lanyard around her neck.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Senior Researcher…</p>
<p><em>[Finlay takes the ID badge in his hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Site-86? How are you still here, Vo…?</p>
<p><em>[Vo tucks her ID badge into her lab coat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> "Making trouble, as per." Had some cases to finish up, that’s all.</p>
<p><em>[Vo stands and begins to pace slowly around the room. Finlay remains seated.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> So… what’d I miss?</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> You got a commendation for good behavior. From Talbot.</p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Jesus, you should've euthanized me.</p>
<p><em>[Neither speak for several seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Did you hear… any of what I said, just then, before you woke up?</p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> I… was running the trigger word test on a subject. Couldn’t get the poor sod to shut up… Next thing I’m here, with you. So, no, I don’t suppose I did hear it, whatever you said.</p>
<p>Except… I dunno, there is something there. Like they all say – feels like a dream I had. Something important. Maybe I didn’t hear it but… maybe I felt it.</p>
<p><em>[Vo abruptly moves across the room and hugs Finlay, who stares, unmoving, for a moment before reciprocating.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> Alright there, Doctor. It’s all good–</p>
<p><em>[Finlay pats Vo on the back in an apparent attempt to disengage. Vo does so, slowly, and sits in the chair once more.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finlay:</strong> So, you solved it, then? 9100, all figured out?</p>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Well… almost. We’ve got a lot to catch up on. I need your help – your connections, if you still have them.</p>

<p>[…] Even if the rescue attempt fails, the resultant co–antagonistic psychokinetic pull accomplishes a reduction of subsumptive depth, temporarily abating further reflex for five to seven years.

<p><strong>Vo:</strong> Finlay retired, finally. He's earned it – people don’t retire here very often.</p>
<p>Hard to believe it’s over… the problem I've spent my career trying to solve. We couldn't help the ones who woke, but at least we woke everyone still asleep.</p>
<p>Talbot is happy DAYDREAM is moving again, but Velicheti’s conclusion was firm – there's no safe way to prevent transmission. Talbot will keep trying anyway, forever. Trapped in his patterns, like all of us.</p>
<p>I had time, finally, to pick up threads I noticed earlier, and it confirmed my suspicions. So, now I have to decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>If I used the formal channels, Talbot would kill it, and bury me. But Bakaluba at Site-25 still owes me a favor.</p>
<p>Look at that, Finlay – I know people now, too.</p>
<p>In this job, we're often forced to choose between what we <em>want</em> to do and the <em>right</em> thing to do. This time, though, they’re one and the same.</p>
<p>I know what it will cost me, and I don’t care. I’m through doing what I’m told.</p>
<p>The difference between me and Finlay is that I don't need to lie to myself – this is fucking personal.</p>

<li>The dossier included an audio recording of Sarah-Anne Manderley’s visit to Site-86.</li>
<li>It also included a comprehensive analysis of Site-49’s performance metrics over time, demonstrating that these metrics began to decline immediately after Manderley returned from her Site-86 visit, plateauing at a near-average level which had been maintained consistently since.</li>

<li>The rapid spread of SCP-9100 through the Foundation was traced to the movements of Sarah-Anne Manderley, whose telepathic abilities effectively broadcasted its effect to all nearby personnel.</li>
<li>The global reduction in performance standards caused by the 2,871 contaminated staff members was deemed responsible for at least 18 other containment breaches, resulting in 138 deaths and approximately $1.9 billion in losses.</li>
