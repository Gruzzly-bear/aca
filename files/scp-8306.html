<p>SCP-8306, photographed on Site-898's grounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Attempts to contain SCP-8306 thus far have resulted in failure. However, the entity appears either unwilling or unable to leave the grounds that make up the Red Brook Mine and Site-898, both of which are already secured by Foundation personnel. As a result, SCP-8306 is permitted free access of these areas.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>
<p>Site-898 staff are encouraged to close their blinds at night.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8306 is believed to be one of the first RUNS RED anomalies to have manifested from <a href="/scp-8987">SCP-8987</a>, as reports and references to it within recovered mine documents date back to 1963, around the same time frame that SCP-8987's activation events began affecting the operations at the Red Brook Mine.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Appearing similar to a baseline human male of roughly 60 years in age, SCP-8306 is usually dressed in miner's attire typical of the 1960s, and is often seen carrying related equipment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Its eyes and mouth are empty and agape, its skin is pale. More often than not, SCP-8306 is caked in mud and coal dust.</p>
<p>The true extent of SCP-8306's exact anomalous capabilities is unknown, though it has displayed the consistent ability to manifest and de-manifest at will — this being the primary reason behind the abandonment of containment attempts, as SCP-8306 is uninhibited by physical barriers.</p>
<p>SCP-8306 is the only known RUNS RED anomaly to display sapience. It is cordial, seemingly benevolent despite unpredictability, and capable of human speech. The entity has never stated having a name, simply referring to itself as "the Foreman", a title which has caught on colloquially at Site-898. In spite of some members of staff's familiarity with SCP-8306, personnel are warned to be cautious around it due to a present lack of understanding of its true nature.</p>
<p>Additionally, SCP-8306 appears to display symptoms similar to that of black lung: its breathing and frequent coughing are described by personnel as "wet and rattly" or as "wheezing". These distinctive sounds are often used to identify SCP-8306's presence, alongside its habit of whistling. Under no circumstances is a member of staff to whistle back.</p>

<div class="notation">
<p>Chief Miranda, is it possible for you to append some of the past reports and sightings of SCP-8306 to this file? My Sector is starting to look into the anomaly; Director Eden wants us to find out more about its behaviors, and what might be motivating its presence with us.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>- Dr. Fate Hargroves, Cryptozoology Lead</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p>Can do. These reports are a little disorganized, many cross my desk, but you might find what you're looking for in them.</p>
<p>Good luck.<br/></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8306.1:</strong> Attached documentation, per request.</p>
<div class="darkdocument">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> The construction of Site-898 has not exactly been, shall we say, smooth. While officially construction of the Site has been labeled "complete" as of last week, we are far from done. Primary structures were rushed under the worry of MC&amp;D<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> striking when our guard and gaze were low, and the location wouldn't be my first choice.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> We've recycled MC&amp;D's little company town into one of our own. Yes, I do acknowledge the irony in that, but waste not, want not. I needed to house my staff, and a plethora of cabins already existed. At least, it seems our new friend doesn't mind it. While I've seen him lurking around the outskirts of construction, heard him whistling late at night whilst stalking our grounds with lantern in tow, nothing has come of the encounters that I would consider worrisome.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> My biggest hurdle, however, is that the Foundation ain't gonna be rigging any heavy power out into the belly of Appalachia. We're off-grid, all construction has been done on manpower and carbon oil alone. It's been left in my hands to determine the most efficient way to power the place once it's in full operation. So, I called a meeting of my staff, to field for ideas.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> The most popular proposal that came of this was to use Red Brook. Not the mine, no, but the tributary that flows out from the Coalbed Swamp and down into the valley cliffs beyond us for hydroelectric. If the construction ends up a success, the run-of-river system might make us entirely self-sufficient, which would be a major boon out here.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> Though, Dr. Hillard had proposed we use the bounty beneath our feet to fuel the Site, the coal. It was another option I myself had briefly considered, despite its risks.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> And then Hillard found a dead canary on his pillow the next morning.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> I'm not a man foolish enough to scoff at omens, so we took the message to heart.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>Security Report 8306, 20/06/1970, Dr. Seth Miranda</span></h3>
<p>It was a couple ticks past midnight, when it started up. Woke up to it; heavy boots crunching pine needles and grass. Now, hearing walking outside isn't out of the ordinary. People sometimes work late in the labs, head their way back in the dark; but they've got flashlights. The light that started bobbing around out my window wasn't that. Orange-gold, flickering fire.</p>
<p>We all keep our blinds closed at night in the cabins. The woods have peering eyes, and I don't want to join the unlucky few who have woken up late to find 8306's empty face staring in.</p>
<p>But curiosity got the better of me. I pulled open the curtain.</p>
<p>8306 was walking the town. He was at the row across from my own, so I only initially saw him when he passed the gaps between the cabins until he hit the end of the line, and turned towards mine. Light got brighter from there, as he walked down the houses. The shadows grew odd.</p>
<p>There were people in the dark, when his lantern came. Not any of us, no, but people on the porches nonetheless. In rocking chairs, standing at the doors, sitting in the grass and muck. They watched as he walked.</p>
<p>I sat there, watching those watchers, realizing how damn <em>quiet</em> it was. No birds, no wind, not even a peep from the other cabins. I watched the door of one across from mine swing open, and someone walked out, just stood there and stared. Couldn't see who it was. If it <em>was</em> anyone at all.</p>
<p>Didn't like the thought, so I turned back and watched 8306 and that swinging lantern. He only paused once, to turn his head towards one set of shadows. I watched him tip his cap to 'em, before continuing to trudge on.</p>
<p>Then the silence broke. He started singing.</p>
<p>Now, I keep a tape recorder in my nightstand. I like to record birdsong from time to time, helps me sleep. So halfway through this I fumbled for the thing in the dark and flipped it on. Quality ain't the best, but I've added it to this report.</p>

<p>I think the fire died at some point, because I blinked and the light was gone. The town was empty, not a soul out.</p>
<p>But I heard 8306. He just went on a'whistling into the night with that strange tune on his tail.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Site-898 staff culture has been influenced by SCP-8306's extended presence on the grounds in the form of superstitions and traditions. Polling of the Site's staff over the years has shown a split between individuals who actively fear SCP-8306, and those who regard it with intrigue or curiosity.</p>
<p>New employees, transfers, or visitors are encouraged to leave a small object on the outside of their cabin's windowsill on the first night of their stay as a "gift" to SCP-8306. While the object is never specified by others, most tend to leave small trinkets, shiny stones or tools.</p>
<p>Typically, these offerings are gone by morning.</p>
<p>It is believed that presenting these gifts will both acclimate new staff to SCP-8306's presence, and show SCP-8306 that the newcomer is welcome on the Site's grounds. While the success rate of the former is unclear due to the possible psychological consequences that come with luring SCP-8306 towards one's window at night, the latter has been remarked upon positively by the entity itself.</p>
<p>It has also been found that if presented with multiple objects, SCP-8306 will only take one. It has shown a preference towards lamp oil, tuning forks, shale and saltwater toffees.</p>

<p>While not all personnel engage, superstitions relating to SCP-8306 that have emerged at Site-898 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The closing of window blinds past dusk;</li>
<li>Saying "bless you" or "'scuse you" anytime one hears coughing in the woods.</li>

<p>Foreman Keshner (left).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>PoI Designation:</strong> 8987</p>
<p><strong>Date of Identification:</strong> 16/05/1966</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Theodore Keshner</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> POI-8987, Theodore Keshner, was the Mine Foreman at the Red Brook Mine during the Summit Anthracite operation. After Investigation RED CANARY, Summit Anthracite was found to be a front company of Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark, with Keshner functioning as the primary MC&amp;D operative in charge of the mine.</p>
<p>Keshner would be arrested by Foundation personnel on 06/06/1966, and taken into temporary custody at the Summit Anthracite mining town whilst Site-898 was under construction. Attempts at interrogation on the motivation behind Summit Anthracite's harvesting of SCP-8987's wood has yielded little result, with Keshner merely expressing repeated contempt for the mine and its workers as a whole.</p>
<p>When Keshner's cabin was searched after his arrest, the following was found within:</p>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>There's a devil in my mine.</p>
<p>It's a trifle keeping the worker's traps shut about it, murmuring of some specter. I figured it bullshit, just some hick ghost stories these mountainfolk were making up to kill time instead of doing their damn work, till I saw it myself. Heard it myself. The thing makes these sick, wet sounds like the men do when the dust gets in their lungs and their time's damn near up.</p>
<p>It stalks the mine, whispers to my men.</p>
<p>I think it's mocking me, whatever it is. Calls itself a "foreman" but has raised nothing but hell. Half the time I catch word of an accident down there, someone brings the thing up. But it's not as some harbinger of death or talk of supernatural attack, no. They speak blasphemy, call it holy.</p>
<p>While it's damaged equipment, it's never laid a hand on those fools. I heard that it was there each time the tunnel detonation's malfunctioned. That it watched and it wept.</p>
<p>Like some patron saint of accidents beneath.</p>
<p>Crock of shit, I'd say. Last report said it was the one at the detonator. Them blasts cost me five men, you know? Five men and good gunpowder.</p>
<p>I've been trying to smoke the thing out on my own for months, but nothing seems to work. Most of the time, it keeps away from me, but I don't think it's outta fear. I have been face-to-face with it though, just a few times. Stare downs in the depths. Warnings exchanged. One of them was recent, too.</p>
<p>Now I try not to be down there often, but every once and a while they need me down there to choose where to keep digging. I was coming down the bend, lower part of the mine, to look for some stable spots, when I heard it coming.</p>
<p>You always hear it coming.</p>
<p>I was white-knuckling my pick by the time it turned the corner, staring at me from the dark. I told the thing to bugger off, that I ought to start salting these grounds, see if that'll finally make something stick. The laugh it gave sounded like a man gargling tar. It drew closer, started up some murmuring about the tunnels, their stability.</p>
<p>So I demanded, "You do something? Have you given up in trying to chase me off my property, decide you're gonna bring this mine down instead?" I don't know if it could, wasn't keen to find out. I've invested too much down here to play with that kind of fire.</p>
<p>It kept coming closer as I started to back away. "There's only you down this path. Maybe nothing else would fall."</p>
<p>I told it that I don't take kindly to threats. That if it kept coming, I'd start hollering, bring others down. "What would you do then? Kill 'em all?"</p>
<p>It did stop, at that. Made that gargling again.</p>
<p>"They ain't the ones deserving."</p>
<p>I swung the pick and struck the stone between our feet. Clanged against the rock so loud I heard it ring through the tunnel three times over.</p>
<p>Then we both went quiet. Me gripping the hilt, it peering down. I stared that devil straight on.</p>
<p>There's something wrong with its eyes. It doesn't have any, yet I could <em>feel</em> it looking back. I just kept staring into those pits of coal in its head till I smelt something burning. Like lamp oil fumes. It made my head spin but I didn't look away, couldn't look away. It was getting louder, in the mine. I could hear men shouting but I couldn't see them. I stood and I stared and I heard that old platform in the shaft give way and the squelching of flesh against stone. Heard wailing rise up from below. Pained mewls and cries and it just got louder and louder till my ears were ringing.</p>
<p>I managed to find my will, throw the pick. Struck the thing's leg, only made it take a step back with a wheeze, but its black magic broke on me and I tore my eyes away.</p>
<p>It gave this wet, gurgling sound, when I finally fled towards the surface. Like something 'tween a chuckle and a cry.</p>
<p>"Don't keep them waiting."</p>

<p><strong>RED CANARY Incident Report</strong><br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 08/07/1966<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> At approximately 18:03, Theodore Keshner managed to escape from personnel while being transported from a temporary holding cell to Site-898. Security lost pursuit of him in the Coalbed Swamp.</p>
<p>The following was captured by CCTV systems placed by Red Brook.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Keshner stumbles out of the foliage, coughing and swearing. The image is poor due to the darkness, but the man appears to be covered in mud and plant matter. He stops to catch his breath, head whipping around, before continuing forward. He stops when he sees Red Brook obstructing his path, squinting in the darkness and out across the water.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> God dammit.</p>
<p><em>His head snaps up when he hears rustling. Keshner grabs a sizable rock from the ground in an attempt to arm himself as he searches for the source. A glow is seen through the swamp's thick brush, growing brighter. The gold light illuminates the camera feed better.</em></p>
<p><em>Keshner tenses as wheezing becomes audible.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 emerges. It holds up an oil lantern, which casts long shadows in the pitch black. Keshner's eyes widen at the sight of it, jumping back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> <em>Jesus Christ—</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 breathes a wet exhale.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> Should watch your tongue. Your Lord ain't the one who's listenin' out here.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> I'm not going to heed the words of a devil like you. <em>[He jabs a finger in SCP-8306's direction.]</em> You've brought hell down upon this place since the moment you crawled out of those depths.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> It was you who opened them gates. This was far more your doing than mine.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> Don't try that with me. You haunt <em>my</em> mine, chase out <em>my</em> men, and lead these bastards right to <em>MY</em> prize! You think I didn't notice your shit? You're awful fond of whistling.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> What makes you think I was trying to be hidden, mm? I'd forgone all subtlety long ago, Theodore.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> It doesn't matter. My bosses are gonna have my head when they find this place got stolen. <em>[He pauses, sneers.]</em> They might wanna have <em>yours</em>, too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> Bah, this place was never yours to keep! What lies 'neath these damned grounds ain't no mortal man's prize. You're looking for some golden goose to rob for riches? All you were gonna find is a monkey's paw.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> If whatever is here's so dangerous, then why lead some other chumps right to it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> Cause they're smarter than your lot. They'll find it. They'll let it lie. They've even smoked you <em>rats</em> outta my mine.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> What if they don't leave it, huh? What if they take it for themselves? Haven't they already?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 lets out a low, wheezing laugh. It has placed its lantern on a nearby rock.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> They may "have" it, but they know they don't own it. The mining work here is done.</p>
<p><em>Keshner scoffs, but he grips the rock in his hands tightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> That mine was worth a fortune and we sunk more so into manpower. If you think my bosses are just gonna lay down and take this shit, you've got a storm coming.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> They'll have a worse storm waiting.</p>
<p><em>Keshner pauses in confusion. He takes a step back from SCP-8306, eyes darting back and forth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> Whatever. Just stay out of my way. I'm getting out of this hellhole.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> One way or another.</p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> What?</p>
<p><em>Without warning, SCP-8306 suddenly lunges forward and tackles Keshner. His back hits the ground and he cries out in pain. He struggles as the entity attempts to pin him to the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Keshner swings the rock, and strikes SCP-8306 in the side of the head with an audible crack. It wheezes and shudders, before attempting to wrestle the makeshift weapon from the man's hands. In the process SCP-8306 presses its knee against Keshner's stomach as it bears down on him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> <em>You bastard—</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 wrenches Keshner's hand down against the dirt, and manages to knock away the rock. The previous strike appears to have broken the entity's nose, and sliced part of its face. Mud oozes from the injuries.</em></p>
<p><em>Keshner's shouting grows in volume as he tries to fight off SCP-8306 to no avail. Its hands have grasped his throat, smudging dirt and mud across his skin.</em></p>
<p><em>Site-898 staff arrive on-scene, led by Chief Zoe Miranda. The members of security burst from the brush and fan out with weapons raised. The clicking of their rifles makes SCP-8306 pause. Keshner gasps in air, as it slightly relents as to straighten and stare. The staff seem startled by SCP-8306's presence; Chief Miranda lowers her weapon slightly.</em></p>
<p><em>A few moments later, Director Julian Eden and Doctor Hellen Gibbs emerge from the swamp. Dir. Eden frantically waves a hand at security.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Hold your fire, <em>hold your fire!</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 makes a sound like stones scraping against one another.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> Please do listen. I have work to be done.</p>
<p><em>Keshner gasps frantically. He turns his head towards the Site personnel with wide eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Do not fire on the anomaly.</p>
<p><em>Chief Miranda narrows her eyes, but nods. She turns to security.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> Secure the perimeter.</p>
<p><em>The security staff continue to tensely fan out. SCP-8306 and Keshner's proximity to the wide brook renders the group unable to fully surround them.</em></p>
<p><em>Keshner cries to the staff for help as he struggles.</em></p>
<p><em>Chief Miranda looks to Dir. Eden.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> None of us have containment equipment, sir. We have no way of removing SCP-8306 without utilizing force.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> In a perfect world, we avoid that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gibbs:</strong> I don't think there's going to be any talking it down.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> We could try—</p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 jerks its head over its shoulder and makes eye contact with Dir. Eden. The man freezes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8306:</strong> Leave me to finish. You've gotten no blood from this stone, but <em>I</em> shall.</p>
<p><em>Another sound, shrieking metal. SCP-8306's lantern falls from the stone and strikes the ground, glass and lamp oil exploding against the dirt. Fire surges into the night air.</em></p>
<p><em>The act scatters the Site personnel as they move away from the burning oil. The grass is too damp to catch aflame, but the oil has made a line of fire nonetheless. Dir. Eden does not flinch nor move as the burning oil splashes barely a meter away from him. He stares at SCP-8306 through the growing flames.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 maintains eye contact with him for a few moments longer, before jerking its head back to Keshner. Only then does Dir. Eden stumble back with a gasp, disoriented as he breaks from his trance.</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dr. Gibbs braces a hand against him with alarm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> I think that's just about the only warning that thing's gonna give us—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gibbs:</strong> Then what the hell are we doing? Just letting him die?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Hold.</p>
<p><em>Dir. Eden wheezes, out of breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gibbs:</strong> Eden?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Do not engage.</p>
<p><em>Keshner jerks his head, having since managed to pry one of SCP-8306's hands from his throat. The man grunts and kicks at SCP-8306, his foot makes a hollow thud against its chest. The anomaly breaks down into a fit of vicious coughs and gags.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keshner:</strong> ARE YOU CRAZY? GET IT OFF ME! GET I—</p>
<p><em>He's cut off by a spurt of coal-stained mud splattering against his face. The substance begins to pour from the orifices in SCP-8306's face in a continuous flow. Keshner chokes as it fills his nose and mouth. He gargles on the thick mud while clawing at SCP-8306, its hands curl around his throat once more.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Gibbs takes a step back with a gasp.</em></p>
<p><em>Keshner gags, spitting up mud and bile. It stains his clothes black and soaks the ground he's sprawled on. The mud is in his eyes. SCP-8306 is motionless above him, leaned over his face. It does not appear to be breathing.</em></p>
<p><em>Chief Miranda glances to Dir. Eden, who stares at the scene unfolding with wide eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> It's going to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> We can't stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> Can't or <em>shouldn't?</em></p>
<p><em>Choking is audible in the background.</em></p>
<p><em>Dir. Eden does not respond. He is trembling.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 continues to strangle Keshner for approximately two minutes. The man's throat becomes bruised and his head coated in dark mud, tears mixed with dirt and blood and spit as he squirms in the marsh. By the time the man has gone still, the fire has died down. Oil hisses and bubbles against the cold air.</em></p>
<p><em>When SCP-8306 rises to its feet, the security staff raise their weapons again. Dir. Eden winces at the act, but watches. He avoids SCP-8306's eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>The entity stares at them, and does not speak. It wheezes heavily for several moments. Weapons remain raised.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8306 grabs the unconscious Keshner by the collar, and drags him into the brook.</em></p>
<p><em>The Site-898 staff do not interfere.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End Recording&gt;</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Two days later, Site-898 would experience minor power fluctuations. Investigation into the Site's hydroelectric plant would find that several of the turbines were clogged with human remains.</p>
