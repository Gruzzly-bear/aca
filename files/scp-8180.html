<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the difficulty surrounding complete erasure of relevant information regarding individuals who possess SCP-8180, impacted subjects should be monitored for progressive deterioration via common indicators that typically develop. Given the self-corrective nature of the anomaly, majority of cases do not require Foundation intervention. Nevertheless, personnel assigned to the study of SCP-8180 should remain vigilant. Veil-harmful content is to be taken down upon detection. Replacement of content wholesale should only be permitted as a last resort, when absence of such content is deemed detrimental to Veil operations.</p>
<p>Actors used to replace those represented in affected media are to be given daily psychological evaluations, with any adverse results being immediately reported to SCP-8180's project lead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8180 is the designation given to a collection of behavioral phenomena affecting approximately 0.01% of content creators on the video sharing platform YouTube.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-8180 behaviors do not always develop in creators that fit the criteria outlined in supplementary documentation, however, a significant trend suggests prolonged exposure to the platform and its audience compounds the likelihood these behaviors will develop. Often, SCP-8180-afflicted individuals experience symptomatic progression of adverse mannerisms to a level of severity in which counterproductive anomalous effects hinder the ability to maintain consistent content creation—<em>See attached observations.</em> Similarly, personal desire to produce videos free of these counterproductive effects diminishes over time, further complicating internal struggles through the emergent ideological shifts that usually occur.</p>
<p>Roughly 82% of impacted creators cease or greatly reduce their online presence upon being afflicted with SCP-8180. Study of individuals that maintain a semi-stable brand image despite ongoing developmental disadvantages are of great interest to the Foundation, and are to be observed in perpetuity until such time that significant indicators of Veil-threatening effects are observed. More info can be found below.</p>

<p><strong>Preface:</strong> PoI-8180 is a notable member of the YouTube community, and as such exhibits a predisposition to SCP-8180-related phenomena. However, a case study of PoI-8180's progression revealed a remarkable deviation from typically observed cases, mostly in the form of a complete absence of effective self-inhibition, bolstered by extreme wealth.</p>
<p>Audits and interviews with PoI-8180 suggest that, due to a substantial core fanbase,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> PoI-8180 is able to produce content containing adverse behavior without risk of losing the income necessary to do so.</p>
<p>A brief list of impacted videos, and summaries of their contents has been compiled for reference:</p>

<td colspan="2"><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <tt>PoI-8180 holds a "blindfold challenge", wherein five of his friends have their vision restricted until they encounter various barriers (both physical and figurative), contact with which ultimately concludes the challenge. Each individual is monetarily incentivized by PoI-8180 to keep their blindfolds on in hazardous scenarios such as driving and preparing elaborate food dishes. Minor injuries are sustained by two of the five contestants.</tt></td>

Upon conclusion of the challenge, PoI-8180 exhibited pronounced disappointment and annoyance.</tt></td>

<td colspan="2"><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <tt>PoI-8180 transports regulars and his camera crew to the outskirts of Kenya, where communities suffer from poor water conditions. The group proceeds to oversee construction of one hundred wells in the surrounding area, over into Nairiri. Constructed wells pull typically inaccessible, potable groundwater upwards for civilian use. PoI-8180 is markedly dismayed that large machinery would be used to bore holes, which immediately necessitate infrastructure to preserve contents. Individual was not present for most of the filming process. According to eyewitness accounts, PoI-8180 spent majority of this time attempting to bore his own holes with hand tools, but found the fruits of his labor underwhelming.</tt></td>

Unfortunately, the presence of the camera crew appears to cause PoI-8180 moderate discomfort, which he claims is due to the simulated challenge not being "realistic" enough, given the presence of others and the included food catering services.</tt></td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <tt>PoI-8180 is filming himself, alone in his backyard, where he takes the next several hours to dig a hole large enough to fit a coffin. Piloting a small rental crane, PoI-8180 directs the coffin above the space, lowering it down wordlessly. He is seen towing the conveyor belt from VIDEO #0785 into frame, where he begins piling the displaced soil created from his previous efforts. After another hour, subject appears satisfied. He then activates the belt and walks quickly over to the hole, lowering himself down into the space and out of view. A moment later, he is seen popping back up and quickly climbing out, signing off in front of the camera before scrambling back down and disappearing once more. A short while later, soil is loosely deposited into his gravesite by the converyor belt. PoI-8180 is not seen until the end of the video. The interim is spent as a timelapse of the next week, capturing the discovery of his camera and status by his colleaugues, who react with approapriate alarm, calling emergency services shortly thereafter. PoI-8180 is recovered without issue, who plays off his actions as an extreme stunt and a "survival challenge" similar to those described previously.</tt></td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <tt>This video possesses similar themes compared to the previous, but is produced in a way that suggests crew members and friends are aware of and are helping facilitate PoI-8180's burial. Subject agrees to take camcorder with him and wear a chest-mounted body camera. Video contains a truncated series of clips and interviews with friends and crew members, as PoI-8180 is noncommunicative for majority of this period, only talking in short bursts to the camera while spending most of his time asleep or exhibiting symptoms similar to catatonia. At the end of a 30-day period, he is exhumed once more without complication. While noticably thinner and pale in complexion, neither the subject nor his constituents acknowledge PoI-8180's absent need for oxygen, water, or food. Observations from eyewitness testimony suggest PoI-8180's visage improved in the days following the posting of a produced final product.</tt></td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> <tt>PoI-8180 decides to hold a philanthropic solo challenge in which he will donate one thousand dollars to charity for each day he is able to spend buried without impediment. Friends of PoI-8180 exhibit atypical behaviors as well, filming a funeral service in his honor post-interment as content for their own channels, and remaining dressed in funerary attire for the entirety of the time spent on camera. Subject is unclear about which charitable organization would be receiving these donations, however, recovered correspondences between PoI-8180's legal team and a representative of the <a href="/manna-charitable-foundation-hub">Manna Charitable Foundation</a> have raised suspicions regarding their potential involvement.</tt></td>

<p><em>WIth the addition of mild amnestic sigils embedded within the broadcast, PoI-8180's monitoring and containment efforts are entirely self-maintained at this point. Daily ad revenue and paid "superchats" accrued from viewers of the live feed have increased steadily since the stream's inception, thus PoI-8180 has been allowed to remain in this state until this is no longer the case.</em></p>
