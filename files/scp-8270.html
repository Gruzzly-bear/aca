            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8270</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8270 is to be contained in transparent containers in a sterile forensic research lab at Site-██. Personnel must decontaminate their hands before and after handling SCP-8270. SCP-8270 should only be handled with latex or nitrile gloves. If any instances of SCP-8270 are found, personnel are to report to the on-site HMCL supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8270 is a collection of 157 human teeth. The teeth have so far been discovered in unusual locations in and around Site-██. None have sustained any damage from the locations they were found in.</p>
<p>New teeth are discovered approximately 1-3 times per week. Forensic analysis is in progress — results can be found below.</p>

<tr>
<th>Tooth #</th>
<th>Location</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Inside a vending machine’s coin return tray.</td>
<td>Small incisor. Minor discoloration near the gum.</td>
<td>Likely caused by excessive coffee or tea consumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ejected from a paper shredder.</td>
<td>Molar. Slight wear along the biting surface.</td>
<td>Tooth may have been subjected to higher-than-normal pressure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Floating in a mug of coffee.</td>
<td>Bicuspid. Erosion near base. Mild crack on left side. Stains near crack.</td>
<td>Crack is likely the result of external trauma. Stains are probably from dark liquids (e.g., wine).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Trapped in the center of a numeric keypad button.</td>
<td>Small wisdom tooth. Faint marks near roots.</td>
<td>Marks near the roots could be signs of trauma, possibly from an infection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Discovered inside SCP-███'s containment cell.</td>
<td>Bicuspid. Signs of having been extracted under abnormal circumstances. Surrounding tissue is absent.</td>
<td>Lack of surrounding tissue suggests sourcing from a cadaver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Inside a soil sample from the greenhouse.</td>
<td>Large front incisor, filed down in front. Discoloration present near filing.</td>
<td>Filing seems to be intentional and post-mortem. Discoloration appears to not be from food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Lodged within an air duct.</td>
<td>Molar. Significant damage around the edge. Likely sustained a forceful impact.</td>
<td>Impact likely caused the tooth to be dislodged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Enbedded in wall insulation.</td>
<td>Bicuspid. Radial fractures present. Coating of dried blood along the edges.</td>
<td>Fractures and blood suggest direct blunt-force trauma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Inside the intercom.</td>
<td>Upper molar. Stained with dirt and blood. Root is partially exposed.</td>
<td>Appears to have been violently extracted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Suspended within the zero-gravity unit.</td>
<td>Molar. Significant chipping along the edges.</td>
<td>Damage suggests a violent and prolonged struggle, possibly involving restraints or forceful restraint during the time of injury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Within a human cadaver's stomach.</td>
<td>Small canine. Traces of dirt are present.</td>
<td>Analysis of the soil reveals that the tooth was sourced from Fairvale, WV, a town near Site-██.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Suspended in a beaker of anomalous gel.</td>
<td>Half of an incisor. Appears to be snapped in half by blunt force.</td>
<td>Damage was likely the result of a forceful extraction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Embedded within a meal from the site canteen.</td>
<td>Incisor. Series of unusual marks, including faint burn scars, signs of blood under the enamel, and a visible fracture.</td>
<td>Analysis of blood suggests the tooth was also sourced from Fairvale, and dates back to the 1980s.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Stitched into a researcher's skin.</td>
<td>Large molar. Roots fractured as though forcibly extracted. Base is stained red.</td>
<td>Evidence suggests the tooth was recovered from a site linked to the disappearances of 14 individuals in Fairvale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Growing out of a D-Class's eye.</td>
<td>Molar. Charred along the crown, root missing. Engraved with the initials "R.S."</td>
<td>Engraving appears to have been done post-mortem, using a precision dental drill. Similar soil signature to instances #041 and #130. Forensic analysis matches missing persons records from 1984 — identified as R████ S████, age 12, a resident of Fairvale, WV.</td>
