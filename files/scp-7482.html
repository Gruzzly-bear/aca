<p>SCP-7482</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7482</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7482 is to be kept in the archives of Site-██. Access is to be restricted to staff with Clearance Level 5/7482.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7482 is a Commodore SuperPET SP9000 computer that has collected data from all electronic devices on Earth since January 1st, 1984. Access to this data is only possible by creating queries in custom FORTRAN code, and requires knowledge of the esoteric data structures it uses. Research is ongoing to expand Foundation understanding of these data structures; with those currently known, anomaly identification and containment have increased by 15%.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7482.2</strong> Ethics Review 7482-4193</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> SCP-7482 Misuse by Dr. Lucien Niccol<br/>
<strong>REPORTING OFFICER:</strong> Alicia Harrow, Ethics Liaison (Site-██)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>An ethics review of SCP-7482 handling was conducted on ██/██/██. It was discovered that Dr. Niccol's research queries had focused exclusively on a single civilian subject: Emily Hayden, ex-wife of Dr. Niccol. Additionally, Dr. Niccol was discovered to have acted on data recovered from this program, without approval, in a campaign of stalking and revenge against his ex-wife. The following are considered by the Ethics Committee to be the most serious actions taken by Dr. Niccol:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stole Emily's credit card info to purchase and deliver abortifacient medication to her while she was mid-coitus.</li>
<li>Obtained codes to her home security system and entry lock to facilitate breaking and entering, where he destroyed her property and left a threatening note and an STD test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Niccol has been placed on administrative leave, pending formal action.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended disciplinary action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent removal from the SCP-7482 project</li>
<li>Full psychological evaluation</li>
<li>Revocation of Clearance Level 5/7482</li>
<li>Amnestic application to remove knowledge of the project and all data he has recovered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>O5 OVERRIDE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authorization:</strong> O5-1</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Dr. Niccol is too valuable to our efforts with SCP-7482. Replacing his knowledge of the anomaly's data structures would set us back by an unacceptable amount of time. The research Dr. Niccol performed to get Ms. Hayden's data has proven the effectiveness of the SCP-7482 program. Dock his pay, but he will be permitted to continue with the project.</p>
