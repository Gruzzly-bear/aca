            <h1>SCP-525</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-525</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Outside of testing conditions, the individual components of SCP-525 must be stored in separate sealed containers. No more than six components may be stored in the same room or within 15 meters of each other. All currently-existing components are accounted for at Storage Site-23 in lockers ██ to ██.</p>
<p>Only Class D personnel are authorized to handle SCP-525. All supervising staff must wear protective eyewear during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-525 consists of multiple disjoined arthropod legs, 10-15 cm in length. DNA identification has been inconclusive, but the closest match so far is to the brown recluse spider <em>Loxosceles reclusa</em>. The base of each leg ends in several minute hooks capable of perforating flesh. SCP-525 is covered in short, fine hairs, and is quite brittle.</p>
<p>When alone or in proximity with fewer than six others, SCP-525 is inert. When eight components of SCP-525 are brought within range of each other (approx. 0.6m), the legs will immediately crawl into a group and attach themselves into a single entity, referred to as 525-1. At this stage, the speed of its locomotion greatly increases, and it will attempt to make contact with the closest human or similar (see Addendum #525-A).</p>
<p>When a suitable animal is found, 525-1 will climb directly towards the animal's eye. Having centered itself over a socket, four legs will secure the eyelid while the others extract the eye. Despite 525-1's rapid movements, extreme care is taken not to damage the eye during the extraction, [DATA EXPUNGED] severing the optic nerves and central retinal vein. Once the eye is free from the original owner's socket, 525-1 will implant the base of each leg into the eye. Close inspection shows that the hooks at the base extend, effectively rooting the leg in position.</p>
<p>If allowed to remain, 525-1 will lay what appear to be eggs in the socket of its host before climbing off (see Document #525-A).</p>
<p>When in possession of an eye, 525-1 is no longer hostile and its movement is somewhat impeded. Curiously, 525-1 does not respond to visual stimuli, suggesting that it does not use the eye for sight. Dissection of a chimpanzee eye taken by 525-1 and retained for a period of one week revealed the formation of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Over time, the eye dehydrates, eventually turning the same reddish colour as SCP-525. After 2-3 weeks, 525-1 will abandon the eye and begin to search for another.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #525-A</strong>: 525 responds to most large- to moderate-sized mammals. Reptiles, fish, and birds have provoked little response. When exposed to <em>Crocodylus acutus</em>, 525-1 attempted extraction, managing to blind the animal but otherwise failing. Thereafter, all instances of 525 have not responded to crocodiles, even those not present at the initial experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Document #525-A</strong>: Observation log of Subject D-1548 after exposure to 525-1. Report compiled by Dr. Weiss, dated ██/██/20██.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Medical staff on hand attend to D-1548. Fourteen ovoids resembling opaque toad eggs discovered embedded in the extraocular muscles. Three are removed and sent to the research lab. D-1548 placed under quarantine.</li>
<li><strong>Week 2</strong>: D-1548's injury is healing as normal. Eggs show marginal swelling. D-1548 does not display unusual discomfort. Eggs stored in the lab have deliquesced.</li>
<li><strong>Week 3</strong>: D-1548 complains of increasing "phantom pressure" in the socket. D-1548 demands a mirror to inspect the injury (request denied). Muscle tissue has healed over and obscured the eggs.</li>
<li><strong>Week 4</strong>: D-1548 forcefully removes bandages and attempts to dig into the socket; is successfully restrained. 24 days after initial exposure, eleven fully-formed components of SCP-525 erupt from D-1548's socket and begin to coalesce [DATA EXPUNGED]</li>
