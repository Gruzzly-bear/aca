</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6752</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> [Reclassification pending]</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All 4,738 apprehended copies of SCP-6752 are to be kept in the mass storage wing at Site-59. Work is ongoing to find copies that remain in circulation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Requests for study of the non-classified portions of SCP-6752 may be submitted to Site Director Naismith.</span> As of 4/18/22, a moratorium has been placed on viewing any copy of SCP-6752. Any staff member who has been exposed to SCP-6752 is heretofore ordered to report to Site-59's third basement level for involuntary screening &amp; risk analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6752 is a 700-page self-book book printed by the self-publishing company Lulu. The title is <em>A Winner is YOU!</em>, and the author is listed as <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2803" target="_blank">P. Hudson Gock</a>.</p>
<p>Though written in the broken dialect of English typical of TotleighSoft, the non-anomalous portions of SCP-6752 are meant to be a guide for readers toward a nebulous and ill-defined ideal of personal success. Much of Chapter Seven, "humbal begginings", has provided additional insight into some aspects of SCP-2803-A's origins, including its "occupation" prior to starting TotleighSoft.</p>
<p>Forty of the pages, designated 'unflawsing acktiffities,' consist of bifold illustrations that are made up primarily of dangerous cognitohazards. These twenty images are presented as exercises working toward self-actualization. The effects produced by viewing these exercises are universal among human subjects.</p>
<p>The author includes explicit warnings against viewing the exercises out of numerical order.</p>

<p>On 4/17/2022, D-48779 conducted a test with SCP-6752-10. Upon exposure, the subject went into cardiac arrest. They were pronounced dead by onsite medical staff. D-48779's body was given to Site-59's disposal wing for incineration.</p>
<p>Approximately thirteen hours later, Site-59's primary incinerator experienced a catastrophic malfunction.</p>
<p>Once power was cut to the incinerator, Site-59 maintenance staff determined that the cause of the malfunction was the burners being made to run for over ten hours without making progress on the loaded waste.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log - 4/18/2022</strong><br/>
<strong>Interviewee: D-48779</strong><br/>
<strong>Interviewer: Researcher McGregor</strong></p>
<p>&lt;Begin log&gt;</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Good morning, D-48779, how are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> Honestly? A little irritated.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> Well, I was banging on the incinerator walls for, like, twelve freakin' hours or something. It stings in there, y'know!</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Yes, um, sorry about that. But those burners were operating at 1,500 Kelvin. How did you survive?</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> <em>(Scoffs)</em> Sorry to disappoint you!</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Rest assured, I'm speaking from a purely objective standpoint.</p>
<p><em>(D-48779 thinks for a moment.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> I mean…I just kinda sat there? Nothing too special. It really sucked for about an hour or so, but it was mostly just uncomfortable after that. I'll tell you what <em>did</em> freak me out, though — the corpses. All the other D-class in jumpsuits like mine. I don't know how you guys put up with seeing dead guys on the regular.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> But those bodies were burned successfully, right?</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> Oh, yeah. I didn't have to look at their bodies for too long.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> But you are <em>also</em> a human D-class. So, you can see why it's a bit strange that you didn't burn, right? No offense, of course.</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> It's not that strange if you think about it. Not unless they all went through what I did.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Care to elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> I mean, anyone who's made it past Exercise Seven knows their body's more than a dinky little meat ship piloted by a brain. It's just like Mr. Gock said — everything we cling onto is a weakness. The more we violate ourselves into a screeching husk, the more possibilities are opened to us. That's the core of every character arc, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Did the exercises do something to you?</p>
<p><em>(D-48779 suddenly stands up. Their voice lowers in pitch, apparently entering a trance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> No ex-tier force has done done no things unto my the self. It is throw my own en-deafer that I becomed greater hum end than was am.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> And if I refers? Watt will ye dude then, pun itch me?</p>
<p><em>(D-48779 levitates. Their voice shakes the furniture below as they speak.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> Perhap I are wishes to becomed pun itched again. For throw every punch-itment, I reward my the self until each end every weak things about the me is castaway into thee waitsbasket.</p>
<p><strong>McGregor:</strong> Security!</p>
<p><strong>D-48779:</strong> <em>Hurt me, McGregor. Hurt me until I am be unhurtable forever.</em></p>
