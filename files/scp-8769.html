<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation webcrawlers have been programmed to search all major dating applications for signs of SCP-8769. If a flagged account meets the predetermined criteria, it is to be catalogued and immediately deleted. All attempts to track the I.P. addresses of SCP-8769-created accounts have proven unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Foundation agents implanted within local police forces and media centres are to catalogue and cover instances of SCP-8769 as standard cases of random violence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8769 is a hostile entity/group of entities/force that utilises online dating apps and forums to prey on humans. Whilst the exact conditions for an individual to be targeted by SCP-8769 are unknown, all confirmed victims have met the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual is between the ages of 18 and 25.</li>
<li>Individual has a low number of significant in-person relationships.</li>
<li>Individual lives in or near a major metropolitan area.</li>
<li>Individual does not have a full-time job.</li>
<li>Individual has a low number of matches with other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an individual has been targeted by SCP-8769, they will be overcome by an anomalous effect causing them to dismiss any and all behaviour that may have previously been seen as unusual or off-putting. Following a brief period of talking, typically ranging between 1 and 3 days, SCP-8769 will propose to meet in person at a nearby location. As of writing, this has been shown to have a 100% success rate.</p>
<p>During their journey, the victim will experience a drastic increase in anomalous phenomena within their general vicinity, seemingly attempting to obstruct them from reaching the agreed upon location. Due to the previously mentioned effect, the individual will be completely oblivious to this. As of writing, no individuals have been prevented from meeting with an SCP-8769 instance.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8769.1:</strong> Discovery</p>
<p>The first recorded instance of SCP-8769 occurred on 17/08/2023, where it targeted Mason Jordans, a 21-year-old university student from London, England. Jordans was previously noted as a person of interest, due to being a prolific poster on the Parawatch forums. Because of this, Foundation operatives were able to monitor his activity using hidden tracking software installed on his phone.</p>
<p>A log of the events leading upto Jordans' encounter with SCP-8769 can be read below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Event Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17/08/2023</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Prior to this event, Jordans had spent the past two days communicating with a confirmed SCP-8769 instance, masquerading as a young woman by the name of "Kim Wallis" on the app Tinder. The two had previously agreed to watch a film together at a Vue cinema in Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>The following log was taken from a combination of mobile activity tracking software and CCTV footage.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[Begin Log]</p>
<p><strong>16:52</strong> - Jordans leaves his home. He messages the SCP-8769 account, "onw". The account responds with an emoji of a thumbs up.</p>
<p><strong>17:02</strong> - A large tree branch suddenly falls metres in front of Jordans, caving in the roof of a nearby car and setting off its alarm. Jordans does not react, simply stepping over the branch.</p>
<p><strong>17:08</strong> - Jordans waits at a road crossing. The traffic lights take a significantly longer amount of time to change than per usual, however Jordans does not seem to notice, simply staring blankly in front of him. When the light eventually does turn red, it begins rapidly flashing, spelling out "TURNBACK" in Morse Code.</p>
<p><strong>17:12</strong> - A spectral entity, resembling a figure in a black hood, manifests behind Jordans and follows him as he enters the tube station. Jordans pulls out his phone and checks his messages as he takes the lift, completely unaware of the figure, now standing directly in front of him. The figure dematerialises as he exits the lift.</p>
<p><strong>17:15</strong> - As Jordans approaches the Elizabeth Line platform, a female busker stops halfway through her performance and begins to sing "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" in a voice much deeper than what should be physically possible. A large crowd begins to gather around the busker, which Jordans walks around.</p>
<p><strong>17:17</strong> - Jordans continues to scroll on his phone as he waits on an empty platform. In place of the typical schedule, the arrival board simply lists the word "death" repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>17:24</strong> - Jordans spend the majority of the train journey scrolling through the Parawatch website, eventually settling on a thread of posts made by user '13thdoctorsupremacy'. The lights of the train go dark numerous times throughout the journey; each time they come back on, the other passengers are stood in different positions to how they were previously. At one point, all passengers lie limp on the ground with pools of red liquid gathering across the floor. Jordans remains oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>17:40</strong> - Jordans steps off the tube and begins to walk down the platform. All other commuters, both on and off the train, stand completely still, watching him as he approaches the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>17:45</strong> - As Jordans ascends the escalator to the station entrance, all advertisement screens change to display a video of a figure resembling Jordans, hanging from the ceiling of a dimly lit room. Other commuters express confusion and disturbance, however Jordans takes no notice.</p>
<p><strong>17:46</strong> - A figure resembling an older man in a back suit suddenly appears out of an employees-only area and attempts to block Jordans' path as he goes through the barriers; analysis of CCTV footage revealed the man to not have a mouth. Jordans does not acknowledge the man, simply pushing past him. The man seems to hang his head in defeat before melting into the floor.</p>
<p><strong>17:47</strong> - Jordans stands by the station entrance. He messages the words "I'm here" to the SCP-8769 account. After two minutes, the account responds with "Look behind you ;)" Jordans begins to turn, and at this moment all devices capable of recording audio or video within a 50m radius experience a simultaneous loss of power.</p>
<p>[End Log]</p>
</div>
<p>Jordans' body was found discarded in a nearby alleyway two hours later, decapitated and drained of all blood. As of writing, SCP-8769 is believed to have been the cause of an upwards of 3200 deaths since its initial discovery.</p>
