</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8327</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two MTF Alpha-2 ("Cave Divers'') are to be stationed inside the cave housing SCP-8327 on rotation every three hours, with the remaining MTF on patrol outside SCP-8327 cave opening, sensors are to be placed at the perimeter of SCP-8327 containment area on land half a mile diameter from the entrance of the cave and underwater along the coastal area near the collapsed sea entrance. Visual confirmation of SCP-8327 is to be checked every two hours before a rotation of guards can occur; underwater cameras have proven an ineffective means of surveillance. Site-16 will not supply any more drones, due to the cost of lost and damaged equipment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: As of the incident that occurred on 2/19/20██ at Outpost 16-1 all samples of SCP-8327 will need to be approved by Site-16 before being taken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8327 is a humanoid entity bearing traits consistent with the descriptions of merfolk from mythological records, as confirmed by Dr. James Kegans and Dr. Auther Baker. It measures approximately 1.8 meters in length and weighs an estimated 55 kilograms. Its physiology is predominantly humanoid from the waist up, with webbed appendages and gills on both sides of its neck. Its hair is white and mid-back length. SCP-8327 possesses pale skin with the lower half resembling that of marine life, displaying a pink hue and ending in a caudal fin. Notably, SCP-8327 appears to exhibit signs of malnutrition or undernourishment, likely endured over an extended period.</p>
<p>SCP-8327 is located in a cave off the coast of Texas, 20 miles from the nearest coastal city and 2.5 miles from the nearest public road, in a remote uninhabited area. SCP-8327 resides in a large domed cave, filled with stalactites and several large stalagmites scattered around the cave both in the water and near a dry upper area. There are no entrances to the cave, except for a hole measuring 7 meters across, at the crown of the cave. The height of the domed ceiling reaches 120 ft high from the surface of the water, while the water is 200 ft at its deepest area in the central chamber and averages 5 ft at its most shallow areas, near the southeast side accompanied by dry ground. A large rock protrudes near the center of the cave directly under the entrance, surrounded by water.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Information:</strong> SCP-8327 was discovered by local divers mapping the coastal region. While surveying the coast they discovered the submerged and collapsed entrance to SCP-8327 cave. Later when revisiting the area the explorers discovered the entrance to the cave 13 meters north of the underwater entrance. The group recorded their descent into the cave, once inside the group soon realized they were not alone. Footage shows SCP-8327 lurking around the surface of the water. The group quickly decided to leave and reported the incident to the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department, the Foundation was alerted and quickly took over, setting up Outpost 16-1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The land and area surrounding SCP-8327 stretching a mile radius was owned and maintained by a small international company, Endlings Int © ™ since 1992. The Foundation reached out to acquire the land through a front company at market price but was unable to come to an agreement. The Foundation turned to the US government to use eminent domain to acquire the land. Nothing has been heard from the company about the land since the Foundation acquired it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samples of SCP-8327 cave water taken in for testing showed that the cave water is distinctly different from the surrounding seawater. Core samples show that the mineral composition of the cave and surrounding rock contain unknown combinations of elements creating the unique water in the cave. It is suspected that SCP-8327 species biology has adapted to the cave over centuries, evolving along with certain plants that have evolved differently than the outside marine flora. Near the southern side of the cave inside resides a collapsed entrance, sealing the cave from the sea, matching the outside under the sea. The cave entrance is suspected to have collapsed around 40,000 years ago sealing the cave off from the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Log:</strong> SCP-8327 was tranquilized and brought to the shallow area, near the shore to be monitored in a tank filled with SCP-8327 cave water, while MTF Alpha-1 ("Cave Divers") ventured into the cave's upper underwater section. The team commenced mapping the cave using lidar technology in an attempt to penetrate through the rock. However, the scans proved inconclusive due to the thickness of the surrounding rock.</p>
<p>Upon entering the water, the divers circled the primary cave, mapping and recording the main underwater area. The initial section revealed a sprawling expanse filled with schools of fish, which they mapped as they progressed. Subsequently, they descended further into the cave, exploring its various other sections, eventually reaching a deeper opening.</p>
<p>In the first expansive chamber once leaving the primary cave, they encountered a large cave filled with a plethora of long seaweed-like plants that lined the walls of the chamber and a diverse array of fish, many utilizing bioluminescence. This chamber boasted two additional chambers branching off, flanking the cave's sides.</p>
<p>To the left, another chamber unfolded, revealing a vast space covered in a soft, squishy moss. Along the walls, there were indentations measuring 6 meters deep and 4 meters wide, approximately 30 in total. Dr. Pearl, the lead researcher for SCP-8327 believes this area served as a sleeping area for SCP-8327 pod.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Once this area had been completely explored the team moved on to the last section.</p>
<p>Beneath, they discovered a narrow medium-sized passageway opposite the sleeping chamber extending for 10 meters before abruptly dropping 90 degrees into a dark abyss. Two MTFs were sent in one at a time with lights. After swimming down they discovered the floor housing an eerie assembly of bones and skeletons resembling SCP-8327, researchers believe this is a makeshift graveyard for the dead. Several bone fragments were taken at different levels of the pile. The diving team returned to the surface, the fragments were analyzed the oldest bone fragments currently tested date back to 42,069 years old while the youngest dating bones were dated to 21 years old.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Pearl</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview with SCP-8327, [Subject's speech invariably pauses every few words]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, am&gt;</strong></p>
<p>(Dr. Pearl arrives in the cavern and calls for SCP-8327 at the water's edge, SCP-8327 approaches and stops wading in the water in front of Dr. Pearl)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Hello SCP-8327, good afternoon, how is the water today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Hello… the water is fine …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> I wanted to ask you some questions. Would you mind answering?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Ok….</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Let's begin with where you come from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> I come from here (SCP-8327 looks around at the cave)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> You originated from this cave?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> I did… this is my home…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Are you the only one here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Yes… For a while… Once there were many… Now only me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> What happened to the others like you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Hunger… This cave… Only provides so much.</p>
<p>[SCP-8327took a long pause, turning its head to look at the cave before turning to Dr. Pearl]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> I’m the only one left… the last to go was my mother… she's with the others…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Oh I'm sorry to hear, it must be tough being alone here.</p>
<p>[SCP-8327 nods at Dr. Pearl]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Do you know what the sea is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> My mother… she spoke the tales of the ocean… passed down… when our people resided there… the food plentiful and we were free… but that was long ago.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Do you know of any way out of this cave?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> (Thinking for a moment) The elders before they passed… told of a way outside… but connected to the sea no more… after the world shook.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> What is your primary food?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Hardly anything to hunt in here… everyone farmed fish or collected…. small animals but mostly the kelp… and the sky worms when in abundance … father taught me to spear. He was taught by his father … and so on … he went away before mother.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Can you sing? It's thought that your people can sing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8327:</strong> Yes all could sing … (ethereal song begins for a moment then stops)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl</strong> Thank you SCP-8327, I think that will conclude today's interview.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, pm&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-8327 exhibits a limited vocabulary most likely due to being in isolation for a long period since the death of its parents and pod, along with a lack of social skills leading to increased anxious behavior and pauses in speech.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>Incident 1 Summary:</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>On 2/19/20██ the second day of a three-day tropical storm approaching from the Caribbean, at 10:30 pm Outpost 16-1 lost contact with Foundation Site-16 for a period of 6 minutes, before being re-established. At 10:45 pm MTF permitted guards reported hearing what was believed to be a helicopter pass overhead during the storm, no visual confirmation or sensors were tripped during this time. At 10:52 pm MTF patrolling encountered two unknown agents in tactical gear near the perimeter. Both men were quickly surrounded and subdued, taken into Foundation custody.</p>
<p>Outpost 16-1 contacted Site-16 to report the incident and requested the pickup of the two men to be transferred to Site-16 for investigation. Foundation Site-16 responded and confirmed, with orders to hold the area until Foundation agents arrive for pickup and to collect samples of SCP-8327 Site-16 will add additional MTF to the Containment site, for future security, shortly after.</p>
<p>The next day at 2:34 am help from Site-16 arrived, by van, at the SCP-8327 containment site perimeter ahead of their expected arrival time. Two researchers and four MTFs arrived, and each badge was scanned and cleared. The two scientists were accompanied to SCP-8327 while the MTF were brought to the prisoners where they were escorted to the van. At 2:45 am they arrived at the entrance to SCP-8327 and lowered down into the cave. SCP-8327 was called to the surface and was tranquilized and brought over to the shallow shore inside the cave. Samples of SCP-8327 skin, blood, and other fluids were extracted before being pushed and released back. At 3:05 am the van left the perimeter of Outpost 16-1, with both men in their custody.</p>
<p>Shortly following the Outpost 16-1 communication system experienced another glitch then static, followed by communications sent from Site-16 reporting that Outpost 16-1 had not reported in for the last five hours and that MTF Beta-3 ("Far Reach") had been sent to assess what had happened to the Outpost 16-1. Outpost 16-1 staff were left confused until the Foundation arrived, procedures dictate that the Site is to stop all testing and remain in lockdown until further instructions. 30 minutes later MTF Beta-3 ("Far Reach") arrived and secured the Outpost 16-1 and SCP-8327.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Pearl</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Randy Berryhill</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> After incident interview with lead researcher Dr. Pearl</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, [7 am]&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Can you please state your name for the Record?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> My name is Dr. Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Thank you, now can you help me understand exactly what occurred earlier tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Again with this, we already told you what happened it's all documented in our reports and logs.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Yes, raging storms, communications glitching, multiple perimeter breaches, unauthorized access to the anomaly, samples stolen… All documented, this doesn’t look good from any angle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Whoever it was they knew what they were doing, said, and did all the right things. All their badges checked out at the gate when they scanned in.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Well actually all their badge numbers were real, except for the fact that they belonged to Foundation researchers and MTF agents that were deceased, their badges were reactivated last week.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Wait, how was this not flagged?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Well, there aren’t any automated programs in place that are triggered when this happens, but I'll tell you this, there sure as hell will be now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> What about the communication equipment malfunctioning, Outpost 16-1 reported in on time during that time to Site-16 with confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> That's the funny thing, Site-16 hadn't heard back from the containment site until 3:12 am, most likely there was someone else nearby hacking into the communication network, pretending to be Site-16.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Are you fucking kidding me!?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> Nope well, thank you for your time. The Foundation will be back in contact with you soon regarding going further with SCP-8327.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pearl:</strong> Wait what, you can’t be serious! We need to know who did this and why!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Randy:</strong> I can assure you we know exactly who did this, as for why? That is yet to be determined, as I said before. Have a good day, Dr. Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, am&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Additional security will be required for this anomaly to ensure another incident like this does not occur, likewise future anomalies like this one will require new security protocols. Dr. Pearl will continue working on SCP-8327 under probation until further notice.</p>

Good morning, Dr. Baker I regret to inform you that there has been another raid carried out by the group now being colloquially known as S.T.R.A.D. behind closed doors in the early hours of Sunday morning. The temporary site has been reestablished and the area secured along with the asset. Your son Randy has sent the investigative report to me to review before handing it off to the 05 council for review on further actions to be taken place, regarding this ongoing issue. This message is being sent as a courtesy to you for the previous events taken place with this group along with your decades of tireless work for the Foundation.</div>
