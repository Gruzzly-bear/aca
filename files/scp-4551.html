<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4451 is to be stored in an anechoic chamber<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. A commercially produced bell muffler is to be placed into the interior of SCP-4551 when not in testing.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Update:</strong> In order to control rust build-up, SCP-4551 is to be cleaned with a 20% electrolytic solution of white vinegar mixed with salt, once per day and re-cleaned after testing. This process is to be performed inside SCP-4551's anechoic chamber.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to prevent severe oxidation to occur on SCP-4551's surface, renaissance oil is to be doused daily. This oil is to be blessed by a member or decendent of Roseafar.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4551 is an ornate iron funeral bell, constructed during the late 1300s in Roseafar, Scotland. When SCP-4551 is rung, it produces a clear note in E♭3, which causes an illusion (SCP-4551-1) to appear to the ringer for a period of up to ten minutes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-4551-1 illusions appear to be incorporeal, partially-translucent figures with a physical appearance identical to a deceased individual whom the ringer had an interpersonal relationship with.</p>
<p>The following has been observed during interactions between a ringer and an SCP-4551-1 illusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ringer maintains that the SCP-4551-1 illusion is the 'soul' of a deceased individual.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ringers report that the SCP-4551-1 illusions converse about past memories shared between the ringer and SCP-4551-1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-4551-1 illusions engage in endearing behavior such as giving compliments and easing doubts when emotionally 'close' to the ringer, and engage in negative<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> behavior when 'distant' to the ringer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Rust has been documented occurring on SCP-4551, with about 3 mm<sup>2</sup> of rust occuring daily, generally forming around the base of the bell. As of █/██/████, it has been discovered that when a human subject rings SCP-4551 while the object is rusted<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, a cognitohazard occurs in which the memory of a deceased individual is completely forgotten by the ringer. For more information, please see addendum no. 3. It is currently unknown what will occur if SCP-4551 is rung while fully rusted.</p>
<p>The <em>Prayer of Rosefar</em>, a holy book from the region, describes SCP-4551's rust effect in the following manner:</p>

<p>According to a senior member of Roseafar, Fr. George Albert, SCP-4551 was considered to be a holy item, and was used to wish for harvests and to celebrate and revere dead members of the community. A special ceremony known as the '<em>Gost of God'</em> was conducted to remove rust from SCP-4551, and to prevent deceased members from being forgotten by the population of the village. This ceremony required a dying member of the community to baptize the bell. A special song was sung during the ceremony, viewable as a transcript below.</p>

<p>Ghost' sightings and reports of paranormal activity were frequent in the area surrounding Roseafar, with the local area using the sightings as a method to attract tourism to the region. These sightings had not been taken seriously until April 9th, 2005, when, during a mass offered in Edinburgh for the recently deceased Catholic Pope John Paul II, SCP-4551 was rung, triggering the appearance of 23 instances of SCP-4551-1. The presiding priest, Roseafar native Fr. George Albert, confessed to removing SCP-4551 and moving it to Edinburgh for this mass.</p>
<p>Foundation agent Lilly Amarte confiscated SCP-4551 at the ceremony, and George Albert and the congregation were detained, and given class-A amnestics.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Daniels:</strong> Good. First, where were you born?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> Hammersfield, Southwestern Wales.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Daniels:</strong> And your mother and father?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> Roseafar, Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> Do you have a family member, friend, or even pet that has died?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> My mother.</p>

<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> Floyd Saifield.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Daniels:</strong> And who is your mother?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> I don't know, Doctor. I only know my father.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> SCP-4551 behaves as a rudimentary amnestic, able to produce an effect in which the ringer will completely forget the memory of the individual summoned during a rusted ringing of SCP-4551. Family members and those related are not affected. Currently, the only long term side effect is clinical depression, and periods of muteness.</p>

<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> A room, but the walls are weird, lots of angles. Never seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> All right then, next question. Is your mother named Beatrice Saifield?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> No. I don't know who my mother was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> Do you have a father?</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> My father was named Floyd.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Daniels:</strong> Last question, who is this, to you? (<em>She holds up a picture of D-4515's mother.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-4515:</strong> I don't know who that is. I've never seen her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> I see. That is all, D-4515. We will return you back to your cell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Amarte's Note: <em>It was about a year or so since we conducted the test involving SCP-4551 and D-4515. The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning… We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don't know just yet. I don't think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it’s not as though there aren’t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics… But is it //right</em>? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man's memory from him. Imagine if the some old coot doctor done the same to me. If they made me forget her. Like I did with the man's mother. For now though.</p>

<p>I'll put those feelings aside. I have to talk to Daniels.//</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> Hello, Laura. We have a few questions we would like to ask you. We are doing a test on memory for the University of Scotland. Do you see these two pictures?</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Daniels holds up a photo of SCP-4551, and SCP-4551's containment chamber.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> I do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte.</strong> What is the first?</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Its a bell, pretty too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> And the second?</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Some sort of room; weird angles. Never seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> I see. Next Question. Who is your mother?</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> My mother was named Beatrice Siefield. A clergymember, from Scotland, Roseafar or something. I've never been, being born in the states, but I'd like to visit, after all, Scotland is-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> That's all we need to know. Is this her? (<em>Dr. Amarte holds up a photo of Laura Siefield's mother.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Oh, yeah, that's her at right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> Good. Last question, do you have a brother?</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I do. I haven't seen him in ages, but I have one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Amarte:</strong> Interesting. That is all. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Don't mention it, Doctor.</p>
