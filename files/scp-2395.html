<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Location of SCP-2395-A.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2395</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Observation Post 44 is to maintain communication and support from Area-30 while continuing surveillance of SCP-2395 and SCP-2395-A. A precautionary 250m radius zone around SCP-2395 has been established, which Observation Post 44 will continue to monitor for any notable movement or activity. Further information from SCP-2395-A's occupant has been deemed unlikely following communication with Dr. Mill.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2395 is a giant price tag, located at 82°08'02.1"S 16°59'05.5"W in Antarctica. Observing aerial drones have recorded SCP-2395 to have the price of "$҉ 585.98" [sic].</p>
<p>SCP-2395 is tied to a small rebar loop embedded in the ground by a 0.7m length of twine. SCP-2395's dimensions are 258m by 90m in length and width; a 2.5 m layer of Polyethylene covers the paper inscribed with SCP-2395's price.</p>
<p>SCP-2395 possesses unpredictable centrifugal and centripetal movement around the rebar loop, usually being manipulated and shifted by unknown forces in random directions and velocities. One instance has occurred where SCP-2395 maintained a constant velocity of approximately 65km/h on the date of 11/2/16, spinning clockwise for 49 seconds. Researchers note the twine that secures SCP-2395 to the rebar loop may possess anomalous tensile properties.</p>
<p>SCP-2395-A is a wooden shack located 0.3km east of SCP-2395. The structure is empty, save for a room in which an unknown individual, presumably a human female, prohibits access from within. The door to their room is engraved with the initials "L.C.E." This individual (designated SCP-2395-B) has responded to no verbal communication, but has occasionally been recorded conversing with other entities.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2395-Q:</strong> [<tt><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8/2/1968</span></tt>] After numerous attempts to establish an interview with SCP-2395-B, surveillance cameras recorded a saw protruding from the door, creating a rectangular hole akin to a mail slot, and a scrap of paper being pushed out. A written message on the paper contained the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fine, write down questions and ill get to them in my down time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mill from Area-30 was brought to communicate with SCP-2395-B, and suggested continued usage of paper notes to recover more information. Note that SCP-2395-B's responses are received in one to two days following Dr. Mill's responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> So if you would prefer I pass notes like this, rather than converse, all I'd like to do is ask a few questions regarding your environment and role, would this be fine?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> ≤10 words or else you're wasting my time</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> Could you explain why you're here?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> It's fricking cold all day and I have work</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> I'm waiting for purchase offers. The price isn't set in stone, but this is the kind of minimum we have to offer to make a profit</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> So you're working for an organization?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> You blind or something, name's on the door</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> Can you explain the price tag's movement?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> Already said I'm trying to make a sale here.</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> What exactly are you selling?</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> Please elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> Earth, planet, terra nova, blue ball of life, flesh cesspool, etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>Mill:</strong> That doesn't explain the price tag's movement.</p>
<p><strong>2395-B:</strong> Well, you know when you pick up a stick with a dying leaf on it? Or when you pick up something at a store with a price tag attached to it and inspect it a bit, and the price tag might flop around a bit? And you might grab the price tag to get a look at the price? Now imagine something else looking at that price tag. Actually scratch that, since you can't.</p>
<p>You getting it now? We're selling the Earth. And I'm busy speaking to willing buyers.<br/></p>
