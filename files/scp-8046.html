<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> Satellite Site-212(f) is solely dedicated to the containment of SCP-8046. The Hvitskauen forest has been enclosed by a chain-link fence with gates on the west and north, a cabin adjacent to the latter. Cabin-212(f)-A and -B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> are provided as residential housing for personnel assigned watch over Site-212(f). Personnel currently residing are Agent Holger Valebrokk, Agent Venke Lahlum, and Senior Researcher Frode Lahlum. Site-212(f) staff are instructed to refer to 1 Hvitskaunvegen and 2 Hvitskaunvegen as their private property, and advised not to leave both cabins unattended. Perimeter of Site-212(f) is under remote surveillance, accessible to all personnel from computers on-site and at NOSTTH-Site-212.</p>
<p>As of 2006, non-compromising information of SCP-8046-B including facial reconstructions have been publicized to mainstream media with the intent of outsourcing the civilian population for potential identification. Authorized personnel discussing SCP-8046-B with civilians or unauthorized personnel must abide by Cover Stories Index Kripos§5.2 "Ola og Kari Nordmann", with attention to Subset 5.2.8046 "Hvitskausmannen" for case details.</p>
<p>Inventory of samples taken from SCP-8046 for research and physical records pertaining to the anomaly are kept in Storage Locker 6-10 at NOSTTH-Site-212.</p>
<p>If SCP-8046 is accessed from outside of the Site-212(f) enclosure, the event and location is to be reported to superiors immediately.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-8046 is a spatial anomaly centralized around a wooden door confined to the wilderness of the Hvitskauen forest outside of Buvika, Trøndelag Fylke, Norway.</p>
<p>The exact geographic location of SCP-8046 is inconsistent, and cannot be located with set directions, only with perseverance. Tracking of expedition members confirms that the location is extraplanar but coextensive with the baseline, as individuals within SCP-8046 cannot be located by those outside despite cross-referencing GPS coordinates, which are otherwise actuate in recording individuals' movements. Testing indicates SCP-8046 can be accessed unpredictably within an area of approximately 12 square kilometers, and can be traversed by multiple people at once, arriving via individual entrance points or a single access as a close group.</p>
<p>Physically, SCP-8046 is a small clearing with flora, fauna, and time of day corresponding with the baseline forest, but weather is consistently under -2℃, with several centimeters of snow always being present, regardless of season. Baseline can easily be returned to by walking into the forest away from the clearing. It is unknown at what distances from SCP-8046-A does a person disappear and reappear, as the shift between SCP-8046 and baseline has never been observed by a stationary outsider, and traversal is always perceived as a gradual transition, even in the event of weather extremes.</p>
<p>Erected within the center of SCP-8046 is SCP-8046-A. The door measures 204.15 × 75.57 × 3.8 centimeters, and is inset to a door frame that is a uniform 9.53 cm width and 14.6 cm depth. The foot of the door frame extends into a cement platform measuring 1 × 1 × 0.455 meters, present since the pouring of the cement. Analysis of samples taken confirm SCP-8046-A is constructed with non-anomalous materials that have been commonplace throughout Norway in the 20th century.</p>
<p>SCP-8046-A is always found in a closed state. Upon opening the door either inward or outward, the frame proceeds to a further coextensive location, designated SCP-8046-i. SCP-8046 and SCP-8046-i can only be perceived through the boundaries of SCP-8046-A, and attempts by more than one individual in viewing through the opposite side of an accessed SCP-8046-A while in the same iteration are unable to perceive one another through the door frame. All persons or objects in SCP-8046-i cannot be seen outside the boundaries of the frame or interacted with from SCP-8046, and vice versa for occupants of SCP-8046-i looking back at SCP-8046.</p>
<p>SCP-8046-A is the only known access point to and from SCP-8046-i, as walking away into the forest does not return an individual to either SCP-8046 or baseline, only continuing as a geographically unidentified expanse of forest.</p>
<p>Dismantling of SCP-8046-A disconnects from SCP-8046-i but produces a further spatial anomaly. While the door can be removed from its hinges without issue, all individuals inside SCP-8046-i relocate into SCP-8046 at the corresponding positions and GPS tracking immediately stops upon doing so. Attempting to leave SCP-8046 resulting in individuals walking several hundred meters before invariably returning to the clearing, in spite of directions taken. SCP-8046 can only be departed once the door is returned to the frame.</p>
<p>The clearing of SCP-8046-i is identical to the superlative iteration, aside from occasional blizzards and various furniture. Almost none of these objects found in the location exhibit any anomalous properties or known relevance to paranormal culture,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and the manufacturer has been identified for half of all objects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Furnishing are typical of a bedroom: including a nightstand, a bookcase, a dresser, and miscellaneous clothing and items, all covered in snow and faring various states of water damage.</p>
<p>The focal point of SCP-8046-i is a twin-sized bed with an adult male human's cadaver lying supine on the left-hand side, designated SCP-8046-B. At a cursory glance, SCP-8046-B's cause of death was knife-related homicide; a kitchen knife (SCP-8046-C) is embedded in the chest, with twelve (12) stab wounds being visible. SCP-8046-B had been stabbed through the covers with no signs of a struggle, presumably asleep. The cadaver has been naturally mummified by the weather of SCP-8046-i and encased in ice that has accumulated on it and under the covers; SCP-8046-B would require an extensive extraction effort to be removed from the mattress with minimal damage, but such a mission has not been approved.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>It has not yet been identified who SCP-8046-B was in life. The right ring finger, prioritized due to the presence of a wedding ring, was successfully severed and transported to NOSTTH-Site-212 for study. SCP-8046-B was identified to be of A+ blood type and R1a haplotype, but no matches have been found in any DNA or fingerprint databases. Ring was inscribed on the interior with <em>14k Du er min<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> 28-7-85</em>. Testing of dental records has not yet been approved.</p>
<p>All attempts at removing SCP-8046-C have been unsuccessful. Personnel who have grasped SCP-8046-C on both the handle or blade describe feeling a heat emanating from the object, which progressively increases in temperature when applying force in attempt to pull, push, or otherwise lever the blade. Thermal readings show that SCP-8046-C has an ambient temperature of 38.8℃, and readily heats beyond the point of inflicting burns through clothing and damaging apparatuses used to indirectly manipulate it; it proportionally heats by roughly 0.032℃ for every newton of force applied, and cools at a rate expected of a stainless-steel object of its dimensions. Despite this thermal activity, SCP-8046-C does not deform from the heat, nor has it moved under force applied to it, and SCP-8046-B has not thawed around the point of contact.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>HISTORY:</strong> SCP-8046 came to the SCP Foundation's attention after a local from the municipality of Orkanger, Albert Hagen (22, M), disappeared in the Hvitskauen forest while exploring with friends and was reported missing by said friends on 1/1/2003. Hagen's friends told police and news outlets that Hagan had brought them to investigate a rumor he heard of a door out in the forest that "takes people places". Questioning for friends and family was unable to conclusively determine where Hagen heard the rumor, but it was their and staff's general assumption that it was from Unni Ebbesen (27, F): Hagen's cousin was known to hike in the region prior to her death in a boating accident on 14/7/2002.</p>
<p>SCP-8046 was located 8/1/2003 during search efforts for Hagen, concurrently by undercover Field Agent Valebrokk and a civilian volunteer. Foundation assets embedded in the Sør-Trøndelag Police District secured the Hvitskauen forest and exclusively continued the search for Hagen. SCP-8046 was given SCP designation as Euclid on 9/1/2003. Hagen's body was located outside of SCP-8046 on 13/1/2003; autopsy confirmed cause of death to be hypothermia, and Hagen's body was given to family without incident.</p>
<p>After attempts to dismantle and transport SCP-8046-A failed, NOSTTH-Site-212 administration decided to contain SCP-8046 on location as a satellite site. The land on which the Hvitskauen forest resides was chartered and purchased by a Foundation front company on 3/2/2003. Construction of Satellite Site-212(f) was completed 27/7/2003.</p>
<p>Due to risk posed to personnel and equipment from sub-zero temperatures, and fragility of SCP-8046-B, incursions into SCP-8046 have been limited over the years. Approved actions for analysis of SCP-8046 phenomena have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPS tracking of personnel entering and leaving SCP-8046,</li>
<li>Dismantling of SCP-8046 during occupation of SCP-8046-i,</li>
<li>Splinter samples taken from SCP-8046-A and furniture,</li>
<li>Removal of bedsheet segment for SCP-8046-B access and fiber analysis,</li>
<li>Severing of SCP-8046-B's right ring finger for forensics,</li>
<li>Facial reconstructions using photography and non-invasive forensics,</li>
<li>Removal of reading material from bookshelf,</li>
<li>Unmanned drone exploration into SCP-8046-i.</li>
</ul>
<p>On 22/4/2006, administration authorized dissemination of facial reconstructions made of SCP-8046-B to the Norwegian public under standard pretenses of an unidentified murder victim. Additional reconstructions using different art techniques have been released in 2010 and 2014. This outsourcing to civilians as well as cross-analysis with the national list of missing persons have been unsuccessful in identifying the "Hvitskau Man".</p>
<p>On 1/9/2013, SCP-8046 was denied reclassification as Safe, justified largely in part due to the unpredictability in accessing SCP-8046 and uncertainty where it can be accessed from. Concurrently, further long-term investigation of SCP-8046-i and its contents was postponed due to lack of productivity, and funding for SCP-8046 research was redirected to Site-212's other projects. Remaining personnel containment were granted authority to conduct independent investigations using existing samples and records, with possibility of future incursions into SCP-8046-i needing to be approved by Site Director or Assistant Site Director.</p>
<p>As of 10/6/2024, Site-212(f) personnel have not found conclusive evidence if SCP-8046's area of encounter has expanded, nor any evidence it has shifted outside of the Hvitskauen.</p>
