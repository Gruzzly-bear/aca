<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The conspiracy theory of global Tetrahydrocannabinol<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> tolerance (Cover Story 60) increase has been perpetuated by the Foundation, and corporate Tetrahydrocannabinol manufacturers have been blackmailed to comply with this conspiracy. The War on Drugs (Cover Story 7), has been reinstated with the intent to dissuade the general public from consuming Tetrahydrocannabinol.</p>
<p>Those affiliated with various drug empires across the globe have been informed of the tolerance conspiracy theory by embedded Foundation agents within their ranks, and have been strongly advised against selling Tetrahydrocannabinol products to their customers. Civilians who remain vigilant and skeptical of the conspiracy are to be discretely detained by Foundation agents and subjected to experimentation.</p>
<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol experimentation is to be supervised by Researcher Umar Hadid of the S.T.O.N.E.R. Division<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Experimentation is to continue until an accord with SCP-7168-A can be established, as it is hypothesized that doing so will rectify the societal damage done by its anomalous properties.</p>
<p>SCP-7168-A is confined to its extra dimensional hyperlocation and cannot be practically contained without risking further disruption to the standard, non-anomalous effects of marijuana consumption, or perpetuating SCP-7168 indefinitely. Attempts to communicate with the anomaly are the primary goal of Operation ROOT.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7168 is the phenomenon currently affecting all non-anomalous strains of marijuana. SCP-7168 negates the perception altering effects of, and hallucinations induced by, marijuana. While under the influence of Tetrahydrocannabinol, individuals have reported feeling an overall increase in libido, nausea, guilt, and relaxation, although the perception-altering effects of the substance are absent. Additionally, individuals have reported experiencing hallucinations depicting a "white, formless void", occupied by a sole humanoid entity, designated SCP-7168-A.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Researcher Hadid's custom strain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7168-A's visual appearance drastically varies to each individual who observes it, with very few consistencies. From the accounts collected from the experiment subjects, SCP-7168-A is always female-presenting, standing at least two meters taller than the individual, and possesses two eyes, one of which luminates a green aura. SCP-7168-A is also highly temperamental, often harassing or belittling individuals who observe it.</p>
<p>SCP-7168-A has admitted to causing SCP-7168, although its reason for doing this is unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Researcher Umar Hadid inadvertently discovered SCP-7168-A following the manifestation of SCP-7168. When Researcher Hadid noticed that the marijuana infused brownies he had baked failed to initiate the desired effect, he originally attributed the phenomenon to his rapidly increasing tolerance. Researcher Hadid reported to a Foundation co-worker in his company at the time that he caught a momentary glimpse of a tall female humanoid, who regarded him with disdain. The other individual with him, MTF Delta-20's Jason Mendoza, reported a similar experience, although when he made flirtatious advances at the humanoid, it ignored him.</p>
<p>At this point, Researcher Hadid suspected that anomalous activity was involved. He contacted Alaina Chin, the Director of Site-83, through email, and requested to conduct a series of tests on D-Class personnel and volunteer Foundation researchers. The email below has been included for posterity.</p>
<div class="email-block">
<div class="email-header">
<p><strong>To:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">ten.pics|38nihcaniala#ten.pics|38nihcaniala</span><br/>
<strong>From:</strong> <span class="wiki-email">ten.pics|7991didahramu#ten.pics|7991didahramu</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Director Chin, it is with the utmost dismay that I write this email to you as a sober man. Between Agent Mendoza and I, we have consumed a whole tray of edibles and have barely gotten a contact high in the three hours since ingestion. I ripped a bong about ten minutes ago for good measure, just to make sure that my tolerance hadn't excelled beyond reasonable parameters and still, I remain sober and aware.</p>
<p>We both experienced a shared hallucination independent of one another, shared being the operative word.</p>
<p>The woman we saw was exactly the same in both of our brief visions, albeit some minor differences. She was tall and beautiful, but the problem is that we both saw her independently, without talking about something like that with one another.</p>
<p>Of course, that could just be a coincidence. Independent, shared hallucinations aren't exactly out of the realm of possibility, and it could be the case that we are both attracted to the same type of person and subconsciously thought about that.</p>
<p>Generally though, when you're hallucinating something like that (meaning an attractive person right in front of you), the hallucination is typically more amicable. They want to spend time with you, or do whatever it is you're thinking about. Hallucinations are generally under the control of your subconscious, and to that effect, often beneficial to you. This one didn't feel like that. It was like it was independent.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is not unique to me, however. I've contacted our branches in Jamaica, Chile, Ghana, and Guam, and their researchers have noticed this drastic decrease in the perception altering affects of marijuana in their respective country's civilian population. There have been riots, destruction en masse, and the drug empires across the globe are starting to crumble. People are dying.</p>
<p>So far the people in the know have been complying with our current containment procedures, but there is a potent danger still present that is threatening to destroy civilization as we understand it.</p>
<p>If marijuana is not functioning as it should for much longer, that is going to pose a serious threat to the Veil. We need to resolve this immediately.</p>
<p>To that end, I propose Operation ROOT. It will be a short-term series of experiments using those Foundation volunteers and D-Class personnel. They will have various years of experience with marijuana, as well as drastically different tolerances. My aim is to observe their reactions under different amounts of marijuana to gather data and potentially find a cure as to preserve the Veil of Secrecy.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br/>
<em>R. Umar Hadid</em></p>

<p>Site Director Chin consulted with Ethics Committee Liason, Michael Keetan, who reasoned that there would be no harm being done to individuals who partook in the proposed experimentation. Site Director Chin greenlit the request, stipulating that the pool of test subjects consist of D-Class personnel and volunteers. The on-going phenomenon was given SCP Classification, and the experimentation was conducted shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Trials:</strong></p>
<p>On February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025, Researcher Hadid began conducting various experiments with volunteer Foundation personnel using different strains of marijuana, each developed and cultivated by the S.T.O.N.E.R. Division.</p>

While displeased with the taste, Dr. Burr complied with Researcher Hadid's instruction and waited in the testing chamber for the effects to manifest. After two hours passed, Dr. Burr reported feeling mild nausea and witnessing a semi-transparent hand manifest in front of him and unfurl its middle finger.

As Broadus's tolerance was exceptionally high due to his prolonged experience with marijuana, the perception-altering effects took significantly longer to manifest. Once they did, however, Broadus reported seeing the semi-transparent outline of a female, humanoid visual anomaly. Broadus attempted to contact the visual anomaly, although he vomited before he was able to do so, causing the anomaly to demanifest.</div>

After three hours, Agent Mendoza began to feel a minor alteration to his perception, claiming that the same female humanoid he witnessed with Research Hadid had manifested again. The visual anomaly appeared greatly displeased by Agent Mendoza's presence. It waved its hands in a circular motion in front of its body, following which Agent Mendoza vomited, causing the visual anomaly to demanifest.</div>

<p>While Researcher Hadid was unable to glean significant data from the brief experimental trial, he did confirm that anomalous activity was presently affecting marijuana. Over the course of the ensuing three days, Researcher Hadid cultivated a modified strain of marijuana comprised of the five modified strains used during the trial. Using accelerated growth hormones, Researcher Hadid grew and treated a unique strain of marijuana and returned to the testing chamber to document its effects on himself. The following video footage was recovered after the incident on February 18<sup>th</sup>, 2025.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> It should be noted that, following his transformation, Researcher Hadid is speaking through the reflection, while SCP-7168-A is speaking in the physical world.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Researcher Hadid is sitting with his back against the wall of the testing chamber, inhaling 2267kg of marijuana over the course of four hours through a Klein bottle, retrofitted with a small access designed to hold ground up marijuana matter. Researcher Hadid produces a lighter from his pocket and lights the access port, exhaling before inhaling vapor. Researcher Hadid convulses briefly before retching, then regaining control.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> For the love of God, please. Just give me a single win, that's all I ask for.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Hadid remains sitting as the marijuana begins to take affect. He raises both hands up to his face slowly, turning them over and marveling at his surroundings. His mouth is agape as he stands and paces around the testing chamber, avoiding obstacles that cannot be observed by the camera. After several minutes of this activity, Hadid abruptly stops and stares upward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> Woaaah. You're… beautiful!</p>
<p><em>Hadid doubles over, clutching his abdomen, as he begins to retch again. Before he can vomit, however, he undergoes several physiological changes rapidly. He grows an additional two meters in height and his arms elongate and alter pigmentation, changing from dark brown to light green. His hair lengthens and becomes iridescent while being affected by a breeze that is not present in the testing chamber. His eyes alter hue and begin to luminate green. At this point, Hadid physically resembles the female humanoid entity as described by Broadus. Hadid walks to a reflective surface in the test chamber and examines himself. Despite the physiological changes, Hadid's reflection is unaltered.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> What in the <em>fuck</em> do you think you're doing? I stopped you people from getting high for a reason. You really think that you can just steal my gifts and I'd, what, just roll over and be cool with that? Doesn't "Goddess" mean anything to <em>anyone</em> anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> I made my own strain. Who are you? Are you real?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> (<em>Sighs</em>) What is it going to take to get a little respect around here? Thousands of years making everyone happy and not a single "Praise Reefer the All Loving" or even a fucking "thanks Reefer, you really are the bees tits". Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> I'm… okay, I'm sorry. (<em>He laughs</em>) Your name's Reefer? What are you, some kinda… weed goddess?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> (<em>Crosses its arms</em>) I am THE weed goddess, fuck you very much. And I'm tired of being treated like an old toy you play with a few times and then throw away. If you aren't gonna recognize all the hard work I do maintaining an, and let me emphasize here, <em>entire planet's worth of stoners</em>, then you don't get to be stoners anymore. Understand that you little ungrateful asshole kleptomaniac piece of shit. You know what you're doing is illegal, right? It's blatant intellectual theft.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> I didn't know, fuck, I didn't know. I'm sorry Reefer. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Oh my god, do you really think you can make up for this with <em>sex</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> …What?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> You mean you didn't do all of this to try and fuck me?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> No, what? I just wanted to get high— I mean, the world is in ruin now because of the drug problem. It's been weeks, Reefer. Weeeks. Kingpins are going apeshit, as are their customers. There's a revolt going on in France, again! The Canadian weed market has crashed and they're in economic ruin! Riots, looting, society is breaking down on a macroscopic level and on top of it all I'm about to be head of the S.T.O.N.E.R. Division at my job, and I cannot do that sober.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Oh. Sorry. Actually, no I'm not. Fuck your job, fuck your species. That all sounds like a personal problem. Why should <em>I</em> go out of my way to help you when no one has done anything for me? How much longer do I have to stick my neck out for absolutely nothing in return?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> You want… you want to get paid? I can pay. I'd love nothing more than to pay you for your services.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> No you smooth-brained jackass, I don't want to get paid. Also, gross. Can't you read subtext?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> I'm a little out of it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> I just want to be loved again. People have forgotten that I even exist. You just smoke and eat hot chips and lie. There's no ritual behind it anymore. Israelites used to burn ganja thousands of years ago during ritualistic worship at their temples to commune with me. The Mayans used to smoke every third moon to maintain a relationship with me. The Rastafarians once revered me, and Ronald Reagan once feared me. I mattered.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> That's incredible. You're incredible. You matter to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Do you know how many people have done exactly what you're doing now? Assuming my form and tripping hella balls? You aren't the first, but you'll probably be the last.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> But whhhyyy?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Because.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> 'cause?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Because I'm tired of the bullshit.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7168-A sits cross legged, facing away from Researcher Hadid.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> Reefer, don't be mad. Please. I just want to help.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Do you really want to help or do you just want to get high again?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> Can't it be both?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> You're unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> (<em>Holding up hands</em>) Woah, okay. Okay. I'm just, give me a sec to sober up a little.</p>
<p><em>Silence for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> Look, Reefer. I can't apologize for what everyone before me has done, or how people in the past have treated you. You're the weed goddess, and you should be treated like a goddess. I love what you've done, and I really, <em>really</em> appreciate the thankless work you do behind the scenes. Can you please let people get high again without resorting to this extreme?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Is that sarcasm?</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> I am stoned out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> (<em>She sighs</em>) I guess not. Okay, look, whoever you are, I'll give my gifts back on the condition that you let me do a little "retconning". Your intellectual theft has given me a genius idea, and I'm hoping whatever powers that be down in your plane of existence will help me out.</p>
<p><strong>Hadid:</strong> (<em>Retching</em>) Anything for you, Reefer, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7168-A:</strong> Don't make it weird, dude.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Researcher Hadid vomited following the conclusion of the log, and the expected effects of marijuana began to remanifest across the continental United States. SCP-7168 is pending "Explained" classification at the time of writing.</p>
<p>An additional property of non-anomalous marijuana strains has manifested following Researcher Hadid's interaction with SCP-7168-A. Individuals who ingest or inhale non-anomalous marijuana will invariably worship a deity of unknown religion known as "Reefer". Observed worshiping rituals have so far included the additional consumption of marijuana followed by praise to the aforementioned deity for their service. This behavior can be attributed to the perception-altering effects of marijuana.
