<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All twenty-four (24) instances of SCP-4632 are to be kept in a secure storage locker at Site-64. Any access to SCP-4632 is to be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any subjects that come in contact with SCP-4632 and reads its contents are to be monitored for a period lasting no more than forty-eight (48) hours, after which subjects are to be administered Class-A amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4632 is a set of twenty-four (24) memetic posters found in the city of Sheffield, England. After increasing reports of severe derealization disorder<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> cases in local psychiatric facilities, the Foundation recovered all 24 instances. Cross-examination of affected areas revealed that the number of SCP-4632 instances correlated with the number of derealization cases.</p>
<p>When a human subject reads the contents of an SCP-4632 instance, the implantation of the following concept into the subconscious mind occurs: the current reality in which the subject lives is a dream. This effect initially manifests as a passing thought over time confusing the subject as derealization progresses. The progress of the anomaly is gradual, the median time for complete derealization is 12 to 18 months. Subjects with diagnosed mental illnesses prior to contact see an increased rate of derealization.</p>
<p>Affected subjects are careless and as such show little to no interest in real-life events; justifying their disinterest by their purported dreaming state. Previously normal subjects affected by SCP-4632 have been seen engaging in activities such as extreme sports, violent crimes, reckless behavior, public indecency, and Class-A felonies.</p>
<p>Any digital copies of any SCP-4632 instance exhibit no anomalous properties.</p>

<p>A 36-year-old male, to be referred to as POI-4632, was spotted putting up more instances of SCP-4632 around Sheffield. The subject was detained without resistance and brought to Site-64 for interrogation. POI-4632's medical records show that he has been diagnosed with chronic clinical depression, schizoaffective disorder, and depersonalization disorder. He has a record of twenty-seven (27) involuntary hospitalizations for mental health-related crises.</p>
<p>Subject displays low-level reality-bending abilities; he claims this is because he has gained control over his "dream." It is hypothesized that extended exposure to SCP-4632's effects may contribute to slowly increasing ontokinetic abilities; due to the fact this is the only affected subject to display these types of abilities, he is considered the originator of SCP-4632.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<hr/>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> Hello, my name is Michael Herrera. For the record, do you know why you're here?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Hello subconscious, are we talking again?!</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> This is an interview, yes. Again, do you know why you're here?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Cause I let you take me, I find that dreams are more interesting if you go with the flow, you know what I mean?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> I do not. You believe this is a dream?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Of course it is, what else? I mean look around! The armored guys that brought me in told me this was <em>"The Foundation"</em> and that they <em>"contain anomalies and monsters or something."</em> That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!</tt></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>[POI-4632 laughs.]</tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> I mean that's some top-notch dream logic, right?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> I see… why do you believe that?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Because reality is fucking boring, man! There's nothing fantastical about it, at all. No monsters or superheroes or… I don't fucking know… Krampus or something. None of this shit exists, you don't exist.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> I definitely exist. Well, moving on… you were spotted posting instan-</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Look subconscious, come on. I'm already lucid, I know this is a dream and all of that, stop trying to convince me otherwise.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> What exactly do you mean by lucid?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> I did the poster thing, a reality check! I printed those things so I would remember how to do it. It is clear that I am dreaming.</tt></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>[POI-4632 is seen materializing a cheeseburger and breaking his restraints without effort.]</tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> What the-?! Command, you didn't tell me this was a reality bender!</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Dude, fucking relax, okay? None of this matters. Who the hell is Command anyways?</tt></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>[Command communicates to Agent Herrera through an earpiece, orders to not anger the subject.]</tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> Yes… of course, this is a dream. I apologize.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> There you go.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> Forgive my memory. You have power over your dream of course but, what have you been doing with these abilities?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> The usual, you know. Getting with women I wouldn't have a chance with in real life. Getting all the things I've ever wanted. What else would you do if you had no consequences?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> I am curious though, how did you realize this was a dream? As your subconscious I'm supposed to avoid that, you see.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> You did a terrible job of that.</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> How so?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> Look around you man, this is a place where we're in a giant dirt ball riding through space with no direction, a gigantic fucking fireball warms us and we have all of these arbitrary stupid rules, and now you mean to tell me monsters are real! And all the people in the dream do is run around trying their best to make their worthless lives mean something; the fucking money, the status, the power, the endless struggle to find safety. I shouldn't have to search for meaning, I shouldn't have to warn the others! I shouldn't have to stay in the house! I shouldn't need the pills or the doctors or anyone that can turn the… wait… what… I…</tt></p>

<p><tt>[POI-4632 is visibly confused.]</tt></p>

<p><tt><span style="color: blue"><strong>Agent Herrera:</strong></span> Who?</tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: red"><strong>POI-4632:</strong></span> I didn't do that to my sister… I didn't do anything to Clara.</tt></p>
