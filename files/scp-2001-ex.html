<p><strong>History:</strong><br/>
The initial proposal for SCP-2001 was made 1/17/████.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> As the size and scope of the SCP Foundation expands, RAISA is having a harder time maintaining information security. Symmetric key schemes (e.g. AES, N = 256) are no longer viable due to the difficulty of sharing keys securely, and public-key encryption (e.g. RSA, ECC) is vulnerable to both ordinary and anomalous quantum computers<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-161125-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-161125-5')">5</a></sup>. It's a miracle that the number of leaks by hostile GOIs, enterprising whistleblowers, or just Foundation employees with too much curiosity and too little clearance has been so few.</p>
<p>The existence of mundane stimuli that can produce desirable mental states - blue light for suppressing circadian rhythms, LSD for enhanced suggestibility and ego dissolution, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound#Infrasonic_17_Hz_tone_experiment">the infrasonic 17 Hz tone experiment</a> - suggests the human brain is highly vulnerable to…intervention. If we can discover the right kind of vulnerabilities, we can protect our data with mental deterrents - cognition-hazards, if you will - against unauthorized consumers. Imagine an eye-aversion response in low-clearance documents, all the way up to killsprites in the top-secret stuff. We have an entire department already dedicated to studying mind-affecting anomalies. I just need the go-ahead to start trying things out.<br/>

</blockquote>
<p>On 06/14/████, the proposal was approved for preliminary testing by Site Director ████████.</p>
<p>Below is a selection of SCP-2001 preliminary testing. For full testing logs, see Document 2001-1.<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Testing Log 2001-1</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-0992<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> Series of flickering white lights at 10Hz, displayed on a CRT monitor for 1 hour.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Mild nausea. Lingering perception that lights were flickering even after monitor was turned off for approximately 5 minutes. Within expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_vertigo">Bucha effect</a> bounds.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher Note:</strong> I don't know why I thought we would get lucky with some kind of untapped well - if "cognito-hazards" were that simple, people would have discovered them by accident already. I guess all those mind-affecting SCPs really are called anomalous for a reason.<br/>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:white">We should have stopped here.</span><br/>
<strong>Follow-up:</strong> Researcher Ibaraki has been given authorization to experiment with D-class subjects in order to determine whether human neurological makeup can be altered, within an acceptable degree of deviation, to be susceptible to "cognitohazardous" stimuli.</p>

<p>Below is a selection of notable genomic/proteomic modifications proposed and tested by Researcher Ibaraki. The goal was not only to confirm that modified D-class were now susceptible to desired cognitohazardous inputs, but also that there were no long-term side-effects or undesired aberrations in their behavior.</p>

<p>Visual cognitohazards are the big one. Fortunately, we now have the expertise to target the lateral geniculate nucleus and striate complex efficiently. - Dr. Ibaraki</p>
<p><strong>Subjects:</strong> D-3248 through D-7200<br/>
<strong>Procedure 5.9:</strong> Injection of cytochrome oxidase blobs into striate cortex layers II through VI, extended through to the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex.<br/>
<strong>Intended susceptibilities:</strong> Sight-induced control of somatic nervous system and general executive function.<br/>
<strong>Confirmed susceptibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shikibu visualhazard: Stifled ability to produce self-deceptive thoughts.</li>
<li>Rao-Heat infopattern: Increased receptiveness to mind-body dualism<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-161125-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-161125-16')">16</a></sup> and decreased receptiveness to divine command metaethics<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-161125-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-161125-17')">17</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Adamec VH 8: Subjects rode a bicycle to the nearest home-improvement store and purchased five smoke alarms and the components for an improvised explosive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observed results:</strong> The remaining subjects were amnesticized and released to civilian life under observation. No signification aberrations in behavior or health were noted at 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year checkpoints. No known cognitohazards were triggered by accident. ██ <em>de-novo</em> cognitohazards were discovered.<br/>
<strong>Follow-up:</strong> Approved for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Subjects:</strong> D-4020 through D-5123<br/>
<strong>Procedure 5.10:</strong> NGF was used to induce growth of a retinofugal projection to the hypothalamus. For each of the below agents, a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell">grandmother cells</a> were cultivated in the LGN corresponding to the visual cognitohazard cue.<br/>
<strong>Intended susceptibilities:</strong> Sight-induced inhibition of autonomic function and general pattern formation.<br/>
<strong>Confirmed susceptibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kandel deterrent: Produced strong and persistent belief that most of one's memories have been tampered with or fabricated.</li>
<li>Berryman-Langford kill agent: Visual and auditory hallucinations, followed by fatal brain hemorrhage within 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>DAMMERUNG visual agent: Disorientation and loss of consciousness. Permanent disruption of gamma waves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observed results:</strong> The remaining subjects were amnesticized and released to civilian life under observation. One notable incident of D-4998's gamma wave pattern being disrupted by an oscillating flash of sunlight as he drove along a tree-lined road; D-4998 experienced a seizure and was killed in the crash. No known cognitohazards were triggered by accident. No <em>de-novo</em> cognitohazards were discovered.<br/>
<strong>Follow-up:</strong> Approved for implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HMCL Note:</strong> The capabilities of these visual cognitohazards are everything we could've hoped for. <span style="color:white">And more.</span><br/>
I'm sure they'll be moved along to large-scale implementation in no time. Congratulations on a big step for the continued protection of Foundation secrecy and the Veil as a whole.<br/>

<p><strong>Implemented Modifications:</strong> Vital modifications allowing for the function of lethal cognitohazards approved. Use of Foundation-approved cognitohazards restricted to infohazardous and high-security Keter, Thaumiel, and esoteric class anomalies only.</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedures used: 4.3, 5.10</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Projected likelihood of Broken Masquerade scenario decreased by 60%. Negligible increase in rate of memetic SCP discovery.<br/>
<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Seems like those fears I had were unfounded. The number of mind-affecting anomalies is remaining stable, and the Foundation is stronger than ever. - Dr. Ibaraki</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">
<p><strong>Implemented Modifications:</strong> Further modifications allowing for function of nonlethal cognitohazards approved. Expansion of lethal cognitohazard libraries. Use of Foundation-approved cognitohazards available for general database and communications security. Use of Foundation-approved cognitohazards available for employee behavioral modification and infoprotection as well as O5-approved MTF missions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedures used: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 4.5, 5.9, 5.11, ███</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Projected likelihood of Broken Masquerade Scenario decreased by 20%. 25% increase in rate of memetic SCP discovery. Negligible increase in projected chance of AK-Class Madness and EK-Class End-of-Human-Consciousness scenarios. MTF Eta-10 ("See No Evil") and MTF Eta-11 ("Savage Beasts") established.<br/>
<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> I recommend a reduction in the next batch size of 35% - we need to keep an eye on this jump in memetic anomaly evolution. - Dr. Ibaraki.</p>

<p><strong>Implemented Modifications:</strong> [DATA LOST]</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Emergence of Class X contagious memetic hazard <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-3002">Lily Veselka</a> [DATA MISSING OR CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE YOUR RAISA SUPERVISOR.]<br/>
<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Very little data remains of this iteration. I highly recommend we roll back SCP-2001 modifications by a couple batches - not only are we getting decreasing returns on information security and memetic warfare capabilities, but the kind of vulnerabilities that are now present in the human noosphere are getting worrying. We may not be able to handle many more of these kinds of cognitohazardous SCPs which are popping up all over the place. - Dr. Ibaraki</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O5 Response: Activation █ batch rolled back only. We do not feel that the Foundation will be capable of handling its vastly greater responsibilities should more of SCP-2001 be rescinded. - O5-7</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Projected likelihood of Broken Masquerade Scenario decreased by 5%. 48% increase in rate of memetic SCP discovery. █% increase in projected chance of all K-class scenarios.<br/>
<strong>Follow-Up:</strong> There are now ███ and counting mind-affecting anomalies in containment, and that's only the ones I have clearance for. I estimate at least ██% are piggybacking off of SCP-2001. This is no longer sustainable. - Dr. Ibaraki</p>

Additionally, the evolution of more mind-affecting anomalies should soon mean that a "microbiome" of innocuous memes should soon suppress the more dangerous SCPs by outcompetition. We have no reason to believe that the current rate of high-risk SCP discovery will continue. - O5-12</p>
