            <h1>SCP-1170</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1170</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the incorporeal nature of SCP-1170-2, it cannot be moved to a safe distance from local residents. As such, Area-1170 has been built around SCP-1170-1. The entire apartment complex has been blocked off; however, due to its rather public location, Foundation personnel are required to maintain disguises when in view.</p>
<p>Shift changes for guards stationed at Area-1170 occur every three hours. No personnel are to enter SCP-1170-1 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">except in special cases</span> under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1170-1 is a windowless bedroom located on the second floor of Apartment #21 in the ████ ███████ Apartment Complex, ██████, British Columbia. The room measures 8.5m x 11m x 3.2m, with hardwood floors and concrete walls. It appears empty on all security footage. The room cannot be illuminated by visible light (excluding the built-in light fixture), as SCP-1170-1 seems to absorb all visible wavelengths. The interior of the room appears pitch-black when viewed without specialized equipment. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Light outside the visible spectrum appears to encounter no resistance from SCP-1170-1, allowing use of infrared and night vision cameras.</span> All light with wavelength shorter than 1 m is in some way affected by SCP-1170-1. It is not known whether radio waves are also manipulated. Audio recording devices have been shown to be at least partially functional.</p>
<p>SCP-1170-1's active anomalous properties are triggered upon activation of the room's built-in light fixture, located approximately 0.75 m from the door on the west-facing wall. Subjects present when this light is on claim that the bedside lamps in the room activate, although security footage shows no change in luminescence and infrared cameras do not detect any heat source other than the subjects. In addition, subjects describe the room as having a bed, a fireplace, two bedside tables, ████████████, and two lamps, none of which appear in security footage. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It is theorized that this effect may be purely psychic in nature.</span></p>
<p>Approximately one minute and thirty seconds after the light fixture is activated, an entity (hereafter SCP-1170-2) appears on night vision camera (though only barely, as wavelengths emitted are only up to 10<sup>-6</sup> meters in length). SCP-1170-2's anatomy is apparently humanoid except for its inverted joints. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Footage taken shows no interaction between the subject and SCP-1170-2</span>. At some point between 2 (two) seconds and 40 (forty) minutes after SCP-1170-2 appears, both it and any foreign objects in the room (including cameras, external lights, and test subjects) vanish. SCP-1170-2 is visible only to human subjects who have been present in SCP-1170-1 for the entirety of the time between the most recent activation of the light fixture and the subsequent appearance of SCP-1170-2. Exiting the room is not recommended while SCP-1170-2 is present in the room, as [DATA EXPUNGED]. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It is unclear whether or not SCP-1170-2 physically exists or is simply a near-infrared illusion produced by SCP-1170-1.</span></p>
<p>Subjects inside SCP-1170-1 are seen to converse with a partner while SCP-1170-2 is present; the content of these conversations suggests that they are in fact speaking with SCP-1170-2. Furthermore, the sudden emotional changes experienced by subjects conversing with the entity suggest that SCP-1170-2 may have a memetic effect. SCP-1170-2 has avoided all directed questions about any subjects unrelated to love and romantic partnership.</p>
<p>Objects occasionally appear at random in SCP-1170-1. Most are mundane and have no apparent anomalous properties. However, there have been several instances of blood appearing on the walls, roof, and floor of the room: genetic testing revealed it to belong to Class-D personnel who had disappeared along with SCP-1170-2. Fecal matter, semen, saliva, and [DATA EXPUNGED] have also been recovered, all consistent with previous test subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The audio receivers during this test were put on a frequency of [REDACTED], as well as being placed in new locations around SCP-1170-1 in hopes of receiving more intelligible audio. Log begins immediately after the manifestation of SCP-1170-2. D-20192 is the sole test subject.</p>
<p><strong><em>Begin Log.</em></strong></p>
<p>D-20192: Oh my god, what the fuck is that. What the fuck is that.</p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: Please don't be scared. I only came here for you.</p>
<p>D-20192: Wait, what? For me? I'm a criminal. What do you want with me?</p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: I want to love you. We can be together.</p>
<p>D-20192: Uh, are you even a chick? I'm not into that other thing…</p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: I am not sure what a chick is, but I can assure you that our love will fit well.</p>
<p>D-20192: Dude, this is fucking weird. Oh, <em>(pause)</em>, god, I… I just…</p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: We can do it. This is where we can live. No barren residence, filled with ungratefuls, don't appreciate you. I want to love you.</p>
<p>D-20192: I… I want… <em>(sobbing)</em></p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: I love you.</p>
<p>D-20192: <em>(Sobbing continues, D-20192 moves to kneel beside SCP-1170-2)</em></p>
<p>SCP-1170-2: I need you.</p>
<p><strong><em>End Log.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Less than four (4) seconds after the conclusion of this audio log, SCP-1170-2 and D-20192 simultaneously disappeared from the room.</p>
