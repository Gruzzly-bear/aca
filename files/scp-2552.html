            <h1>SCP-2552</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2552</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2552 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment unit located at Site-17. SCP-2552 is to be fed three meals a day and is allowed fluids upon request. Personnel delivering food or fluid to SCP-2552 are not to interact with it. SCP-2552 is to be allowed access to recreational activities upon request in exchange for cooperative behavior, as well as paper and crayon to make requests. SCP-2552 is to be interviewed on a weekly basis by Dr. Lin. More frequent interviews may be granted upon request, depending on continued cooperative behavior and Dr. Lin's schedule. Interviews with SCP-2552 are to be accompanied by one other personnel of any level. These personnel are not to interact with Dr. Lin during the interview and are not to interact with SCP-2552 at all.</p>
<p>Should Dr. Lin be permanently unavailable, SCP-2552 is to be notified of this in writing so it may prepare to familiarize itself with the replacement. Potential replacements must fit criteria detailed in Document-2552 and follow familiarizing methods as detailed in Protocol 2552. The personnel selected for replacement is encouraged to maintain a cordial relationship with SCP-2552 in order to better study it. However, care must be taken to maintain SCP-2552's ignorance of the Foundation and other Groups of Interest.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2552 is a 14 year old multiethnic male (Han Chinese and African American primarily) known as "Kevin Sanders". SCP-2552 displays no physiological abnormalities. SCP-2552 is fluent in both Simplified Chinese (Mandarin dialect) and American English.</p>
<p>SCP-2552 is incapable of perceiving humans it is unfamiliar with. Instead, SCP-2552 perceives a specific entity referred to as SCP-2552-A in the place of any humans it is unfamiliar with and will perceive multiple identical iterations of SCP-2552-A if interacting with multiple unfamiliar humans. SCP-2552-A is only able to be visually recorded if SCP-2552 is using the equipment with the intention of filming SCP-2552-A. SCP-2552-A varies its appearance and appears to be sapient. SCP-2552-A will vaguely mimic the actions of the human it is replacing but will purposefully exaggerate movements and facial expressions with the apparent intention of encouraging SCP-2552 to avoid human contact. The most reliable way to communicate and gain familiarity with SCP-2552 is to converse through writing.</p>
<p>Currently, SCP-2552 perceives every other human it has met as SCP-2552-A with the only exception being Dr. Lin, who developed the currently-used method of gaining familiarity with SCP-2552. SCP-2552 is highly cooperative with Dr. Lin; it is believed that SCP-2552 is dependent on Dr. Lin for emotional support and fulfillment of social needs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> December █, 20██<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-2552<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Lin<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> This interview is the first interview in which SCP-2552 was able to discuss SCP-2552-A with Dr. Lin in significant detail. The process of providing an unfamiliar human for SCP-2552-A to be perceived had not yet been implemented in order to allow SCP-2552 a feeling of safety with Dr. Lin. SCP-2552 had been provided with writing material in the case it becomes too anxious to speak. Dr. Lin has been granted temporary permission to freely use SCP-2552's name in order to foster a cordial relationship with SCP-2552.<br/>
<strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Good afternoon. How are we doing today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> [SCP-2552 chews on sleeve for a period of approximately three seconds.] [indistinct mumbling]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> I'm afraid you will have to speak up for me to be able to hear you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> Have you figured out what's wrong with me yet?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Unfortunately not. We'd need more information about the entity you see in order to be able to help you, Kevin. Do you think you could do that for me today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> I think so. I call her Susana. She has a real name but it hurts too much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> When did you first begin seeing Susana?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> Maybe when I was 6 or 7 I had an imaginary friend I called her Susana. Back then I would pretend that some random strangers I see were Susana just pretending to be people and it was a fun game like hide and seek with her. My mom thought it was cute and encouraged the strangers to play along. Somewhere along the line, I dunno maybe six and a half that things started getting weird.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Would you mind explaining further?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> I noticed when I was really little some people weren't like me pretending that they were her. They were really her. I remember having a big argument with her, because it was really inconvenient that I was trying to buy ice cream from the ice cream truck and she showed up and started talking to me. I think I told her I knew she wasn't real and told her I wasn't gonna pretend her into people anymore. Then, then she started getting mad and and-[SCP-2552 begins to cry.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Do you want to stop now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> [SCP-2552 shakes his head.] She disappeared for a while after that. I didn't try to pretend her into people anymore. I think after my tenth birthday I saw her again at the park. Maybe she was a homeless man or something but she looked up and grinned and her grin was, was really disturbing. Too big. Reached up to me and asked for change but the voice was all messed up. I got scared and ran back and, and after a while she kept showing up, more and more often until she was- she was everywhere. She was everyone. People wouldn't believe me, so I, I got pictures o-on my phone… Then you people came along…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> It's okay now, Kevin. We're going to fix this, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552:</strong> Please hurry. I miss my mom. I miss my friends. I miss everything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> We'll do our best. When you've calmed down enough I'll take you to your room, ok? [Dr. Lin reaches over to squeeze SCP-2552's hand in a reassuring manner.]</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> March █, 20██<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-2552-A<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Lin<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-2552 was given a blindfold for this interview and was requested to hold recording equipment in order to conduct the interview with SCP-2552-A. The recording was available to Dr. Lin in real time to allow her to react to SCP-2552-A appropriately. This was the first attempt at establishing contact with SCP-2552-A, taking the place of D-7220 at the time of interview.<br/>
<strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Hello. Can you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> [SCP-2552-A appears to be a humanoid mass of Brachyceran fly larvae, commonly known as maggots, with a lamprey mouth in place of a human mouth. Several of the larvae shrivel and blacken, forming into a 'YES'. SCP-2552-A continues communicating in this manner.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> [Dr. Lin pauses for ten seconds upon viewing the recording.] Do you know where you are right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> YES. YOU ARE A FRIEND.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Are you aware of your influence on SCP-2552?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> I DON'T WANT TO DIE. YOU KNOW? I'VE BEEN THERE. TO NOTHING.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> I do not understand. Would you be willing to explain?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> YOU CAN'T BLAME ME. YOU WOULD DO THE SAME. IN MY POSITION. YOU CAN'T BLAME ME. I'M NOT BAD.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> I'm not blaming you for anything, SCP-2552-A. I only want to understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> I DON'T MEAN. TO HURT HIM. I JUST WANT TO LIVE TOO. IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK? [SCP-2552-A appears to tilt its head back and its facial area splits in half. Greenish slime is produced from the resulting hole. This movement coincides with D-2270 leaning back and yawning.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Please calm down. I am not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> I WANT TO LIVE. I WANT TO LIVE. I JUST. WANT TO LIVE. I AM NO K[illegible]. I CANNOT SIMPLY. LEAVE A STORY. THAT NO LONGER SUITS ME.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lin:</strong> Could you explain further?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2552-A:</strong> THERE IS NO POINT. I JUST. WANT TO LIVE. [SCP-2552-A refuses to answer any other questions.]</p>
