<hr/>
<p><strong>Event:</strong> The unexplained disappearance of Dr. Justin Krusen and his family.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant evidence:</strong> Various objects gathered from Dr. Krusen's residence.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Bloodied dog collar</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Diminished. This belonged to a creature that was once the center of a joyful and harmonious household. This item was warmed by countless loving embraces. A distant time."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Broken keyboard</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> “Notable. This was obliterated in a fit of apoplectic fury. Years of suppressed frustration, resentment, and stress culminated in its destruction. As one victim escapes this prison, another is captured."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Kitchen knife</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> “Lasting. Thoughts of regret and deceit idly passed through its possessor's mind. A despondent soul contemplated taking risks and embarking on adventures, but never acted upon such desires.”</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Blanket</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> “Enduring. A lonely, unloved soul's only source of comfort through years of isolation. Almost every night, this item was soaked in tears."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Video game controller</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Fleeting. This served as a vessel of escapism in a cruel world devoid of compassion and peace. The possessor departed long ago."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Diary with pages torn out</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intimate. Its pages were filled with the emotions, dreams and aspirations of a once-optimistic adolescent. Such hope dissipated over the years, supplanted by bitter cynicism. This was mangled with deceptive intentions."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Restaurant receipt</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Negligible. This was the result of a last-ditch effort to repair an unsalvageable rift. Both its possessors were filled with hatred and indignation."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> SIG Sauer P220 (semi-automatic pistol)</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intense. Initially, this was purchased to protect innocent lives, but its single usage was a perversion of that purpose. This instrument was hidden for years. Thoughts of an estranged spouse, vengeance, and anxiety rushed through the executioner's mind."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Turkish Airlines boarding pass printout</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Weak. This was hastily created. The possessor discarded it upon realizing its futility."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Torn t-shirt</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Significant. A familiar article of clothing, once chosen for its aesthetic qualities. Its other half remains with a terrified, uncertain soul in a foreign land."</p>

<p><strong>Event:</strong> The death of Edwin Field (voluntarily terminated employment with the Foundation).</p>
<p><strong>Relevant evidence:</strong> Various objects gathered from Field's room and apartment building.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Teddy bear</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Weak. A forgotten relic. This was once a child's beloved companion, ever-present in their thoughts and dreams. That child outgrew the desire for friends, but not make-believe nor fantasy."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Photograph</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intimate. This once rekindled feelings of comradery, nostalgia, and endearment. After a cataclysmic accident, the possessor only felt sadness and emptiness upon seeing this item."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Paper job application</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Weak. This was first received with excitement and anticipation. Such feelings quickly vanished, replaced with indifference. This was discarded in the same manner as rotten food."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Wine glass</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intimate. After one fateful day, this became a broken soul's companion. This was used to manifest wishful thinking in the evenings."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Credit card</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Significant. Extreme dread consumed a desperate mind. This fueled the possessor's self-destructive path. Overusing this item rendered it obsolete."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Rubber band</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Lasting. This originated from an establishment of debauchery and exploitation."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Comic book</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intimate. This was a light in someone's dark world. Although the tormented soul had lost everything in the real world, the world of imagination had always treated them well."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Pig's severed head</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Visceral. A wicked soul acting on behalf of their master left this as a warning."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Noose</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Mortal. Although the victim suffered from unbearable dejection, this senseless act of violence was not self-inflicted. This atrocity was prolonged to extract information. There was a cunning attempt to disguise the nature of this crime."</p>

<p><strong>Relevant evidence:</strong> Various objects gathered from Dr. Locke's residence.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Laminated performance report</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Acute. This item would bring immense pleasure to most, but an ambitious soul considered everything less than perfection to be an utter failure. Always hungry, but never satisfied."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Sealed envelope</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Weak. A message of outreach sent by concerned relatives. This was given absolutely no consideration."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Empty beverage can</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Noteworthy. This type of synthetic elixir was consumed daily to artificially enhance the possessor's vitality. Unbeknownst to them, it contributed to their deteriorating health."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Shattered hand mirror</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Persistent. This item conjured feelings of great shame and inadequacy. It was solely used to identify flaws, most of which didn't exist."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Unknown device</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Essential. This contraption altered the structure and chemical composition of the brain. An invaluable part of a quest to surpass one's biological limits and unlock esoteric knowledge. However, such gains did not come without a cost."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Driver's license</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Potent. A delirious soul abandoned this item in their hasty departure, convinced they were on the verge of discovering something important."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Glasses</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Intimate. This was essentially worn at all times. Its possessor would be rendered helpless without its aid. It likely could have prevented a tragic mistake leading to a watery abyss."</p>

<p><strong>Event:</strong> The unexplained disappearance of Security Officer Trevor Cruz, Dr. Amy Randle, and several other Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant evidence:</strong> Various objects gathered from Dr. Randle's property and residence.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Printed invitation letter</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Persistent. This misleading text was used to obfuscate a sinister agenda."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Security key card</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Significant. This was often misused to unlawfully obtain equipment."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Magnetic shackles</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Extreme. Unsuspecting, petrified souls were prevented from escape. They met a gruesome end, dying in fear and alone."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Grimoire</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Diabolical. This conduit for demonic presence offered endless promises. A nefarious duo attempted to outsmart forces beyond their comprehension."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Bloodied scalpel</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Overwhelming. This was used to inflict immense, unnecessary suffering to prepare so-called offerings."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Pen with unknown markings</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> [AI translation of unknown language] "Absolute. Every mortal who touched this item became instantly seduced by dark forces, becoming merely a puppet. Due to foolishness and pride, countless lost souls sealed their fate."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Unknown skull fragment</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Eternal. This belonged to an oppressive soul who was transformed into a being of virtually infinite power. They rule over a desolate, horrific domain no mortal would envy. Such a monarch inherits the sins of vast ranks of hellish warriors, and in doing so, experiences proportional agony."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> Unknown dismembered hand</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> "Eternal. This belonged to a venturous, depraved soul who was shown macabre sights not meant for mortal eyes. Supreme knowledge of the mystical arts was bestowed upon them. Having been drained of every ounce of sanity, they wander a dark, endless expanse."</p>

<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> Daria, good morning. How's it going?</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> Agent Sobaski, I was calling to check in on you. Are you experiencing any difficulty with SCP-8455?</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> No, not at all. The object's been incredibly useful, you have nothing but my gratitude. It's just that…</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> I'm listening.</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> I wasn't always like this. Before, I just perceived everything as information to piece together an incident.</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> But now, it's much harder to disassociate. I'm often afraid of what I might learn from SCP-8455. I feel genuine sadness toward all these people who I'd previously dehumanize and reduce to a written report. Now, when I handle someone's possessions, I wonder what their daily life was like, what sort of interactions they had, how they felt in certain moments. They -</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> I don't have time for this. Do you intend to keep using the object or not? Because there are other parties who have requested its transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> I'd like to keep using it, if possible. But, I had to get tha-</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> Understood, please be quiet. [Sigh] Seeing as your performance metrics haven't experienced any shifts, there's nothing left for me to discuss. Do you have any final comments or concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> Actually, I…</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> [Groans] Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> I'm sorry. That was all.</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> A word of advice, agent: stop feeling sorry for yourself. You're not special. On the contrary, you're extremely replaceable despite being in such a privileged position. I don't care if you have to put on a mask to get through your day. Just find a way to sort out your problems or I will.</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> Next time, please report only legitimate issues related to the object. I'm not your therapist, and it is an utter waste of my time and this department's resources to discuss irrelevant matters. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> Please, can you -</p>
<p><strong>Nawaz:</strong> Understood, Agent Sobaski? Were you even listening?</p>
<p><strong>Sobaski:</strong> Yes, I understand. But -</p>
