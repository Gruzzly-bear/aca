            <h1>SCP-7762</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7762</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7762 is to remain within a standard anomalous humanoid containment chamber at Site-97 until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7762 is Wynonna “Winnie” Harker. It is a 28-year-old Anglo-Indian female and a former Foundation researcher. It was placed into containment following an incident in which it displayed symptoms of an acute hematophagous substance consumption disorder tantamount to a debilitating appetite for human blood. Prior to its containment, it exhibited extreme aggression toward Foundation personnel and members of Site-97’s in-house security detail, continuously attempting to utilize objects around it, its fingernails, and its teeth to cause bleeding to those restraining it. Following its containment, it began to exhibit a post-traumatic unresponsiveness toward Foundation questioning, necessitating immediate psychological evaluations conducted by a Foundation-sanctioned psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Incident SCP-7762-1 resulted in the exsanguination and desecration of its romantic partner and coworker, Researcher Dean Pludveil. A series of precise lacerations to several of Researcher Pludveil’s muscular arteries allowed it to orally draw approximately 4,800 mL of blood from his body. The implement utilized to inflict the lacerations, in addition to Researcher Pludveil’s tongue, has yet to be located. Immediately following its initial psychological evaluation, it is scheduled to undergo a round of radiographic imaging. The remaining 200 mL of Researcher Pludveil’s blood is to be submitted to a contamination screening and analysis.<br/>

<p><strong>Incident Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Person(s) / Anomaly Involved:</strong> Lt. Susan Acaster, Doctor Jaan Seacost, SCP-7762</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Lt. Susan Acaster, a member of Site-97’s in-house security detail, was ordered to retrieve SCP-7762 from Doctor Jaan Seacost’s office following its initial psychological evaluation. Reproduced below is a transcription of Acaster’s raw body camera footage.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Acaster raps her knuckles on the door to Seacost’s office.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acaster:</strong> Doctor Seacost? Your time is up. I’m here to escort 7762 back to its containment chamber.</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acaster:</strong> Doctor Seacost, you’ve gone over your allotted time. You’ll be able to continue during 7762’s next psych eval.</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acaster:</strong> <em>(whispering)</em> Fuckin’ shrinks…</p>
<p><em>Acaster grabs the doorknob and pushes the door open.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acaster:</strong> Alright, I’m coming in—</p>
<p><em>Acaster freezes. SCP-7762’s body is on the floor, surrounded by a pool of its blood. A jagged slash of rended flesh is ripped across its throat, though the laceration has stopped spouting blood. In its limp hand is a gored pair of scissors, its twin blades coated in a crimson sheen. Seacost is on his knees beside the body, his face splattered with blood. Its other hand is raised to his mouth as he suckles from a scratch on its wrist, stray beads of blood spiraling down its forearm.</em></p>
<p><em>Seacost slowly raises his head as Acaster enters, unceremoniously dropping SCP-7762’s hand. His eyes are stretched wide, pupils dilated until the irises appear entirely black. His nose twitches and his tongue is lolled from his agape mouth, pinkish and sinuous strands of saliva and viscera dripping from the corners of his slackened jaw.</em></p>
<p><em>Seacost lowers his hands to the floor and stalks toward Acaster, clambering over SCP-7762’s body in the process. In an instant, he lunges at her, his hands splayed and his teeth bared.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acaster:</strong> S—SHIT—</p>
<p><em>Acaster attempts to draw her pistol but is unable to do so before she is tackled into the hallway outside of Seacost’s office. A single gunshot echoes, followed by muffled gagging and a wet tearing.</em></p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7762</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Overseer Council has sanctioned the formation of MTF Rho-7 (“Die, Mosquito, Die!”), a Mobile Task Force assigned with executing Operation Helsing’s Angels, a Foundation initiative aimed at ceasing the consumption of human blood by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>The event that initially triggers instances of SCP-7762 within infected individuals prior to their consumption of human blood is currently unknown. Thus, the Foundation’s primary objective is the total neutralization of SCP-7762 from within its ranks while monitoring potential outbreaks throughout the civilian world.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7762 is a hematological cognitohazard that affects individuals by enhancing the taste of human blood to an extent that, if consumed, will compel infected individuals to seek out and ingest large quantities of human blood. Additionally, the cognitohazard may be contracted through the consumption of an infected individual’s blood.</p>
