<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6405 is to remain anchored at its current position by steel wire tethers that are to be replaced biannually or as deemed necessary by Command. Patrol ships are to maintain a 5 km perimeter around SCP-6405, preventing unauthorized access. Due to environmental conditions, all Foundation personnel are to be equipped with cold weather attire. The use of earplugs is mandatory due to the deafening vocalizations of SCP-6405-1.</p>
<p>Personnel are to be rotated every three months due to the physiological and psychological stress caused by the low temperature, remote nature of the location, lack of direct sunlight, and the persistent vocalizations of SCP-6405-1.</p>
<p>Boarding SCP-6405 is strictly prohibited until further notice.</p>

<p>Personnel are to only board the vessel as part of authorized exploration missions. Selected personnel are to be delivered by speedboat and must disembark SCP-6405 in under 9 minutes. Objects are not to be removed from SCP-6405 and are to be instead photographed with non-electronic cameras.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6405 is a 134.16 m length cruise ship. Research into the origins of the vessel revealed that it had been registered anonymously to the Bahamas Maritime Authority, a popular flag of convenience<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The Foundation has since been able to trace ownership, through transaction records and the questioning of Bahamas Maritime Authority employees, to Rufus Dreschner - film producer and high ranking member of the Fifth Church.</p>
<p>Infrared readings have revealed a humanoid entity within the lower hold which has since been classified as SCP-6405-1. SCP-6405-1 continuously vocalizes at &gt;150 dB. These vocalizations, along with the observed movements of SCP-6405-1, are suggestive of a perpetual state of pain and an inability to leave the room in which it is presently located. SCP-6405-1 emits a periodic burst of radiation on par with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, highly lethal<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> but quickly dissipating for reasons still unknown. These bursts occur approximately every 9 minutes, though the reason for the pause/delay has yet to be determined. Electronics brought aboard SCP-6405 are immediately rendered inoperable regardless of when a burst event occurs. Non-digital photography is a viable means of gathering information in the limited time allotted for exploration. Objects removed from SCP-6405 rapidly disintegrate, resulting in photography being the only means of gathering information from items and documents discovered aboard.</p>
<p>SCP-6405 was discovered during the investigation of a "double flash" of light detected by an American satellite<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> at coordinates 47°S 40°E on September 22, 1979. The event was publicly hypothesized to be the result of a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test near the South African controlled Prince Edward Islands. The Foundation, suspecting a potentially anomalous event, proceeded to investigate.</p>
<p>Passenger manifests and dossiers recovered from SCP-6405 support the existence of a once extensive crew. However, out of the 1,892 people mentioned, only one has been definitively proven to have ever existed outside of documents found on SCP-6405 (see SCP-6405-1). Social Security numbers and bank accounts fail to correspond with any persons, living or deceased. Journal entries and missives found on board suggest the purpose of SCP-6405 was to serve as a reeducation center for members (and former members) of the Fifth Church. The general living quarters were found to be cramped and lockable from the outside, closely resembling prison cells, while those inhabited by higher ranking members of the Fifth Church were noted to be of ample size and lavishly furnished. Although no human remains have ever been recovered, clothing can be found scattered throughout the ship's interior, evidently discarded as entire outfits and covered with a black residue of unknown origin.</p>
<p>SCP-6405-1 is believed to be Sophia Salazar (formerly Sophia Efron), a soprano with the Vox Aeterna opera company and wife of Carlos Salazar, a wealthy and influential member of the Fifth Church. Sophia Salazar had been reported missing by friends and family not associated with the Fifth Church. The Los Angeles Police Department claimed to have investigated the matter, visiting Carlos Salazar's Hollywood mansion, and declaring Sophia Salazar to be safe. She has not been seen in public since 1974.</p>
<p>Operatives have reported and captured photographs of Foundation-issued uniforms and equipment throughout SCP-6405. Identification cards do not match recorded personnel, living or deceased, and were initially considered forgeries, though how the Fifth Church gained the necessary classified information to do this remains unknown. Further complicating the matter is the recent discovery of Foundation materials only created or employed after the discovery of SCP-6405. These objects number in the thousands and have rendered certain parts of SCP-6405 inaccessible without excavation.</p>

<p>“Her bad vibrations make her bad for the church. Should have just gotten rid of her but Mr. Salazar thinks we can fix her. Who am I to question a CS-VII? Most here just want to give all they can. So much love. Already gifted all their worldly possessions. Bodies too. Not like they'll need them in the long run.”</p>
<p>“Salazar’s problem spit on my face today. It’s like she doesn’t even want to ascend. What a psycho bitch. Stupid! Decided to do a little ‘corrective therapy’ but she lost consciousness about an hour in. I take pride in my work and expect a captive audience. Got pretty messy in there, so figured I’d let the other aberrations clean up. You know, let her be an example of what happens if they deviate from the program.”</p>
<p>“We've been at this one for years now. Must have pissed off Mr. Salazar something fierce. Her flow is all wrong. Told us to correct her but I don't think he even cares anymore. Easy enough to replace. Keep up appearances. I wanted to toss her overboard but Armitage radioed us, says he got something special planned and needs the bitch alive, for now. If Armitage tells you to do something you fucking do it. Man's CS level is out of this world.”</p>
<p>“We docked at Cali and shit, the equipment they set us up with? We're gonna make Salazar's little problem disappear. The Fifth World ain't for everybody.”</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On 06/21/1991, a photograph was obtained by a D-Class personnel (the first sent) and returned safely to the Foundation Control Ship. The image depicts a heavy vault door with an observational window. Although the photograph revealed an empty cell, it appears to be the room containing SCP-6405-1 based on thermal readings. It has thus been hypothesized that SCP-6405-1 cannot be observed by the naked eye. Closer analysis of the photograph uncovered words carved in the back wall of the cell. Although difficult to read, scans with image retrieval software revealed the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“MAY THEIR NAMES AND MEMORIES BE OBLITERATED”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent photographs from the ship suggest that orange D-Class jumpsuits now outnumber plain clothes and operative attire. Also noted was a sudden jump in discarded cameras within SCP-6405.</p>
<p>The O5 Council has ordered the cessation of all SCP-6405 related exploration and experimentation until further notice.</p>
