            <h1>SCP-3094</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3094</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The building containing SCP-3094 has been fenced off and is to be monitored at all times by security cameras and occasional patrols. Renovations to the outside of the building have been completed to deter people from attempting to explore the location due to its local reputation for being abandoned and haunted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3094 is an empty elevator shaft located within the former site of ████████ Aquarium and Conservatory. The shaft has a width of 4 m and a length of 5.5 m. It extends up to the third floor of the building, and descends to an unknown depth, though the building does not have a basement or any floor below the ground level. People and objects lowered into SCP-3094 are estimated to disappear completely at a depth of approximately 30 m below the ground floor entrance to the shaft. To this date, the only thing recovered from SCP-3094 is Agent Brandt.</p>
<p>The Foundation was alerted to SCP-3094 after an abnormal amount of missing person reports were filed in the area, including a police officer who investigated the building after multiple reports of individuals falling into the elevator shaft. Splashing sounds without any apparent source had been reported in the building for several decades. Several victims of drowning have also been found near the building over the years, with no nearby bodies of water or signs of the deceased individuals' bodies having been moved from another location.</p>
<p>An unmanned drone was sent into SCP-3094, but contact was lost with the drone at approximately 30 meters below the entrance to the shaft; at the same time that contact was lost, a loud splashing sound was heard. Under the assumption that the drone had fallen into a pool of water and malfunctioned, Agent Holm and Agent Brandt were then tasked with descending into SCP-3094 with waterproof recording equipment. Upon reaching 30 meters below the entrance to the shaft, contact was lost with both agents. Neither agent reported any abnormalities up to the point of disappearance. Further attempts to explore the shaft resulted in the loss of all equipment used.</p>
<p>Agent Brandt was later recovered in Libreville, Gabon, Africa. He claims he appeared somewhere in Pongara National Park, requiring him to hike for miles through the jungle until a park ranger found him and returned him to civilization. He had also managed to retain his waterproof audio recorder. While his voice is almost entirely inaudible, the rest of the audio was salvaged and seems to confirm Agent Brandt's account of his experience after disappearing into SCP-3094. An interview with Agent Brandt can be found below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Agent Brandt, could you please tell me what happened to you and Agent Holm after you descended past 30 meters below the entrance to SCP-3094? Provide as much detail as you can reliably recall.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> As I said before, I really don't know what happened to Holm. She was next to me, rappelling into the shaft, and the next thing I know the rope in my hands is gone and I'm falling. I fell maybe 50 meters into a body of water. It was pitch black, and I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> And you then immediately attempted to reach the surface of the water?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Yes, that's correct. I'm fairly certain I swam straight up, but in the darkness and confusion I could be wrong. Either way, when I reached the surface of the water, I discovered the elevator shaft was no longer above me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> What was above you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Metal. A ceiling of sorts? I hit my head on it. At that point I started panicking because I realized there was only about 5 cm between the water and the ceiling. I practically had to kiss the metal to keep my mouth and nose above the water. It was rusty and smelled like seaweed. The water seemed brackish, and the smell of everything was overwhelming at first. I'm not sure how I didn't lose it completely and just drown.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> What did you do then?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> I figured the shaft had to be somewhere close, and even if I was disoriented, I knew it shouldn't be too difficult to find it so I had more room to breathe, maybe call up to the research team and let them know what happened. So I started looking, keeping my face above the water as best I could, feeling along the metal for the opening. I probably did that for twenty minutes before I realized I wasn't going to find it, that maybe it wasn't even there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Did you attempt to locate Agent Holm at any point?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> At first I had completely forgotten about her in my panic. Once I was focused on finding the shaft, I remembered, and called out for her a few times. Never got a response. I was actually calling out for her when the water began to light up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> The water itself lit up?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Actually, I heard a loud splash first. And then the water, or something in it, started to light up. I yelled again for Holm, but that was when the water started to rise.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> It noticeably rose?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Yes. All the way to the ceiling. And I knew that I was going to die then. That's… when things got weird.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Continue please.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Well, the water was over my head, but I could breathe somehow. And I could see. And I don't just mean because of the light source. I could see in the water as if I was wearing swim goggles or a scuba mask. Everything was crystal clear. I could see what was giving off the light.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> What was it?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> It was a very large owl. Well, it looked like an owl, but it was massive. I'd say it was about 70 meters away from me, and yet I could see it perfectly through the water. It looked like it was at least 60 meters tall. It had very long legs for an owl though, which was part of why it was so tall. And it had a crown on its head.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> A crown?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Yes. It was bright gold, so it caught my attention immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> What was your reaction upon seeing this entity?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Dr. Bekker, I was going through a lot of emotions at that point. Terror was in there somewhere, for sure. But I was also very confused, tired, and also in awe. You know how some people just exude charisma?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Yes, I do know what you mean, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> This thing exuded something like that. Not charisma though. It was like a mixture of horror and wonder and something else that was just…incomprehensible. I sensed it was going to speak to me seconds before it opened its mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> What did it say to you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> At first it was just noise. Awful, awful noise. Sounded like an orchestra of broken trumpets all vying to be heard over each other. I instinctually covered my ears but it was still just as loud. I yelled at it to stop, but it wouldn't. And then slowly, I realized there were words in the noise. It…it…can you just give me a second, Dr. Bekker?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Of course. This was traumatizing, I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> No. I mean, sort of. I…I want to tell you everything in detail, but speaking with it was difficult to describe. Everything about it felt very, very wrong. And trying to remember that wrongness, which is just so hard to put into words, feels like it's draining me. I feel like I'm not meant to remember or repeat any of this. I wish I could more eloquently explain the bizarre emotions I'm feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> It's okay, Agent Brandt. Just tell me what you can. We can always take a break and try later.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> I'm not sure a break would help. Is it okay if just summarize it? Maybe I can try writing down the details later or something. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> A summary is fine for now. I will warn you that the director probably will want more than that from you eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Of course, yeah. I understand. Give me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> When I realized I could hear words within the cacophony, I was able to focus on them, and realized it was asking me a question. It wanted to know why I was there. I told it I didn't know, and I asked it where I was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> And it responded to you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Yeah. It was difficult to understand its answers. It spoke in an odd combination of Danish and English,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and it had a cadence to its speech that was…discomforting. None of what it said made much sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Could you understand anything?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> It said something about a very big gap or drop. Something about visiting. Something about separation. I didn't know what to say to that, so I asked it if it knew where Agent Holm was. Do you think we can stop now? I'm honestly quite exhausted, mentally and physically.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> Just summarize the rest as best you can, and we can be done for now.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> It said something about the "eve cunt" being separated, something about property. At that point its voice was making me feel ill and I didn't want to know what it meant anymore. I asked it if I could please go home. It said no. So I begged it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> How did it respond to that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> It made me some sort of offer. And I took it. Dr. Bekker, I have no idea what I agreed to. I just know that it laughed and the sound was like an audience of predator animals screaming all at once. And the next thing I knew, I was in the jungle. I really need to be done now. I can't talk about this anymore. My head hurts and I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bekker:</strong> We can be done for now, Agent Brandt.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Brandt:</strong> Thank you, Dr. Bekker.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> Agent Brandt is currently under the care of Site 24's head psychiatrist, following a nervous breakdown he experienced a few days after his interview with Dr. Bekker. It is believed this breakdown was triggered when Agent Brandt discovered a marking or burn on his shoulder that resembles a raven's head. Further interviews with Agent Brandt are restricted at this time.</p>
