            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7189</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7189 hibernation sites are continually monitored, but not disturbed. Known hotspots of SCP-7189 activity have been purchased by the Foundation front group the Society for Conservation and Protection and restricted to public access. SCP-7189 activity within these areas is monitored by drones and remote sensors. If Foundation personnel must enter these regions they should travel in armed groups of at least ten, wearing flint blades on their body, and remain in contact with at least one person with 4/7189 clearance or higher. If unauthorized personnel enter these areas or attempt to approach inactive SCP-7189 instances, they are to be terminated as soon as possible. Entering areas of SCP-7189 activity is authorized in this scenario. If personnel encounter SCP-7189, the unit is to be immediately debriefed. At least one staff member with 4/7189 clearance or higher must be present at the debriefing.</p>
<p>Alexandria.aic is currently monitoring global sensor and communication networks for signs of SCP-7189 activity, and MTF Gamma-4 ("Green Stags") has been assigned to follow up on potential sightings. Akiva and Kant counters have proven unable to detect SCP-7189 and should not be used in the field. Scantron Reality Anchors do not protect from SCP-7189 intrusion.</p>
<p>Known SCP-7189 cults are to be terminated or amnesticized as appropriate. Contacts of known SCP-7189 worshipers are also to be surveilled, and terminated or amnesticized at the earliest opportunity if found to be in contact with SCP-7189 instances.</p>
<p><a href="scp-561.html">SCP-561</a> is to be decommissioned once access to it can be regained. All Pleistocene organisms within are to be euthanized, incinerated, and stored at Reliquary Area-27. Flint blades are to be placed in each box containing their ashes. Access is restricted to personnel with 3/7189 clearance. Formerly extinct Pleistocene wildlife not created by SCP-7189 or SCP-561 (such as those that travel through temporal anomalies, are resurrected through necromancy, and so on) are to be euthanized and incinerated if possible. If not, Procedure Jaktorów is to be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7189 is a collection of theologic entities taking the form of extinct organisms from the Pleistocene era. Over a hundred instances have been discovered so far, individually designated SCP-7189-1 through SCP-7189-107. Instances have been encountered on every continent but Antarctica. Most SCP-7189 instances are mammalian, but many are birds or reptiles. Four are plants, and one is a previously unknown species of snail (tentatively identified as a member of <em>Discus</em>). Without exception all instances of SCP-7189 are unusually large for their species, but the degree varies with instance. Generally, smaller organisms display more pronounced gigantism than larger ones. The appearances of SCP-7189 instances are somewhat inconsistent between manifestations. While species is a constant, instances frequently display open wounds, partial necrosis or skeletonization, and translucence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Behaviorally, SCP-7189 instances are similar to their once-living counterparts. This has been verified by study of <a href="scp-561.html">SCP-561</a> and the use of temporal anomalies. No signs of higher cognition have been reported, in contrast to theologic entities generated through human consciousness. During periods of activity SCP-7189 instances have been observed engaging in agnostic displays towards each other, courting closely related SCP-7189 instances, and predating on each other. SCP-7189 are unable to permanently harm or kill each other, and consumed instances usually manifest one to three months later. SCP-7189 instances appear unaware of their semi-necrotic nature.</p>
<p>When active, SCP-7189 are able to demanifest and remanifest, apparently without regard for distance. SCP-7189 occasionally use this ability to travel between continents. However, SCP-7189 instances have never been found outside of their respective representative species' former range. In addition, SCP-7189 naturally avoid heavily modified landscapes and human populations. SCP-7189 instances will attack (and, depending on the species, may consume) isolated humans, however.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-7189 begin to heal and display limited control over their environment as the worldwide population of their physical counterparts increases. At the time of discovery several instances, especially SCP-7189-4<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and SCP-7189-11<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> had regrown substantial healthy tissue and were able to remain awake continually. Since the beginning of containment procedures their recovery has partially reversed, but they have not returned to full hibernation yet.</p>
<p>The Foundation was first alerted to the existence of SCP-7189 on June 10, 2010 after several users of the Urban Exploration Resource forum posted that they had encountered an "undead rhino" while exploring the ghost town of ███████, Russia. Site-6 sent was alerted and managed to identify the users. It was determined that they had already told many of their friends and acquaintances about the encounter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Mikkel Nordby, Ketil Dahl, and Astrid Hoey</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Arild Soren (Cryptozoology Division)</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The three urban explorers were informed that Dr. Soren was a cryptozoologist and wished to speak to them. The interview was held at a house Site-6 maintains for interviews with civilians when apparent police involvement would be unhelpful. Prior to beginning, the interviewees were dosed with a very mild truth serum, dissolved in their water.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> Why the hell are you taking us seriously, anyway? Everyone else thought we were making shit up. <em>I</em> half thought we were making shit up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> There were three of you and you all saw it. I've learned to take even the most unlikely leads seriously. I didn't think Selma was real, but the fish finder sure showed quite the creature!</p>
<p><strong>Nordby:</strong> You saw Selma?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> Well, not <em>saw</em>, but they were definitely there. It's on my blog.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>[The three interviewees exchange slightly awkward looks. Dr. Soren clears his throat.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> Anyway, why don't you start with when you arrived at ███████?</p>
<p><strong>Hoey:</strong> It was early morning. We used Mikkel's cousin's boat to reach the town. The skies were clear and the air was calm. Good conditions, if cold. We heard ███████'s docks were shit, so we beached on the shoreline. near the port. Must've spent a good four, five hours exploring the buildings—but you saw our posts about that, I guess. And that's not where we saw him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> Him?</p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> You notice the strangest things when dealing with adrenaline, that's all I'll say.</p>
<p><strong>Hoey:</strong> We'd finished looking around in ███████ and were going to hike a bit uphill for the view. Ketil also wanted to look for wildflowers.</p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> And because I was the only one looking around, I saw him first. He was big, real big. Must have been two and a half meters tall. Despite being half rotten he was still majestic. [pauses] He had fur. Most of it was fallen off, but there were some really shaggy parts. And, uh. He was grazing. Wasn't doing a very good job of it, though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> How many horns?</p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> I didn't see, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Hoey:</strong> I think two, but I can't be sure.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> What happened after you saw it, Ketil?</p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> I yelled, forget what exactly—</p>
<p><strong>Nordby:</strong> Pretty sure you said that there was a big fucking rhino—</p>
<p><strong>Dahl:</strong> Sounds about right. Anyway, then you two looked over and saw him too. But we only had a couple moments before he ran off. Couldn't even get my camera out to take a photo. After that we went back down and got back in the boat. Didn't want to stay there with whatever the fuck that was running around.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soren:</strong> Which way did it go?</p>
<p><strong>Hoey:</strong> Further inland. Didn't note anything but that. Did either of you? [Dahl and Nordby shake their heads]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Witnesses were given targeted amnestics to cloud (but not remove) memory of the encounter and erase all memory of the interview. Their forum posts were subtly edited to make the sighting seem less credible and introduce subtle inconsistencies. Follow-up surveillance has shown that all witnesses have begun to doubt their own memories of the incident and react with embarrassment when the topic is brought up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Access to the area was restricted under the pretense of a chemical spill. An operating base was set up at ███████, and MTF Gamma-4 ("Green Stags") was ordered to search the surrounding area for signs of anomalous wildlife. Initial explorations did not encounter SCP-7189, but camera traps were able to confirm the anomaly's presence and identify them as an unusually large wooly rhino (<em>Coelodonta antiquitatis</em>). They were given the designation of SCP-7189-1. A partially necrotic musk ox and feline were also observed, and tentatively identified as <em>Praeovibos priscus</em> (giant musk ox) and an unknown species of <em>Homotherium</em> (scimitar cat). These were given the designations SCP-7189-2 and SCP-7189-3 respectively.</p>
<p>SCP-7189-1 and SCP-7189-2 were observed to remain within a 10 square kilometer area (designed Area 7189-Alpha) and graze on desiccated plant material. SCP-7189-3 was usually observed hunting and occasionally pursued the other instances of SCP-7189. SCP-7189 avoided human presence but were frequently seen on camera traps.</p>
<p>By October, lack of hostile action on the part of SCP-7189 had led to the anomaly being declared Euclid and MTF Gamma-4 being reassigned to other duties. In the end of the year security presence was reduced, leading to researchers placing camera traps without escort. It was after security was relaxed that the first encounter between a member of the Foundation and SCP-7189 occurred, on May 10, 2012. This encounter has been subsequently classified as Incident 7189-1.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 7189-1:</strong> At 13:46, May 10, Junior Researcher Helene Koppang radioed Outpost 6-7189 reporting that she had sighted a herd of musk ox due east of ███████. A connection to SCP-7189-2 was immediately suspected but could not be confirmed. Musk ox are not not usually found in the area. Jr. Researcher Koppang was ordered to observe the herd from a distance and report back every five minutes.</p>
<p>At 13:50, Site-6 staff decided to radio collar several members of the herd so their movements could be monitored, and ordered a helicopter launched to sedate the animals from the air so they could be fitted with transmitters.</p>
<p>At 13:56, Jr. Researcher Koppang radioed in, stating that one of the animals had begun to go into labor. She remained on radio. The helicopter was ordered to hold position to avoid disturbing the herd during the birthing process. The musk-ox finished giving birth at 13:59, and was observed to be unusually large and strangely proportioned. At 14:00, Jr. Researcher Koppang reported spotting SCP-7189-2 approaching the herd.</p>
<p>Despite SCP-7189-2's partially decayed nature, the musk ox herd did not display any fear or attempt to avoid it. SCP-7189-2 nuzzled the calf and licked it, then demanifested. Jr. Researcher Koppang took several photos of their interactions. These show SCP-7189-2 with slightly larger patches of healthy tissue than before.</p>
<p>After SCP-7189-2 demanifested, the helicopter was ordered to continue towards the herd, which maintained position. At 14:23, the helicopter arrived and tranquilized three of musk ox, including the mother of the calf. The calf was crushed by its mother during sedation. The helicopter crew retrieved it and took it to Outpost 6-7189 for treatment, but it expired en route. Dissection and genetic testing showed significant anatomical and genetic differences between the calf and musk oxen (<em>Ovibos moschatus</em>), and near identical morphology and genetics to <em>P. priscus</em>. The calf's corpse was designated SCP-7189-2A and placed in cold storage.</p>
<p>Three days later, the following video logs were recorded from a remote camera.</p>

<p>The similarity to SCP-561 was immediately noted, and MTF Gamma-4 and a research team were sent in order to investigate SCP-561 and the surrounding area for signs of SCP-7189 activity. Surveillance of Area 7189-Alpha was increased, but at the time the musk ox herd was not euthanized.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1 — Investigation of SCP-561:</strong> The evacuation of ██████████, Saskatchewan took place rapidly enough that some records and artifacts remained in the town. While the Foundation seized medical and administrative records, it did not conduct an exhaustive search of the houses or the microfiche of the local newspaper at the time of the evacuation. Dr. Spencer Black, who led the SCP-561 team when the anomaly was first being investigated, assumed that police and birth records would be sufficient to identify the beginning of the SCP-561 effect.</p>
<p>The investigation's search of the microfiche discovered several sightings of 'a giant jaguar with leprosy'<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> starting in the 1950s, and testimony from one hunter who claimed to have found the creature's den. Upon return, the animal was gone but the cave was littered with subfossil remains. All sightings were south of town, deep inside SCP-561's approximate area. The cave's subfossil deposits were not preserved, but Foundation paleontologists viewed the photos and believe the bones were moved into the cave over several thousand years. Some bones from the cave were retained by ██████████'s residents and left behind when ██████████ was evacuated. The most recent bones are too new to test with radiocarbon dating. The rest of the bones are prehistoric.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1960s, Pleistocene wildlife such as saber-toothed cats (<em>Smilodon fatalis</em>), dire wolves (<em>Aenocyon dirus</em>), and giant beavers (<em>Castoroides ohioensis</em>) began to be sighted south of town. All sightings were brief and in poor conditions. This led to the animals were misidentified as feral dogs, mutant cougars, and unusually large beavers, so the records of their existence were not noted when initially investigating SCP-561. At this time, domestic cats and humans gave birth to normal offspring.</p>
<p>By the 1980s, Pleistocene wildlife had begun to be seen farther north. Additional species such as short-faced skunks (<em>Brachyprotoma obtusata</em>) were observed, but misidentified as members of extant species. Sightings of SCP-7189 decreased during this period.</p>
<p>SCP-561 began affecting ██████████ by the 2000s. The first anomalous human birth was in 2003. There is some ambiguous evidence that domestic cats were affected prior to humans.</p>
<p>SCP-561's effect appears to have begun with only some species, and gradually expanded to others over time. Whether SCP-7189 was near ██████████ before SCP-561 began or were drawn to it once it reached a certain strength is currently unknown, but as SCP-7189 activity is positively correlated with population size of the relevant species it is hypothesized SCP-561 predated their current rise in activity. A proposal to reclassify SCP-561 as SCP-7189-Alpha was rejected on these grounds. As SCP-561 has gradually affected more species, it may eventually begin to alter avian, plant, microbial, and insect species. This is an unacceptable threat to normality.</p>
<p>Extensive searching by MTF Gamma-4 revealed no trace of current SCP-7189 activity. On suggestion of on site staff, personnel began euthanizing SCP-561 affected animals, with MTF Gamma-4 and a deployable Scranton Reality Anchor on standby. Five minutes after beginning, three SCP-7189 instances manifested and attacked the staff conducting euthanasia. All had almost entirely regenerated, and displayed a limited ability to manipulate their environment through phytokinesis and geokinesis. The Scantron Reality Anchor had no effect, and on-site Kant and Akiva counters did not detect anomalous readings. MTF Gamma-4 was able to repel SCP-7189 with sustained gunfire, but took causalties.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the attack, Regional Director Dr. Atmos ordered all SCP-561 affected wildlife to be terminated. This order did not initially include Group N, but was later expanded to include them. However, locating Group N proved impossible. Friends and family reported [REDACTED] prior to disappearance. [REDACTED]. Area 7189-Alpha's musk ox population has been terminated. After the death of SCP-7189-2B, SCP-7189-1 through -3 displayed displayed signs of distress and disorientation. They became less active, and after three months of inactivity were found hibernating. Bullet wounds were visible on healthy areas of SCP-7189-2's flesh, and it had further decayed.</p>
<p>A full search of documentation for reference to necrotic Pleistocene wildlife was made by RAISA. Potential instances of SCP-7189 were found on all inhabited continents. Subsequent investigation would confirm most of these as SCP-7189 instances (see Supplementary Documentation 7189-1). Most appear to be in hibernation, and their resting places are under surveillance. No areas similar to SCP-561 were found.</p>
<p>SCP-7189 have been regularly sighted around Biological Outpost-561 since termination procedures have begun. Instances demanifest after exposure to sustained gunfire, but generally reappear within three days. Lone staff and small groups have been attacked by SCP-7189. MTF Gamma-4 has been assigned to assist in the termination of SCP-561 affected wildlife, but due to slow progress the use of poison is being considered.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 7189-2:</strong> At 2:34 AM December 3, 2012, SCP-7189-4 manifested inside Biological Outpost-561's security perimeter and began attacking personnel. Three additional SCP-7189 instances were attracted by the confusion and tore down the security perimeter while Gamma-4 was neutralizing SCP-7189-4. Some staff fled the outpost and were attacked by SCP-561 affected and non-anomalous wildlife. Instances of SCP-7189 poorly controlled geokinetic and phytokinetic abilities further damaged the outpost and prevented their quick neutralization.</p>
<p>The commotion drew ten additional SCP-7189 instances, quickly overwhelming on-site security and Gamma-4. Sr. Researcher Spencer Black called for an evacuation at 3:01 AM. While much of Biological Outpost-561's vehicle fleet had been destroyed, remaining staff were able to fit inside usable vehicles and fled by 3:11 AM. The outpost's self-destruct protocol was activated at 3:15 AM, but failed to detonate. It is believed incidental damage sustained in the attack rendered it non-functional.</p>
<p>Evacuation proceeded in good order. SCP-7189 instances pursued, but were unable to match the convoy's speed. Most surviving personnel arrived at a Foundation safehouse by 6:06 AM. A few survivors who had attempted to flee on foot would trickle in over the next week. Total casualties, including MIA, came to 34.</p>
<p>A drone flyover of SCP-561 revealed that roads leading into the area had been washed out and overgrown. Subsequent expeditions by MTFs to Biological Outpost-561 have been repelled.</p>
<p>SCP-7189 and SCP-561 have been reclassified as Keter. Two ten meter high fences separated by a ten meter gap have been built around SCP-561's known area of effect, with guard towers, security cameras, and a kill zone. A cover story about military activities has been released. Missions to kill SCP-561 affected wildlife near the borders of the anomaly have been successful. Research on how to shrink SCP-561's area of effect is ongoing.</p>

<p>On May 4, 2014, MTF Tau-9 (“Bookworms”) raided a suspected Serpent's Hand cell in ██████, California. The building the cell was squatting in was abandoned when Tau-9 entered and showed signs of rapid evacuation. Documents found around the area showed that the cell was not part of the Serpent's Hand but was instead a previously unknown faction of the Earth Liberation Front that had managed to survive the FBI's efforts by going off-grid. Supplies for anomalous terrorism and books from the Wanderer's Library confirmed that they were within the Foundation's purview. Links to the Serpent's Hand are suspected, but unconfirmed.</p>

<p><em>[…] Elbert Hughes, notable both for regularly endorsing crackpot theories and reliable first-person testimony, encountered the Sonoran Sloth in 1903. Unfortunately, he did not record the god's location. His testimony is reproduced below.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When I first heard the stories of the Great Sloth of Pima, I thought them to be baseless rumor. Such a beast could surely not escape the eye of science, and there was no evidence but some odd dung. But when I was in Tucson a man offered to show me tracks in the mountains he claimed were made by a Mogollon Monster. Knowing as I did that the Yeren did not range so far south<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>that antediluvian race is too tied to the trees<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>I was skeptical, but agreed to take a look after some coaxing. I must confess I thought him merely drunk. He was drunk, but not so into his bottle that he had imagined it.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon our arrival at the site, I could see quickly that this was no Yeren, for the tracks were hooked. Instantly I recognized the tracks as belonging to a</em> Megatherium<em>, that savage subterranean beast from prehistory! The tracks were left by no fossil, though! By what mechanism it survived I knew not. Perhaps it survived in the underground cave systems that so riddle our Earth, only wandering back up from time to time.</em></p>
<p><em>I asked my guide if he had seen other tracks like this. He affirmed he had, and, almost shyly, admitted he thought he had seen the creature that made them. He had no proof, though, and was hesitant to tell a man of science such as myself without a dead specimen. I instructed him that the Monster had proven itself gentle and intelligent by nature, so it would be cruel to kill one. Of course I knew that his "Monster" was in fact a ground sloth, but if he encountered a Yeren it would not do for him to shoot them.</em></p>
<p><em>At my request he took me to where the creature had been seen. Indeed, tracks led into the cave, but knowing what hazards lie for those unprepared to enter caves I would not go on. I did not have high hopes the beast would emerge again, but told him to leave me and assured him I would be back in town in a few days, and that if I managed to photograph the beast he would be the first to know. Exultant, he returned to Tucson.</em></p>
<p><em>Luck was on my side, for I only had to wait a day before the sloth came from the cave. Immediately I knew that this was no mortal creature. The animal was diseased. No, more than diseased. It was dead. It must have been half skeleton. But this thing's aura was not that of a reanimated creature. There was the touch of death, yes, but also a vital energy and a touch of the Fundamental. Despite being dead, it was somehow more real than I. I have only felt that energy around<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>do forgive me for saying this<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>so-called gods. Divine they may not truly be, but this creature had the same essence.</em></p>
<p><em>I watched it for some time, unobserved. It wandered, picking fruits off the cacti and yucca. Either it ignored my efforts to photograph them, or it did not notice. Partway through its dinner, it attempted to groom itself, but gave up after its claws dislodged a chunk of flesh from its neck.</em></p>
<p><em>When it was done, it headed back towards the cave. But its path took it past a pool in the rock, filled by the rains the night before. When the creature saw its face, it froze. After half a minute of motionlessness, it let out a horrible cry I wish to never hear again, and jerked its head away from its reflection. Maddened, it ran towards me. I am sure the poor brute did not know what it was doing, but it nearly trampled me nevertheless.</em></p>
<p><em>I was lucky. I fell backwards in shock, and my hand fell upon a flint blade I had found earlier and set down nearby for inspection. I grabbed it on instinct, and when I raised my hands to ward it off, up came the blade. The creature took one look at it and let out a bellow of fright. It raced back towards the cave, and that was the last I saw of the Great Sloth of Pima.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Unfortunately, other records of the Sonoran Sloth are quite scarce. The god may be dead. […]</em></p>

<p>Use of flint blades in SCP-7189 containment procedures was mandated.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <em>Dream Journeys</em> is a collection of dream narratives by a Serpent's Hand telepath with a talent for contacting psychologically divergent non-physical anomalies. The selected text is from a chapter where the author talks about her experiences contacting theologic entities. It is not believed that the author intended for this text to be easily available outside the Hand. How it fell into the hands of the ELF is unknown.</p>
<p><em>[…] Heralded by a blizzard they came, a thousand beings at once but all of them white-furred and vulpine. Their eyes glittered in the light that filtered down through the snow, amber and blue at once. No words came from their muzzle, but we were both beyond such things as speech. What was their nature, I asked? Why had they come to me while I was in the dreams of dead sleeping gods?</em></p>
<p><em>I am a kindred spirit, they answered. My twin lived but I did not. And I saw past the appearance that clung to to their true nature. Beneath it they were but a rotting corpse. It made me recoil in horror, but pity stirred in my heart. You can see it, they said. My children's bones lie within the ice. I still feel them, but you know them not.</em></p>
<p><em>I see you as you are, I said. Would you show me what it was like, when you walked the Earth? And the blizzard parted around me, and I found myself in many places at once. A steppe. A forest. A desert. I could see forever, and so I could see titans walking the Earth. I knew some of them, but others were strange to me. Some of the titans had the glow of gods upon them, and I knew these to be my companion's siblings.</em></p>
<p><em>It is beautiful, I said, and the fox was pleased, but sad.</em></p>
<p><em>It was, they said. But the titans were dead, and the gods were doomed to a slow death. They were gods of nothing, now. I was quiet for a moment. Don't go, they asked. We lie restfully, with no dreams of our own. It has been so long since I visited the mind of another fox, and remembered what it was like to live. It has been so long, and it is so hard to reach another. Those that come to us are easier, but their minds are alien.</em></p>
<p><em>They did not, I was sure, really care about me. They bore me no ill will and even, I think, a faint affection, but mostly they wished to live vicariously through me. It was a favor I would not mind providing, but for one thing.</em></p>
<p><em>But I am no fox, I said. I am human. At this they were amused, but they did not laugh.</em></p>
<p><em>You shape your mind like water to be closer to us. Are you so sure you're not? In the blink of an eye, I was. Had I been awake, I would have hated them for it, but in the dream it seemed only appropriate.</em></p>
<p><em>I remember only fragments of what happened next. I remember stalking across the snow, and the taste of warm blood between my teeth. I remember being warm despite the freezing cold. I remember being groomed and sleeping curled up with the god. It was not peaceful, but my mind was quiet. Even now, the fragments of memories are sweet.</em></p>
<p><em>My mind can only hold another shape for so long. I could not tell how much time had passed, but in time I returned to humanity. We talked for a while<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>I will not say on what<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">--</span>but in time I had to go.</em></p>
<p><em>They were sad to be trapped in dreamless sleep again. But I could scent the hope on them, for in strange aeons even dead gods may rise. […]</em></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The original copy of the letter was not found, but a notepad had pencil impressions from a torn away sheet. Several other notepads were found on the scene but did not have such marks. It is believed that the cell used pieces of cardboard for greater operational security.</p>
<p>DNA, fingerprint, and handwriting analysis do not match any person of interest in Operation Backfire. No recipient was listed.

<p><em>I never told you about what I did after we split up at [blank space]. I went north after hiding from the cops, spent some time in Canada. No problem making my own way up there, and there's plenty of places to get lost in the cracks. Found one of them too well. There was a small town, maybe a thousand, in south Saskatchewan. Perfectly ordinary, or so I thought.</em></p>
<p><em>There were stories about monsters in the forest. I disregarded them because I didn't believe in monsters, but I did believe in demonization. Now I believe in both.</em> [blank space] <em>and you were always into the nature worship, and I never was, but I was the one who ended up having a religious experience and got changed by it. There's no way you can't be when you find the rotting corpse of an animal that should be extinct and realize that they still live. They were some sort of saber-tooth, and I found them. Half of them was skeleton and the other half looked rotten, but I could see the rise and fall of their chest.</em></p>
<p><em>I never believed in gods before, but with one right in front of me how could I not?</em></p>
<p><em>I told no one and decided to stay in the area for longer than was probably safe. I saw a lot over those years. There were smaller saber-tooths in the forests too. The god grew healthier over the years. I saw them active more and more. They knew I was there, I'm sure of it, but they let me be. I saw other giants too. They should have all been dead thousands of years ago, but they lived. I know it sounds impossible, but we've both seen impossible things. The gods are stirring again, and if we can help their mortal kin survive they may live again.</em></p>
<p><em>As far as we're concerned, that place is a no-go zone now. Entire town got evacuated because of a "tainted water supply," and while I'm sure they had one I'm damn sure that's not why they were evacced given that the place is currently crawling with military types. I'd left with some other wanderers a few years before, and it's a good thing I did. Fighting them isn't like sabotaging the corps; they only care about control.</em></p>
<p><em>I spent a few years wandering. You heard some of the stories from our mutual friends, I'm sure. What they probably didn't tell you is that the place up north isn't the only place where the gods have been active. I and some friends have been trying to help them. Obviously, I can't tell you anything about where we are or who else is in it. But I think I found a way we help, if you're up for it. I'll meet you at</em> [blank space]<em>.</em></p>

<p>A search of the surrounding area revealed no Pleistocene wildlife. It is believed the cell center of activity was not near the building, but accessed by a Way. The Unusual Investigations Unit has been notified of renewed activity on the part of the Earth Liberation Front and their entrance into the anomalous community.</p>
<p>Following Incident 7189-3, the Foundation re-evaluated containment of SCP-7189.</p>
<p>SCP-7189 poses a memetic hazard to humans. While this meme does not appear to be anomalous, it does lead to worship of SCP-7189 instances and the growth of cults. The meme is virulent enough to make humans attempt to help SCP-7189 achieve an SK-Class Species Dominance Shift Scenario. Given this, the Foundation has elected not to inform staff without 4/7189 clearance or higher of SCP-7189's sapience.</p>
<p>The current containment procedures were put in place at this time to fight the memetic threat posed by SCP-7189 by eliminating and preventing the growth of their cults. Knowledge of SCP-7189 has proven impossible to suppress due to the Wanderer's Library, but the Foundation has been able to reduce the penetration of SCP-7189's memetic hazard into the human noosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7189-2 — Foundation Efforts Against SCP-561:</strong> Since loss of Biological Outpost-561, SCP-561's effect has expanded to include avian species. Affected birds, mostly eagles, give birth to <em>Teratornis woodburnensis</em> hatchlings. No other Pleistocene species have been observed. The SCP-7189 instance associated with the species has been spotted and designated SCP-7189-101. SCP-7189-101 is highly territorial and has attacked crop dusters spraying herbicide over SCP-561's area of effect, impeding neutralization efforts, and has shown a flight ceiling above the maximum altitude at which herbicidal spraying would be effective as well as rudimentary aerokinesis. Automated snipers have been placed around the new perimeter fence.</p>
<p>Prior to SCP-7189-101 manifesting, drone flyovers of Biological Outpost-561 showed that the ruins of the facility were being overgrown by vegetation at an accelerated rate, rendering it unfit for human habitation. Satellite photos have confirmed the same is true of ██████████.</p>
<p>Since MTF Gamma-4 began carrying flint blades into the field, no direct attacks by SCP-7189 have been reported and casualty rates have greatly decreased. However, SCP-7891's control over its environment has impeded MTF Gamma-4's ability to seriously dent the populations of Pleistocene wildlife within SCP-561. As of September 2, 2015, five separate incursions by MTF Gamma-4 have been turned back. Armed Biological Outpost-561 has been constructed to serve as a base for further incursions into SCP-561 and the eventual reclamation of the area.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, the populations of Pleistocene wildlife within SCP-561 have dropped slightly, and the Foundation has been able to reclaim 1.5% of SCP-561's former area.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 7189-4:</strong> At 13:25, September 10, 2015, a vehicle in Armed Biological Outpost-561's parking lot exploded. Immediately afterwards, a previously unknown Way opened inside the outpost's security perimeter and three individuals stepped out. Before security forces could react they threw home-made bombs at the outpost's parking lot, radio tower, substation, and a guard tower. These bombs flew unusually far and with exceptional accuracy and are believed to have been anomalously augmented. While the bombs inflicted only mild injuries, they did cause several million dollars worth of damage and a blackout and loss of communications that lasted until 14:23. A chaos star, the letters "ELF," and the slogans "Bite Back [sic]" and "Earth First!" were graffitied on several of the recovered bomb casings.</p>
<p>Personnel are reminded that SCP-7189 have sapient sympathizers and these should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Attempts by SCP-7189 to damage the perimeter fence increased in the days following the attack. This did not allow for any Pleistocene wildlife to escape, but did lead to the deaths of 28 Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7189-3 — Increase in SCP-7189 Activity:</strong> As of May 10, 2017, anthropogenic materials within areas of heavy SCP-7189 activity decay at an accelerated rate. This rate is not so fast as to make modern equipment useless when entering zones of SCP-7189 activity (though equipment does suffer a much higher failure rate), but it makes remote sensors useless and forward operating bases impossible to set up. Biological Outpost-561 and ██████████ have almost completely turned to rubble (though the effect seems to target brick and concrete to a lesser degree).</p>
<p>SCP-7891 has been increasingly sighted outside SCP-561's exclusionary fence, and their activity has begun to degrade some areas of the fence. This has forced the Foundation to abandon some areas of the exclusionary fence in order to maintain containment. Additionally, a zone of heavy SCP-7189 activity in central Finland has manifested a similar effect as SCP-561.</p>
