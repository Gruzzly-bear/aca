<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation assets are to identify, locate and shutter all instances of SCP-5740. Individuals affected by instances of SCP-5740-A are to be remanded to Site-57 for analysis and medical treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5740 is a series of pop-up restaurants that appeared in the ██████████, █████████ area starting on June 5th, 2020. The restaurants are small, cubical structures with no discernible openings save for a small metal chute next to a touchscreen interface on, presumably, the front side of the structure. The entire remaining surface of the building is covered in advertisements for the building itself. These ads identify the restaurants as "dado-nuts by dado".</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="donut2.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5740/donut2.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Touchscreen interface of SCP-5740.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Gathering from the advertisements on the exterior of the various instances of SCP-5740, as well as from television advertisements that were purchased to run in the area at the time, SCP-5740 is a stand-up donut shop that advertises specifically to members of local law enforcement. In contrast to the supportive tone of many of the advertisements, the donuts (hereafter identified as SCP-5740-A) are not conducive to human health.</p>
<p>When a member of law enforcement approaches SCP-5740, a jingle will begin to play from within the structure. Afterwards, the touchscreen interface will activate, encouraging the individual to press a red button on screen to receive a donut. Once this is done, an instance of SCP-5740-A will drop out of the metal chute.</p>
<p>Note that instances of SCP-5740-A only generate when SCP-5740 is activated by members of law enforcement. SCP-5740 will still activate when others approach, but will typically drop non-anomalous donuts of varying shapes and designs based on the person's profession. A full list of known deviations is available below:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">

<p>The effects of SCP-5740-A are typically not observed until roughly 4-6 hours post-consumption. Affected individuals will briefly experience stomach discomfort and bloating, followed by extreme diarrhea. Immediately afterwards, the subject will begin to excrete a domesticated pig (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) from their rectum. How this animal, which is otherwise non-anomalous, manifests within the subject's bowels is currently poorly understood.</p>
<p>How the size of the excreted hog is determined is a point of ongoing discussion among SCP-5740 researchers. While there appears to be no correlation between the size of the animal and the size of the subject, there does appear to be at least a mild relationship between the size of the animal and the disciplinary record of the subject. Officers with fewer disciplinary offenses or who had commendations for service to their community typically excrete smaller hogs. However, those with records that indicate they have been the subject of disciplinary action, or who have taken actions in their line of work that should warrant disciplinary action, regardless of whether or not they were disciplined, are more likely to excrete hogs of considerably larger sizes.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Various hogs excreted from members of the ███████████ Police Department.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite the vast disparity in some cases between the size of the excreted hog and the size of the subject's anus, the bodies of affected individuals are anomalously capable of passing the swine, though not without effort. In many cases, the act of passing a four to five hundred pound hog can take many hours and be excruciatingly painful for the affected individual. This, coupled with the fact that the hogs in question are almost always panicked upon their formation within the rectum, often results in the process being extremely traumatic for both the subject and the excreted hog.</p>
<p>The traumatized anuses and rectums of affected subjects will eventually recover and return to their pre-anomalous state, typically over the course of several weeks and with medical therapy. However, to date no subject who has passed a hog larger than 20kg has ever fully regained complete control over their sphincter.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5740.1:</strong> Communication with POI "dado"</p>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of the first instance of SCP-5740, it was also discovered that the touchscreen interface could be manipulated to reveal a text interface. This interface appears to be solely for processing refunds; however, a large sign just above the interface boldly states "no refunds".</p>
<p>Using this interface, Foundation agents attempted to communicate with the POI "dado".</p>

<p><tt><span style="color: blue">also dado is currently not do publicity shoot for dado-nut business as u see dado is very important businessmen with very many business venture</span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">but dado is happy 2 answer question if u have them</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">That would be helpful, yes. We noticed that your stores don't appear to have any openings. How do they work?</span></tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">hmmm unfortunately this is dado trade secret. u see dado is use special dado-brand technology to be sending only highest quality dado-nut to all location of dado-nut fine stores.</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">Is there anything inside the stores?</span></tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">dado is beginning to think u is attempting to swindle dado by confiscation of dado technologies</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">No no, nothing like that. Different question. Some of your donuts seem to cause certain health problems with law enforcement officers. Why is that?</span></tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">dado is not knowings what u r talking about</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">

</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">no no see dado is of enlightened centrism. dado only want 2 grill and sell fine dado grill products.</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">I have a hard time believing that.</span></tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">it is true. certainly is having nothing 2 do with dado seeing peoples on dado television (now on sale at dado electronics mart and fish emporiums) being smack about by police. no sir says dado. nothing 2 do with so many fine dado customer being harass and threaten and beat upon by police. dado certainly is feeling no obligation for dado to come to defense of consumerbase. dado certainly is not taking stand against <em>fine</em> local policemen, only sell upon policemen some fine dado-nut. all policemen like dado nut.</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">You're being sarcastic, I'm sure.</span></tt></p>
</div>
<p><tt><span style="color: blue">if u say so. however dado does not know who this mr sarcastic is. dado is only purveyor of fine business and excellent salesman, like the bezos or 420 elon.</span></tt></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><tt><span style="color: red">Alright. One last question. You're obviously trying to target dirty cops or something, but some of the people affected by your products are good cops. Why are you going after them, too?</span></tt></p>

A small piece of paper was stuck into the donut, which read as follows:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">

<p>The SCP-5740-A instance in question was revealed to be a stale donut with a bitter frosting. The frosting was later revealed to be 92% guinea pig feces by weight.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5740.3:</strong> Ongoing Containment Attempts, Cont.</p>
<p>An unverified instance of SCP-5740 was discovered outside of the ████████ Building in ███████████, ██<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. The structure lacked the touchscreen of earlier models, with the screen having been replaced by a small placard reading "oh no! is of small immigranting child inside!! coming quickly to apprehending!"</p>
<p>The appearance of this instance of SCP-5740 was documented by DHS officials, who sought to break into the donut stand. As agents approached the structure, it rapidly dispensed 47 live grenades.</p>
