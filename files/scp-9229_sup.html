<strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9229 is a construct of unknown origin occupying approx. 70% of the volume of Saturn's satellite Iapetus. Preliminary gravity gradiometer data indicate a layered structure.<br/>
<strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9229 was discovered in 1981 during Voyager 2's flyby of Iapetus, when its magnetometer and Foundation-embedded gravity gradiometer<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-436769-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-436769-1')">1</a></sup> gave readings that didn't match the natural satellite's predicted composition. The magnetometer data was promptly covered up by a Foundation deep cover agent, and the gradiometer data was used to reconstruct the structure's approximate shape.<br/>
Due to large communication lag between Earth and Iapetus and the broad possible range of work required, a drone exploration proposal was denied. Instead, a multidisciplinary research group was assembled. The group, designated GOODBUS, consists of:
<ul>
<li>Mikhail Grigoryev, Doctor of Sciences in Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Rostov State University</li>
<li>Manfred Owens, PhD Biology, UI Urbana</li>
<li>Rebecca Owens, PhD Mechanical Engineering, MIT</li>
<li>Stepan Davankov, Doctor of Sciences in Philological Studies, N.I. Lobachevsky State University, Bachelor of Memetics, SCP-YU Internal University of Čačak</li>
<li>capt. Buster "Bus" Williams, former Apollo program reserve crew, Bachelor of Sciences, USMA</li>

Despite the ship being completed in record time, the project encountered difficulties with the procurement of shaped nuclear charges, needed for propulsion. As a result of Foundation involvement in USA/USSR arms control treaties, the problem was resolved by 1987. The GOODBUS vehicle was launched the same year.

<p>27 hours post-connection loss Foundation telescopes spotted bursts of light on Iapetus with signatures corresponding to shaped nuclear charges. An unexpected solar flare was promptly falsified by the Department of External Affairs to cover the incident up. 74 hours in, connection was re-established by calibrating to ultra-longwave radio.<br/>
74 hours worth of compiled material was received in rough chronological order, along with telemetry from the crew's implants and a brief message, which are as follows:</p>

<p>Rebecca Owens on record, saw Grigoryev leaving the radio booth a little while ago. Heard some of it, too. The walls are jinxed, I swear they flip from cardboard to completely inpenetrable to sound at the worst moments. Anyways, back to the radio, no hands were applied (Ugh, Greg's such a… We can't swear on these, correct?), he just stood around the display for a bit and breathed over my shoulder. Yes, and about the display, I now have visual confirmation that something happened with the curtain array. Freddie was kind enough to give the shuttle a whirl, but I could've easily just repositioned the outer cam, so… I'm not actually sure why he did that. I'll be callous and classify the damage as anomalous. Full report is done already, but the gist of it is that the array didn't use to be a perfect grid (compensating the ship's shape, that is) and now it has somehow is! We'll have to recompute the whole signal geometry, could take days. Owens out, wish us luck.</p>

<p>Rebecca Owens on record, and it's not getting better anytime soon. Same structural damage manifesting on wiring inside the ship.

The brass plate contains a message in three paragraphs in an advanced, highly recursive and abstracted form of English. Even the headings were several sentences worth of length. The text did not pass an initial cognitohazard check, but that was found to be a false positive triggered by the its sheer intricacy. After stripping unreadable parts, the remainder was fully comprehensible and grammatically correct. Contents suggest that is intentional.

<p><em>I. The Circumstance</em><br/>
Taking into account you having already found this message, a choice is presented. A veritably unjust choice, where neither of the options is true, not to us. You, dear reader, are between a rock and a hard place on this heavens-forgotten hardly-rock. From your side, standing upon an ordered century’s worth of experience, the choice may appear obvious, our morals – peculiar, decadent, even. I pray it is so, for there is a lesser pain in choosing what you perceive as a lesser evil. To not bore the altered audience and, indeed, some twelve non-altered readers, onwards, away, away from the introduction!<br/>
<em>II. The Complexity</em><br/>
Consider chaos. In a closed system, the most probable state is the most uncertain one. A man is simpler than a mash of molecules by virtue of being structured. You, dear reader, if of a certain sort, could attribute that to a godly act, however profundity (yet!) lies in evidence, not mere reason. The truth of man is that his home is not a closed system. I trust you to divine that the enormous engine you stand in opens the system of the universe. As with all, the engine takes its toll, what the wise are most proud of: their complexity. Complexity of customs, sophistication of studies. And what a magnificent engine it is! Such sundry sensations overflowed me when the first draft was presented to me, its electron-thin pen strokes, sadly, irreplicable in your revision of the world.<br/>
<em>III. The Crucible</em><br/>
I do not believe this solution is right, but we are tyrannised by circumstance. I will spend my days, as atonement, in the churn of the engine, performing final checks, until simplification to nothing brings my task to a stop. I am assured it will not take long.</p>

<p>Manfred Owens recording. I was wrong. Our food supplies have symmetrized not partially, but completely. In my initial samples I see organics turning to elemental carbon and releasing everything else. We aren't going to survive unless you send us a supply package. Anomalously, I don't care, you either get cross-contamination or all your researchers die of hunger in a week, with no research at all. Much as Grigoryev's a prick, I wouldn't eat him.<br/>

<p>Rebecca Owens on record from the shuttle. We went in, the nukes went off without a hitch. Speaking of that, Turgis might actually be a <em>hatch</em>, I've spotted rows of hinge-looking devices on the inner side, all melted shut. Observation confirms the layer-cake model, there is a notable trend with depth: the first layer was chiseled rock pillars, we then passed downwards through pulleys and gear systems. All the guts of Iapetus are slowly turning. At time of recording, I see hundred-storey boilers before me. Williams's maneuvers through the moving environment is impressive without an autopilot, I'll give him that.</p>

<p>Captain's log: We appear to be have reached the center, it's almost zero-gee here. All the gears and circuits have become too intricate to see long ago, they converge and intersect in branch-looking things. I see them as holding hands surrounding the middle.<br/>
Stepan's really not doing great, his fingers look webbed now and his nostrils have filled. He's breathing from the mouth now, God, how he's wheezing. Fred wanted to cut through, but had the wisdom to scan beforehand and nope, it's all solid cartilage. Don't think he'll make it. Don't even know how to help. Everyone else is outside, so that's why I'm writing all this. I should be talking to Ste</p>

<p>09/20/1990 Skin grew over his eyes. Nose and mouth receding into the skull. Little and ring fingers fused together, fusion of other fingers in progress. Attempted tracheotomy, windpipe completely smooth -&gt; unable to vocalize.<br/>

<div class="turbo-block bg-grey border-white text-black" data-title="O5 CONFERENCE LOG 1990-20-09">
<p>&lt;O5-03&gt; I would like to direct attention to our unknowingness, neither reassuring nor comforting, our impossibility of "single-source" trust, primordial guidance in the decision for the Universe's survival. We should be suspicious of the categorism of the message, of the distinction between the heat death and cold, cruel life. What of the make-it-simple-machine, could the situation be driven to worseness? We have not the slightest idea of its work principles (make, manufacturer, material conditions, etc.)</p>
<p>&lt;O5-10&gt; And, of course, the question of its use's optics (hysterics, cleanness, alternatives) remains. Even in the (hypothesized) case of truthfulness, our goal is to protect (secure, contain relegated). If there is a profound (DEEPWELL-noticeable?) difference (abnormality) in the world post-activation, would it remain protected? We possess (haunting, grasping at straws) a set amount of time and must make use of it fully (amen, amen, amen).</p>
<p>&lt;O5-07&gt; The narrative has been lost[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-1-65396a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-1')">1</a>], we are in posession of no time [<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-2-39057a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-2')">2</a>]. If we aren't to act now[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-3-59718a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-3')">3</a>], we might not have a chance to send another crew. Who will be to blame[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-4-71821a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-4')">4</a>] if there's nobody left?[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-5-91852a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-5')">5</a>] We have about ████ hours until catastrophic entropic[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-6-57462a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-6')">6</a>] damage gets inflicted and circa two minutes until the communication lag exceeds Williams' projected lifespan[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-7-17756a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-7')">7</a>].</p>
<p>&lt;O5-13&gt; Exactly, which is why it must be destroyed now. There's no decision here, we die as ourselves.</p>
<p>&lt;O5-07&gt; That is completely unrelated[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-8-63665a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-8')">8</a>] to what I said[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-9-89263a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-9')">9</a>], and really, this is a display [<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-10-17661a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-10')">10</a>] of poor justification[<a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-300859-11-39826a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-300859-11')">11</a>].</p>
<p>&lt;O5-13&gt; I'll have to remind you who's responsible for fortification procedures here. I'm going to give you a choice: either everyone remains themseves, or no one—</p>
<p>&lt;O5-01&gt;<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>&lt;O5-13&gt; Apologies.</p>
<p>&lt;O5-01&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;O5-04&gt; Excellent addition, <em>kÿak</em>, 01. However, and this may sound loud, <em>hlaszno</em>, there are faster ways, <em>Ways</em>, to the satellite, <em>tanamgzavri</em>. Though their usage, <em>ūtiļ</em>, merits discussion—</p>
<p>&lt;O5b0t&gt; Voting is open. 55 seconds have been allocated for choice.</p>
<p>&lt;O5b0t&gt; Voting has been closed.</p>
