</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Should SCP-6495 manifest, personnel are advised to avoid interacting with it outside of approved testing conditions. As the anomaly poses no threat to the Veil, further research and containment efforts have been deemed unnecessary, and have thus been suspended indefinitely.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6495 is a collection of incorporeal entities possessing the appearance of four human males in their late teens (designated SCP-6495-A through -D). To date, fourteen sightings of SCP-6495 have been reported in various locations; in all such cases, they have manifested outdoors, at night, and in the presence of Foundation personnel, and have subsequently demanifested within ten minutes.</p>
<p>SCP-6495 is only perceptible to personnel possessing at least Level 1 Foundation clearance; D-class, civilians and members of other anomalous organisations are incapable of seeing or hearing SCP-6495 under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel directly observing or interacting with SCP-6495 report the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-6495-A appears to be constantly 'motion blurred', even when not actually moving;</li>
<li>SCP-6495-B induces a sense of vertigo and loss of balance, and appears to be of inconsistent height; all subjects viewing the entity report that it appears roughly one inch shorter than themselves;</li>
<li>SCP-6495-C generates high-pitched screaming noises through unclear means, which are audible only to those making direct eye contact with it<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">No audio equipment has proven capable of recording these noises, but one observer has compared them to "a seagull singing out of tune".</span>;</li>
<li>SCP-6495-D possesses no obvious specific anomalous properties, but its speech consists exclusively of variations on the word 'redacted'.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum 1, Origin:</strong> On 2016-08-03, Incident S128-2016-25 occurred at Site-128<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A small containment facility located in the south of England, disguised as a refuse management centre.</span>; the incident report (abridged to include only relevant excerpts) is included below.</p>
<div class="blockquote report">
<h2 id="toc0"><span>Incident S128-2016-25</span></h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 3 August 2016<br/>
<strong>Officer of Record:</strong> Dr. O. Memphis (Acting Site Director)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hostile agents of as-yet-unidentified affiliation attacked Site-128, resulting in numerous injuries and casualties as well as severe structural damage.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> In recent months, on-Site security and associated systems have deteriorated significantly. Power supply issues have been frequent, physical barriers have fallen into disrepair, and insufficient personnel have been assigned to important monitoring positions. These successive failures enabled two separate groups of non-Foundation personnel to access Site-128 on the afternoon of 2016-08-03.</p>
<p>At approximately 16:50, four teenage boys entered the grounds of the Site. They did not enter the main facility, but they did gain access to External Building C — a small, temporary structure on the south side of the grounds built primarily of corrugated steel. This building had previously been used to store furniture, office supplies and other non-critical equipment, but was now disused and scheduled for removal. The civilians' motivations for trespassing in either the Site as a whole or this building in particular are unclear, for the reasons outlined below.</p>
<p>At 16:56, an armored truck containing twelve hostile insurgents breached the gates at the Site entrance and drove directly into the main building, destroying the front-facing wall and injuring numerous maintenance and support personnel stationed within. Six armed agents then exited the vehicle and headed for the main containment wing.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote report">
<p>The vehicle then reversed, extricating itself from the wreckage, and drove around the western side of the building, directly into External Building C (apparently unaware that it was empty of Foundation personnel or equipment). Two of the four civilians inside were crushed immediately, and one other was fatally struck in the head by a high-velocity piece of metal originating from the building's structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote report">
<p>Shortly afterwards, the one surviving civilian ran out from the remnants of External Building C, and was quickly shot dead in the crossfire. As most of the security cameras covering this portion of the Site were by now either nonfunctional, damaged, or only capable of recording low-resolution footage, it has proven difficult to determine whether the shot in question was fired by an insurgent or a Foundation agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote report">
<p>The total losses from this attack were as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Foundation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hospitalisation of nine personnel, including Site Director Bradley and Deputy Director Montalbini; all injuries are currently considered serious but not life-threatening;</li>
<li>Destruction of one Safe-class SCP object;</li>
<li>Destruction of External Building C;</li>
<li>Destruction of much of the maintenance &amp; support wing;</li>
<li>Structural damage to the main office wing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Foundation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Death of ten hostile insurgents, and capture of the two others (these subjects have been moved to the custody of Site-12; interrogation has thus far yielded minimal results);</li>
<li>Death of four civilians (cover-up efforts ongoing).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following senior Site personnel have been suspended, pending an O5 investigation into conspiracy, corruption, and several related charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Director Marie Bradley;</li>
<li>Deputy Director Lorenzo Montalbini;</li>
<li>Security Chief Jeffrey Flint.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>One week after this incident, four incorporeal entities resembling the deceased civilian trespassers manifested in the destroyed remains of External Building C. They then walked to the Site's main parking lot, where they were encountered by Senior Researcher Dr. Kai Lassila. Dr. Lassila immediately phoned Site security; however, the entities demanifested roughly twenty seconds afterwards, making their detainment impossible. Dr. Lassila subsequently reported the anomalous properties of the individuals, and the group was designated SCP-6495.</p>
<p>Since this incident, SCP-6495 manifestations have been reported three times outside Site-19, twice at Sites 17, 43 and 91, once at Site-87, and once outside a building owned by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media during an MTF raid. In all cases except one (see Addendum 2), the entities have demanifested too quickly for an interview to be conducted.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 2, Interview:</strong> On 2017-07-30, SCP-6495 manifested in the Site-43 topside interdiction zone. Security &amp; Containment personnel noticed and recognised the entities immediately, and did not engage them as per the Special Containment Procedures. SCP-6495 did not demanifest, however, instead remaining motionless for several minutes.</p>
<p>By this time, the SCP-6495 file was under the purview of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43">Site-43</a>'s Spectrometry and Spectremetry Section<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A department dedicated to the investigation of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5729">incorporeal and spectral entities</a>.</span>; Dr. Anastasios Mataxas, the Section Chair, was therefore alerted to SCP-6495's continued presence, and quickly travelled topside to conduct an impromptu interview.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 30 July 2017<br/>
<strong>Present:</strong> Dr. Anastasios Mataxas, Agent Howard Yancy, SCP-6495-A, -B, -C, -D</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Log begins.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Mataxas stands in front of the four members of SCP-6495, and avoids looking directly at any of them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> So what are you, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-A:</strong> You know what we are. We're a bunch of weird ghosts who keep randomly showing up. Not complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> And why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-D:</strong> Redacted.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-C:</strong> I dunno. It just sort of happens.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> It just sort of happens.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-C:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> And your specific… properties? Do those 'just sort of happen' as well?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-B:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Mataxas points at each member of SCP-6495 in turn.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> You look blurry. You look too short and too tall at the same time. You're screaming at me in my head, and you only talk in blackboxes. Why?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6495-A shrugs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-A:</strong> I don't know. Maybe it's a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> A <em>joke</em>?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-A:</strong> Yeah, we make dumb jokes. You think we've got anything else to do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> I was hoping you'd tell me something useful about yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-D:</strong> Redacted!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-B:</strong> What are you—are you asking why we <em>exist</em>? Because you know that as well. We exist because you fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-B:</strong> Not <em>you</em> you. The <em>Foundation</em> fucked up. You let one of your Sites turn into a warzone, and you let four kids in UrbEx gear wander into the middle of it, and then we <em>fucking died</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6495-C:</strong> We just thought you might want a reminder every now and then.</p>
<p><em>[All four members of SCP-6495 demanifest.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Log ends.]</em></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 3, Update (2017-12-17):</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote s128">
<p>I'm going to stray into the bounds of unprofessionalism by adding this note, but I'm putting it in here anyway because I think the information is relevant.</p>
<p>I don't work at Site-128 any more. Nobody does, because it got shut down and bulldozed last year (mainly, but not entirely, due to the incident detailed above). I'm at 43 now, with a substantially better job — albeit one involving more paperwork. Sometimes, only sometimes, the administrative grind can obscure the real significance of what we do, and it becomes easy to start wondering what the point of the work even is. Last night was one of those times, so in between dealing with more batches of forms than I care to count, I went topside and sat by the lake for a while. After a few minutes, I heard the voice of a mildly-irritated teenager behind me.</p>
<p>"Evening," it said.</p>
<p>I didn't bother turning around. I knew who was there, and I knew my head would start spinning if I looked at them. I just stared straight ahead, and said "Hello" into the empty air.</p>
<p>There's no transcript of what little was said after that. We were well out of the cameras' audio range, and I certainly don't remember our conversation word-for-word. But I can say this much: they reminded me not to fail.</p>
<p>I am often asked variations on the following question: "How was Site-128's security allowed to deteriorate so badly that Incident 2016-25, or anything like it, could ever possibly happen?" The answer to this question is not what people often expect.</p>
<p>Three senior staff at the Site lost their jobs as a result of the incident: Director Bradley, Deputy Director Montalbini, and Security Chief Flint. They were originally investigated for "conspiracy" - everyone assumed they'd been working with the hostile forces, or with each other, or with <em>someone</em>, to make sure the Site would fall easily. It's an appealing narrative for sure, but that's not what they were actually found guilty of in the end.</p>
<p>They were found guilty of gross negligence.</p>
<p>They got complacent, or they got lazy, or they got demotivated, and the rest of us — including myself — either didn't notice, didn't care, or were too afraid to speak up about it. I couldn't tell you anything more specific than that; Bradley, Montalbini and Flint aren't around for me to ask them now. The four people who died as a result <em>are</em> still around, though, and they remind us all why we do what we do — and why we must not, under any circumstances, fail to do it.</p>
<p>Proposing that SCP-6495's Special Containment Procedures be amended to the following, with immediate effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personnel are advised not to look directly at SCP-6495, should it manifest, but are permitted and encouraged to talk to it. No containment is necessary or will be pursued; SCP-6495 does not threaten the Veil, and may indirectly help to aid its maintenance.</p>
