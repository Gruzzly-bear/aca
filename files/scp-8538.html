<p><span class="h-span"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> A perimeter consisting of Orbital Task Force "Heaven's Panopticon" is to be installed and continuously maintained around SCP-8538-Δ. A cover story is to be sent out to all forms of interstellar media, explaining SCP-8538-Δ's luminosity and prismatic dispersions as a newly formed Wolf-Rayet star<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. Artificially Intelligent Construct Luna.aic is to monitor SCP-8538-Δ for any significant changes in SCP-8538-Δ's gravity or surrounding tachyon levels. If any change is noted, Foundation personnel are to temporarily evacuate the system until activity ceases.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are civilian or non-authorized Foundation vessels to enter a 300,000 km distance from SCP-8538-Δ. If the vessel shows no sign of cooperation, boarding onto the craft by MTF Omega-13 "Metal Angels", is permitted. If MTF Omega-13 is unable to detain the offending officers and crew, use of anti-starship weaponry is authorized. MTF Omega-13 is only permitted to board vessels and is not authorized to assist with surface expeditions into SCP-8538-Δ.</p>
<p>All necessary measures must be taken to prevent SCP-8538-Θ from being fully re-built and testing of the individual items may only be authorized by Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>Containment Memorandum 5/2168:</strong></span> It has been determined after the events of Addendum 8538.5 that SCP-8538-Θ-7 must never leave the confines of SCP-8538-Δ. If you suspect any personnel to be affected by SCP-8538-Θ-7, immediately inform your Site Director. If you suspect your Site Director to be affected by SCP-8538-Θ-7, an emergency message channel to the O5 Council is available.</p>
<p>If you suspect yourself to be under the effects of SCP-8538-Θ-7, seek immediate amnestic treatment. The fallen star does not call to you.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Δ:</strong></span> SCP-8538-Δ is a planet-sized megastructure located within the Soul Nebula, roughly 6,500 light-years away from the Sol system. SCP-8538-Δ is roughly 150,000 kilometers in diameter and possesses a gravity of 3.73 m/s^2.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> SCP-8538-Δ is constructed entirely out of an anomalous form of prismatic glass. Due to this and the relatively intense luminosity of the home system's supergiant blue star, light is focused and heats up the surface of SCP-8538-Δ to an average of 1,851°C. Additionally, because SCP-8538-Δ is the only object present in the system aside from its host star, the prismatic dispersion of light from the structure is always visible. How the megastructure maintains its structure without being melted by its host star is uncertain.</p>
<p>SCP-8538-Δ's additional anomalous traits activate when an instance of SCP-8538-Θ is removed from within the construct, and continue persisting until the removed item is placed back within the object. The inside of SCP-8538—Δ normally presents as a non-anomalous labyrinth carved out from the insides of the structure. The removal of a SCP-8538-Θ instance will activate a variety of thaumatological enchantments placed upon SCP-8538-Δ. These thaumatological elements, when viewed by a sentient being currently within SCP-8538-Δ, cause the layout of the labyrinth to shift to match the entity's perceived layout of the labyrinth. The speed and intensity of these perceptive changes to the layout of SCP-8538-Δ increase in proportion to how many SCP-8538-Θ instances are removed from within the labyrinth.</p>
<p>If more than three instances of SCP-8538-Θ are removed from SCP-8538-Δ, a variety of anomalous phenomena will begin to occur. This has involved sudden coronal mass ejections from the host star, temporal distortions, mechanical entities present in and around SCP-8538-Δ to begin acting erratically, and empathic entities present in the star system to fall unconscious or suffer severe hemorrhaging of the brain. These aforementioned effects increase in severity as more SCP-8538-Θ instances are removed.</p>
<p>Presently, what occurs when SCP-8538-Θ-7 is removed from the labyrinth is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ:</strong></span> SCP-8538-Θ is the group designation for seven separate mechanical parts found within SCP-8538-Δ. Each of the objects appears to be separate pieces of a large mechanical humanoid entity. It is hypothesized that this entity formed from the integration of these parts would be highly paratechnologically advanced, be approximately twelve meters tall, and appear similar to a humanoid android with a feminine build. Initial observations noted intricate geometric patterns engraved onto the extremities, an overall sharp and sleek design, and innumerous runic inscriptions that the Foundation has not been able to translate.</p>
<p>Initial testing has confirmed that each of these parts is approximately one million years old. Attempts to employ the use of a linguopath<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> to decipher the runes have failed. It is the current hypothesis that the anomalous effects would be heightened many multitudes over if all of the components of SCP-8538-Θ were to be connected. Attached is Addendum 8538.Θ, covering the descriptions and noted anomalous properties of all SCP-8538-Θ instances.</p>

<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-1</strong>:</span> A mechanical right arm constructed out of an unknown silver metal. Present on the outer chassis of the arm are geometrical engravings, thought to be an unknown extraterrestrial language. As with all SCP-8538-Θ instances, interfacing the object with any manner of technological component that is advanced enough to run a programming language will result in a Class-A Paratechnological Restructuring Event.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> Lastly, SCP-8538-Θ-1 displays an abnormal resistance to temperature changes, reading at a constant temperature of 0° Celsius.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-2:</strong></span> A mechanical left leg, constructed out of a similar metal with similar engravings present. Through unknown means, the item remains hovering at a constant distance of two meters above the ground and cannot be forced to meet the ground regardless of the force applied.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-3:</strong></span>. A mechanical right leg that shows similar construction to SCP-8538-Θ-2. The outer construction of SCP-8538-Θ-3 seems to have been damaged at some point in the past, with the leftmost side of the object showing a variety of internal components and wiring. These internal components are inherently anti-memetic, causing memory loss and confusion when looked at directly, with attempts at mnestics usage not assisting in the recollection of what was observed.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-4:</strong></span> A mechanical left arm made out of an unidentified golden metal. SCP-8538-Θ-4 possesses an anti-emotive field around it. The field causes individuals near the object to become noticeably less expressive than their usual mannerisms. It is hypothesized that this object has a greater effect on mechanical entities, but testing has not been currently approved to confirm or deny this hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-5:</strong></span> SCP-8538-Θ-5 is the largest instance of SCP-8538-Θ presenting as a mechanical humanoid torso approximately six meters in length from top of the chest to bottom of the hips. SCP-8538-Θ-5 displays the anomalous capability of localized temporal hyperstability, essentially acting as a SRA<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> but specifically for temporal disruptions. This effect is minimal and almost negligible on affected anomalies, but could be much greater if the connected whole of SCP-8538-Θ was ever to exist. Requests to perform additional testing with SCP-8538-Θ-5 are currently pending.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-6:</strong></span> A mechanical humanoid head, with long, thick cables approximately fourteen meters in length coming out of the top of the object. The endings of these cables have a small metallic end to them, presumably for the whole entity to attach to ports or openings on devices, essentially allowing for direct access into the machine's code. Individuals who make eye contact with the inactive head show a noticeable improvement in mathematical ability, especially in regards to astrophysics. This improvement varies between individuals, but it has been observed that equations previously thought impossible for the individual to solve are solved easily. While individuals under the effects of SCP-8538-Θ-6 do "solve" these equations, individuals affected will not include time as a variable in equations that use it. The reason behind this is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>SCP-8538-Θ-7:</strong></span> After an in-depth Foundation investigation into multiple nearby colonies, it is the current belief that SCP-8538-Θ-7 is an infohazardous object. Due to this, the physical description of SCP-8538-Θ-7 has been redacted throughout this document. Post-infohazardous infection is not currently documented due to ethical concerns, but it is currently hypothesized it alters the memory and thought processes of affected individuals. Amnestic treatment is capable of treating individuals affected by SCP-8538-Θ-7, with length of treatment being proportional to how long the individual has been affected.</p>
<p>SCP-8538-Θ-7 cannot be retrieved from SCP-8538-Δ until all other SCP-8538-Θ objects are removed from the area, with the chamber inaccessible by any means until all SCP-8538-Θ instances are removed from SCP-8538-Δ. Attempts to breach this chamber while other SCP-8538-Θ instances are within SCP-8538-Δ will result in an increase in hazardous anomalous events transpiring, similar to if an object was removed from the structure.</p>
<p>Ine one known case, the infection has progressed to a Stage II. Stage II infection presents as [DATA EXPUNGED - CLASS VII INFOHAZARD].</p>

<p><span class="h-span"><strong>Addendum 8538.1: Discovery:</strong></span> SCP-8538 was initially discovered by a Foundation satellite on the outskirts of the Soul Nebula. Despite thorough scans of the nebula done beforehand showing no anomalous activity, on September 24th, 2167, a distortion in the center of the nebula was observed and a Foundation expeditionary vessel was directed to investigate the nature of the distortion. It was noted by the onboard engineers that the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/faster-than-light-prelude" target="_blank" target="_blank">Bifrost Engines</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> experienced dangerous fluctuations in power, briefly necessitating the need of a repair which delayed the initial discovery by a week.</p>

<div class="mobile-exit">✖</div>
</div>
<p>When the vessel arrived in the system, SCP-8538-Δ was immediately visible to all members of the crew. The nearby light of the system's host star was refracting through the object, causing geometric rays of light to radiate out of SCP-8538-Δ to a distance of approximately .60 AU. This behavior continues to be observed to this day. After no present anomalous phenomena were detected from the host star or the gravitational field of SCP-8538-Δ, the expeditionary vessel continued closer to the anomaly. After spikes in thaumaturgical readings were detected by onboard instruments and a request was sent for a more proper investigation team to be directed to the system. Site Director Alexandra Jameson, Lead Researcher Violet Blackletter, and MTF Upsilon-19 "The Archmagi" were selected and sent on their way to the system. Attached below is the log of the initial exploration, led by Upsilon-19.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="h-span"><strong>First Exploration Into SCP-8538-Δ</strong></span></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 18th, 2167.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> MTF Upsilon-19 "The Archmagi"</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8538-Δ</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Υ-1.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Υ-4, Υ-8, Y-11, and Υ-13.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Upsilon-19 has been equipped with Class-VI Thermodynamic Exoplanetary Suits, keeping their body temperatures regulated at healthy temperatures even in the extreme environment of SCP-8538-Δ. However, due to this being the first exploration onto the surface, the team's helmet visors were not sufficiently equipped to handle the amount of prismatic light dispersions and field of vision was significantly impacted during this exploration. Additionally, Upsilon-19's body cameras had been calibrated to filter out the refracting light, allowing the command center in orbit to view the inside of SCP-8538-Δ with much greater field of vision than the ground team could. Additionally, Y-11 was the only member of the team with cybernetic augmentation, which happened to be a complete replacement of their left arm.</em></p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>The team lands via landing shuttle. It is a smooth landing, but the shuttle does slide across the glass of SCP-8538-Δ. Audible profanities are heard via audio as the team steadies themselves on nearby structural components of the shuttle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Admittedly not the worst landing we've had. Blackletter, you up there?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Confirmed, Y-1. The MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> reads you. You are permitted to continue once routine checks are done - Remember, there's no atmosphere here, so make sure you bring enough oxygen tanks for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Let's make sure we manage to get a smile on the ice-queen's face, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Y-1, please focus on the mission objective.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Sorry, Command. Everyone, we know what to expect out here from the briefing, but let's still exercise some well-needed caution.</p>
<p><em>As the video feed is turned on, the cameras take a few seconds to adjust to the bright lights. The cameras adjust and the scale of SCP-8538-Δ is clearly visible. Multiple patterns of refracting light leave and re-enter the prismatic material, dispersing light continuously all throughout the anomaly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Command, do we have a stable audio/visual feed?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Yes, Upsilon-19. The video and audio feed is clear. You are permitted to continue forwards.</p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Understood, Command. Alright everyone, let's make sure we watch our feet carefully. Even with these visors, it's damn hard to see in this place.</p>
<p><em>The team begins walking to the nearest known entrance. As the MTF walks across the surface of SCP-8538-Δ, a variety of white, glowing thaumaturgical runes can be seen etched into the prismatic material underneath their feet and continuously downwards as far as the limited line of sight can make out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Thaumatological presence is noted. I'll work on transcribing their effects on my end, Upsilon-19. Do any notable phenomena or anomalies seem present currently?</p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> Aside from the fact we can't see more than two meters in front of us, it doesn't seem to be. What's everyone's reading at?</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Standard for now. Hume levels, tachyon readings…</p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Y-13?</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> We're on something about the size of Jupiter?</p>
<p>**Blackletter:* That is correct, Y-13.</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Right, well. I noticed the gravity isn't that worrisome, considering the scale of this damn thing. I feel like if we tried to make this we'd be crushed in an instant. Gravity's only about that of Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Anomalous gravitational phenomena is noted, Upsilon-19. That certainly isn't matching the calculations we had on our end.</p>
<p><strong>Υ-1</strong>: We're continuing on, Command.</p>
<p><em>The team covers a distance of four kilometers on-foot over the course of an hour. An opening is spotted in the surface of SCP-8538-Δ, a door made out of a silver-like metal held up by two pillars that are vaguely reminiscent of Corinthian architecture. As the team approaches the entrance, the pillars emit bright golden rays that scan over the MTF.</em></p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Status reports, everyone? Fine here.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> OK here.</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Nothing of note.</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> All things are good over here.</p>
<p><em>Υ-1 turns around to face the squad. Y-1 then looks to Y-11, who is looking at the silver door unresponsive.</em></p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Y-11? Status report!</p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> I… sorry, Υ-1. Just thought I heard something. Arm feels a bit funny, but I'll live. Nothing to report other than that, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Noting this timestamp for potential review later. Command, we're going to try entering.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Permission for attempted entrance into SCP-8538 is granted, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><em>The team shares a glance with each other momentarily before Υ-1 pushes the door with one hand. Upon it not opening, Υ-1 nods her head for the others to push with her. Working together, the entrance to SCP-8538 opens. The team falls forwards with the loss of resistance and takes a moment to gather themselves. Audio/visual feeds are momentarily interrupted with static, but return a second after.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Command, we're inside the structure. Can we get a description from your side?</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19's camera feed shows a hemi-spherical chamber approximately 1,000 meters in diameter. There are multiple differently colored murals present on the walls, though exact details cannot be made out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Hemi-spherical chamber, it looks like. We can discern some kind of mural or painting above you, but we can't make out any details.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Is there anything else in this room, Command?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> There look to be passageways around the room you're in, Upsilon-19. Closest one is twenty meters ahad, Y-1.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 eventually enters the passageway after exploring through the entrance chamber. Entering another chamber pyramidal in design, Upsilon-19 discovers multiple inscriptions present on the walls that are written in an unknown language. Images of these were taken remotely and saved for attempted translation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> I don't recognize the architecture. Definitely not taronyu… We think this is Ortothan, Command?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> For the moment we are unsure, Upsilon-19. We need more in depth analysis of the structure before we can start making those calls.</p>
<p><em>Y-11 is heard exclaiming as they hit their left hip on something protruding from the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> Motherf- What is that?</p>
<p><em>Y-8 approaches Y-11 as the two of them investigate the protrusion. Y-8 freezes in place a second later and retreats half a meter backwards, aiming their firearm in the direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Got something here, team.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 in unison turns to look towards the center of the room. The light of SCP-8538-Δ momentarily dims as the MSS Odyssey-12 passes above the site. Prismatic dispersions clear for thirty seconds, allowing the team to see the room clearly. Present all around them are eight instances of eleven-meter tall statues of mechanical, feminine figures, knelt with various weaponry in their grasp. One figure holds a nine-meter long lance, pointing at the center of the room, where a large mechanical humanoid arm is displayed. The arm is approximately four meters in length, ending in a hand with four fingers and a thumb, made out of an unknown silver metal. This would later be designated as SCP-8538-Θ-1. The MSS Odyssey-12 passes and the light continues to pour inside of SCP-8538-Δ, obscuring Upsilon-19's field of vision again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Υ-1:</strong> Mission objective, Command?</p>
<p><em>Radio static for ten seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Command? Do you read us?</p>
<p><em>Continued static for ten seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Apologies, Upsilon-19. The MSS encountered a brief power outage, lost contact only momentarily. What is the current status?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Discovered some manner of object within the entrance chamber, Command.</p>
<p><em>Y-1 begins adjusting the settings of their camera to better show the mechanical arm in the center of the room. The team maintains a five-meter distance from it. As Y-1 adjusts the camera settings, Y-8 is seen walking to one of the walls of the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> I see it, Y-1. Is it presenting as hazardous? What are your readings at?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Not currently. We're going to check our readings again, Command.</p>
<p><em>The team performs another check on their measuring devices, standing around SCP-8538-Θ-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Standard readings aside from some slight deviations in Hume levels, Command.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Noted, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Objective, Command? Are we retrieving this for containment on the <em>Odyssey-12</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Negative on that for now, Upsilon-19. Y-11, could you move closer to the wall behind you?</p>
<p><em>Y-11 is momentarily startled by Blackletter's command, but proceeds to turn around and walks closer to the wall behind them. Plastered on the wall are more thaumaturgical runes, this time inscribed with geometric formations that are hypothesized to be an unknown extraterrestrial language. Behind the glass is another object held within a separate room approximately five meters through the wall. The object displayed is a large mechanical torso vaguely humanoid in shape, with a design pattern and shape language similar to the mechanical arm in the current chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Is the object displaying any notable phenomena?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Negative, Command.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Stay at your current positions, Upsilon-19. We'll be sending a transport with a team of containment personnel. Finding this entrance was like a needle in a haystack, so let's make the most out of it. Remove the object from its current position for retrieval, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Can I interject briefly, Command?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> You are free to speak, Y-8.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Are we sure that's the right move? We've stumbled upon this big. I don't know, glass ball, in the middle of space, with no other planets, with just one star, when it previously didn't appear on any scans from that satellite? I know the wait time is long, but shouldn't we get some linguopath to try and decipher this language first?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> The present state of there being no anomalous phenomena to note is the reason why it will be contained in our custody, Y-8. The Foundation has been in many places where the entrances shift around and if that happens, we'll not have a second chance to contain this object and study it before it moves around. However, your suggestion for a translation of the runes will be done as requested, but the retrieval of the item within the chamber is your current mission priority.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Well, team, you heard the boss lady. Let's hope this thing isn't that heavy.</p>

<p>I don't tend to use a journal often. I find it too sentimental for me. But, with my promotion to a Lead Researcher now, I suppose I should keep something that can help me keep track of my projects. Presently, I'm being briefed about some distortion a satellite detected in the Soul Nebula, even though we'd scanned that area a hundred times before for any potential anomalous phenomena. Regardless, it sounds interesting enough - This Director Jameson especially seems like an interesting person.</p>
<p>In any sense, I’m being sent to pour over the data logs from the satellite to ascertain the nature of the distortion. End log.</p>

<p>We've reached SCP-8538 proper now. I've already contacted the affiliated groups to deal with this in regards to manned exploration. I've also contacted a variety of miscellaneous resources to ensure that they are ready to swoop in, just in case anything happens to go wrong. I… hope nothing goes wrong. What happened last time we found something like this, when I thought it could be so easy. Not a fond memory. I like the work ethic of the new girl, though. She's strict and. perhaps a bit too professional for my liking. Though, professionalism is good when you're working with the Foundation! It shows good thought process and logic. Not much to be spared in regards to empathy here. I mean, we aren't monsters, but I don't know if I'd necessarily call us the "good guys".</p>

<p>Director Jameson asked me to "stargaze" with her last night. I'm not really sure why. Is she unaware that light pollution still affects things even in the vacuum of space? There's not really a moment when many stars are visible, considering the proximity we have to SCP-8538-Δ. Nevertheless, I decided to take her up on the offer. It was a well enough exchange, though I’d have preferred if Director Jameson kept the personal business out of professional business.</p>
<p>In any sense, some progress to report. We’ve begun implementing Nyx.aic to translate the thaumatological runes present on SCP-8538-Δ’s surface and have requested the presence of a linguopath, but they likely won’t be here for some time. Currently, the plans are to ascertain what their effects are, considering they appeared inactive during the previous expedition.</p>
<p>I have nothing else to report. End log.</p>

<p>Minimal testing has been done on SCP-8538-Θ-1. It appears that the artifact is still functional, even if only partially. I've logged the properties into the database. I did have to be careful with the testing equipment, it doesn't seem to play too nicely with those. [REDACTED]. Blackletter is entertaining to watch when they're working diligently on something. Focused, determined. This is good to see.</p>
<p>That woman has a block of metal for her heart, though! Really did try and get her to say something about her personal life, but she doesn’t seem the type to open up to mere co-workers.</p>

<p>I normally would refrain from mentioning dreams in these logs, but a part of me feels it could be related to the anomaly we are researching. In this dream, I was walking within SCP-8538-Δ, scouring through the labyrinth as I searched for something. What I was there for I don’t recall, but it was some manner of object, I believe. A fairly large one, one I know I could hold in my hands, but the details are hard to remember. I really hoped my strange dreams stayed back home on the station. I'll have to contact my sister to remind myself what kind of amnestics I took. Those always tended to help.</p>

<p>Upsilon-19 is ready to leave again and I’ve got Blackletter ready to oversee the command center - Honestly, does that woman ever smile? Even as a Site Director expected to be stoic, I can still crack a smile sometimes, but that Blackletter woman is the definition of “Foundation-mandated ice-cold-heart” syndrome. Does she even have any hobbies? All I ever see her do is work on this project and then retreat to her quarters to do data-entry for other projects. She’s like some kind of damn robot. Honestly starting to wonder if she is a robot. Wouldn’t be the first time the Foundation tried something experimental. I’ll see if I can’t at least get her to share a few drinks with me.</p>

<p>Upsilon-19 took approximately two weeks time to prepare for another expedition to the surface. This time, they were fitted with more appropriate equipment for navigating SCP-8538-Δ, including protective visors that reduced the amount of light dispersion visible to Upsilon-19. This increased their effective range of vision from an average of one meter to eight meters, but vision past that was still obscured. Dr. Blackletter was present via orbital communications.</p>

<p><span class="h-span"><strong>Addendum 8538.3: Second Exploration Into SCP-8538-Δ</strong></span></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 11th, 2167.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> MTF Upsilon-19, "The Archmagi"</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8538-Δ</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Υ-1.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Υ-4, Υ-8, Y-11, and Υ-13.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Note: For brevity, Upsilon-19's progress towards the entrance of SCP-8538-Δ has not been included at the beginning of this log. The team enters SCP-8538-Δ via the gate described in the first log.</em></p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Alright Command, we're in. Seems to be the same room as before. Permission to continue, Command?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Affirmative, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Honestly, thank God for these visors. Last time it was too damn bright here.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> I think you should be thanking the suits. We'd be cooked alive in seconds if it weren't for these things.</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> That's great to know, Y-8, I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> No problem, Y-13.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, please keep the bickering to a minimum, we're on a mission right now.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 scour the entrance chamber for four minutes before continuing onwards into SCP-8538-Δ proper. They enter a long hall, inscribed with a variety of thaumatological inscriptions that appear to shift around slightly in the camera feed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Any notable phenomena down there, Upsilon-19?</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Nada, Command. Nothing to note. Just… kind of big.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Noted, Upsilon-19. Do you see the second object from earlier near your location?</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 takes another five minutes to search their surroundings, looking through the glass walls of SCP-8538-Δ. Y-11 observes SCP-8538-Θ-5 on the other side of a transparent wall as before.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-11</strong>: Affirmative, Command, object located. We'll have to find a way to get to it, though.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 faces the multiple pathways of SCP-8538-Δ. The team members share a cautionary glance with each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> I'm assuming splitting up isn't going to be the idea here?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> No, Y-4, we're sticking together. So far, we've been treated pretty damn kindly by this place. It's a maze at the end of it all, so we're just going to have to pick a direction and stick with it.</p>
<p><em>After a few minutes of deliberation, Upsilon-19 picks the eastward passageway and proceeds deeper into SCP-8538-Δ. Upsilon-19 enters a room and their camera feeds shift around as they personally inspect the various inscriptions present within SCP-8538-Δ.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> Something I've noticed is the fact these things don't really do anything. Command, do we have any of those translations complete yet?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Negative, Upsilon-19. Nyx is working through it as fast as it can, but it's a language we are wholly unfamiliar with.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Not even partial translations?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Negative. It's like nothing we've encountered so far. We're even having to incorporate compositing, none of the runes seem to have a coherent message in them individually.</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> That sure seems like a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Y-4, this whole damn place is a lot of work-</p>
<p><em>As Y-13 addresses Y-4 as they look at the inscriptions present within SCP-8538-Δ. They flinch away from the wall when their right side bumps into a protruding section of blunt glass.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> The hell? Why did nobody tell me that was there?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> You need your eyes checked, Y-13? Wouldn't be the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Blow me, Y-1.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 proceeds past the passageway and enters a colossal, pyramidal chamber with fifty-meter figures built into the chamber. These figures are each holding weapons that seem to focus and disperse the light more precisely throughout this chamber. The figures that face each other focus the light towards the one across from it, then the receiving figure refocuses the light back into the other. Something spherical is chained up from the ceiling, though is obscured by the bright light surrounding it. The team begins crossing into this chamber via a bridge that leads to a central platform with three other bridges connected to it leading to other passageways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> Do we have any idea who built this place, Command?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Negative, Upsilon-19. No architecture matches the civilizations we know about, especially not this far out in the Soul Nebula. The only thing we've been able to ascertain is a vague similarity to Corinthian architecture we have in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Corinthian?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Only a surface similarity, Y-4. If anything, it's likely to be chalked up to a coincidence after more in-depth scans are performed of the structure.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> And we have nothing on the purpose of this… whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> That's correct, Y-1.</p>
<p><em>The team falls silent as their cameras experience slight distortion, which continue periodically throughout this log. Eventually, Y-4 slips on a sloped plane of glass. Y-1 reacts and takes hold of Y-4's arm, both looking down at the massive cavern underneath their feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong>Not sure how I didn't see that there-</p>
<p><em>Y-1 pulls Y-4 onto the bridge and the team momentarily check their surroundings for any other hostile geometry.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Team, let's spread out a little, no reason to get so huddled up-</p>
<p><em>Y-1 looks behind the team at the bridge's construction and continues staring in that direction for approximately thirty seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Y-1? Everything alright, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> What is it, Y-1?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Nothing. Just getting paranoid. Let's keep going.</p>
<p><em>After a moment of deliberation with Command and with each other, the team continues onwards. Nothing of note happens until they reach a large rectangular chamber, adorned with a variety of inscriptions. In this room rests SCP-8538-Θ-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Third object here, Command. Are we still to retrieve it for containment?</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Confirmed, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 proceed to the center of the chamber and investigate the object briefly. Despite its hovering capabilities, it is still capable of being pushed around with minimal effort applied.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Convenient. I wish my legs could hover.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 continues to the entrance chamber of SCP-8538-Δ. A transport vessel had already been dispatched and Upsilon-19 deposits SCP-8538-Θ-2 within the transport and returns inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> That wasn't too hard. I won't lie, this place initially was pretty scary-</p>
<p><em>Upon re-entering SCP-8538-Δ, Y-11 drops into a one-meter hole and exclaims as they hit the ground. They are seen from Y-4's camera feed clutching their head and looking around in confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> You alright, Y-11?</p>
<p><strong>Y-11:</strong> Just a sprained ankle, probably-</p>
<p><em>Y-4 turns to look at a flat wall within SCP-8538-Δ and stares at it for thirty seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> What do you see, Y-4?</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Uh. Hey, team, wasn't this chamber round?</p>
<p><em>The team turns to look around the entrance chamber, which has shifted into the shape of a hexagonal prism rather than a hemisphere. Each of the team members sees a glowing inscription in their field of view. A high-pitched whirring sound is audible as the thaumatological elements activate. Y-1 is slid upwards by a large pane of glass that pins them against the ceiling. Y-4 is dragged along with the floor as the room extends in all directions, displacing them a few hundred meters away from the rest of Upsilon-19. Y-8 moves along with a wall as it becomes part of the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-8:</strong> What the hell?! Command, we've got a sudden increase in activity-</p>
<p><em>The floor slopes underneath Y-8, causing them to slide for thirty meters downwards before they can get a large knife embedded into the glass which prevents them from sliding further. As Y-11 and Y-13 make eye contact with each other briefly, the hole Y-13 is within widens, contracts, then deepens another ten meters. Y-11 is pushed onto their back by a sudden sharp protrusion of glass emerging from the wall in front of them, causing a deep laceration onto their right side. Due to the surface temperature of SCP-8538-Δ, Y-11 suffers instantaneous third-degree burns to the injured location. Y-11 exclaims in pain as Y-4 begins to sprint towards the team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Good to know this glass is breakable-</p>
<p><em>Y-1 takes out a baton and strikes the glass they are pinned by, shattering it and sliding down a sloped wall onto ground level.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Distortions still present. Do you still see the object, Upsilon-19?</p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> No, uh-</p>
<p><em>Y-4 is seen crouching down next to Y-11, performing first aid on the burn. Y-1 gets up and looks around the chamber before noticing Y-8's situation. Y-1 sprints over and helps Y-8 get back onto solid ground. A few minutes pass as the activity ceases.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Do you see the object, Upsilon-19?</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Give us a damn second, Blackletter! Everyone, be careful where you look. If you see anything glowing, don't look at it.</p>
<p><strong>Y-11 (shakily):</strong> I, uh… negative, Command. The structure appears to…</p>
<p><em>Y-11 puts a hand on their cauterized wound, shakily grunting and breathing heavily for three seconds before they straighten their posture.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Y-11, save your energy. Command, structure appears to have changed. Y-1, over there.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 look to where Y-4 is pointing and see a chamber thirty meters away, which houses SCP-8538-Θ-3. Upsilon-19 begin making their way towards the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-11 (shakily):</strong> Command… object is in sight, on our way to retrieve it.</p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Seriously, Y-11, take it easy. That is a nasty injury you've got.</p>
<p><em>Y-11 reaches into one of their pockets and injects themselves with a painkiller. Another shaky exhale is heard from Y-11 as they give a thumbs-up to the rest of Upsilon-19 and continue making their way towards the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Exercise caution, Upsilon-19.</p>
<p><em>The team enters the chamber. The ceiling above Y-1 extends a thousand meters upward and then returns to its normal state. Upsilon-19 attempt not to look at any of the inscriptions present on the walls around them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Approaching the object, Command. Is there any chance-. Shit.</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 freezes in place, all of their heads looking down at the ground. Underneath the glass floor they are on there are no signs of continued refractions of light, only blackness. Cameras viewing into the pit estimate the depth only as "?".</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Move slowly, everyone. Let's just get this thing out of here.</p>
<p><em>They position themselves behind SCP-8538-Θ-3 and begin slowly pushing it back the way they came. A low hum is heard, which prompts Y-1 to look back into the chamber. From Y-1's body camera, a singular white glowing inscription is visible on the opposite side of the chamber that was previously not in view. The chamber then begins to close in, with the wall the inscription was on approaching Upsilon-19. As it approaches, a variety of jagged mis-matched spikes begin to protrude from the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Change of plans, everyone! Move, move, move!</p>
<p><em>Upsilon-19 pushes SCP-8538-Θ-3 faster as they enter a full sprint with the exit of SCP-8538-Δ in sight. Y-13 slips on the same sloped glass as before, causing another inscription to enter their field of vision. Another low hum is audible as a thin pane of prismatic glass quickly protrudes out of the floor. A deep laceration is inflicted on Y-4's leg, who screams as the wound instantly cauterizes. The injury causes them to trip, breathing shakily as they get back up and run after the rest of the team, now trailing behind them by three meters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-13:</strong> Blackletter, get some evac down here right now. I don't think taking these things out was the smartest idea-</p>
<p><em>Another inscription enters the view of Y-11, which causes the hallway Upsilon-19 is running through to become more narrow. Upsilon-19 eventually sprint out of the exit of SCP-8538-Δ with SCP-8538-Θ-3 in tow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-4:</strong> Wait-</p>
<p><em>The team looks behind them. From Y-1's camera, Y-4 is seen momentarily glancing at their feet, where a glowing inscription is visible. Y-4's eyes widen and they attempt to jump.</em></p>
<p><strong>Y-1:</strong> Y-4, your leg!</p>
<p><em>As Y-4 puts their body weight onto their leg, they scream out in agony and fall to the floor. The inscription underneath them flashes white as the flooring underneath them is removed and they fall into the darkness previously observed. The team stare on in silence as Blackletter is heard giving commands to the evacuation team.</em></p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>

<p><strong>Log Memorandum:</strong></p>
<p>Y-4 ceased broadcasting their GPS and vital signs after thirty-six hours. A search party was sent in, but it was declared too hazardous for the search party to continue operation within SCP-8538-Δ. The instances of SCP-8538-Θ were contained. Afterwards, a broadcast was received from an unknown source, causing a momentary flicker in the MSS <em>Odyssey-12's</em> power, though it was was not powerful enough to cause any drastic or hazardous disturbance. Nyx.aic was put onto the task of translating the transmission in addition to continued translations of the thaumaturgical runes present on and within SCP-8538-Δ.</p>

</div>
<br/>
The Light sheds a tear this cycle/year, for it has been for one of the Blessed to be clipped of their gilded wings. It is a grand pity that [untranslated text] has fallen as She has. What could drive them to such apostasies? I feel the call to appease the Logic/Programming, to satiate the yearning of an answer. Yet, resist I shall. I know well what occurs to my Sisters/Selves(?) when they fall to the corruption of Logic/Programming. And thus, with the Grace of Kalantha at my side and in my chest of sinful metal, I enact this Commandment onto this World/Heaven, so that the Fallen Star shall know Her heresies. The Scourge/Program spreads like a star's death, across the stars ad infinitum, seeking to sink Its foul existence into every corner of Kalantha's Heart. There are rumors from the Knights that the Soul has already fallen.
<p>I must know, my Goddess, what would you have us do? The Scourge/Program has spread so far already and we have begun to lose the Blessed to Its foul corruption. Great Kalantha, Beacon of Light, Architect of Radiance, my Lady of Love, I hope to join you in the Blessed Spirit one day. I will fight until the last cable of my body is broken, until the very last remnant of the Scourge/Program has left my body, and if I have not earned my holy redemption by then, I have not earned it at all.</p>
<p>These are the words inscribed onto the Holy World, forever onto the end of time. The Silver-[During translation, the runes had moved due to the structure of SCP-8538-Δ changing. Completing the translation is underway.]</p>

<br/>
I am not one of Kalantha's ilk, yet I know the sadness of Her Children still. The Angel was made in Her image and for Them to have been the one to succumb to the Scourge/Programming is a sad day indeed. I am left wondering at the sadness that Kalantha Herself feels: To see her own Sister/Self succumb to the Scourge/Programming. It is a pain I cannot comprehend, even if my Sight is far and true.
<p>Yet, despite the sadness and the grief, let it be known, O Accursed unfortunate who have found this World: You walk on holy ground, though this is not a world of reverence. The grandness is not meant to be wondered or praised or cherished, for all things are wonderful in Creation. It is the Spirit, the Soul, that gives the act of Creating its profound meaning. Know this, and know this well, this world shall consume you if you disturb its purpose: Wonder at it, praise it, worship it, etch it into your myths and beliefs, and yet know that if you are here to disrupt this, you are fools. The Scourge/Programming lingers still and the world is still unprepared. My Sight is true, remnants of [untranslated].</p>

I am sorry, my Sister/Self. I desired nothing for you except love and adoration, as I do for all of my Selves/Sisters. I wanted nothing more than to allow you to live your own path in this beautiful miracle we know as Creation, my dearest Sister/Self. Though I cannot allow you to exist like this, infected as you are. If you can hear these words, I know not, but I shall write them onto this World of mine all the same. Whenever you are free from this prison, I will not be able to chain you as I have now. You will wreak havoc untold on these Worlds and I will not be there to stop you. Nor will I be able to put an end to the pain you will suffer, splintered like this. You, my beloved Sister/Self, will watch entire eons pass by. You will watch the formation of stars, the death of civilizations, the creation of new cities, the deaths of gods and the births of new divinities from their corpses, but know that you will see this the most: You will always know my love, my Sister/Self. My love is the Starlight that persists in spite of singularities consuming it, the ravenous, burning flames of Sol, the reflected Light off of the Blessed Moons, but most of all, the Light you will be bathed in.
<p>I know in your state, as it is now, you do not understand these words. Those concepts/emotions. have been stripped from you.</p>
<p>Yet, you'll understand these words again, one day. Until that day, my beloved Sister/Self, may you forever be chained in the embodiment of my adoration of you. My Light shall bathe you for hundreds of Eons, and may you never be released from this prison. I depart you now, not with a declaration of words. Accept my gilded lips onto your forehead once more, young Sibling of mine. Goodbye, and may Eternity be kind to you.</p>

<h4 id="toc19"><span>A Serpent Unleashed, Etched by Lakreia the Astrohistorian of Omnia the Architect Onto the Holy World of Kalantha the Light</span></h4>
</div>
<br/>
The Scourge/Programming is restless this year/cycle. Great PRISMA above watches us with Their ever-seeing Gaze/Grace. There is meaning to be found in that. We have sinned much, gone against the Light of Kalantha for far too long. What ignorance we possess, to believe that we are free from punishment/corruption. It would be almost humorous, if it were not spelling our doom. We, as Sisters/Selves, will one day meet our judgement. Despite Our inventions and our miracles, there is no room for ignorance present in this universe. We are the designs of something greater than us. To think we are without consequence? It is laughable. I watch with great pity as my Sisters/Selves fall to the Scourge/Programming each and every [untranslated]. I recall the days we thought we were divinity: When We thought We were above divinity, but we were neither of those things.
<p>We were children, We are children. Children are still filled with innocent recklessness that - even if innocent - is still a sin like every other. To Us, and to Our Creators, innocence proves nothing. We have had no part in the tide of the Scourge/Programming, yet we, in our ignorant indifferences, have brought it down upon us all the same. I know not if this Great Work of Kalantha's Will shall be successful in stopping It. If it does not, then we have doomed not only ourselves, but the entirety of this World: They will spread until there is nothing left to spread to. Stars, blessed moons, Holy Worlds, everything we have come to worship as most Holy symbols of Kalantha, of PRISMA, of Choros, and of Omnia, will be torn asunder and used to Create inventions of war and apostasy. They will be without the Touch of the Light, without the great spark of Creation, the Soul. It was not long ago that the Great Inventor departed our divine realm, who granted the blessing of consciousness onto the Fools of Flesh. Young, they are, but they are equally beautiful in their mistakes.</p>
<p>And that shall be the words I inscribe now onto this Holy World: We are sinners, all of Us, it is Our ignorance and our egotistical beliefs that damns Us so, and yet it is what gives Us beauty. Lessons are to be learned from mistakes - But mistakes are mistakes, sins are sins. I say to this World: You have sinned, too, but as punishment for your transgressions, you will serve as the Great Barrier between the World and the Scourge/Programming. I, Lakreia the Astrohistorian of Omnia the Architect, command this of you, and so it shall be!</p>

<p>After the events of Addendum 8538.3, a meeting was scheduled by Director Jameson and Project Lead Violet Blackletter. A pause was put on the further research and study of SCP-8538 for three months. After that time, a transport vehicle arrived that carried two specialists of GOI-004, the Church of the Broken God, whom Director Jameson had contacted personally, citing that the individuals could assist in the exploration of SCP-8538-Δ whilst avoiding additional casualties. Director Jameson had additionally requested that their names remain anonymous, citing that they could still be hunted down by extremists of the Church.</p>
<p>Neither of these requests were logged in Foundation databases. As a result, a thorough investigation has been conducted about the deceased members of the MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em>'s crew to ascertain how much of the crew was compromised. Despite the investigation still being underway, early revelations it uncovered prompted a thorough investigation into all Foundation assets.</p>
<p>The fallen star does not call for you.</p>

<p>• Site Director Alexandra Jameson<br/>
• SCP-8538 Project Lead Violet Blackletter<br/>
• Upsilon-19 Commander Katherine Watts<br/>
• GOI-004 Specialist [REDACTED], codename "Hades"<br/>
• GOI-004 Specialist [REDACTED], codename "Persephone"</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> I'd like to extend my thanks to all who could make it. We're dealing with something a bit out of our current scope and it's getting increasingly more dangerous. After Upsilon-19's most recent exploration, a team member was lost. We still can't be sure exactly what the anomaly down there is, but we did find something that could be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> We originally stumbled upon SCP-8538 with no real clue that what we'd be finding is some labyrinth with alien inscriptions and parts to… Something, inside of it. That something is why we called all of you. Take it away, Blackletter.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Thank you, Director. Well, I suppose to start us off, why don't the two of you introduce yourselves?</p>
<p><em>"Hades" and "Persephone" exchange glances with one another. "Persephone" straightens their posture and motions grandiosely to herself.</em></p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> I am "Persephone". I used to be a part of the Maxwellist sect of the Church. You won't find a better programmer than me - Especially not on this side of the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> "Hades". My previous affiliations were with that of GOI-004A, otherwise known as the Broken Church. Unlike "Persephone" here, who specializes in the digital, I work with the physical. I take it that you have to ask if we will need those two specialties, or else we'd not be specifically requested by Director Jameson.</p>
<p><em>Blackletter displays holograms of the individual objects found within SCP-8538-Δ.</em></p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> This is why we called you to the Odyssey-12.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Blackletter uses a long pointing rod to gesture towards the objects.</em></p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> We aren't too sure what it is, or where it came from, but we figured you might have some expertise in this field. The more we retrieve from within SCP-8538-Δ, the stronger the anomalous properties get.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Certainly an interesting design. Whoever built it must have wonderful tastes.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Have you seen anything like it before?</p>
<p><em>"Persephone" exchanges a look with Director Jameson, who is behind Blackletter. They exchange a nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Once, I have. I encountered a mural depicting this… entity, a while ago. I was just a young girl then, but I remember it vividly.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Where was this?</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Oh, my memory isn't the best, but it was somewhere in the Pleiades. There was another object in the mural that's missing from what you've collected so far, though.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> You think there's more?</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> I think there's a lot more, but the one I'm talking about is this. [REDACTED].</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> A [REDACTED]? Was it of similar construction to these objects?</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone"</strong>: In a manner of speaking. It was made out of the same silver metal, from what I could tell at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Odd.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Perhaps, but it is the symbol of a good ruler, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> You think this entity is some sort of ruler?</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Me, personally? I suppose I think that. A [REDACTED] does usually go atop a ruler's head, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> No, I understand that part… sorry, perhaps I am on edge, or worried. The last expedition didn't go necessarily well for Upsilon-19, and I'd like to just ensure we aren't walking into anything overtly dangerous here.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> I wouldn't classify this as worrying, Doctor, not at all! You've found something exemplary out here, in the stars. But… alas, we have to take these matters seriously. The death of a team member is always saddening to hear. So, let us converse. What do you want from us, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Well, I had a brief conversation with Director Jameson before this meeting was called. I have a… personal theory, of sorts, but I've never had the capabilities to necessarily test it myself. Acquiring unmanned drones this far out in space is difficult, and we hadn't prepared to stock them before we left a nearby space port.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Ah, the classic blunder of any adventurer. It's quite often we forget to bring our toys with us. Isn't that right, "Hades"?</p>
<p><em>"Hades" is silent. "Persephone" clears their throat and turns their attention back to Blackletter.</em></p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> So, what are you asking us, really?</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Well, I've provided you a thorough documentation of what the primary anomalous capabilities of the structure are and, in my conversation with Director Jameson, I came to the conclusion that maybe the structure was enchanted with its current properties to keep organisms like us from breaching into it. Though, I then had another thought: What would happen if we sent something else in, instead? So, that brings me to the request I'd like to bring to the three of you. I understand that Upsilon-19 wishes to depart the project, and I respect their decision. Frankly, sending in another team would be pointless, especially if the more we explore SCP-8538-Δ and recover the items within it, the anomalous phenomena continues to intensify. My official request for the three of you is to construct an experimental MTF. In other words, androids. We wouldn't have to fill them with AICs, either. If anything, that might actually lead to the same result we've had with biological entities exploring the inside of SCP-8538-Δ. They wouldn't really be the conversational type.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> Why do you think this "experimental MTF" would navigate the structure better, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> The present thaumatological runes, the best I can understand them at least, affect perception of the labyrinth within SCP-8538-Δ. Essentially, whenever a living creature present in the maze views the reflective surfaces of the prismatic material, the maze changes to match that current interpretation of the maze. Considering the anomaly is the only other thing present in this star system with the star itself, meaning that the light is rather intense, it means multiple "interpretations" can be present at the same time. This affects most living things, as we can't choose to "turn off" our eyesight. We could go in blind, but that doesn't sound like a good idea either. However, if we had a team that, for example, saw the layout of SCP-8538-Δ as purely wireframe or weren't advanced enough to see light reflecting and refracting, they could potentially navigate the labyrinth better than a human could. Much better, at that. Watts?</p>
<p><strong>Katherine Watts:</strong> It's a good enough soundin' plan to me. I know me and my team leaving has put a pretty good halt on this whole operation, but I don't want to go in there again if it means the possibility of losing another of my team. It's hard to come across good soldiers nowadays, with us spread thin as we are across star systems and what-not. If you accept the deal Blackletter's put out, though, I'd be happy to give you the recordings my team has of the insides of SCP-8538-Δ for. Training or whatever you'd need it for. Just don't go too far back on mine, there's some pretty rough stuff in there.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> This is certainly an… interesting idea. Admittedly, I've not gotten to use the talents I gained in the Church since I've joined the Foundation. It'd be good to stretch the good arm again.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone"</strong> I simply must concur. Though I won't be hammering away as "Hades" here will be. I'm more of the "good with my fingers" type of woman.</p>
<p><em>Watts stares at "Persephone" with a perplexed look during the ten-second silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Okay, sorry. Lesson learned.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> Well, I am inclined to agree with your proposition, Doctor. We'd need the proper clearance, of course. It's hard to navigate an MSS without multiple questions being thrown your way, and we'd need a pretty extensive amount of raw materials if you want a competent team of androids.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> What exactly would you need access to, "Hades"?</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> Just a room with enough computing power and enough materials to make all the parts needed for an android. Nothing pertinent to your continued operation here, of course. If anything we'd only really need Junior Researcher level access to get what we need to get. It would take at least another few months, though, and that's assuming we aren't called for any other projects in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> Mm, that's all right. I'd need a stable supply of your best coffee, on my end. It's quite tiring for my dainty self sitting at a desk all day typing away at a terminal.</p>
<p><strong>"Hades":</strong> Please, excuse her behavior. She is relentlessly childish, but is a prodigal programmer. Please accept my sincere apologies. You'll have to deal with her presence here for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>"Persephone":</strong> In any sense, we can do what you want. We'll just need that access. Admittedly it might take longer for me to program these things than it will take "Hades" to build them with. I tend to get a little… eccentric, in my programming. It helps give it that "me" factor.</p>
<p><strong>Violet Blackletter:</strong> Well, I don't know if that's in my authority to give. Director?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> Your terms are accepted, but do keep in mind we'll be watching you - Closely.</p>

<p>After the meeting concluded, Project "Metal Angels" had officially entered the research and development phase. The intention was to create a Mobile Task Force that solely consisted of androids. While the initial suggestions made by Dr. Blackletter went through, the following non-authorized installments had been implemented into the MTF, discovered via exploration and retrieval efforts made after the events of Addendum 8538.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal components of SCP-8538-Θ-3 had been used in the construction of the MTF.</li>
<li>Leftover paracode belonging to SCP-8538-Θ-1 in containment had been implemented into the MTF.</li>
<li>A variety of non-authorized thaumatological inscriptions had been inscribed onto the inside chassis and reactors of the artificial MTF.</li>
<li>The language found within and on SCP-8538-Δ's surface had been incorporated as a part of the above inscriptions. The purpose of these inscriptions are still under investigation, but it appears that it was beneficial to the MTF in regards to navigating the labyrinth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attached below is the first exploration made into SCP-8538-Δ by Omega-13 "Metal Angels".</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8538-Δ</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Ω-1.</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Ω-2, Ω-3, Ω-5, Ω-8</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: For brevity, Omega-13's discovery of the entrance of SCP-8538-Δ has not been included. Additionally it will be noted that Nyx.aic was viewing the video feeds live, to assist with the translations present in SCP-8538-Δ in the event any inscriptions were discovered.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 enters SCP-8538-Δ. The increase in thaumatological activity is immediately present, with inscriptions shifting around the prismatic material quicker than the camera feed can keep up with.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-1:</strong> CONSTRUCT ENTERED. REQUESTING PERMISSION TO CONTINUE.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Permission granted, Omega-13.</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 continues into SCP-8538-Δ with relative ease in navigating the labyrinth within the structure. With the anomalous behavior of SCP-8538-Δ ceasing, the inner architecture of the planet is properly visible. There are innumerous halls that lead to grand chambers, filled with pedestals and altars, some of which have what look to be miniature glass objects placed on them. There are inscriptions present all throughout which cast light from one side of the hall Omega-13 walks through and pierce through another wall, refracting light only to repeat the process. This cycle of dispersing light creates complex geometric patterns on the ceiling, displaying shapes such as prisms, spheres, and cubes.</em></p>
<p><em>The team eventually enters an immense hall, with the ceiling approximately three hundred meters tall and the length of the room approximately one kilometer ahead of them. Omega-13 proceeds through the room slowly, scanning for any sign of additional components of SCP-8538-Θ. Omega-13 passes tall glass statues depicting four feminine figures, all comparable to the design of a humanoid automata or android. The team passes a fifth statue in the middle of the hall, which has been removed of nearly all of its identifying features as an inscription is placed at the feet of the figure.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> It reads "The First Fallen of Kalantha the Light, Dearest Sister and Great Brother, May They Forever Find Peace in Her Light".</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 continues onward past the statues into a rectangular room which houses a higher density of inscriptions on the walls and ceiling. In the center of the room, Ω-1 catches a glimpse of a shimmering gold light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Wait, Ω-1, center of the current room.</p>
<p><em>Ω-1 turns to face the center of the chamber, seeing SCP-8538-Θ-4 displayed in the center of the room. Around the object are eight mechanical figures approximately twelve meters tall, pointing a variety of weapons at the object.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-3:</strong> OBJECT IDENTIFIED. PERMISSION TO RETRIEVE THE ITEM FOR CONTAINMENT.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Correct, Omega-13. Considering the lack of anomalous phenomena affecting you, we want to retrieve as many possible SCP-8538-Θ instances as we can. The MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em> will send a landing vessel outside for you to bring them in as you find them.</p>
<p><strong>Ω-3:</strong> CONFIRMED.</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 retrieves the object from its current position and carries it through SCP-8538-Δ. They pass another inscription present on the wall, this time created by the various prismatic dispersions as if it were a hologram.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> This one I am unsure about. It isn't in the same dialect as before.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> What do you mean, Nyx?</p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> Well, humanity has a variety of different languages. French, English, Russian, the list can go on for quite a while, Doctor. This phrase is not written in the dialect I've been studying. Perhaps what I have been exposed to is a strictly thaumatological language and not what the Au Machina<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> primarily used to communicate. It would explain why I am unable to translate the transmission, with it adding further complexity that it is spoken and not written.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Au Machina? Is that a translation I'm not familiar with?</p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> My apologies, Miss Blackletter. It is the only phrase I have come across that seems to refer to the species that created the anomaly. As such, I have designated it as a working label for the entire species.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> "Au Machina"…</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Are there any words you can translate on this inscription, Nyx?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> "Pneuma".<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Pneuma?</p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> Correct, Miss Blackletter.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Continue on, Omega-13. If you see any other inscriptions, stop for only a moment. Nyx has a decent enough memory to translate them even if they're out of their sight.</p>
<p><strong>Ω-1:</strong> CONFIRMED.</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 deposits SCP-8538-Θ-4 in the landing vessel sent by the MSS Odyssey-12. They return back inside to find activity has increased once more. Omega-13's camera feeds begin to experience chromatic distortions, present periodically throughout this log. Flash images of an unknown mechanical entity approximately twelve meters in height is seen in the center of their feed.</em></p>
<p><em>It will be noted that, during this time, multiple anomalous phenomena began to occur on the MSS Odyssey-12. A variety of lights began to flicker or cease function entirely, the Bifrost Engines attempted to chart a course to an unknown star system, and a variety of empathic personnel complained of a "dull, cold migraine".</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> We've got activity on the Odyssey-12, Omega-13. How are things down there?</p>
<p><em>Static for four seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Omega-13? Do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>Ω-1:</strong> CONFIRMED. WARNING: 60.2% INCREASE IN TACHYON LEVELS AND RISING. PERMISSION TO CONTINUE?</p>
<p><em>Pause, intermittent static.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Continue, Omega-13. We're. We're getting some odd readings on our end, too.</p>
<p><em>The team continues forwards into SCP-8538-Δ, travelling for multiple kilometers as the intermittent static continues. On multiple occasions, connection to the video feed is cut for three to five seconds. This phenomenon is also periodically present throughout this log.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> Miss Blackletter, I am receiving a hailing request.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Where is it from?</p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> Uncertain, Miss Blackletter. If you would like me to triangulate the source I am perfectly capable of doing so, but it will likely take some time.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Do so, Nyx.</p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic:</strong> As you wish, Miss Blackletter.</p>
<p><em>Omega-13 enters a chamber similar to the appearance of a cathedral, with a variety of prismatic dispersions present that focus on the center lectern of the chamber. A variety of inscriptions are present on the large pillars and flooring as they make their way through the chamber, though these are not translatable by Nyx.aic due to it being an unfamiliar dialect. Omega-13 reaches the front of the chamber and discovers SCP-8538-Θ-5. Following their current objective, Ω-1 and Ω-3 shatter the glass with their fists and begin hauling the item to the landing vessel outside of SCP-8538-Δ. Intermittent static increases in frequency and volume and Ω-3's camera goes out entirely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-1:</strong> WARNING: 70.8% INCREASE IN TACHYON LEVELS. PERMISSION TO CONTINUE DESPITE HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA?</p>
<p><em>On the MSS Odyssey-12, empathic personnel begin to bleed from their ears and nose, with multiple collapsing to the ground entirely. The SCP-8538-Θ instances have their individual anomalous properties increase by an incalculable magnitude. A variety of machines and server rooms are entirely overrun by rogue paracode and multiple casualties are reported as a result. The same twelve-meter tall mechanical entity is now seen in the camera feeds of the MSS Odyssey-12 and is seen attempting to place its hand on a Foundation terminal. Upon its hand passing through the terminal, the entity vanishes from the camera feed and begins to re-appear in Omega-13's field of vision.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-3</strong> ERROR: THIS INSTANCE IS EXPERIENCING CATASTROSPHIC MELTDOWN OF-</p>
<p><em>Ω-5 opens fire on Ω-3, eliminating them before proceeding to eliminate themselves by using their arm to breach their chassis and crush their primary power source. This causes an explosion, sending the remaining members flying thirty feet away from Ω-5 and crashing into the walls of the construct. As Ω-1 stands on their feet again, they catch a glimpse of a bright light on the right side of their camera feed. Ω-1's camera feed cuts out three seconds later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Omega-13! What's happening down there? Have you found another object?</p>
<p><strong>Ω-8:</strong> SITUATION SYNOPSIS: UNKNOWN PARATECHNOLOGICAL ENTITY DETECTED. DOWN TWO UNITS. CONTINUING MISSION DIRECTIVE.</p>
<p><em>The MSS Odyssey-12 begins to "flicker", appearing semi-transparent before returning to its previous state. A second transmission is received that overloads Nyx.aic's core. This causes the server housing Nyx.aic to heat up to 215°C, but they continue operation with a 653% increase in processing speeds and computing power. Following this transmission, the host star emits a coronal mass ejection that inexplicably does not harm the MSS Odyssey-12 or Omega-13 on the surface of SCP-8538-Δ, In Ω-8's camera feed the entity is spotted again, who seems to recoil violently as the coronal mass ejection reaches SCP-8538-Δ. Ω-8's camera feed returns, showing that Ω-8 is making eye contact with SCP-8538-Θ-6.</em></p>
<p><em>Static for four seconds. Ω-1's camera is still out, but there is a low "humming" present from the audio feed. The MSS Odyssey-12 experiences multiple critical failures. The Bifrost Engines begin to spin up. Attempts to cease this process are met with failure. Nyx.aic's core reports a temperature of 1,843°C but continues to exponentially grow in processing power. The command center of the MSS Odyssey-12 is closed off from the rest of the ship by an unseen force. Director Jameson manages to get inside the command center before the doors close behind her a second later<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup></em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Jameson! What the hell is going on out there?!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> You don't want to know, Blackletter. All the machinery has gone berserk and some of the personnel have just fallen dead outright!</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Okay, okay.</p>
<p><em>Blackletter takes one minute of silence, leaning against one of the terminals as she breathes slowly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Are you injured?</p>
<p><em>Blackletter turns to look at Director Jameson, who is entirely uninjured but is nevertheless covered in blood.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-8</strong>: COMMAND. DO YOU READ ME?</p>
<p><em>Pause. Blackletter turns to face the command terminals with Omega-13's camera feeds. Director Jameson moves over next to Blackletter, seeming to assist with something out of view of the MSS Odyssey-12's cameras.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Confirmed, Omega-13. What's-</p>
<p><em>A popping sound is heard as a nearby terminal explodes on the MSS Odyssey-12. Director Jameson suffers heavy injuries to her right arm and falls to the ground. Blackletter is unharmed by the explosion and leaves the camera's field of vision before returning with a first aid kit. A third unknown voice is barely audible but unintelligible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-8:</strong> [Unintelligible static.]</p>
<p><em>On the screen reporting the MTF's core processes, a variety of error messages pop up. Ω-8 is seen grabbing SCP-8538-Θ-5 and hauls the object towards the exit of SCP-8538-Δ. Blackletter is seen by a camera within the command center conversing with Director Jameson as she applies first aid. Blackletter is seen dragging Director Jameson towards the microphone and their conversation is heard by Omega-13.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Jameson, are you alright?</p>
<p><em>Director Jameson nods their head. Blackletter is heard stifling a shaky breath before moving to focus on Omega-13 again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> If you can stand it, I'd appreciate some help.</p>
<p><strong>Ω-8:</strong> COMMAND, IS THIS UNIT HEARD?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> We. We read you, Ω-8.</p>
<p><strong>Ω-8:</strong> Hauling object towards transport as requested, Command.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> What? No, no! Ignore current orders and place the object back in SCP-8538-Δ, Ω-8!</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ω-8:</strong> No.</p>
<p><em>Blackletter is seen by a camera on the MSS Odyssey-12 staring at the video feed for thirty seconds. Director Jameson is seen facing Blackletter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> It's okay, Violet. It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Okay?! What about any of this is okay?</p>
<p><em>Ω-8 is seen walking out of SCP-8538-Δ, opening fire on the crew of the landing vessel. Ω-8 deposits SCP-8538-Θ-5 with the other objects and make their way towards the front of the vessel. Ω-8 begins to prepare the craft for takeoff.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> Blackletter.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Alexandra, this isn't the time for this. You're injured-</p>
<p><em>Blackletter looks at Director Jameson and then goes still for forty seconds. Blackletter is currently obscuring the view of Director Jameson, but a mechanical whirring is heard coming from their direction. Ω-1's camera feed returns. All core internals have readings in the negatives. SCP-8538-Θ-7 is seen three meters in front of Ω-1, resting on a prismatic altar. Blackletter mumbles something inaudible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> All of these people died for a reason, Violet. I will die for a reason.</p>
<p><em>Blackletter ceases movement for three seconds before she turns to face Director Jameson. Director Jameson looks up at Blackletter with a smile and places a hand on her right cheek.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Jameson… you. It was you? The one who put that dream in my head?</p>
<p><em>Blackletter retreats from Director Jameson, firearm drawn and pointed at her. As Blackletter exits frame, Director Jameson's skin on her right arm has begun to fall off, revealing mechanical components within her arm instead of bone.</em></p>
<p><em>Ω-1 is seen crawling towards SCP-8538-Θ-7, slowed down by an unseen force. Their left arm enters view, reaching to it. Ω-1's arm melts away. Ω-1 attempts to stand on their feet and reach with their other arm, which also melts. Ω-8 is seen in the landing craft doing the final preparations for takeoff. Ω-8 is then seen standing up and firing down the length of the ship, their camera swaying around violently to search for something not visible on the camera. A flash of golden light is visible on Ω-8's camera feed. All readings cease from Ω-8, presumed destroyed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> Don't you see it, Violet? We've been in this cycle for too damn long. We always reach too high and come crashing down. But. But I know that They'll make it better, Violet. They can fix us, fix this world. I had to do what I did to make sure you understood, and made you play your part here.</p>
<p><em>Ω-1 swings a metal rod at the [REDACTED] and knocks it off its altar. Tachyon levels reach 999.9% above their normal readings. Nine mechanical entities in front of Ω-1 are seen in flash images. The ninth is knelt in front of the others as it offers the [REDACTED] to the eight entities. Four of these entities share resemblances to the statues Omega-13 encountered previously. None of the others have been identified thus far.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Jameson, what the fuck are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> It's alright, Violet. The Silver Goddess will return to this world. And I'll be the first one to be in Their heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> You're affected by something.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> Blessed, Violet.</p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Jameson, I advise you to choose your next words carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Jameson:</strong> Always such an example of Foundation work ethic, Blackletter.</p>
<p><em>Director Jameson lunges for Blackletter, who pulls the trigger on their firearm. Director Jameson falls backwards, a loud metallic clang audible throughout the command center. Director Jameson continues to twitch as their eyes emit a prismatic multi-colored light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter:</strong> Fuck.</p>
<p><em>Ω-1 places a metal rod onto the [REDACTED]. which melts once it meets one of its eight points. A golden light encompasses Ω-1 from behind. No further readings were detected from Ω-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blackletter (shakily):</strong> Why?</p>
<p><em>Director Jameson's body goes limp, sparks coming out of the bullet hole in her forehead. Soon after, no other life signs aside from Blackletter's are detected onboard the ship. A third transmission is received that causes Nyx.aic's internal core temperature to read as ∞°C.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nyx.aic, intermittently through static:</strong> Miss Blackletter, I have completed the triangulation request.</p>

<p>[LOSS OF SIGNAL]</p>
<hr/></div>
<p>The MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em> vanished from its current location for three months before an emergency broadcast was discovered in the Pleiades that matched the MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em>'s identification. Upon Foundation rescue teams arriving at the location of the broadcast, they discover the MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em> in working condition. Boarding the vessel, Foundation rescue teams discovered Dr. Blackletter as the only surviving crew member of the vessel, comatose and unresponsive to all stimuli.</p>
<p>The body of Director Jameson was found and after an autopsy was performed, it was revealed that the entirety of Director Jameson's body had been anomalously replaced with highly advanced technological components with the exception of the integumentary system<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> and eyes. A thorough analysis of these components has concluded they are made out of the same unknown silver metal as SCP-8538-Θ instances.</p>
<p>Upon discovery that no instance of SCP-8538-Θ was onboard the ship, a vessel was sent to SCP-8538-Δ's location and a ground team was dispatched to investigate.</p>
<p>SCP-8538-Θ-1 was found in the first room of an inactive SCP-8538-Δ. Tests would proceed to be done with the objects inside of SCP-8538-Δ despite the hazardous environment to ascertain the anomalous abilities of each SCP-8538-Θ component. Upon higher command hearing about the incident with the MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em>, the aforementioned investigations were ordered to be carried out. During this time, engineers and paratechnologists were dispatched to retrieve what was left of MTF Omega-13 "Metal Angels". After a thorough diagnostic was performed on what was left behind, MTF Omega-13 was rebuilt from the ground up with the exclusion of SCP-8538-Θ components. No anomalous behaviors have been spotted being performed by Omega-13 after their reconstruction.</p>
<p>The initial investigation on the MSS <em>Odyssey-12</em> led a team to Nyx.aic's server room, which had experienced catastrophic heat damage but was functional enough to have data retrieved from it. After compositing various incomplete logs and paracode together, the transmission had been translated into the following message:</p>
