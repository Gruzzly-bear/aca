<p>SCP-6206, the Commissioner of Baseball in the universe of SCP-2206, seen here signalling for the execution of the losing team following the 2001 World Series.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-6206 is a humanoid entity originating from the universe of <strong><a href="scp-2206.html">SCP-2206</a></strong><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, where it served as the Commissioner of Baseball from 1998 to 2019. SCP-6206 possesses a non-petrifying gorgon-like look-to-kill effect<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, but is superficially and biologically human in all other respects.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the 2019 World Series<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, SCP-6206 was ousted as Commissioner in a violent coup orchestrated by the Pittsburgh Rebels. SCP-6206 was put on trial by the Players Association, convicted of crimes against baseball, and banished to our universe.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in our universe, SCP-6206 promptly proceeded to locate and execute the Commissioner of Baseball, Robert D. Manfred Jr., in an attempt to seize control of Major League Baseball. When apprehended by the Foundation, SCP-6206 was in the process of trying to secure the position of Commissioner by threatening the principal owners of the 30 MLB teams. In its threatening communications to MLB owners, and in post-containment interviews, SCP-6206 expressed the belief that our baseball was "boring" and in need of "drastic intervention", and presented a plan to revise the rules to be more similar to those of SCP-2206.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Operation <tt>PINCH HITTER</tt> was launched to conceal the involvement of SCP-6206 in the death of Commissioner Manfred, ultimately necessitating the insertion of an embedded Foundation agent to serve as a replacement Commissioner. Due to his previous experience with SCP-2206 and Major League Baseball, and his existing public profile from his role in SCP-2206 containment efforts, Agent Jeremy Steele of MTF Lambda-30 ("Sports Casting Performers") was selected for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span><strong>Addendum — Incident <tt>STOLEN BASE</tt></strong></span></h2>
<p>On 2020-02-17, an inter-universal incursion was detected within Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts. When MTF Mu-8 ("Southern Hospitality") arrived to contain the incursion, they found the entire roster and coaching staff of the Boston Red Shirts, an SCP-2206 baseball team, engaged in a brawl with several members of the Boston Red Sox<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. Mu-8 quickly contained the SCP-2206 team, who revealed that they had come to our universe in order to play our significantly less lethal version of baseball.</p>
<p>This incursion was followed by another on 2020-02-20, wherein the New York Urbans were apprehended in an attempt to assassinate their counterparts on the New York Mets. A further incursion was discovered on 2020-02-26, when representatives of the Montreal Volcanoes approached Commissioner Steele with a proposal to join Major League Baseball as an expansion franchise.</p>
<p>Interrogation of the captured baseball teams revealed that following the ouster of SCP-6206, the Players Association seized control of the league and cancelled the upcoming season. Instead, a series of exhibition games is being planned, which will feature different rosters of All-Stars playing under a progressively evolving set of rules. The Players Association believes that through this method, they can eventually play "the most perfect baseball game", although what they expect to accomplish by doing so is unknown. This plan, which is estimated to require several decades of continuous play under increasingly lethal conditions, has generated significant dissent, leading to the incursions into our universe.</p>

<p>In light of the continued incursions of SCP-2206 baseball teams, the Overseer Council has authorized the reclassification of SCP-6206 as a Thaumiel asset.</p>
<p>SCP-6206 is to be returned to its universe of origin, along with the Boston Red Shirts, New York Urbans, and Montreal Volcanoes. MTF Iota-18 ("Air Bud Jurisprudence") is to accompany SCP-6206 and render all necessary aid so that it may reclaim the position of Commissioner of Baseball. SCP-6206 has agreed to use its position to prevent further incursions into our universe from SCP-2206 teams. Once SCP-6206 is restored as Commissioner, MTF Iota-18 will remain in the universe of SCP-2206 to assist and monitor SCP-6206. Regular reports from Iota-18 and SCP-6206 are to be encoded in normal broadcasts of SCP-2206.</p>
<p>As it is anticipated that one or more games of SCP-2206 baseball will be required during the course of this operation, MTF Iota-18 has received extensive training in baseball operations, and includes a number of former professional baseball players and several members of captured SCP-2206 teams. Despite this, options for restoring SCP-6206 as Commissioner that do not rely on success in sporting contests are considered preferable, and should be pursued if at all possible.</p>
<p>Efforts to mitigate the effects of prior incursions, and to ensure that the 2020 Major League Baseball season is played without interference, are being handled by Agent Jeremy Steele as part of Operation <tt>PINCH HITTER</tt>.</p>

<h2 id="toc5"><span><strong>Addendum — Results of Operation <tt>Seventh Inning</tt></strong></span></h2>
<p>On 2020-04-01, an SCP-2206 broadcast was received which described the performance of an exhibition game, played between a combined team of American and National League All-Stars (the "Stars"), and a mystery team assembled by the deposed Commissioner (called the Select Commissioner's Players, or the "Skippers"). According to SCP-2206 commentators, a victory by the Skippers would result in the immediate reinstatement of the Commissioner, while a victory by the Stars would lead to the summary execution of the Commissioner and his team.</p>
<p>As described in the broadcast, the events and results of the game are as follows:</p>
