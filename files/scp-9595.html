<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the incorporeal nature of SCP-9595 events, physical containment of the anomaly is not feasible. All references to SCP-9595-1 on online platforms are to be flagged and removed by Foundation Webcrawler Team I/O ADORO.</p>
<p>Suspected SCP-9595 events are to be logged immediately, and any location where an SCP-9595 event occurred is to be cordoned off by the Foundation for 48–72 hours. Individuals disseminating information related to SCP-9595 events are to be amnesticized and monitored.</p>
<p>Containment efforts for SCP-9595-1 are currently ongoing. See Addenda.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9595 refers to a consistent, anomalous experience affecting individuals in deliberate or accidental proximity to a pizza.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Despite a lack of evidence that any such event occurred in baseline reality, individuals affected by it display vivid and highly detailed recollections of an identical sequence of events. These experiences center around a presumed humanoid entity referred to as the "Pizza freak," henceforth SCP-9595-1.</p>
<p>Through all testimonies, SCP-9595-1 has been determined to be a humanoid entity resembling stereotypical depictions of an "Italian chef." Auxiliary details consistently report it having an apparent age of 268 years and originating from Parma, Italy. Most notably, SCP-9595-1 exhibits an aggressive, compulsive obsession with consuming pizza. Observation of SCP-9595-1 while it is eating has led to incidents of severe, often fatal, bodily harm to victims.</p>
<p>Individuals who claim to have been harmed or killed by SCP-9595-1 remain adamant about their experience, despite exhibiting no visible physical trauma and being demonstrably alive at the time of reporting. Attempts to convince them otherwise have universally failed.</p>
<p>SCP-9595 events occur as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Victim enters the vicinity of pizza;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Victim reports an overwhelming smell of tomato sauce, freshly baked dough, and/or Italian herbs;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></li>
<li>SCP-9595-1 is observed at a distance, aggressively consuming a pizza, either completely clean or covered in sauce and cheese;</li>
<li>If the victim makes any noise at this stage, SCP-9595-1 will notice and attack, typically resulting in grievous injury or fatality, none of which reflect in baseline reality.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">I'm pretty sure I was killed</span></span></p>
<p>When I was a kid, my cousin and I were out near this fenced-off compound in the woods, one of those places people say used to be military but had crackwhores living in it recently. It was totally empty. No reason for it to be there. I don't know what we were doing there.</p>
<p>Then we smelled pizza. Tomato sauce, baked dough, oregano, maybe some pepperoni or a sausage perhaps. It was too strong to be nothing. And we look around and see this guy who was just standing there in the distance far on the opposite end of the fence. He was dressed like a cartoon chef or the guy on those cans of ravioli. Clean apron, chef’s hat, big mustache, clearly italian, weirdly calm. It was the Pizza freak. I knew that for sure. He was holding a pizza and staring at it like it was the holy grail. Then he started eating it like an animal, all fast and frantic, like he hadn’t eaten in years.</p>
<p>My cousin said something, and the guy froze mid-bite, and looked up at us, sauce and cheese dripping down his face. And then a feeling of dread overwhelmed me, and I felt everything and nothing at the same time. He moved fast. I don’t remember anything after that, just that we were running, and the smell followed us for a while. I'm pretty sure I got killed by the Pizza freak, but I know for sure he fucked me up in the leg and arm. Anyone else deal with this? What am I supposed to do here?</p>

<p>Foundation webcrawlers quickly flagged all mentions of SCP-9595 or SCP-9595-1 online and issued a blackout on the subject. Subsequently, an investigation was ordered by Overwatch Command.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9595.2:</strong> Foundation Investigation</p>
<p>Verification of SCP-9595-1's existence and its containment, if confirmed, became paramount. More than 250 interviews were conducted by Site-322 researchers, but all were fruitless in eliciting any empirical information regarding SCP-9595-1’s origin, nature, or behavior.</p>
<p>A small schism occurred within the SCP-9595 research team along ideological lines. Eleven members of the team, including the project director, Dr. Marley Mooney, maintained that SCP-9595-1 does exist, while the other fourteen were opposed.</p>
<p>As research intensified without definitive results, the non-believers grew increasingly disgruntled, questioning the validity of the project and its use of resources. To defuse mounting tensions, Site Director Paul Lague intervened and formalized the disagreement as a wager. Per the conditions of the agreement, if the existence of SCP-9595-1 can be verified, the non-believers will assume responsibility for the believers' administrative paperwork for two weeks. If no evidence is found, believers will fund an "extravagant pizza party"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> for the opposing side.</p>
<p>In addition, members of the victorious team in either scenario would each receive a $500 technology stipend, provided by the Foundation's discretionary morale funding.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9595.3:</strong> Investigation Outcome</p>
<p>After a review of both teams' findings, it was conclusively determined that SCP-9595-1 was a product of anomalously influenced mass psychogenic illness caused by SCP-9595. As such, Director Lague declared the non-believers winners of the wager and awarded them their pizza party.</p>
<p>Several pizzas were brought to Site-322's private cafeteria for the non-believers. The food was dropped off at 18:03 local time and left unattended. Without any discernible cause, the floor underwent a seven-minute blackout. During this period, no personnel were recorded entering or exiting the cafeteria, no alarms were triggered, and no motion detectors identified any activity.</p>
<p>The following was seen on the surveillance camera of Site-322’s private cafeteria at 18:11.</p>
