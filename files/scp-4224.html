<br/>
<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4224 is permanently located within a specialized containment cell within Site-97. SCP-4224 is to remain within its life support system permanently, and electricity is to be continuously supplied to the cell. A backup generator is also installed and automatically activated in the event of main power failure. Medical staff must constantly monitor SCP-4224's homeostatic status; any deviation from nominal levels must be immediately corrected. Secreted Substance RJ-O1 "ROYAL JELLY" is collected in a secure vessel exterior to SCP-4224's chamber. This vessel, and by extension all SCP-4224 products, are considered Class-V extreme biological hazards.
<p>255 instances of SCP-4224-1 are to be contained within a panopticon<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-746819-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-746819-1')">1</a></sup> located at Site-97. The cells are to be equipped with basic living facilities alongside an additional gas inlet, waste, and outlet pipes, as well as a wall-mounted monitor. Interactions with SCP-4224-1 instances are to be minimized, and guards must regularly be checked for DR-O1 "DRONE" infection.</p>
<p>Upon expiry of SCP-4224, an SCP-4224-1 instance is to be promoted to SCP-4224 status. Upon expiry of SCP-4224-1 instances, a random selection of D-Class without any notable characteristics, history or experience are to be exposed to DR-O1 followed immediately by RJ-O1 and contained as an SCP-4224-1 instance. SCP-4224-1 instances are to be conditioned to release Substance DR-O1 upon visual stimulation, while SCP-4224 is to be conditioned to release Substance RJ-O1 upon visual stimulation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Ennui Protocol Directive, the majority of Site-97's functions are controlled by a remote terminal, accessible only to the O5 Council.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-4224's life support system (hover to enlarge)</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4224 is a Russian female approximately 90 years old, named "Natalya Ignatova" prior to Foundation classification. Due to the deteriorating health of SCP-4224, it must be attached to a bespoke Foundation-created life support system.</p>
<p>SCP-4224 produces two products at will, designated RJ-O1 and DR-O1. These substances are detailed below.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RJ-O1 "ROYAL JELLY"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Viscous, translucent liquid at room temperature. Visually resembles honey.</p>
<p><strong>Containment:</strong> Contained in a chilled (5 <sup>o</sup>C) Class-V biological hazard liquid tank.</p>
<p><strong>Effects:</strong> Once RJ-O1 enters the digestive system in volumes greater than 500 mg, the individual is granted immunity to subsequent DR-O1 exposure. The individual's morphology changes to accommodate the generation of RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances unique to the individual, allowing them to create these substances at will. Infectees are designated SCP-4224-1.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> Due to the unfamiliarity of secreting RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances, individuals must be applied DR-O1 prior to RJ-O1 application. RJ-O1 may be administered orally or through injection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DR-O1 "DRONE"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Airborne viral pathogen. Invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p><strong>Containment:</strong> Contained in a body-temperature (37 <sup>o</sup>C) Class-V biological hazard aerosol tank or storage vat.</p>
<p><strong>Effects:</strong> Infection causes only behavioural symptoms, detailed below. When infected, the pathogen causes massive neural remodelling to the host's brain. This process takes approximately two weeks to complete and is highly energy intensive, requiring a caloric intake of 5000 kcal/day to sustain. After infection of DR-O1, the process is irreversible.</p>
<p>After initial infection, the disease begins the transformation in the prefrontal cortex and progresses posteriorly. Meaning that personality is affected first, before affecting other areas such as facial recognition, memory, language, reading, etc.</p>
<p>After the process is complete the individual's connectome will mirror that of the individual that synthesized the DR-O1 substance, creating a neurologically identical copy. Infected individuals act autonomously, but identify as the parent except in cases where infiltration is required, such as assuming a position of authority.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> For DR-O1 harvested before Ennui activation, an oral-nasal mask is attached to a DR-O1 tank and opened for 3 seconds once secured over the patient. Aseptic techniques must be followed when working with pre-Ennui DR-O1. DR-O1 harvested post-Ennui activation may be used freely.</p>

<em>Camera is stationary and pointed directly at SCP-4224, who is pacing within its cell. Researcher Everwood and Selks enter the frame, equipped with oral-nasal masks and air tanks and carrying chairs. Selks and Everwood seat themselves before SCP-4224's containment cell, facing away from the camera.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Good evening, SCP-4224.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (to Selks) Another one so soon? Shame, the old assistant started to grow on me.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> (to Everwood) You sure you want to take the lead?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> (to Selks) What do you mean?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Well, if you're uncomfortable taking the reigns, just let me know. Alright?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Sure thing. (to 4224) We would like to ask you some questions, if that's fine with you?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Do I really have a choice?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Of course you have a choice. We could come back tomorrow if now's a bad t-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks places a hand on Everwood's shoulder and shakes his head slightly.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Sorry, my colleague here's new to how we handle up-close interaction. What she means to say is that we can't force you to co-operate, per se, but we <em>can</em> reprimand you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (pause) Ask away.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Selks gestures to Everwood to continue</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Uh, so, (pause) when did you first come into possession of your anomalous traits?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> It was a long time ago. Back when I was in my mid-teens. I discovered a beehive in my garden shed. When I was little I loved fuzzy animals, and I managed to pester my mother to keep the hive in there. Funny thing is, because I had to move my bike out of the shed, it got stolen! All for those little bumbling creatures…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Is this tangent necessary?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Well, I remembered that the hive nearly died the previous winter, and I doubted it would survive another. I was concerned, so I waited until the temperature was low so that the bees would be pacified. When I peered into the hive and saw thousands upon thousands of dead bees, piled atop each other. A pile of cold, fuzzy bodies. I ran back into the house and cried in front of the fire. Those bees were the closest thing to a pet I'd had to that point.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks leans back in his chair and folds his arms. Everwood leans forward slightly.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> My mother sat by my side. I explained to her what had happened. I don't think she understood, but she went straight to the beehive. She returned shortly with her hands clasped around something.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Is this relevant to the question at hand?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (pause) Maybe if you listen a little longer, you'll find out?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks scoffs and looks to Everwood, who does not reciprocate.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> So my mother sits beside me and holds up an empty jam jar. Well, not exactly empty. "Natalya," she said, "do you know why the bees were like that?" I said I didn't. "They died for her." she said, raising up a single bee, frostbitten, shivering, but still alive.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>SCP-4224 sighs</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> I woke up the next morning and checked on the bee. It was gone, but it left behind some honey for us. We ate that honey with some toast, and I'd be lying to say it wasn't the sweetest honey we'd ever eaten. Ever since then, I've been able to do what I do.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks runs his hands through his hair and sighs.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> What a long-winded explanation.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (laughing) Sorry if I wasted your time. I don't get to talk to people very much.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks prompts Everwood to continue, who simply shrugs in response</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> This interview is over. We'll be back tomorrow, 4224, and I expect a more direct response.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Researcher Everwood turns off the camera. Video feed cuts to a shaky shot of Researcher Selks by a coffee machine</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> What are you doing, Everwood?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> A post-script. Might as well keep the logs in the same format, you know?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Whatever, you're the one who's going to have to write up the transcript.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> You said you'd do that!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> No, Everwood. I said I'd do the video recordings, but you were adamant you do those as well. I even complimented you on your independence.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> I don't reca-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> (interrupting) Anyway, you did alright in the interview. It's not the way <em>I</em> would've done it, but it was a decent job. The major issue, though, is that you didn't pressure her on her story. You just let that bullshit slide?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> What do you mean?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Her story was obviously just made up. A bee can't produce that much honey, especially overnight. Queens don't produce honey at all. There's too many contradictions with reality.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Couldn't the bees be anomalous?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> Are you just going to believe her blindly? That's a naïve approach, Everwood. A more likely explanation is she's just trying to play with us.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> I'm sure we can pick her up on it in future interviews.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Selks shakes his head, and places a hand on Everwood's shoulder.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> On the whole, you did great. Especially for a first attempt. I'm sure you're going to be a valuable asset in the future.<br/>

<em>Camera is placed in the same position as the first interview. Two empty chairs are placed before SCP-4224's containment chamber, and Everwood can be heard off-screen. After a brief adjustment of the camera's settings, Everwood alone sits before SCP-4224.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Good evening, SCP-4224. I'm here to ask you some questions.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Sure, go ahead.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> On the group organisation of those under the influence of "Delta-Romeo: Option-One 'DRONE'": we're aware that your drones act autonomously, but we were wondering how the social interaction between multiple versions of yourself would play out.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (brief pause) Where's that other guy?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> You mean Selks? He's off work today.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> So you're an intern or something, right?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Well, no. I work under him, but it's not really the same thing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Don't worry about it, Miss…?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Everwood. Doctor Everwood.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Well, Doctor Everwood, I hope you last longer than the last few he's had.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Is that a threat?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> (laughing) No, no. I haven't infected anyone since my twenties. I don't really know why they go, but nobody lasts more than a few months under him.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> And you think Selks is the reason they leave?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> He's the common thread. Besides, I've seen nice people get stepped all over before.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Both parties remain silent for a few moments. SCP-4224 sighs.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> They accept it, by the way. The drones, that is. They might rebel at first, depending on the circumstances, but they accept it eventually. In the end, it's just how benevolent your overlords are, isn't it?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Are you trying to say that Selks is more powerful than me? That's why he walks all over me?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Not really. I have power, Miss Everwood, and I could've made everyone clones of myself. It wouldn't have taken more than a few months. But I didn't. Why do you think I did that?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Because it's unethical?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Kind of. I'd be the worst tyrant in history. I'd literally be controlling thought, in a way. Putting me in charge would only make things worse.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> What does this have to do with me?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> You can use what power you have, or you can bury it. I buried it, and look where I ended up. Those that use power will <em>always</em> subjugate those that don't.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> (pause) Are you saying you think you should've infected everyone?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>4224:</strong> Maybe. (pause) I haven't figured that out yet, but I know I wouldn't be in where I am today. Ask yourself if you're happy. If you're not, be thankful you still have the chance to change it.<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> This is the post-script I guess. Interview was mostly uneventful, but I think we got some insight into SCP-4224's thought process. She seems to have taken a liking to me, for some reason.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Everwood remains silent for a few moments.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> She said something about being unhappy because of her actions. I think she regrets being submissive all of her life, never making her mark on the world, even when she knew she could.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Everwood sighs.</em><br/>

<strong>Everwood:</strong> Sedatives have taken effect. Proceeding with the physical checkup.<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Since "Video Log number 25" SCP-4224's Parkinson's has progressed to the point where her muscles are much stiffer and inflexible than before. While the medication has slowed it down, I doubt she'll last much longer. (pause) It's really a miracle that she's still able to communicate clearly.<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> It should. I added an addendum detailing its progression over the last couple months. The tremors started off small, but grew exponentially as time went on.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Selks:</strong> There's no mention of this on the file. (passing a datapad to Everwood) Here, take a look for yourself.<br/>

<strong>Addendum 4224-B: Heather Everwood's Research Request</strong>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3><span>Research Request</span></h3>
<p>By Researcher Heather Everwood, Level 3</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Request:</strong> To formally diagnose Parkinson's disease within SCP-4224.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Reason:</strong> From my observations of SCP-4224, it can't be denied that the signs of Parkinson's disease are obvious. However, site staff have neglected to formally diagnose the disease. The diagnosis is vital information not only to make informed decisions on what medication to give to SCP-4224, but also to understand the nature of DR-O1 "Drone".<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
For example, Parkinson's is a disease which affects the brain. Since DR-O1 copies the host's neural structure, one would expect to also see Parkinson's within the DR-O1 infectees. This is not the case; DR-O1 infectees show no signs of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="color: #990000">DENIED</span></strong> - SCP-4224 Lead Researcher, Frank Selks<br/>
<em>I've denied this on principle. I've said time and time again: Don't make requests on the official documentation. It's messy, undemocratic, and a pain in the ass. If you have any more research requests, file them to my desk.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><span style="color: #009900">OVERRULED</span></strong> - O5-7</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-4224 is Parkinson's disease positive.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
While DR-O1 infectees show no signs of Parkinson's, the areas where the Parkinson's disease is located in SCP-4224 are very different between subjects. In fact, it appears that DR-O1 only writes over brain matter, and ignores damaged sections. The implications of these results are still being discussed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> This research will likely provide great insight into the inner workings of the Drone pathogen. I'm honestly surprised that Researcher Selks didn't proceed with the diagnosis sooner. — O5-7<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Everwood ever-so-slightly beat me to the punch on publication. I was tracking the intensity of the tremors over the last few months to be certain of the diagnosis, but that unnecessary attention to detail seems to be something that I struggle with. — Frank Selks</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4224-C: NOTICE FROM THE OVERSEER COUNCIL</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2><span>NOTICE FROM THE OVERSEER COUNCIL</span></h2>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Effective immediately, SCP-4224 has been reclassified from Keter to Thaumiel. SCP-4224's threat level has been added to and is now dual red-white, rather than just red. This update has been due to recent discoveries regarding the nature of SCP-4224.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Staff are reminded that SCP-4224 is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not neutralized</span> and should not be considered as such. SCP-4224 should still be considered a Keter-Class SCP and is still to be respected. SCP-4224 is still capable of causing an IK-Class "end-of-individuality" scenario if it breaches containment.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
In addition, all staff are to be informed of the newly developed Ennui Protocol. The nature of this protocol is top secret, but the attached procedures are to be carried out once activated.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>- O5-7</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ennui Protocol Directive</span></strong></p>
<p>Upon activation of the Ennui Protocol, all contained SCP-4224-1 instances are relaxed with a sedative gas and Class-F amnestics. This induces a vegetative state where the SCP-4224-1 entities are rendered suggestible blank slates, where they may be influenced according to O5 Command using the monitors within each cell.</p>
<p>Once completed, the waste gas is siphoned from the room via the waste gas pipe and neurodegenerative cognitohazards displayed on the monitors, causing complete, irreversible loss of all brain function, with the exception of the semantic memory in all SCP-4224-1 individuals. Substance DR-O1 is then harvested and stored within an industrial-size aerosol storage tank. After 40 days of harvest, the aerosol is released into the atmosphere via funnels camouflaged as smokestacks.</p>

<h3><span>COMPLAINT REGARDING RESEARCHER FRANK SELKS</span></h3>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Reviewer:</strong> O5-10
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Recording&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> Greetings, Doctor Everwood. I hope your journey was pleasant.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> As pleasant as it could be. Yourself?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> Let's cut the pleasantries, if you don't mind. We're both busy people, I'm sure. Let's get to business.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Alright.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> For the record, please state the nature of your complaint.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> I believe Frank Selks, SCP-4224's Lead Researcher, has been taking credit for others' work, then proceeding to get their positions terminated before they have a chance to voice their side of things.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> That's quite a serious infraction, Doctor Everwoods. Do you have proof?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> It's come to my attention that Frank Selks, specifically, goes very quickly through Level-3 researchers, coinciding with major discoveries regarding SCP-4224. Researcher Taylor was relieved after Selks discovered that Drone only affects the neural web of the affected individual. Gomez was terminated after Selks proposed that RJ-O1 may give immunity to DR-O1's effects.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> This is odd, yes, but there's no clear cause and effect relat-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> (interrupting) And since I submitted the Ennui Protocol to Selks, I've seen my video log transcripts being uploaded to the main file. I'm certain he's trying to set me up.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> (pause) It has been reported that these logs are… unprofessional.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Yes! Of course it's been reported. Selks reported them, didn't he?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> I'm not at liberty to say.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Well, he's cherry-picked them. There are over 30 video logs, but only 3 have been uploaded, trying to highlight my worst behaviour and make it seem like I have it out for him.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> (pause) It has also come to my attention that your relationship with SCP-4224 is no longer completely professional, is that correct? You've been reported violating standard protocol when dealing with sentient SCP objects. Do you reject these claims?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> (pause) I don't see how this is relevant to my complaint.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> I'm saying, as you've become friendly with SCP-4224, you have a vested interest in seeing Researcher Selks demoted, yes?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Researcher Everwood remains silent.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> While more information is required, the Internal Affairs department will look over your case. If found guilty, researcher Selks will be terminated from his position, his research will be disqualified and retroactively fitted to reflect the true individuals responsible for the discoveries made.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Thank you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> However, your actions regarding SCP-4224 cannot be ignored. Neither can the fact that your presence has made an overall positive impact in SCP-4224's mental state. Normally, the ruling would range from demotion to termination of contract. I'm of the opinion that breaking the relationship you've forged with SCP-4224 would be a shame.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>O5-10 sighs.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-10:</strong> Henceforth, your clearance has been demoted to 0-GENERAL with special 4/4224 clearance. You are no longer permitted to work with SCP objects, staff or Foundation Sites not relevant to SCP-4224. You may appeal after one year. Is that understood?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Everwood:</strong> Yes. Thank you.<br/>

<strong>Addendum 4224-E: Heather Everwood's Overseer Review</strong>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3><span>Heather Everwood's Overseer Review</span></h3>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Two weeks after being reprimanded due to unusual behaviour regarding an SCP object, Heather Everwood has repeatedly breached protocol resulting in violations of safety protocol, gross misconduct and negligence. The circumstances of SCP-4224's death is unknown as Heather Everwood fails to comment on the matter.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Heather Everwood was discovered the morning following SCP-4224's death inside their containment chamber, sat beside SCP-4224's life-support system. Dinner plates, breadcrumbs and playing cards were found on the chamber's floor.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
A new SCP-4224 has been promoted.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The caveat for Everwood's employment at the Foundation was dependent on the relationship between herself and SCP-4224. While it must be a heartbreaking time for Everwood, her employment contract must be terminated.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I'll see her off in person. She deserves that, at least.<br/></p>
