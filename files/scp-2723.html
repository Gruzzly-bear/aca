<p>An instance of SCP-2723-A</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2723</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entrance to SCP-2723 is to be surrounded by a standard Type 2 Foundation Outdoor Security Outpost. In addition, the perimeter fence of this outpost is to be fitted with a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_laser">photonic fence</a> system programmed to target instances of SCP-2723-A as they exit SCP-2723.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2723 is an extra-dimensional anomaly located approximately 22 km outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. When viewed from the outside, SCP-2723 is not readily observable, with its entrance blending into the existing topography. When SCP-2723 is entered from a height below ~3 m, subjects will find themselves located in a pocket dimension. Side boundaries of this dimension are designated by the appearance of thick, grey fog, with no upper or lower boundaries discovered. Located in this pocket dimension is a large, multistory, cylindrical tower, designated SCP-2723-1. All floors of the tower are roughly circular in shape, and have either arches or columns in place of walls. A continuous spiral staircase leads up the center of the tower.</p>
<p>SCP-2723-A are a collection of organisms resembling mid-sized lepidopterans in size and shape, originating from within SCP-2723. Upon closer inspection, SCP-2723-A are composed completely of ash. How SCP-2723-A are able to carry out movement, flight, and observation of their environment despite their composition is currently unknown. All liquid and solid matter within one meter of SCP-2723-A will undergo rapid decay and decomposition. After reaching a certain point of decay, substances will begin to lose mass. Under normal conditions, SCP-2723-A will leave SCP-2723 for roughly one to three days. Upon the end of this time period, SCP-2723-A will return to SCP-2723, at which point they will spontaneously convert into an unidentified black liquid, which will weigh the approximate combined masses of the SCP-2723-A instance and the mass lost by decayed substances. This liquid will quickly soak into the ground in SCP-2723 upon contact. Research has discovered an extensive capillary system which extends through SCP-2723-1 and the ground of SCP-2723, which serves to transport the liquid to the top of SCP-2723-1, where it is then deposited as a viscous black substance.</p>
<p>SCP-2723-B is an autonomous mechanical device which appears to be composed primarily of silver, modeled after an adult male human, with the exception of the head, which is similar to that of an adult male instance of <em>Odocoileus virginianus</em> (White-Tailed Deer). SCP-2723-B inhabits the top floors of SCP-2723-1. SCP-2723-B is heavily coated in the black substance, and has been observed molding the substance into the upper floors of SCP-2723-1.</p>

<p>we execute Scholar Marba's punishment for his atrocities towards our Maker.</p>
<p>Marba served as the aide of Satir, carrying messages for him and retrieving news from all the land. He was a friend and neighbor to all the denizens of ████. He served us well, with nothing known to Crafters, Scholars, or Honorables which could stay his messages against his will.</p>
<p>His punishment will be a loss to all.</p>
<p>Prior to his current state, Marba refused to report the positions of The Furies of ████, despite having knowledge of them. Furthermore, Marba refused to alert the populace of the possibility of uprising. Finally, Marba aided the rebels by delivering their correspondences in secret.</p>
<p>The following orders have been commissioned for Marba's punishment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marba's breath is to be filled with poisonous fumes. This is so that he can see the death, pain, and suffering that his words have caused. This is also so that he may no longer freely speak to his allies as he pleases.</li>
<li>Marba is to be removed from his shell, which will then be burnt to ashes. This is so that his wings may no longer carry him to the far corners of the earth.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let it be known that this is the eternal will, testament, and statement of the Crafter known as Satir, who is in full command of his thought and will at the time of its writing.</p>
<p>I will retreat to a place of my my own design, a place of solitude. I am not to be disturbed during my stay there by the citizens of ████, with the exception of Espen. Marba is to stay with me, where I shall care for him, and he shall serve as my eyes and ears in the outside world. Espen should serve as a fair observer and wise council to ████ in my absence. I will continue to keep a record of the events in the world, should my account ever become truly necessary.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I made a mistake. I got on the wrong side of history. Even with as much foresight as I have, I still didn't believe what the consequences would be like. If we could go back and choose again which side we fought for, I don't doubt that any of us would try to support Fredrick and Agatha. But it's too late now, and there are some things that even I can't repair.</p>
