<p>SCP-8838</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8838</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8838's wellbeing is currently the responsibility of Dr. Krista Eiko. Both reside in an off-site two-bathroom housing unit close to Site-19. No further action is required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8838 is Dr. Connor Hyland, a Level 1 researcher for the Animal Science Division, formerly employed at Site-19. On February 14th, 2026, the second-floor ceiling in the North Wing of the facility suddenly collapsed, resulting in three casualties. One of the deceased was SCP-8838, though his corpse would remain unidentified for a few hours, as the area was on the opposite side of his workspace.</p>
<p>He was interred in the regional cemetery. His body was wholly non-anomalous. On his possession was a box of Ferrero Rocher brand chocolates, all crushed. Due to secrecy protocol, no individuals were allowed to attend the burial.</p>
<p>Through unknown means, SCP-8838's consciousness has been transferred into the vessel of an IKEA-brand standing lamp within Site-19's fourth-floor employee lounge (see image). SCP-8838 possesses some control over the lamp's body and various functions, as well as limited locomotion via "waddling" with its base. However, it requires a constant power supply to remain conscious. SCP-8838 professes complete ignorance as to how or why its consciousness was transferred.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of any ocular, audial, or vocal orifice, SCP-8838 is capable of sight, hearing, and verbal communication. However, the only individual capable of understanding it is Dr. Krista Eiko, a Level 2 IT technician for Site-19. As Dr. Eiko submitted a request of work leave immediately following the collapse, this would remain undiscovered for several hours.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Below are video surveillance transcripts taken from across Site-19, detailing the progression of SCP-8838's mental state following resurrection, as well as the actions of Dr. Eiko. Transcripts are divided between manifestation, discovery, containment, and the transfer process. Archival documents have been included where appropriate.</p>

<p><em>[The camera viewpoint is from the far-right corner of the room. Left of the door, a couch and two armchairs surround an ovaloid glass table. The armchair under the window curtains has a standing lamp plugged in next to it, filling the lounge with warm light. Underneath the camera is a standard refreshments bar, with a coffee machine and a standalone microwave visible atop the ceramic counter.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The standing lamp (now Dr. Hyland) suddenly falls to the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> -ista! <em>Krista!</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland shifts slightly on the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Wait, no, her office was on the far right, wasn't it? So-so then she should be safe! Oh god… HEY! Is anyone else hurt out th-</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland turns around.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><em>[Silence for several seconds. The lamp shade is visible twisting left and right, similar to the motion of a human head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm… not in the North Wing anymore? But this is definitely a Foundation facility. Was it some kind of teleportation anomaly that breached? Hopefully that means everyone else got out safe…</p>
<p><em>[The lamp shade faces downwards.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Wha- Hey! Where did my arms and legs go!? And I have a circular base with a wire coming out of it? Does that mean…</p>
<p><em>[The lamp shade twists around to scan the lounge.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I recognize this place from orientation — the fourth-floor rest room, was it? No, lounge, that was the word. Restroom is… something else entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> There's the counter, and the couch, and the table… judging from my viewpoint, and the lighting, and the base and the wire…</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland gulps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm… a lamp? How is that even possible?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> (groans) No! Stupid me! It's my job to figure that out!</p>
<p><em>[The lamp shade turns towards the camera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Like I thought, there's a camera here. Is it recor- yeah, it's recording. Okay. Alright… I can do this.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland takes a deep breath, before arching his body and vaulting itself upright on its base. He wobbles slightly from the force.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I am Doctor Connor Hyland, researcher for the Site-19 Animal Science Division, employee authentication code [REDACTED]. I believe… just a moment ago, I was caught in a… containment breach? Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I was walking through the second-floor North Wing on… personal business when I heard screaming, followed by the hallway collapsing onto itself. The last thing I remember is trying to dive away from the rubble, and now I'm here.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland pauses for a moment as his body slumps down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I suppose the inertia from the dive carried over into my new body, and so I fell on the carpet here. Wait, the chocolates, they're-!</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …They're probably crushed now. <em>(sighs)</em> It's fine, I'll just pick up another box… sometime.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland arches back upright.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Sorry, that was unprofessional of me. I shouldn't be worrying about those things when others may still be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> My new body appears to be the tall lamp from the fourth-floor lounge in the same site. I'm not too familiar on, uh, lamp terminology, so forgive my wording. I do have some control over my body, 'cause I'm able to move it around like a limb. And if my instincts are correct…</p>
<p><em>[The lamp light turns off, and then back on.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I can do that too. I suppose that figures.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hyland falls silent again. The body twists in its base slightly, before accelerating and spinning around.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Wheeee! This is pretty fun!</p>
<p><em>[The lamp stops spinning.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …This isn't awful. I don't feel restricted in here, honestly. Not having arms may take a bit of getting used to, but I don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm just… happy to still be alive.</p>
<p><em>[Suddenly, a person (Special Liason ████ ███████) enters the lounge, in the middle of a heated coversation with a classified contractor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> -do you <em>mean</em> "they delayed again"!? It's already been almost five days and the hallway's still not safe to use! Do you understand that?!</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Oh, thank goodness, just in time! I need some help, my soul got transported into this-</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> -I swear, it feels like everything is getting less efficient nowadays! I thought I'd be safe from that shit in the Foundation, but <em>no</em>. Jesus!</p>
<p><em>[███████ is wandering around the lounge impatiently while talking. Hyland keeps shifting his lamp shade to face ███████, but he does not appear to notice.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Huh? H-Hello, can you not hear me? I'm right here! I need you to call someone up here! Please!</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> No, wait, I-alright, I'll calm down. Okay? I'm calm now. So please, just-get someone else on the line that can help me. Okay? Okay.</p>
<p><em>[███████ is standing back in front of the lounge door. Hyland shifts around worriedly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Sir? Can you hear me now? Sir… Please…</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Oh thank goodness, I-</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> █████, is that your name? Alright, now please tell me why…</p>
<p><em>[███████ pushes the door open and walks down the dark hallway, his voice growing fainter before disappearing. Dr. Hyland's body slumps down again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Aw, Ffffff… Fiddlesticks. I knew there'd be a catch…</p>
<p><em>[His body swivels almost imperceptibly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I just hope Krista is okay… I only need that…</p>

<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Clothes, essentials, decorations for our offices, and, well, anything else that catches our eye.</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> You should come! It'll be just like our first year here!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Me? Come?</p>

<p><em>[Webb and Owston laugh amongst themselves. When they quiet down, Eiko's breathing is still audible behind the door. She gulps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I think I'm good. You two go on ahead, I'm just not feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Are you sure Krissy? It'd be a good chance to get some fresh air, and after all-</p>

<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Augh, fuck! Y'know, that kid Connor, he was so much better at this emotional softness shit than me! Fuckin' Animal Sciences, of course he'd know how to pitch his voice… dammit, why can't I speak like he did!?</p>
<p><em>[Webb steps backwards in shock, while Hyland gasps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Doctor Owston…</p>
<p><em>[After a moment, Owston relaxes her muscles, letting arms collapse onto the armrests as she looks down to the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> …Too soon, huh? Fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Just take a moment to calm down. I'll, uh, get back to the coffee.</p>
<p><em>[Webb returns to the counter as Owston sits, apparently contemplating.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …A week. The rubble, the ceiling collapsing, oh god, oh no no no <em>no no no</em>…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland begins hyperventilating again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm dead? N-No, of course I'm dead! Stupid… why else would I be here? My job revolves around living beings, how could I be so <em>blind</em>?</p>
<p><em>[Hyland begins quivering. He makes sounds indicating he is about to cry, but due to the lack of tear ducts this is impossible.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Mama, papa, everyone I know out there, do they think… that's what the Foundation does, isn't it? But… no, please, I'm not dead! I'm not! <em>I'm alive! Why can't you hear me!?</em></p>
<p><em>[Hyland's lamp shade turns to face Webb and Owston, both of whom remain unaware.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Krissy, she thinks I'm dead too, right? Would she even… augh, idiot! Stop thinking like that! If there's even a chance that my presence will help her, then I need to take it! It's as simple as that!</p>
<p><em>[Hyland inhales. He is still trembling slightly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …I think I know what to do.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. After a minute, Webb pours two cups of coffee before bringing them over to the other side. She places one on the table in front of Owston while beginning to sip from the other, still standing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Your shift starts soon, doesn't it? You should drink up.</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> …Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> <em>(laughs softly)</em> Don't worry about it. I'll try speaking to Krista one more time before-</p>
<p><em>[The lamp light switches off and back on. Both are visibly surprised.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> The heck?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I suppose it was just a power fluctuation.</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> But the display on the coffee machine stayed- oh, whatever. Tell Krissy I-</p>
<p><em>[The light flicks on and off again. Both are now visibly confused. Owston stands up and approaches the lamp.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Alright, something's definitely off.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> It appears to flicker whenever we say Krista's na-</p>
<p><em>[The lights flickers yet again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> There!</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Hmm…</p>
<p><em>[Owston stares down the lamp. Hyland gulps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Krissy.</p>
<p><em>[The lights flickers once more.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Krissy. Krissy. Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy-</p>
<p><em>[The lights starts flickering more and more quickly. Even when Owston stops, the rapid flickering only continues as the lamp begins shaking and wobbling uncontrollably. Both doctors step back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> W-Whoa Whoa WOAH HEY WHAT THE FUCK!?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> P-Please, just go! I'm-I'm sorry for scaring y-you, j-just please get Krista here! Please!</p>
<p><em>[Webb drops her mug on the floor, spilling coffee on the carpet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> L-Let's go! Head to the main office, we have to report this!</p>
<p><em>[Owston nods sharply, and both flee the lounge.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> A-a-ah, I think that worked… I just hope that-</p>
<p><em>[The lamp, which was shifted off-balance by the extreme vibrations, tilts to the left. It collides with the floor, causing the charger to get ripped from its socket. The light fades from the room. The lamp lies motionless on the carpet.]</em></p>

<p><em>[Initial camera viewpoint is of the hallway leading up to the lounge door. Dr. Krista Eiko walks into frame, dressed in unironed pajamas and socks. She is carrying only her phone, employee ID, a blanket draped over her shoulder, and a pair of wired headphones wrapped around her neck. Her hair is noticeably unkempt, while her eyes possess large sacks.]</em></p>
<p><em>[As she approaches the door, she looks up to the placard next to the doorframe. It reads: "4th Floor Lounge Area", with a braille translation underneath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> They said they'd be here, right? I should talk to them more…</p>
<p><em>[After a pause, she places her hand on the doorhandle and enters.]</em></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>[VANTAGE TRANSITION: HALLWAY -&gt; FOURTH FLOOR LOUNGE]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Same viewpoint as Logs 1 and 2. The coffee mug is still on the ground, and the lamp is still tipped over and unplugged. No persons entered the lounge between Log 2 and now. Dr. Hyland remains unresponsive.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Eiko opens the door. She pauses in shock at the state of the lounge before returning to a slouched position.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Luvenia? Ayumi?</p>
<p><em>[No response; it is then that Eiko notices Dr. Owston's coffee cup on the table, still full.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Guess they went out to get something…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko slowly walks over to the left side of the large couch, walking past the unplugged lamp. She sits down, pulls her legs up onto the couch, and wraps herself in the blanket. She puts on her headphones, connects them to her phone, and begins playing music.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Twenty minutes pass. During this time, Eiko remains stationary on the couch, occasionally singing along to the lyrics, though too faintly for the camera to pick up. Now and then her eyes well up with tears, though she makes no motion to wipe them away. She watches the pattern of sunlight cast by the curtains move across the floor and creep up the walls.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Nobody comes into the room.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eventually, Eiko looks back up. She presses a button on the side of her headphones, pausing the music. She sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> This was stupid…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko gets up, pulls the headphones down and the blanket around her, and walks to the door. As she puts her hand on the doorknob, she looks back at the lounge, before opening the door and leaving. It closes shut behind her.]</em></p>
<p><em>[No activity for fifteen seconds.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko comes back in, looking directly at the lamp. After a brief hesitation, during which she mumbles something inaudibly to herself, she walks over to the lamp and begins setting it upright.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> A guy I knew… he'd always tell me that everyone and everything around us, no matter how big or small, deserved help. He worked with animals, so I guess that's what he was taking about, but… I figured it'd only be right if I helped you too.</p>
<p><em>[After lifting the lamp, she crouches down and takes the charger in her hand, plugging it back into the socket.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> GAH!</p>
<p><em>[At the sudden exclamation, Eiko jumps back in shock, just barely avoiding the coffee stain on the carpet. Scared, she looks up at Hyland.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> That was horrific! Come to think of it, it felt just like how I remember the time between the collapse and this morning! Of course I'd need the plug to stay conscious… How can I be so careless!? Stupid…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> E-Excuse me sir, I… wait, collapse?</p>
<p><em>[The lamp shade turns to face Eiko, who has stopped trembling.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Oh, I'm so so sososo sorry! I should've known the person who plugged me in was still… here…</p>
<p><em>[Silence. Hyland and Eiko stare at each other for an extended length of time.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> K-Krissy! You came! Ah, I'm so happy to see you has it really been a week I'm sorry I didn't come back earlier I should've tried I just didn't know-</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's lamp shade begins spinning around wildly as he rambles. Eiko's eyes widen. Her breath slows down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> -where I was I can't really remember but it doesn't matter 'cause I'm here now the chocolates got crushed but I can buy you new-</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> No way…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland goes quiet. Eiko presses her hands into the carpet below her.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> That… That <em>voice</em>…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Huh? M-My voice… you can hear me!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I'd recognize that voice <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> You… you would?</p>
<p><em>[Eiko pushes herself up, and she begins to stand. Seeing her full frame, Hyland gasps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Krista, have you been taking care of yourself? You look… It's not because of me, is it? I'm so sorry-</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> C-Connor? Am I dreaming?</p>
<p><em>[Eiko pinches her skin. She winces in pain and looks back at Hyland standing before her.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> No… it can't…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's lamp shade twitches enigmatically. Neither says anything. Only the buzz of his lightbulb is audible.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Say something…! Plea-</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> 555-571-7302.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> H-Huh?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …That's the number I gave you, wasn't it? You remember, back when I gave you that letter in 2023, along with the Kit-Kat? The personal line. The one to talk to me with any time. Nobody else knew about that…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko whimpers, as does Hyland.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I don't know if you still have it, but… I remember the first message I sent you. "Hello", all lowercase, followed by three exclamation marks and a colon-three.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Y-y-you're kidding… b-b-but… h-h-how-</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> It's me, Krista. It's Connor… I'm back.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Connie…</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> It's just like I remember… you were always so good at identifying voices-</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONNIE!!!</span></em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko lunges at Hyland. She roughly and tightly embraces him in her arms, nuzzling her head underneath the lamp shade. His frame twitches while her arms shake. The lamplight flickers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Woah! E-Eiko-</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Connie! <em>Connie! Connieeeee-uaghhahaa…</em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko begins violently sobbing. Her tears trickle down the lamp, across the base and onto the carpet. Hyland adjusts his lamp shade to cover Eiko's crying.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Krissy…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I-I-I-I thought I lost you f-forever… Augh…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Hey, d-don't worry about it… just please, let it all out. You… You don't need to b-bottle it in anymore.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko attempts to respond but is unable to formulate any words. She continues shaking and crying into Hyland's body. Hyland sniffles as his lamp shade looks down to face Eiko's back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I don't have arms to console you with… but I'm here. Even when you're done crying… I'll still be here. I'll always be here. I'll…</p>
<p><em>[A couple of minutes pass. Eiko's crying slows down, and she brings herself out from under Hyland's cover. She arches upright and cups his lamp shade in her hands, looking at him. Hyland adjusts the shade to nuzzle it within her palms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm happy…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland makes a noise that indicates he is attempting to cry again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> If someone from my past life knows I'm alive again… I'm happy it's you…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's shade shivers in her hands, but Eiko holds him firm. Despite the tears, a wide smile appears on her face. The two of them remain unmoving.]</em></p>
<p><em>[No movement for forty-five seconds.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Suddenly, there is a sharp knocking on the door. Eiko jumps slightly and looks back in shock, while Hyland peers over her shoulder. A voice is audible on the other side.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Investigative Officer █████:</strong> Hello? Is anyone in there?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> W-Who are you?!</p>
<p><em>[A second and third voice join the first.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Krista?</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> You came?!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Wha- Luvenia? Ayumi? Where have you been!?</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Get out of there! The lamp's acting weird!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> It's not… guys, it's Connor! Connor's alive!</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Sorry about scaring you!</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Krista, dearie, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Huh? C-Can't you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>█████:</strong> Do you mean the lamp?</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> I didn't hear the lamp talking!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> What? But he just told you he was sorry about scaring you!</p>
<p><strong>Owston:</strong> Guh, I'm so confused. Should've had that damn coffee…</p>
<p><em>[Quiet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>█████:</strong> Well, looks like there's a lot to sort through here. Dr. Eiko, could you come with me? And bring the lamp with you, if you could.</p>

<p><em>Preliminary interviews with Drs. Owston, Webb and Eiko confirmed that only the lattermost was able to audibly understand Dr. Hyland. Dr. Owston and Dr. Webb were allowed to return to their normal duties, while Dr. Eiko was brought it to translate the earlier surveillance logs of the fourth-floor lounge.</em></p>
<p><em>As standard procedure dictates that the initial interview of an anomaly must be conducted with the subject alone, a temporary response chamber was constructed for Hyland, consisting of binary "yes-no" reply buttons.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>[VANTAGE TRANSITION: INTERVIEW ROOM -&gt; HALLWAY E]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Two hours have passed since the conclusion of Dr. Hyland's interview. He is temporarily stationed in the hallway outside. His power cord is plugged into a portable charger, both on top of a plastic dolly. He is silent.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Eiko walks into frame, having finished assisting in the transcription of the earlier logs. She pauses upon seeing Hyland, staring at him from a distance. She is silent.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Around thirty seconds pass. Hyland's shade turns to face Eiko, evidently having realized her presence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Hi, Krista!</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Connor…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Just admiring you.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Ah…</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> You can come over, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I guess I should do that, yeah.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko approaches Hyland. She turns her back to the wall and slumps down on the ground before bringing in her knees with her arms. Neither says anything.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eventually, Eiko pulls out her phone to begin looking through her SCiPNET messages. Noticing this, Hyland shifts his dolly over to Eiko and turns on his light. Eiko looks up at him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> It's not good to read in the dark… I'm worried about your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Oh. Um, thanks.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko looks down and shakes her head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> ..How are you holding up?</p>
<p><em>[Hyland fidgets.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> It's strange… I feel like it still hasn't hit me that I died back there. I know it's been a week, but it doesn't feel like a week, because things still look the same. But then I try to move like a human, or take a look at you, and it all comes rushing back.</p>
<p><em>[He shakes his lamp shade.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> They told me during the interview… after my burial, they went through all the post-termination processes. My mom, my dad, my friends and relatives…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland inhales deeply. He is attempting to stifle his crying.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> <em>(hoarse)</em> They've been i-informed… of my passing… of c-course, the Foundation can't exactly tell them I came b-back to life, so… t-that's it, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> There's s-still a lot I have to get used t-to… but I will! I-I'll do it! I can't let it all wash over me again… I need to drill the truth into myself. I can't just keep coasting on my feelings like this, taking what comes so casually. Because that's not fair to <em>you</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko looks up at him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I-I've always had a problem trying to break out of my inertia… that's why I grew so connected to you. I could always tell… you wore your heart on your sleeve. You felt everything, so intensely. You weren't afraid to be raw to people…</p>
<p><em>[He inhales again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Every time I visited you, even in 2025 when it was just the Valentine's chocolates, I always felt a burst… a burst of color into my life! They say I'm good at talking to people, and being easy to talk to in turn, but… that's not true! I'm j-just a people-pleaser who avoids all conflict…</p>
<p><em>[He fidgets once more. Unbeknownst to him, Eiko's eyes are starting to well up with tears again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> When I felt that attraction to you, I was inspired to break the cycle of my own life… that's why I went straight to the chocolate and messages. But still, it was so hard, and all I wanted was to go back into my bubble… and so we drifted apart.</p>
<p><em>[Hyland pauses for a moment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm going to live. I'm going to feel it, feel those emotions like you. I'll cry, and I'll be raw, and I'll make sure I get reality into my head. I'll stop coasting and live… for your sake.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko covers her mouth with her hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Y-you're kidding me…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Krista-</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Why on Earth are you blaming yourself?!</p>
<p><em>[Eiko stands up, angry. Hyland flinches. Eiko's expression suddenly collapses as she drops into her face and begins weeping.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Moron… Don't you get it!? It's my fault! I'm the one to blame!</p>
<p><em>[Eiko is now breathing heavily]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Those flashes of color you're talking about? Those are the only times I stepped out into the world! I was why we drifted apart!</p>
<p><em>[Eiko clenches her teeth as she composes herself. She fails.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I thought I could avoid ever crying if I never had anything to cry over! That's why I studied computer science! That's why I got this job, so I never had to talk to people! I'd never have to… care…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko inhales.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I was so scared. My heart yearned for more, but I've always been so <em>fucking</em> scared. I didn't know what would happen if I lost the things most precious to me, and people and relationships felt so <em>fragile</em>…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko chuckles roughly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Fear of the unknown… figures for a place like this, huh? I thought this position would validate my fears, because see! The world is frightening and unknowable and unpredictable and can snatch everything away in an instant! So why would I ever <em>try</em>?!</p>
<p><em>[Eiko sniffles in. She looks down to the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> B-But then came Luvenia, and then Ayumi, and then <em>you</em>, you all came into my life, and it was everything I wanted, and needed, but NO! I didn't want to risk it! I didn't want to risk feeling those emotions, not knowing what my own heart was doing! And so- and so- my <em>fucking</em> brain thought that I could just return to how it was! All I'd have to do was-</p>
<p><em>[Eiko inhales, attempting to subdue her crying.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …push you all away.</p>
<p><em>[She gulps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I "knew" it was the right thing to do, and yet I found it so hard. Luv and Ayumi, I saw them less, and each time I did they were more worried than the last. God, they tried so hard to pull me out of my idiocy, but I never listened.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> You… it was a different kind of regret I felt for you. You were always so <em>stable</em>… you're basically the only person I ever felt truly calm around. The way you wrote, the way you spoke, it was always so level, so <em>right</em>. My heart wanted nothing less but to be around you, and yet my oh-so-logical brain didn't allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> The less I saw your face, the more the regrets grew… and then came your 2025 Valentine's letter. I know you tried to word it as softly as you could, but… shit, that only made it hurt so much fucking more.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I wanted desperately to fix it, but at the same time the nightmares wouldn't stop <em>clawing</em> at me… I kept putting it off. Summer, Halloween, the Christmas party, I thought I could end the spiral and reach you on the other side, but I was so terrified of <em>falling</em>, and eventually I thought I'd finally be able to talk to you when you came with the 2026 Valentine's chocolates, because you <em>always</em> came with the chocolates! I could always just procrastinate until then! I could always rely on Valentine's Day! <em>Why even try something else?!</em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko is breathing rapidly now. She clutches her head with her hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> And then… I heard the snapping in the roof… I heard the ceiling collapse right outside my office… I…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko quivers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I rushed out… they'd already closed off the area, but… I could see your arm poking out from under the rubble, and a box of crushed chocolates… and I kept reloading the obituary page, hoping and hoping…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …right up until I saw your name pop up. Black text on white background.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> Krista…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Ugh… Augh…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko collapses on her knees.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I'm the reason you were in that hallway. I'm the reason you died. I'm the reason… your parents think you died young…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …and even then, the first thing you did when you came back… was try to make sure I was okay…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I don't… deserve you… it's all… <em>it's all</em>…</p>
<p><em>[Sniffle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IT'S ALL MY FUCKING FAULT!!!</span></em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko sobs profusely. Hyland shifts closer to make sure she is covered by his lamp shade.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> It's all me… It's all me… I'm such… a horrible person…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> Hey, It's okay. It's okay. Let it all out.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> The only reason… I have you back… is all luck… otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> Hold on to my voice. I'm right here. I'm right beside you. You're not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Connie…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> It's me. It's Connie. It's me.</p>
<p><em>[Hyland continues consoling Eiko for the next couple of minutes. Given the secluded nature of the hallway, there are no passersby to interrupt them.]</em></p>
<p><em>[As Hyland keeps reassuring Eiko, she gradually sobs less and less, eventually being to stop completely. She wipes her tears off with her shirt sleeve and returns to a sitting position underneath Hyland's light. Both are silent once again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I feel better now, weirdly. Like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I'm happy to hear that… crying is an effective way to relieve your stress.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Hah, yeah, I remember that from school. Sorry for unloading all of that onto you. Might've been a bit insensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> On the contrary, I'm… really happy that you trust me enough to be vulnerable like that! Besides, I told you my issues first. Though there is the issue of the security camera…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Aw shit, I forgot about that. <em>(cuckles)</em> Fuck, this was the most I've ever said to someone in, like, <em>years</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> You're not a horrible person, Krista. Not in the slightest.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Hard to believe otherwise sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Hmm…</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Okay, how about this? I… won't blame myself for everything?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> It's not fair for me to try and shoulder everything. It's rather insensitive myself. Things are so much more complicated, after all.</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's lamp shade turns to face Eiko.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …And now that I've taken this step, I hope you can follow me.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> W-What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> You shouldn't hold all the blame either. We can figure this both out… together.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko stares at Hyland for a moment, before breaking out laughing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> You really are something, aren't you?</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> In a good way?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …Thanks, Krissy. That means a lot to me.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> A second chance…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …I'll finally have the conversation I thought I'd never get to do.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko stands up and holds Hyland's lamp shade in her hands again. Hyland is visibly flustered.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I'm not putting off what I wanted to say anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> A-a-ah?</p>
<p><em>[Eiko reaches down and grips the handle to Hyland's dolly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> We can go to my room, if that's okay with you.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> T-There's…</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's lamp shade twists nervously.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …no one I trust more than you.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko smiles softly. She pulls Hyland with her out of frame.]</em></p>

<p><em>[The door to Dr. Eiko's dorm opens. The hallway light illuminates the otherwise dark room; it is in a comparable state to Log 1.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Sorry, I didn't have time to fix it up…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> That's fine. We can take care of it later, it's been a long day.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko moves Hyland to just left of the TV. She navigates her way over the clumps of clothing and other miscellaneous trash, arriving at the couch. She reaches underneath the blue coat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Is that my old coat?</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Kind of. It's a new one I brought. Something else to remember you by, because reading your Valentine's still hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Oh…</p>
<p><em>[Eiko grabs something from the wedge of the couch.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> But… that's all in the past now, right?</p>
<p><em>[She pulls out a small felt box, the contents unknown. She feels the lid flap with her thumb and then stuffs the box into her pant pocket. After a moment of silence, she turns back to face Hyland. She is smiling even more now.]</em></p>
<p><em>[She is silent as she watches Hyland. His light flickers enigmatically.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> God… even as a lamp, you've always been so reliable. Cool metal and warm light, I can't think of anything more fitting for you. Fuck, I can't stop looking at you.</p>
<p><em>[She walks back to Hyland, holding his shade in her hands one more time.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Like a beach to my ocean, you were there to give me form. I always knew you were there, stable, strong, known… you never pushed me around like a cliffside, and you never folded away like so many grains of sand in the wind. You fit me like a puzzle, sometimes I wonder how I lived life before you.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko delicately rubs the shade's fabric.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> <em>(chuckle)</em> My knight in shining light, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>[Quiet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Cold ocean waters… you make me feel right. The wit of your words, the depths of your knowledge, they way you laughed, the way you spoke, I never thought someone could be so infinite… or rather, that I could see such an infinity in another person.</p>
<p><em>[His light grows brighter.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I can feel the shivers. They are the percussion that my heart and lungs need to finish their symphony. Even now when I look into your eyes, I feel the rush of wind invigorating my every inch, and I feel like I can face the world, as long as I have you by my side! I… I can't… I just so happy that I was able to live at the same time, in the same place, as someone like you!</p>
<p><em>[Sniffle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I want to be a caretaker for the world, and sometimes I wonder what the point is! But then realize there's people like you in this reality, and I realize that it's all been worth it!</p>
<p><em>[Fidget.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> You're so cool… you're so energetic… you're so soft… Ah, I can't figure out the words I want to say! I just… I can't take my eyes off you either!</p>
<p><em>[Hyland whimpers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I don't know what this feeling is… I'm just so <em>happy</em>…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Hey… I don't understand it either, but I'm happy too.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko brings Hyland in closer.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> No, I'm ecstatic! Because you're alive.</p>
<p><em>[The two of them are audibly holding back tears. Several seconds pass as they remain still.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko shuts her eyes, letting two small drops run down her face. She reaches into her pant pocket and pulls back out the felt box. She eyes it for a moment before opening the lid.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A replica diamond ring made of construction paper is within. The lid covers it from Hyland's view.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> I have one more thing I want to say. A question. Are you prepared, o knight of mine?</p>
<p><em>[Hyland's shade twists nervously.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I don't know if this is presumptuous of me… but I think I already know what that question will be.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko glares at Hyland for a moment. She laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> And I think I already know your answer.</p>

<p>Following the events logged above, Drs. Eiko and Hyland began official motions for the transfer of the latter's containment to the former. While the process typically would have taken several months — an issue compounded by the necessity to recognize an official engagement (and subsequent rapid marriage) between an anomaly and a staff member — additional assistance from Drs. Webb and Owston in getting the documents recognized and transferred allowed the majority of steps to be completed only one month.</p>
<p>By the end of March, the only steps remaining were official signoffs from two more members of senior staff. A final meeting to go over important forms was set up during this period.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>[The office, located on Site-19's first floor, is a green-carpeted room with a wooden desk in the center. In attendance are Drs. Eiko and Hyland, discussing the final stages of form ratification with Site-19 Secretary Ragnar Kristo. Kristo sits behind the desk, a set of documents laid out in front of him. Eiko sits on the other end, embracing Dr. Hyland between her legs and arms, both folded. Given the nature of the meeting, site director Tilda David Moose is also present, watching from the corner.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eiko and Hyland look ahead and nod along as Kristo moves through paper copies of (in order) the Personnel Special Character Evaluation Certification (PSCEF, more rigorous version of PCEF), Official Containment Transfer Request (OCTP, two copies), Official Foundation Marriage Approval Form (OFMAF, extended version), 2021 Specialized Human-Anomaly Interaction Ethics Module Completion Certificate, and 2023 Warranty of Damage to Anomalies (WDA), alongside various sub-forms. Eiko noticeably grimaces at the names of the last two.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The meeting takes in total three hours. Eiko and Hyland occasionally discuss certain elements of the transfer arrangement<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> with Kristo. Eiko translates Hyland's statements when necessary.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Despite the short timeframe the process was finished in, all forms are determined to be complete and accurate. Kristo assures Hyland and Eiko that their part is completed, and recommends they begin packing for the move. After one final congratulation for their marriage, he nods to Dir. Moose, who proceeds to exit from the right door. After a moment, Kristo begins to follow behind her.]</em></p>
<p><em>[He passes through the doorframe. Begin relevant audio except.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Um, Mr. Kristo?</p>
<p><em>[Kristo pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Do you think we'll be alright, in the end?</p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> Hm? What makes you say that?</p>
<p><em>[Eiko stutters.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> Even now, it still feels like I'm trapped in a dream. Like things are too good to be true. I'm worried, that one day I'll wake up and it'll all be gone again…</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Honey…</p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> That's nonsense.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko and Hyland both turn to face Kristo.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> How can you be so sure, though?</p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> What does Dr. Hyland think?</p>
<p><em>[Eiko looks back at Hyland, nestled between her arm and shoulder.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> I feel the same way too, a lot of the time… I…</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> <em>(back to Kristo)</em> He says he feels the same.</p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> There's the paradox. You can't both be dreaming.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko and Hyland look on, stunned. Kristo rubs the bridge of his nose.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> You might think we live in a comedy, or a tragedy, but none of that's true. Our duty is anomalies, no? You can't expect the unexpected.</p>
<p><em>[Kristo looks up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> Sometimes that unexpected is truly awful, but sometimes it's a dream come true.</p>
<p><em>[Kristo turns back to the couple.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> Sometimes the universe throws you a bone- or hell, a mountain of bones. There doesn't have to be a reason to it. "Working with what you're given" isn't always a negative thing.</p>
<p><em>[He smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> You'll be fine, I know you will.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> But what about-</p>
<p><strong>Kristo:</strong> Tilda feels the same way as me, I assure you. Even if it doesn't seem like it.</p>
<p><em>[He waves goodbye to the two as he finally leaves. He flicks the room light off on the way out. Hyland and Eiko are alone.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …I guess that's that then.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> Seems like it.</p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> And you're in my arms.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> …I love you, Connor.</p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> …I love you too, Krista.</p>
<p><em>[Eiko pulls Connor up and presses her nose into his shade.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Eiko:</strong> You won't leave me again, will you?</p>
<p><em>[Hyland turns on his bulb. His light casts a shadow of the two against the wall. It is the only thing visible in the now-dark room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hyland:</strong> No. Never.</p>
