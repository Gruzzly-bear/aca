            <h1>SCP-4037</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4037</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4037 is to be kept in its original wooden box inside a standard lead-lined storage container at Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4037 is a set of seven metallic wristbands, numbered SCP-4037-1 to -7; all seven objects are practically identical, with insignificant variations in mass. SCP-4037 objects measure approximately 100 mm in diameter, 15 mm in width and 3 mm in thickness. The wristbands are made from a duralumin-like alloy, notably containing tungsten in non-negligible proportions. Despite not containing any radioactive materials, the objects emit weak but constant x-ray radiation; effective radiation dose from 24 hours of exposure is equal to approximately 0.0021 rem (approximately equivalent to two days of exposure to Earth's natural background radiation). The objects' interior makeup is homogeneous, containing no extraneous materials, bodies or cavities.</p>
<p>SCP-4037 was discovered after an investigation of a case of mass suicide by local law enforcement in ██████████, Wales. Investigation began after a postal worker called emergency services due to a foul smell emanating from the residence located at ██ ██████ ██. Seven partially decomposed bodies, four male and three female, were discovered inside the building, each wearing an SCP-4037 object (in their idle states at the time); cause of death was determined to be exsanguination due to severed carotid arteries.</p>
<p>After examination of writings found on the scene, victims were found to have been part of a doomsday cult called Temple of the Seventh Heaven. Embedded Foundation assets were alerted to SCP-4037's existence after it was sent to Cardiff University for detailed study, at which time the object was taken into Foundation custody, involved persons were administered amnestics, and official documents were appropriately amended. Transcripts of the discovered writings are enclosed in Addendum 4037/008.</p>
<p>During initial containment, a container was found at the scene of the suicide, believed to be the original storage for SCP-4037. The container is an ornate wooden box measuring 60 cm × 60 cm × 35 cm (L × W × H) with double doors on top. Interior is covered in felt and contains eight cavities perfectly accommodating SCP-4037; seven are located radially around an eighth, located in the center. All eight cavities are equal in dimensions. The container bears no markings and exhibits no anomalous properties. Extensive searches have been conducted, but an eighth SCP-4037 object (provisionally numbered SCP-4037-8) has not yet been located; it is unknown whether SCP-4037-8 is identical to the other seven SCP-4037 objects, but it is assumed that it bears superficial similarity.</p>
<p>Each SCP-4037 object has an identical pattern of small depressions (approximately 0.5 mm in diameter and depth) around its circumference. The depressions are spaced unevenly. No meaning to their configuration has been discerned as of yet, and no definite theory has been formulated on whether these features are ornamental or functional. Current attempts at deciphering the pattern involve studying potential information carried by the intervals between depressions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When at rest, SCP-4037's diameter is large enough to allow most humans to put their hand through it. Once around a human wrist, SCP-4037 usually (see below) enters its active state, which is marked with an approximately 27% increase in x-ray output. SCP-4037 also reconfigures itself to fit snugly around the wrist. This process involves the object changing its dimensions — primarily diameter and thickness, although some variation in width has also been observed. Throughout this process, the object's mass stays constant, though the object's density undergoes slight variation. The size of the depressions on SCP-4037's surface also changes to preserve their configuration relative to each other. In addition to changes in measurements, the object rapidly heats up to match the subject's body temperature. The processes involved in SCP-4037's ability to recognise acceptable human candidates and change its shape and temperature are not yet understood.</p>
<p>As long as only one subject is wearing SCP-4037 in a 30 meter radius, they experience no anomalous effects. When attempting to remove it, SCP-4037 reconfigures itself to normal size and returns to its idle state; however, SCP-4037 may only be removed in this way as long as the wearer is conscious and not inwardly opposed to the object's removal. Forcible removal of SCP-4037 remains possible through amputation or other trauma.</p>
<p>Primary anomalous effects are exhibited when more than one subject is wearing SCP-4037 in a 30 m radius — these subjects are referred to as "connected". After several minutes, connected subjects appear to gain rudimentary telepathic abilities — this phenomenon is referred to as "connection". Initially, this connection is maintained only while staying within 30 m of each other; however, as more time is spent by the subjects around each other, the effective range becomes longer, and the connection between the subjects becomes more profound.</p>
<p>After spending approximately two hours in a connection, subjects are able to meaningfully communicate without vocalisation; by that point subjects also gain basic familiarity with skills, knowledge and mental conditions of other connected subjects. The degree of connection between subjects grows exponentially with time, though a higher number of connected subjects leads to slower growth. Most effects of SCP-4037 exposure disappear fully within 24 hours of connection termination.</p>
<p>The following definite properties of these anomalous effects have been ascertained in the course of experimentation with the object:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-4037 only enters its active state when exposed to humans older than 12 years with average hand and forearm proportions.</li>
<li>Once an initial connection is formed, new participants may only enter the connection if they are within initial effective range (30 m) of the existing participants.
<ul>
<li>Groups of subjects separated by distances greater than 30 m form separate connections amongst themselves, without interlinking.</li>
<li>Bringing two separate connected groups within 30 m does not lead to an interlink.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connections propagate by proxy; as long as each member of a connection is connected to at least one other member, total connection is maintained.
<ul>
<li>Exiting effective range severs the connection until such a time when the effective range extends far enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time spent outside of the connection does not contribute to alterations in mental state; when outside of effective range, SCP-4037 is considered not to exhibit its primary anomalous properties in practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the single prolonged exposure experiment currently on file (see Addendum 4037/012), prolonged connection has been observed to create an extremely powerful mental link between subjects. Prolonged connection also creates extreme aversion to the idea of being parted from SCP-4037 in the subjects. However, it is currently unclear whether this is an anomalous property of the object itself, or an effect of the relationship established between connected subjects. Short-term exposure (defined as up to two hours) does not carry this risk.</p>
<p>An abridged experiment log is enclosed in Addendum 4037/011. Proposed potential military, medical, scientific and other applications of SCP-4037 are discussed in Addendum 4037/022.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>Addendum 4037/008: Temple of the Seventh Heaven Writings (Abridged)</span></h3>
<p>A diary was discovered alongside one of the deceased members, █████ ███████, at the place of initial containment. Transcripts of entries from the notebook are provided below. The date of the first entry, ██/██/20██, is henceforth referred to as Day 1, and each entry is dated relative to Day 1. In total, 43 entries have been omitted for brevity; an unabridged transcript of all entries is available in Addendum 4037/009.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have all been officially inducted into the Temple. I feel truly blessed. I shall be our Teacher's scribe and preserve His teachings for future acolytes.</p>
<p>His first lesson was spiritual resolve. Modern society and inventions cause many to become complacent, wanting and striving for nothing. Only those who constantly struggle towards self-betterment are blessed and pure. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 25</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truly, a miracle has occurred today: our Teacher presented us with bracelets He calls soul-bands. He says they are a special and wondrous gift to Him from God, and it is true — our meeting today took place as we were wearing our soul-bands, and we all felt a most profound spiritual connection with each other. It was almost as though I could feel my brothers and sisters while we were reflecting. We all felt happy and joyous. Brother ██████ wept. We had to leave our soul-bands after the end of our meeting, and the loss we felt was great, but I look forward to our next meeting.</p>
<p>Today, His lesson was on the earthly and the heavenly. Many are misguided, thinking earthly desires sinful and resenting them. In truth, as the soul inhabits the flesh, the flesh affects the soul. Fulfilling earthly desires is simply another step towards purifying the soul, for when the flesh is healthy and content, the soul may endeavour to better itself with more ease. Though earthly desires may corrupt the soul when indulged in excess, those who are strong and resolute shall not fall into temptation, for the soul is not slave to the flesh. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 29</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With each meeting, our connection grows stronger. Our Teacher told us the soul-bands help us grow closer to each other, but that in time, we won't need them to be together in spirit. I wish for that day to come soon.</p>
<p>Today, His lesson was the virtues of love. Closeness of spirit begets closeness of body, and closeness of body reinforces closeness of spirit. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY] After today's reflection, with our Teacher's blessing we were together. Brother and Sister ███ wished for our Teacher to join us, but He said we would be together with Him in time, once we truly understood His lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 37</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Teacher spoke to us with his spirit today. It was a miracle, and we all wept at hearing his words in our minds and feeling them in our souls. We feel closer than ever before, and our Teacher says we may keep our soul-bands outside our meetings.</p>
<p>Today, His lesson was humility. [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 45</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's getting harder to write, because words do no justice to what we feel. Our Teacher says we're almost ready, and we know that we are.</p>
<p>Today, His lesson was patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Day 57</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teacher said we were ready today, and we were. He wanted to take us in, but he was afraid of what we had become. He struck down our flesh, but we didn't falter. We had taken his lessons to heart. We showed him the virtues of acceptance and welcomed him.</p>
<p>Today and forever, our lesson is unity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The identity of the character of Teacher has not yet been ascertained. The current working theory is that this person or being is the eighth member of the group, currently in possession of the missing SCP-4037-8. Locating Teacher remains a high-priority task in the course of SCP-4037's study.</p>

<p>For the following experiments, unless otherwise noted, two subjects were connected with SCP-4037. Only one of them (the "subject") was interviewed; the other subject (the "counterpart"), where applicable, was not informed of the nature of the test. To minimise side effects from the two-way connection, the subject is selected from a pool of D-class personnel without a history of violent crime. One experiment was conducted per day and experiment duration was limited to two hours. An abridged list of experiments follows; a full and unedited log is available in Addendum 4037/013.</p>

<p>This experiment was conducted in parallel to scheduled daily testing. Two subjects, D-9183 (male, 32 years) and D-8145 (female, 34 years) were connected with SCP-4037 and moved to a joint quarters under supervision. Subjects were not informed of the nature of the object or the purpose of the experiment. Subjects were instructed to present a written and spoken report of their status every 24 hours; subjects were instructed to write and dictate a report before the experiment began — this was used as baseline. An abridged log of this experiment is provided below; a full and unedited log is available in Addendum 4037/015.</p>

<p>No more changes in subjects' behavior took place after the 72-hour point.</p>
<p>After one week, the experiment was officially terminated. Subjects strongly resisted security personnel attempting to separate them and remove SCP-4037, displaying superior tactical awareness and coordination. Both expressed no desire to hurt Foundation personnel, but maintained that they would not permit the connection to be broken. SCP-4037 was finally removed after sedating the subjects and breaking several bones in their hands and wrists. Objects were returned to storage, and sedated subjects were returned to prior confinement.</p>
<p>Upon regaining consciousness, both subjects went into extreme emotional distress. State of distress continued for several days, after which subjects entered a severe depressive state. Within one week, subjects independently requested termination ahead of schedule (denied). Linguistic analysis of requests showed significant differences in style and phrasing, similar, but not identical, to pre-experimental levels. Within the same week, subjects' schedules and habits desynchronised. Within two weeks, verbal and motor skills fully returned to baseline.</p>
<p>34 days after the conclusion of the experiment, D-9183 committed suicide. Security personnel involved in this incident were subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Subject's decision to commit suicide was ruled to have been caused by a prolonged severe depressive state. Simultaneously with D-9183's expiration, D-8145 lost consciousness for 3 minutes 17 seconds. Once D-8145 regained consciousness, she went into a state of severe emotional distress that lasted for three hours.</p>
<p>Since this incident, D-8145's behavior returned to normal, with the exception of occasional spontaneous awakenings during the night (between 0100 and 0400) accompanied by [REDACTED]. It is currently unclear whether this is a side effect of D-8145's compromised mental state or [REDACTED]. No special confinement protocols outside of existing security are deemed necessary. The subject is to undergo mandatory psychological evaluation every two weeks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Further experiments involving prolonged exposure, as well as experiments involving D-8145, are discontinued pending Ethics Committee approval.</p>

When the entire circumference of the band is overlaid with a line of circles equal in diameter to the depressions, the band fits precisely 628 circles, and the sizes of the intervals between depressions can be expressed in terms of integer numbers of these circles. This pattern and integer sequence, as well as media the pattern has been embedded into for study by independent researchers, are described in detail in Addendum 4037/006.</div>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. This experiment was performed by MTF Theta-90 and Researcher ████ without proper authorisation and in violation of several security precautions associated with SCP-4037 testing. Parties involved were subject to disciplinary action. However, this experiment also served as basis for recommended applications of SCP-4037 within Foundation task forces (see Addendum 4037/022). MTF Theta-90 agents have since requested access to SCP-4037 for use in especially dangerous missions.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. Subjects frequently performed sexual activities over the course of the experiment. Log entries pertaining to these activities have been omitted due to being largely inconsequential.</div>
