<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9230 and SCP-9230-2 are surrounded by a perimeter fence, equipped with six SRAs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and monitored by drones. No personnel are allowed within 100 meters of SCP-9230. In case of unauthorized entry, MTF PSI-8 (The Silencers) is to be dispatched to terminate them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Instances of SCP-9230-2 are to be denied access to SCP-9230.</span> Instances of SCP-9230-2 are not to be interacted with without direct permission from site command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9230 refers to a lake in western Bulgaria. Temporal displacement in the location around the anomaly causes the immediate area to maintain a consistent state of what would constitute midnight anywhere else.</p>
<p>SCP-9230-1 is a humanoid entity inhabiting SCP-9230. SCP-9230-1 appears as a human female, with height of approximately 10 meters, blue skin and red eyes. Unidentified luminescent white matter serves as both hair (approximately 8 meters long) and dress of SCP-9230-1. DNA samples are yet to be acquired. The entity possesses a high level of ontokinetic abilities, potential telepathic capabilities, and above average intellect. Individuals who come into contact with SCP-9230-1 have developed an immunity to amnestics.</p>
<p>SCP-9230-2 refers to any individual residing in close proximity to SCP-9230. SCP-9230-2 instances display an above average lifespan. An unnamed village, inhabited by multiple SCP-9230-2 instances, has been built 200 meters away from SCP-9230. It is yet to be determined when the village emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9230 was discovered on 27.03.2025. Two field agents, embedded within public society, overheard a group of hikers discussing their encounter with SCP-9230-1 and multiple instances of SCP-9230-2. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Subjects were administered Class-A amnestics.</span> Subjects were terminated due to inefficiency of amnestics. A quarantine zone has been set up around SCP-9230, consisting of an on-site containment facility and six SRAs deployed in a hexagon around SCP-9230.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9230-1:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date</strong>: 8.04.2025<br/>
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Dr. Alexander Ivanov<br/>
<strong>Interviewee</strong>: POI-9230-1<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> The following is a transcript of an interview carried out by head of research on SCP-9230, Dr. Alexander Ivanov in the village near SCP-9230. A small platoon of guards was stationed nearby. The interviewee, an SCP-9230-2 instance, has been identified as Magdalena Tatianova, an elder and leader in SCP-9230-2 society</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Good, uh, evening, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Evening, outsider. She warned us of your coming. Her sight does not end in the lake or our home.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> The anomaly's?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Who else do you believe it would be?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> My apologies, ma'am. I am not acquainted with your culture, but I do wish to learn.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Spare me your feigned interest. The only reason you wish to learn is because your masters told you to. Masters that would cage, torture and break us, were we not under her protection.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I cannot speak for what site command and the O5 will do. I only need you to answer some questions and then I'll be gone for good.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Very well, cold faced conqueror. Ask what you will and begone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I reckon given your isolation and circumstance you have developed a rather unique culture. Could you tell me about your people's beliefs and traditions?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> We have many a tale, most told to us by The Lady. She loves to tell us of her past when we are gathered around campfires. I can hardly remember half the stories, but we have written them down. Please wait a minute.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 goes to the village. Several moments later she returns with a heavy book labeled "Tales of The Lady: Of the Primordium, the Abyss and the First Empire of Man".</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Consider it an invitation to learn if you truly wish to.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov turns to a nearby guard and hands him the book to a guard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Have this scanned for any cognitohazards and get the junior staff decompiling its contents.</p>
<p><em>Security guard nods and leaves.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Can you tell me about your traditions? Any holidays? Special occasions?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> For us each day is as special as the rest. We have no formal religion either. The Lady hates being worshipped, despises seeing people think of her as anything more than a friend and guide. That is not to say we don't have traditions. Every full moon the children aged from five to thirteen go to the lake and personally talk with The Lady.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> What do the entity and children talk about?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> The Lady refuses to tell us and the children swear an oath of secrecy before going to talk with her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> You've been a child too and I doubt you're older than your goddess, so you should have done that and know, right?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> And you won't tell me?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> The oath still binds me and you are not dear enough to me to break it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I won't press into personal details. Gonna assume your lifestyle is a lot different. Can you describe it to me?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Not as different as you think, except that we aren't slaves to overlords and get to live longer and healthier than anyone else. We do still toil and work, The Lady says that the greatest joy comes from personally creating new things, but we don't need to. She provides us with what we need and want. The most unusual thing is the place and that we get to visit her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> How long do you live on average?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> I can't say there is an average. We can get ill, but The Lady always heals us. We don't age at all past adulthood. When we are sick of living and want to go live in The Lady's realm proper we just go. It's always a tearful goodbye.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> That's the hardest part isn't it. "If you love someone you're gonna let them go." I've heard that a lot recently, yet I keep thinking "If that somebody loves me, why would she leave me?"</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 gives Dr. Ivanov a surprised look.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Ivanov:</strong> Ah fuck, I am gonna ge- anyways, how did your people come here?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Our ancestors discovered the lake at least many millennia before your people had a kingdom, before any people had a kingdom, yet The Lady is far older still.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Before any kingdom? How has nobody else stumbled upon it?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> None "stumble" upon it. They are drawn here by her grace. If she hadn't permitted your entry, you would have never found this place.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> And you aren't pleased by it, are you?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> I wasn't, but it seems I might have been wrong. How did you come to that conclusion? Who did you say goodbye to?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> It wouldn't be very professional of me to share personal details, ma'am. Let's stick to the topic. How has the entity helped you?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> The way only a true deity can: When plague came upon us, she made it beg for its own end. When we were without food, she grew silver trees with fruit that could fill your stomach for centuries with a single bite. When I was stillborn she took my spirit and gave it a body that could sustain it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> This goddess of yours brought you back from the dead? Why did she make this exception?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> She did not make an exception. That is her greatest gift. We are all given life, even if the world would try to deny it to us. We know joy even as the rest of our home knows calamity and suffering.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov goes silent for a long time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Are you certain this wasn't a dream? Some near death experience?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> As certain as can be, for I have seen it done to others. Not just newborns. Men and women recently fallen to illness, unable to go to her in time, have received new bodies for their souls.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Then could I - No. No that's - ugh. Is there a chance I can see he-it. This goddess of yours?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 gets up and leads Dr. Ivanov into the village, when they are stopped by two security guards. Dr. Ivanov is escorted out of SCP-9230.</em></p>
<p>Note from Director Anesia: Dr. Ivanov is to be placed on temporary leave. Interviews with residents of SCP-9230's village are suspended until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report-9230-1:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 13.04.2025</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Containment site of SCP-9230</p>
<hr/>
<p>Several SCP-9230-2 instances were observed approaching the containment site, carrying what was identified as an unhealthy SCP-9230-2 specimen. Video showed specimens being turned away, but was abruptly cut off. Hume readings showed unprecedented changes in local baseline reality. All traces of containment have disappeared from baseline reality. Security personnel stationed at SCP-9230's containment site have deserted the Foundation. MTF PSI-8 has been dispatched to deal with the deserters.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On 16:04:2025 One of the deserters (now designated POI-9230-2) was captured. Subject scheduled for interview.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 20:04:2025</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site Director Lena Anesia<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> POI-9230-2</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Good morning, Mister Shumaro. I hope the accommodations have not been too unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> To be perfectly honest with you, it's better than I expected. I was ready to be tossed in with the D-class. Lord only knows I rubbed them the wrong way on a few occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Glad to hear it, sir. Can you please tell me what happened at the containment site that made our recently promoted chief of security leave?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> After the site went into the astral plane the thing that lives in the lake came to us. We opened fire, but the bullets didn't even seem to faze it. We were sure these were our last moments, but that thing didn't kill us. It started talking with us. Asking about us.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> What did you tell it?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> We didn't need to tell it a thing, but it wanted to hear us describe ourselves. It knew every fear, every hope and every wish we had. It reminded me of my father and mother. It reminded all of us of what we love the most. It reminded us that we are people and we can choose the cause we fight for.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> You feel like the Foundation isn't a cause worth fighting for? Were it not for us this world would be gone by now.</p>
<p><strong>POI 9230-2:</strong> Not saying we aren't doing good work, but we are going about it the wrong way. What is the point of keeping the things that go bump in the night locked up, if we kill even more people than they do?</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> The only reason they haven't killed more is because they are safely locked up.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> The lesser of two evils is still an evil though. I know changing things this far in is a risk, but nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Pardon my saying so Mister Shumaro, but I find this idea to be incredibly selfish. You realize that such a drastic change is gambling the world itself right? If we are forced to abide the strictly moral choice it could lead to an uncontainable containment breach, not to mention the philosophical questions that would need to be answered before an action.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> Sure you can't always make the right call but we can at least try. Would it really put everything at risk if we don't kill or amnesticize anyone who gets in the way? The world may be safe the way things are, but should we really settle for being killers? Don't you always say our mission is to protect those who can't protect themselves?</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia goes silent and looks around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> That is not up to me to decide. Thank you for cooperating and answering my questions, however. Now I think there's a matter we still need to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> If you have any humanity in you make it quick.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Make what quick?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> We both know you're gonna make me bite the bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> There's a saying: "History isn't what happened. It's what is believed to have happened." The way I see it there are two things that could have happened. One, as you said, you bite the bullet. Two - via some miracle the amnestic worked. You are an amnesiac ex-military and figure out your life from there.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-2 goes silent for half a minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> What's the catch?</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Consider it a favor from a friend.</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia hands POI-9230-2 a syringe and a new ID card. POI-9230-2 hands over his credentials and records of the Foundation</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> Thanks boss.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> I am not your boss any longer.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-2:</strong> Then consider this advice from a friend. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. What's the point of protecting the bodies of thousands if we stain our hearts and minds with the blood of hundreds. There's always a better way, ma'am. Sorry it took me so long to learn it.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Noted. Thank you for your years of service, Mister Shumaro. Consider yourself honorably discharged.</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia salutes. POI-9230-2 salutes back.</em></p>
<p><em>Director Anesia turns off the recording</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note from Director Anesia:</strong> I don't know if this creature really is benevolent, nor does it matter. Its manipulations could compromise the Foundation. The possibility of more desertions is highly likely under the current circumstances and considering the entity's capabilities it would be a needless waste of lives to send people there.<br/>
The anomaly's clearance level will be raised to 4.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum-9230-2:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>The following footage comes from the security camera in Director Anesia's office</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 26:04:2025</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Director Anesia looks up from a document.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Doctor, not only has this been discussed at length, it could be argued you are the reason for the new security measures. Your interview with POI-9230-1 gives me a good reason to suspect you were compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I get that I was less than professional, but if we just shut down any and all research on the anomaly, we're potentially missing out on on game world-changing secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anesia:</strong> And what exactly do you consider these secrets to be worth, Mister Ivanov?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Think what the Foundation could do if it learned how this creature managed to erase the entire site. Not to mention that if it can really heal living organisms from anything this could bring about an age without…terminal illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> I can see the potential here, doctor. I disagree with you that it's worth the risk though. We still don't know even half of it's capabilities. I refuse to simply throw bodies into a meat grinder. While you are here, do me a favor and stop lying. I can tell there's a more personal reason you want to go back there. Speak plainly.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov goes silent and takes a deep breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Fine. I want to know if this…thing can really bring them back.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> There will be no disciplinary action, if you're worried about that, but I am going to be assigning you a psychiatrist and three years of paid leave.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> If four years weren't enough, why do you think three would make a difference? There are wounds time and help just can't heal, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> I am not letting you toss your life away for a fool's hope. There's a reason we don't use anomalies for therapy or medicine. You are vulnerable and being lured into a potential flytrap.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> If this fool's hope kills me so be it. I am not asking you to understand. I don't want you to understand what it's like to lose a loved one, but have a heart and try to understand. Living with your better half gone. That's not a life worth living.</p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> I may not have a family, but don't think I don't know what it's like to lose people you value. I had parents. I have employees. You are asking me to put my head in the bag so you can beg a creature we don't know anything about to do something we can't be sure it can actually do.</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia breaths in deeply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Why do you think I am gone at least one day of the week, Alex?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia points to her cupboards. Every one of them is stacked with photos of her with other people dressed in black in front of a newly dug grave. Dr. Ivanov goes silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Every week it's another. Every time it's worse. Jess was so young, Mihail's twins had their eleventh birthday just a week prior. I refuse to lose any more people than I have to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I'm sorry you endure all of that. I am sorry I might be asking you to bury me. I am sorry I need to ask you this. If you really know what it's like, please, help a grieving man get his closure once and for all.</p>
<p><em>Director Anesia closes her eyes, breathes deeply and stamps Dr. Ivanov's request to continue his work with "approved".</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Anesia:</strong> Not a word of this to anyone. It's an interview for information and nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> It's not the longest walk. I take it you need something from her?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I need some hope and closure</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Everybody needs those things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Think your deity will be cross with me fo-</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> No. Her wrath is only given to the greatest of monsters. I've gotten to know you aren't one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> That's reassuring. I never really got to ask, but what exactly can I expect?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> She is hard to describe. Imagine being in the presence of the world itself. Every river, mountain and star is right there, listening. You think it would be terrifying, but it isn't. There is no need to be something you aren't. You cannot be something you aren't near her. She sees through you: knows your thoughts, your life, your struggles, your sorrows, your joys. Despite this she never judges, only comforts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> What do you want to do in life?</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 turns to Dr. Ivanov, eyebrow raised.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I've gotten to know your goddess and culture better than I know you.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Did you read the book I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Sorry, but no. Been busy begging my boss and people are still testing to see if it's safe.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> I want to see our home restored. I want to see The Lady outside The Lake. I want to walk upon The Moonlit Sea, learn to capture moonlight in gem, see the Abyss King rise from the depths and make the sky purple. I want to see pain go away forever with all the agony our creators gave to us.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 and Dr. Ivanov walk in silence for several minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Why do you need closure if you don't mind?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I lost two things I can't live without.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov pulls out a photo from his coat. He, a woman and a child are at the beach smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> They look wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> They were. My gremlin and my guardian angel. She hated that nickname so much. I pestered her with it for a month after I got out of the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> The hospital?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I was playing with that little imp when she was at work once, knights and bandits. I made the mistake of letting my guard down and that little goblin jammed a plastic sword into my eye. I yelled at him not to call the ambulance. but the little shit was already on the phone and it turned out the paramedics were the least of my worries. He had called his mother.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> I take it you had a very protective guardian angel.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Protective doesn't cut it. She argued with the doctor in the hospital until security kicked her out, then started calling until they blocked all ten of her phone numbers. In the end I pulled some strings so she could come. She and that gremlin were there, eight hours a day, every day of the week, serving me home-cooked food instead of the garbage the doctors had and making sure I was never bored.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 goes silent. Dr. Ivanov sheds several tears.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> Remember when I told you about how we visit the Lady as children and swear a vow of secrecy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> When I visited her, she asked me what I want more than anything. Those were the worst days of my life. My parents had chosen to leave the world a week prior. I told her that I wanted my mother and father back, if for just a little while longer. She took me by the hand and lifted me into the sky. The world grew smaller and smaller. I saw it was but a small island in an endless ocean. Then I saw a group of people sitting and talking in that ocean. She brought me down to them and there were my parents. They hugged me so tightly. I didn't wanna let go "The world needs you, my dear.", said my mother "Our part is done. We need to rest now.", my father chimed in "How can I live without you?" I asked "You are never without them, my child. Would you rather they see you broken and withered from grief as you come back to them, or tired and relieved with stories, memories and lessons to share? Would you rather they shed tears of mourning for a lost daughter, or of joy for a child returned home from a long journey?" said The Lady.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 wipes the tears from her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230-1:</strong> So I will finish the journey, even if I must crawl on my chin to the final stretch.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov and POI-9230-1 reach the edge of SCP-9230.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9230:</strong> Now it's your time to receive a gift.</p>
<p><em>POI-9230-1 walks away. A bright light envelopes the screen and the recording is cut off.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum-9230-4:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>The following is a transcript of an interview of SCP-9230-1, carried out by Dr. Alexander Ivanov.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27.05.2025<br/>
Time: 12:00 am<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr Alexander Ivanov<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-9230-1</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> Greetings, my child. I must say I anticipated your arrival sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Yeah, my superiors were quite concerned after what you did last month and I didn't exactly help myself on that front. You'd be shocked at the amount of paperwork I had to go through after that. Not to mention the lectures! Well, now I'm finally here. Seeing that book people compiled of your stories, I'll assume you enjoy chatting.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> You assume correct, dear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> What exactly are you? Goddess is a bit of a broad term.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> That is up to you to decide, but please refrain from labeling me that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> What's the problem with "goddess", if you don't mind?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> The greatest monsters I have seen coveted it like a jewel. I am no fear mongerer. I do not wish for any gifts. A mother does not take from her own children.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> How old are you? Who are these monsters?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> I cannot answer your first question, my child, for you speak in terms and concepts that do not apply to me. Time started at the dawn of existence, yet I was ancient before it was even a single, dying spark, dancing in the nothingness. I will not answer your second question, for you have already met my enemies. Worms and maggots who believe themselves to be kings, yet cower the moment one greater than them challenges their right to treat their creations as toys. A great pity that some of you still yearn for the love of beings that will never find you worthy of it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> You mean like the Sarkic cults and the Church of the Broken God?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> Indeed. The Broken Goddess, The Great Dragon and all the rest look upon you and see a future where you exist as nothing more than toy solders in needless war. A future me and my husband swore, would never come to pass.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> How do you feel about people worshipping them? Also who is your husband?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> How would you feel about Simion being kidnapped and brainwashed into becoming a solder for the Foundation? What would you do in that case?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov goes silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> …I'd break him out of there with my bare hands. Try my luck with the O5s if I get the chance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> And you are here now to bring him and Maria out of my realm. To take from the one to whom you owe your very soul and life. To claim that which belongs to death herself.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov takes a deep breath and looks straight into SCP-9230-1's eyes without flinching.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> If you really are better than others of your caliber, you will do this for me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9230-1 closes its eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> I would, but I have a question for you first. Did you ever ask yourself what they wanted?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Wha-tha-what do you mean? I risked my hide at every turn to save them. I personally cu-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> I am not denying you tried to save them, but did you ever consider that they didn't want to keep on living?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I-nobody woul-certainly not her. She loved life so much, she wouldn't just- and he-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> If you were in her place, would you want to live? Would you want to stay a prisoner in your own body, always burning with the sensation of your own being turning on itself and being rent open with a scalpel?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> No, but I wouldn't be so selfish as to give up, knowing how much my death would hurt. I'd rather have her ill, but here than gone from my life.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> Truly? Then it brought you less pain seeing her in tears, begging for me than it does knowing she is in peace?! Perhaps she made a mistake devoting herself to such a cruel, egotistical man. Did you ever love her, or did you merely desire her?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I-no. It didn't bring me joy, but I could have healed her! I could have figured something out! I could have-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> You could not have.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9230-1 puts a hand on Dr. Ivanov's shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> Your efforts were beyond commendable, but hear the words of one that gave her own life to bring forth seven new ones. No matter how hard and nobly you fight, there are things you cannot defeat, events you cannot prevent.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I refuse to accept that the only thing I can do is roll over and accept that she is gone.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> Good, because it's not. You are a master of your own faith and mark my words, you will see them again. Much, much sooner than you think.<br/>
<em>A tear falls from Dr. Ivanov's eye.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Thank you. If you don't mind, what caused you to…become like this?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9230-1 laughs, several tears falling from it's face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> A story for another time, my child. Right now I have a task for you. Try to better yourself for your reunion. Maria and Simion would be disappointed to see their husband and father like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Yeah. I guess I need some alone time. Can't believe I claimed to love her, yet effectively tortured her.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> The only unforgivable crime, my child, is one for which forgiveness is not sought.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Thank you. For the advice and…everything.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9230-1:</strong> You are most welcome and do visit me again one day. Or don't. All of you will come back to my embrace one day.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov turns off the recording.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Report-9230-2:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11:06:2025<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Dr. Alexander Ivanov's residence</p>
<p>Anomalous events were captured via Dr. Ivanov's security system. Suspected link to SCP-9230-1.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>11:00pm:</strong> Dr. Ivanov is seen working on his computer. Light fluctuations in Hume level.</p>
<p><strong>11:10pm:</strong> The moon's glow intensifies drastically. Hume levels on rapid descent.</p>
<p><strong>11:15pm:</strong> Mobile task force Lambda-5 dispatched to location.</p>
<p><strong>11:20pm:</strong> Connection with mobile task force Lambda-5 is lost.</p>
<p><strong>11:30pm:</strong> Substance believed to be water starts flowing from the ground outside the house.</p>
<p><strong>11:40pm:</strong> Dr. Ivanov's yard is fully submerged.</p>
<p><strong>11:50pm:</strong> Two humanoid beings emerge from the water. One is noticeably taller and guides the other.</p>
<p><strong>11:52pm:</strong> The taller entity rings the doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>11:53pm:</strong> Dr. Ivanov opens the door.</p>
<p>Dr. Ivanov smiles and embraces Entity-9230-1 and 2, openly crying.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> There you are…I was beginning to think she lied.</p>
<p><em>Entities embrace Dr. Ivanov back, luminescent fluid dripping from their eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-2:</strong> Dad! I missed you!</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> May we come in, dear?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 and 2 enter the house and sit on the couch. Dr. Ivanov brings three cups of chocolate.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> You can still drink as spirits right?</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> You'd think no, but-</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-2:</strong> Hey that's from the really good one! You had promised to get some of it for my birthday before…</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 rubs 2's back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> We are here to spend time with your father, not dwell on long gone unpleasantries.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Sorry, but we do need to talk about that. I owe both of you an apology. I was so focused on saving you, that I didn't even notice how badly I had mutilated both of you.</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-2 looks visibly scared. 1 looks deeply uneasy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> Alex, please. This isn't something I want to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Nor do I, but it's not something that can be put off. I want to tell you that I am sorry. Deeply sorry. I maimed you worse than that illness ever could. I didn't act like a surgeon, I acted like a butcher.</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> I cannot forgive you, Alexander.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov looks down, clearly ashamed. Entity-9230-1 hugs him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> I was never mad at you to begin with. You don't need forgiveness for trying to save us. Please, can we just enjoy our time together?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Of course. Say how has it been like in the afterlife.</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-2:</strong> It's amazing. Everyone is so nice. Even that grumpy old man is nice. He makes candy out of thin air! I asked him to teach me and look.</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-2 creates a short sword, seemingly out of light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-2:</strong> Hey can we play bandits and knights again later?</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> Now, now my dear. Your father's bones could barely keep up with your plastic sword. Let's not drag him back with us. He deserves a few more decades free from our tyranny.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> Yeah, your old man has gotten even older. Tell me though, does your mother have powers of her own.</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 visibly blushes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> No-</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-2:</strong> Yes. You should see her when she grows those long wings. She can fly so fast and looks so-</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> Simion! I told you not to mention it in front of him!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> So you're now my official guardian angel?</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 sighs and smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> I told you to stop calling me that.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ivanov pulls both entities into a tight embrace.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I told you no other words do you justice.</p>
<p><strong>Entity-9230-1:</strong> …Fine, you win. But we are doing it outside. I wanna stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ivanov:</strong> I wouldn't mind my pillow getting some divine feathers on it. Could bring me some good luck and better sleep.</p>
<p><em>Entity-9230-1 laughs and walks outside with -2 and Dr Ivanov. Footage cuts off.</em></p>
<p>Note: MTF Lambda-5 returned an hour later with no memory of transpired events. All anomalous activity in the area ceased at 1:00am.</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Ivanov has not been seen since. The following note was found in his residence:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"If you love someone, you're gonna let them go." At first I hated that saying. It's only now that I understand how true it is. Letting go may be hard, but the alternative is torture the one you claim to love. I made this mistake and was forgiven, though I did not deserve it. To any on a similar road to mine, please: learn to let go. I know how terrifying it is to think that this may be the last you see of one to whom you have devoted your life, but I am here to tell you that it is not so. No separation lasts forever. The ones who would seek to bring such torment upon us are too weak to do so. Take solace in knowing that after the fire comes the water, after baking summer comes peaceful winter, after the brutal day comes the gentle night, after The Scarlet King comes the Moonlit Queen.<br/>
I will see all of you at the Moonlit Sea.<br/>
-Alexander Ivanov.</p>
