<p>Image of SCP-8326 taken by Dr. Mark Kegans</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8326</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8326 is housed in a reinforced containment cell at Site-16, suspended via mechanical supports due to its weight. Weekly monitoring has been discontinued following Event 8326-Ω. Fragments are stored in a Faraday-lined urn within the same cell, which will be relocated to the Anomalous Anthropology Wing.</p>
<p>All ritual items, scrolls, and logs are archived in Wing C. Access to the urn and related research materials requires Level 2 clearance and written approval.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8326 is a partially fossilized woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) skull, 1.52 meters long, bearing carvings created with obsidian tools. The carvings depict prostrating figures, a coiled sun, and inverted trees. Gold leaf and red ochre are present in some recesses. Carbon-dated to be over 12,000 years old, the skull retains its organic density and has not yet undergone full fossilization.</p>
<p>SCP-8326 emits a low-frequency hum (~14 Hz) detectable only by humans, accompanied by psychological effects: reverence, sorrow, disorientation, and dreams of tundras or long migrations. Subjects often report a desire to remain close to the object.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Recovered by MTF Alpha-2 ("Cave Divers") in a shallow cave 60 miles west of Denali. It was wrapped in hide and birch bark, in the possession of a non-verbal elderly man who expired shortly after first contact. No cultural or linguistic matches are found.</p>
<p>Artifacts identify SCP-8326 as a sacred vessel for a migratory deity named <strong>Namarraka</strong>, translated loosely as "He Who Walks Ahead." No corresponding figure exists in known indigenous traditions.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8326.1: The Voice That Diminished</strong></p>
<p>Over four months, SCP-8326 exhibited a progressive reduction in anomalous output. The hum became intermittent, visual and EM anomalies stabilized. Staff began reporting faint whispering in unknown languages, alongside depressive symptoms. A note from Dr. Trevor Berryhill, dated 01/18/2023, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I heard it breathing last night. Not from the bone itself, but from the air in the room. Like something trying to remember how lungs worked. The dreams are gone now. All I feel when I’m near it is the cold. And silence. And pity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A final message was discovered etched inside the skull, beneath the left orbital cavity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was here before your gods were young.<br/>
I carried you through the white void.<br/>
You forgot the sound of my steps,<br/>
and so I stopped walking.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Translation Excerpts from Ritual Scrolls:</strong><br/>
Recovered bark scrolls describe <strong>Namarraka</strong> as a being of endurance and memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He walked before fire. He walked before names. He pulled the sky behind him so the snow would not fall on us.<br/>
<br/>
We forgot him. He did not forget us.<br/>
<br/>
He waited. Even when we left. Even when we stopped saying his name.</p>

<tr>
<td>Day</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 1</td>
<td>Dr. Berryhill notices the low-frequency hum emanating from SCP-8326, which is felt as pressure in the ribs, not an audible sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 9</td>
<td>The hum continues and sometimes harmonizes with the silence. Dr. Berryhill starts sleeping in the containment room, feeling a sense of peace in the presence of SCP-8326, but not the comfort of standing near a fire someone else has left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 17</td>
<td>The hum stops briefly, and the air feels as if it’s holding its breath. When the hum returns, it is far fainter than before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 26</td>
<td>Dr. Berryhill notices that the carvings on the skull are fading. He traces one this morning, something resembling an eye within the antlers, but by nightfall, it is gone, not eroded, just absent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 41</td>
<td>Dr. Berryhill speaks to SCP-8326, saying, “I’m still here.” Afterward, the object remains quiet, not silent, but still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 48</td>
<td>The dreams associated with SCP-8326 are fading. Where there were once visions of mammoths, only cold wind remains. Dr. Berryhill feels as though SCP-8326 is forgetting how to dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day 59</td>
<td>Dr. Berryhill touches the skull and feels the weight of time like a mountain remembering the ocean. He said, “I remember you,” but the hum doesn’t return. The cold lessens, but only for a moment.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Event Log 8326-Ω (Day 72):</strong><br/>
At 03:14 AM, SCP-8326 collapsed into ash and inert bone fragments. No energy release occurred. The chamber temperature dropped by 6°C. Dr. Berryhill was seated two meters from the object at the time, unmoving. When later interviewed, he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think it wanted someone to see it happen. So it wouldn’t happen alone.”</p>
