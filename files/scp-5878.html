<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Assigned personnel are to monitor public broadcasting networks and internet platforms for descriptions identifiable as SCP-5878. Upon discovery, affected individuals are to be transported to Site-28 for questioning.<br/>
Instances of SCP-5878 are to be stored in secure item lockers outfitted with cameras and audio recorders. Any irregularities are to be reported to appropriate personal immediately.</p>
<p>Affected individuals are to be administered amnestics <span style="color: blue">and provided with 2 years of counseling and/or therapy sessions by authorized therapists and psychologists at the discretion of the assigned lead researcher, currently <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dr. Caesar Cantorello</span> Dr. Elise O'Rourke.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5878 refers to multiple objects manifesting near individuals possessing severe psychological or emotional trauma. The specific object displays significant variation between instances, but in all cases, the object exhibits a dark appearance<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.<br/>
In almost all known cases, SCP-5878 manifests as an object identified as a memento which affected individuals confide in. The process by which SCP-5878 manifests is unknown.</p>
<p>Upon physically contacting the affected object, individuals will enter a catatonic state for 2 to 4 hours. Following this, individuals will no longer exhibit a desire for self-mutilation or suicide. Succeeding this event, the affected object will cease any anomalous properties.</p>

<p>On ██/04/2015, Researcher Dr. Elise O'Rourke found an instance of SCP-5878 in her home. The following log contains an interview conducted by Head Researcher Dr. Caesar Cantorello.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Begin Log, ██/04/2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Hello, doctor. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> I'm fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> So, could you please describe the event in question?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Of course. Um, where should I start?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> First of all, could you tell me what happened that could've caused SCP-5878 to spawn?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Right, yeah. Well…</p>
<p>[Short silence]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Doctor, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Yes, I'm.. fine. Well, it began when I was seven or eight years old. Sometime around 1998. Honestly, I've kind of forced myself to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Well, please just tell us what you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> The problem started with my dad. He was diagnosed with some sort of cancer. Don't know what it was exactly since he never told me. But he died when I was like, eight, or something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Then my mom started dating this other guy. I don't really remember him much, but he became my stepdad pretty soon. And both of my parents were perfect matches for each other, in that they were both moody, arrogant pieces of, uh, crap.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> So do you think this impacted your mental health negatively?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Oh, absolutely. Maybe if it was only my mom, it wouldn't have been that bad. At least she actually cared about me slightly, between the times she wouldn't stop rambling on about how she wished she never had me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> And your stepfather?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Oh, he was worse. I really don't know what my mom saw in him. He had a decent job over in a finance firm, so I guess that was it. But he was constantly drinking and came home in terrible moods. And, unlike my mom, he didn't care about me at all. His abuse turned physical for me and my mom.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> I see. Now, your file says that both of your parents were killed in an accident. Could you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>[Short silence]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Yeah, um..</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Doctor, if you find this uncomfortable, I can omit this from the interview log at your request.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> No, no, it's fine. I just gotta get my bearings straight for a second.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p>[Short silence. Sniffling sounds are heard]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Well, I don't actually know what happened exactly. As far as I know, my mom gave my stepdad a call to pick her up from work. I'm not sure why he agreed, since he usually doesn't pick people up. But he went anyway. I think he was under the influence at the time, which explains what happened next.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> And where were you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Violin practice. I only found out what happened to them after nobody came to pick me up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> [Writing] Thank you, doctor. Now, what happened on the night SCP-5878 appeared?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Well, I came home from work, as usual. I wasn't in a great mood, but I had an urge to find my old violin. I really don't know why. I suppose SCP-5878 was influencing me? It was like a nostalgic feeling was sweeping over myself, even though I hadn't played the violin in years.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> So I searched my old cupboard, expecting to find my violin all dusty and un-tuned. But I saw something else instead. It was something in the <em>shape</em> of my violin, but pitch black. It had no colour or light on it, or anything really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> So I'm assuming this was SCP-5878?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Seemed to be. And the thing is, I knew exactly what it was. I was assigned to research it 3 months before. But I just had the urge to come closer. It was like a voice was telling me what to do. And I just sort of… did it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> So then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> I fell into a trance. Well, I <em>think</em> it was a trance. It felt like I was transported into my head, and I was losing control over my body. But it didn't feel unpleasant, really. On the contrary, I felt… unburdened, if that makes sense. Like weight was being lifted from my shoulders. Sorry, does this seem a little ridiculous to you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> Not at all. Please, continue.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Well, uh.. I heard this voice. I don't actually remember what it was like. But it was sorta soothing, like a therapist. It told it all my trauma, more smoothly that I'd ever told it before. And I had no problem with it either. Like, I usually never talk about it, but I just sorta did it in that moment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> And did the voice respond?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> It did. Honestly, I don't know why my memory of the voice is so foggy. The experience just felt so.. surreal. But the voice talked to me. It went on for what felt like years. And I stood there listening to every word. It really was like a therapy session, except much more effective than any therapist I ever went to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> And do you think this event removed any negative thoughts you may have had?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> …negative thoughts? Sorry sir, what do you mean exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> As in, suicidal, or an urge to self-harm, assuming you had those thoughts to begin with.</p>
<p>[Brief silence]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> Yeah.. it did.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> [Writing] Thank you for your help doctor. I have one last thing to ask before I end this interview. Do you still wish to continue researching SCP-5878? Given your first-hand experience, your insight would be valuable. However, if you feel uncomfortable given recent developments, you can leave the team.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. O'Rourke:</strong> I… no, I think I'll stay. At the very least, I know how it feels now. Maybe it'll make conducting the interviews a little easier. If you don't mind me taking charge of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cantorello:</strong> By all means, Doctor. Thank you for your time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's come to the Foundation's attention recently that victims of SCP-5878 have been exhibiting extreme mental instability.<br/>
Almost all current individuals have been diagnosed with some form of manic or chronic depression, as well as other types of mental illnesses such as psychosis or bipolar disorder. The current thesis is that this is a by-product of amnestic use and it impacts their serotonin reuptake, which dramatically impacts their mental health.</p>
<p>I know this is a massive development, both on what we've done regarding the individuals affected by SCP-5878, and what we plan to do in the future. I know many of you have expressed discomfort after learning of these consequences. I have to admit I feel terrible after being briefed myself. If any of you wish to leave this project, feel free to do so. I will personally bid you farewell. However, leaving SCP-5878 unchecked is a massive security risk that puts the Foundation's secrecy into jeopardy. I have proposed a solution, one I know many of you will fell uncomfortable with, but one that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Amnestic use will continue, as will the effects. I will personally ensure that every single affected individual will receive proper counseling and help from trained experts across the world. These people will not be left alone, I will see to that myself.</p>
<p>Harden your hearts, my friends. I know many will disagree with my actions, but this is for the greater good.</p>

<p><strong>Document 5878-M-1:</strong> On 01/02/2017 at approximately 1700 hours, SCP-5878-7 was reported missing from its containment cell. No signs of a break-in were present. Following this event, Special Containment Procedures were updated to include one security guard stationed outside the containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-2:</strong> On 12/03/2017, SCP-5878-5 was reported missing from containment. Security footage shows the entity seemingly disappearing from its position at 1242 hours. In the place of SCP-5878-5, words were embedded into the marble pedestal on which it stood on. The words were comprised of an unknown black substance that absorbed light similarly to the material of SCP-5878.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the Foundation know how it feels to fall from grace? How it feels to have everything taken away?<br/>
How it feels to call for help from the darkest pits of the abyss?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for SCP-5878-5's disappearance is unknown, nor the meaning of the message. Further documentation is to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-3:</strong> 12/04/2017. SCP-5878-1 disappears in a similar fashion. A message of similar construction to that of SCP-5878-5 is found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the monsters, who you believe to be evil, become benevolent; what is your purpose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Ben Ward, the subject who manifested SCP-5878-1, was found deceased in his home due to cardiac arrest. Darryl Brown, subject who manifested SCP-5878-5, was also found deceased in an alleyway due to an overdose of heroin, a month prior to Document 5878-M-3. The relation between these events, if any, is not yet known.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-4:</strong> 15/04/2017. Sri Bin Nilam, the subject who manifested SCP-5878-7, was found deceased in a river near ██████. Reports seem to indicate suicide, although no confirmations have been made. The date of this event is approximately 2 months and 2 weeks before the writing of Document 5878-M-4.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-5:</strong> 18/06/2017, 1636 hours. SCP-5878-8 reported missing, leaving another message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite everything, you are still cold. Cruelty still courses through every single one of you.<br/>
Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carl Flannigan is also found deceased near the bottom of the Cliffs of Moher in an apparent suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-6:</strong> 31/09/2017, 0920 hours. SCP-5878-2 reported missing. Another message is left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is simple. The truth is unfortunate. Not even you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Egor Kuznetsov is reported missing my local authorities. His current status is unknown.</span> A cadaver was found in █████████ matching the description of Egor Kuznetsov. Cause of death seems to be death by overdose of medication.</p>
<p><strong>Document 5878-M-7:</strong> 26/12/2017, 2051 hours. SCP-5878-10 reported missing. Another message is left.</p>

<p>To everyone on the team,</p>
<p>This is a message for the few people who are still with me. Formality isn't my forte, but I suppose I have to get this out there. SCP-5878 is being reclassified as Neutralized. There hasn't been any new instances for over 2 years and the last major event was a few months ago. If you enjoy getting free paychecks, get ready for that to end.</p>
<p>I know most of you have read my interview log, and subsequently all the depressing shit that's been happening these past few years. It <em>really</em> doesn't seem like time's gone by that fast. In a way, I suppose it's a great time to reflect on my mistakes.</p>
<p>When I was first recruited to join the Foundation, I wanted to help people. Looking back, I've done the opposite. Ten people are dead. Ten deaths that could've been prevented. Honestly, there isn't anyone to blame but myself.</p>
<p>I remember conducting almost every interview. It was basically the only thing I was good at. I suppose I enjoyed it, too. Seeing all those people happy for the first time in a while. I knew how it felt, and I liked seeing all the other victims experiencing it too.</p>
<p>Well, I call them "victims" of SCP-5878, but really, it saved them. They're victims of us. We made their lives worse up until the end. And I could've stopped it too, but I didn't.</p>
<p>I spoke with almost all of them. Ben Ward, he was diagnosed with PTSD and chronic depression that SCP-5878 somehow managed to cure. Darryl Brown said that he was going to quit drug abuse. In fact, all of them said that they were going to thoroughly change their lives for the better.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter.</p>
<p>When we administered amnestics, they lost their initiatives. Their mental states got even worse. Maybe it was <em>"for the greater good"</em>, but the moral compass in me says it wasn't. Whatever the entity was that was leaving those messages probably agrees with me. It's also more disappointed in me than all the victims combined.</p>
<p>I could blame Dr. Cantorello for this, but that would just be too easy. He knew what he was doing, but he didn't know what these people were feeling. I did.<br/>
And I didn't stop it.</p>
<p>I've rambled on quite a bit for a document I'm planning to give to other people. I'm just happy to get as far away from all of this as possible. Maybe that's for the best.</p>
<p>Good luck to all of you. Try to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Elise O'Rourke - Head Researcher</p>
