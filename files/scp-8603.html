<p><strong>Archived Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8603 is to be contained via one of thirteen specialized electronic jamming units. Each unit is to be assigned a unique site. Each site may hold no more than one unit for a period of time exceeding no more than two months. Upon arrival, the Department of ███████ is to assign eleven (11) guards to the protection of each unit. Under no circumstances may any unit be opened to confirm its location. Staff may be informed of SCP-8603, and more importantly, its consequences.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The writing is kind of sloppy.

<p>Regardless of the level of encryption or programming language, the terminal of -B will activate and present a prompt: "Extract or Depict."</p>
<p>Upon prompting "Extract," all information aboard -B will be unencrypted, duplicated onto SCP-8603, and re-encrypted. In comparison to its non-anomalous counterparts, SCP-8603 has no storage limit.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Sellable enough for you?</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>At approx 0500 hours local time, two black hawk helicopters make unauthorized landings on helipad B.</p>
<p>Each helicopter was staffed with 13 operatives of Mobile Task Force Alpha-1.</p>
<p>Witnesses confirmed these "operatives" to override containment procedures and seize Unit 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>At 0530 hours both black hawks lift off, moving southeast.</li>
<li>At 0545 hours (1) B-52 Stratofortress takes off bearing north. Records confirm the presence of 20 operatives of Mobile Task Force Omega-1 at the direction of the Ethics Committee.</li>
<li>At 0700 hours both black hawks are intercepted by the B-52 Stratofortress.</li>
<li>Both black hawks are fired upon. Return fire is acknowledged by the O5 Council.</li>
<li>At 0715 hours, (1) black hawk is shot down. Crashes into the ███████ Ocean. No survivors.</li>
<li>At 0725 hours both aircraft are spent. B-52 subsequently rams into surviving black hawk.</li>
<li>At 0730 hours both aircraft crash into the ocean. No survivors.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unit 13 was confirmed to house SCP-8603. Following investigation into the crash site, SCP-8603 was confirmed destroyed.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Can't believe they both fell for it.

<hr/>
<p><em>In the weeks after, considerable tension rose between the O5 Council and Ethics Committee, and a substantial increase in infighting occurred between the two departments.</em></p>
<p><em>In response to Incident 13, the Ethics Committee repeatedly vetoed the containment procedures of several Thaumiel-class anomalies, to the annoyance of the O5 Council.</em></p>
<p><em>The O5 Council perceived these actions as planned aggression. MTF Alpha-1 was deployed to Site-65 and Area-27, facilities a short distance away from Site-37—home of the Ethics Committee.</em></p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following the destruction of SCP-8603, several facilities belonging to prominent groups behind the veil were attacked and sacked, including those of the Foundation. As of now, 53 separate targets belonging to various Groups of Interest were hit over the span of seven months.</p>
<p>No discernible pattern was uncovered; however, attacks against the Foundation were rare and limited. Over the course of the seven months, with an estimated death count of 3,138, only 253 were Foundation-affiliated. It is unknown what caused these attacks; however, through diplomatic chatter and informants, all targets believed the Foundation to be responsible.</p>
<p>Several issues of diplomatic protest were delivered to the Department of Advanced Diplomacy.</p>

<div class="report-body">
<p>Over the course of the last year, due to the efforts of several of our counter-intelligence agencies, multiple autonomous deep‑cover cells and data leaks have been uncovered.</p>
<p>The following discoveries have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery of 17 unique cells belonging to several Groups of Interest</li>
<li>Cell sizes ranged widely, between 17 and 155 members</li>
<li>SCPiNet contained several backdoors across six sites<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">I think it’s better we have the nerds close these. The risks outweigh the benefits here.</span></li>
<li>On average, most double agents held Level 2 access, the highest being Level 4</li>
<li>The Chaos Insurgency held the most cells, numbering 8</li>
<li>The capture of 1,668 agents</li>
</ul>
<p>The loss of SCP‑8603 has been a huge blow to our future operations; however, with the capture of the majority of their agents, the Foundation holds massive leverage. I expect any Group of Interest can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">persuaded</span> to submit to our demands, with the possible exception of the Chaos Insurgency. It is unknown if the Insurgency values their lives enough to get them to agree with us.</p>

<h3 id="toc3"><span>After-Action Report: Operation Black Stone</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Operation Black Stone was a joint operation between Mobile Task Force Titan-1 "Off the Books," the Internal Security Department, and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/petition-for-the-creation-of-mtf-nu-15">Mobile Task Force Nu-15 "Stormtroopers"</a>, conducted between June 13th, 2022, and December 15th, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Operation Black Stone was devised to root out networks of double agents across the Foundation's most suspected hotspots for defection, using a method that would not incriminate the Foundation. These networks were to be lured by a powerful anomaly and intentionally lax security procedures in order to complete objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> Operation Black Stone was concealed from all personnel outside the operation, including the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, to maintain complete operational silence and security.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h5 id="toc4"><span>Roles:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Internal Security Department:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Selected suspected agents to guard Unit(s); greater chance of detecting network</li>
<li>Determined which sites contained Unit(s); maximum chance of data breach</li>
<li>Intercepted all communication geared toward SCP-8603; self-explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: transparent">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Task Force Titan-1 "Off the Books":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collected evidence of Groups of Interest’s attempts on SCP-8603</li>
<li>Intercepted raids when necessary</li>
<li>Covertly captured and tortured double agents when deemed necessary</li>
<li>Collected information on suspected double agents if not captured</li>
<li>Covertly pressured the O5 Council and Ethics Committee</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: transparent">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Task Force Nu-15 "Stormtroopers":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attempted to identify all members of raiding troops</li>
<li>Gathered intel into the lives of suspected double agents and their families</li>
<li>Tailed raiding units to bases of operations</li>
<li>Assassinated all personnel who attempted to gain information on Operation Black Stone (3 dead)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<h5 id="toc5"><span>Objectives:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Primary Objective:</strong> The capture of double agents across the most infested facilities.<br/>
<strong>Secondary Objective:</strong> The discovery of facilities owned/operated by groups of interest.<br/>
<strong>Tertiary Objective:</strong> Establish a network of informants across these groups of interest based upon the information collected from previous objectives.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc6"><span>Execution Layout</span></h4>
<p>Operation Black Stone was separated into three core phases: Initiation, Research, and Execution. Alongside these three phases, Operation Black Stone also contained the sub-operation "Black Granite."</p>
<h5 id="toc7"><span>Phase 1:</span></h5>
<p>The initial effort was to create the illusion of SCP-8603, as well as to establish its viability as a lure for outside actors and a deterrent to Foundation personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2 Summary:</strong> Phase 2 of Operation Black Stone occurred between November 1st 2022 and July 15th.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of Operation Black Stone was a purely intelligence-gathering commitment, with little to no real military action taken. Each department was given a role in this intelligence effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internal Security Department – Combed through all data feeds and intel provided by Titan-1 and Nu-15 to compile a list of all agents. Identified digital vulnerabilities exploited by agents.</li>
<li>MTF Titan-1 – Oversaw covert transport of Units to specified sites, identified physical site vulnerabilities, and manipulated Site security to ensure the destruction of Units. Reported intel to ISD.</li>
<li>MTF Nu-15 – Collected intel, provided by the ISD, on all personnel suspected or confirmed to be agents. Tailed fleeing groups of interest to facilities of operation and provided said intel to the ISD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The identification of 2,126 agents across all 12 sites</li>
<li>The identification of 53 facilities belonging to several groups of interest</li>
<li>The identification of 238 distinct members of several groups of interest</li>
<li>Via data comms, 24 different schematics of various machinery were copied</li>
<li>Via data comms, 54 different internal documents of various groups of interest were obtained</li>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Through the combined efforts of all three parties, a total of 53 concealed locations belonging to various groups of interest have been discovered.<br/>

<strong>Divisions of Engagement:</strong><br/>
The Department of Consolidation, <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ends-and-the-means">a division of the Internal Security Department</a>, has been assigned to missions that require public subterfuge and sabotage.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Titan-1 has been assigned to capture all locations of interest and liquidate personnel present, with the exception of locations belonging to Group of Interest 003 — "The Chaos Insurgency".</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Nu-15 is tasked with all efforts regarding Group of Interest 003 — "The Chaos Insurgency." This includes the capture of facilities, interrogation of stationed operatives, seizure of all on-site information and anomalous objects, liquidation of all personnel after interrogations are complete, and total destruction of the facility upon departure.</p>
<p>Any covert attacks on the Foundation require the consensus of all parties involved and must be limited in scope so as to protect innocent personnel while achieving operational objectives.<br/>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Final Report:</strong> By consensus, Operation Black Stone was wildly successful, overcoming initial projections. The result has been the partial or complete dismantling of external intelligence circles and high-yield facilities of varying groups of interest. Alongside this, the efforts of Operation Black Stone have resulted in key concessions to the Foundation by varying groups of interest.</p>
<p>However, the methods utilized by this operation have raised concerns. As far as the Foundation is concerned, Operation Black Stone was never real. SCP-8603 was a real anomaly, and it was destroyed. The staged attacks were not Foundation-sanctioned, and as far as the world stage is concerned, the Foundation was never involved.</p>
<p>The ethics are debatable, of course. Titan-1 and Nu-15 aren't even officially recognized by the Foundation, and the Internal Security Department always had a long leash. Be that as it may, the concealment of Operation Black Stone from the O5 Council and Ethics Committee, even now, is cause for deep concern. The Foundation has always operated on accountability, each department keeping the others in check, but the actions taken in the last year have disgustingly violated that.</p>
<p>Our actions terribly resemble those of the Chaos Insurgency in 1948. We walk a thin line, one where the slightest push may cause us to tumble into incompetence or insurrection. We cannot brand ourselves as the Foundation's protectors if we act as a fifth column to it. This is the consensus of the Internal Security Department, MTF Titan-1, and MTF Nu-15.</p>
<p>For now, we wait. We watch. We listen. Until we are needed again.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency 001:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All digital information detailing Operation Black Stone are to be deleted except SCP-8603, and <strong>this file</strong>.</li>
<li>Any personnel that attempts to disseminate details of Operation Black Stone are to be liquidated.</li>
