<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Argus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All active instances of SCP-9470 are currently contained and utilized by GoI-06 ("Unusual Incidents Unit")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> in accordance with the terms of Operation Breadwinner. Under the aforementioned terms, GoI-06 is responsible for ensuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>That no usage of SCP-9470 compromises the integrity of the Veil in any way.</li>
<li>That usage of SCP-9470 is always done with the primary purpose of furthering the objectives of Operation Breadwinner.</li>
<li>That utmost care is taken to ensure the Foundation is never identified as the source of SCP-9470 in sub-Veil communities or organizations.</li>
<li>That any enemy agents supplanted with SCP-9470 are furnished to the Foundation for incorporation into D-class stock, unless they are required for further operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents of MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") implanted within GoI-06 are tasked with monitoring the usage of SCP-9470 and reporting any important information, including failures to maintain the above terms, to Assistant Director of Continuity William Meyers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9470 refers to a class of artificially-created humanoid organisms which superficially resemble members of Homo sapiens; instances are indistinguishable from ordinary human subjects in terms of appearance and biology, and can only be recognized as anomalous by [REDACTED: L4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]. Instances of SCP-9470 are imprinted on by a designated human handler during their creation, and will display complete loyalty and obedience to their handler until death. A partially-anomalous cochlear implant also allows their handler to provide instructions covertly from a significant distance. Instances display considerable intelligence and acuity, and are capable of following complex directives or of taking independent action to achieve their provided goals if an unexpected obstacle appears.</p>
<p>If allowed to closely observe and examine a human subject, instances of SCP-9470 are capable of anomalously modifying their appearance and biology to identically match the subject. SCP-9470 instances are also able to mimic the unique personality of human subjects by analyzing their neural activity. This process involves removing the eyes and tongue of the target to gain access to the optic and vagus nerves, and can have various side effects on the subject ranging from temporary memory loss to inducement of a comatose state; as a result, analyzed subjects normally cannot be returned to the public without careful consideration to avoid damaging the Veil. Field testing has consistently shown that provided a disguised member of SCP-9470 is not directed to take unusual action by its handler, observers will be unable to distinguish it from the original subject regardless of depth of interaction or previous familiarity.</p>
<p>Thirty-five instances of SCP-9470 were created via [DATA EXPUNGED: UNANIMOUS VOTE OF O5 COUNCIL 01/04/1993] on D-class stock as part of Operation Breadwinner, a joint campaign between the Department of Continuity and the COINTELPRO<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> division of GoI-06. The goal of the campaign has been to maintain the stability of the American culture, economy, and way of life against subversive influences by providing avenues for GoI-06 to request anomalous assistance from the Foundation. Their current usage of SCP-9470 was approved by Assistant Director of Continuity William Meyers, who was personally responsible for the development of [DATA EXPUNGED: UNANIMOUS VOTE OF O5 COUNCIL 01/04/1993]. GoI-06 has utilized SCP-9470 and other provided anomalies to perform the goals of the COINTELPRO program, including the infiltration, disruption, and dismantlement of radical political factions and militant revolutionary groups acting within the United States.</p>
<p>SCP-9470 has been used to replace subversive agents for a variety of time-frames depending on the requirements of the operation, ranging from a few hours to several months. While so placed, SCP-9470 has been able to diminish the influence of these groups through multiple means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting inter- and intragroup conflict such that enemy agents spend their energy fighting each other rather than the citizenry and stability of America. This can be done by introducing topics of conversation considered generally polarizing, such as abortion rights, or by identifying and pressuring specific ideological differences. Preventing independent groups from forming coalitions around shared goals is also vital due to the increased threat these unions represent, and can often be done by publicly disparaging potential collaborators in interviews or newspaper articles.</li>
<li>Providing opportunities to subject the groups and their ideologies to public ridicule, thereby inhibiting their ability to gain new members and court national credibility. One strategy involves pushing for the group to adopt embarrassing issues onto their platform, such as increasing the social acceptability of urination in public pools. It can also involve supporting any negative stereotypes which had already entered the public opinion, especially those involving stupidity, promiscuity, or violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>By acting to prevent these groups from effectively utilizing their collective power to disrupt the stability of the United States, SCP-9470 has been a vital tool in maintaining Normalcy.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9470-1: Successful Operations</strong><br/>
SCP-9470 has been utilized in multiple successful operations since the beginning of Operation Breadwinner. One post-operation report has been provided for ease of access; for a full list, see document COMP-BDWN68-9470.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1 id="toc3"><span>BDWN68-9470-134</span></h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>One of the targets of COINTELPRO is the radical revolutionary group "Students for a Democratic Society" (SDS). Since its inception, this group has insisted on attempting to subvert the American way of life by promoting sexual deviancy, promiscuous use of drugs, and Marxist ideology. The group has also adamantly called for the defeat of the United States in Vietnam, staging disruptive public protests across the nation. Given the importance of the war in maintaining the interests of the United States and in preventing Communism from gaining a stronghold with which to infect Asia, it has been a top priority of both the Foundation and GoI-06 to silence and dismantle all groups which attempt to sabotage the war effort.</p>
<p>The SDS has also often worked with the "Black Panther Party" (BPP), a militant black-nationalist hate group. The BPP works to spread terror and violence in the communities it inhabits by releasing armed gangs to threaten anyone they deem "racist," including police, White passerby, and local business owners. Despite its violent philosophy, the BPP has enacted many "public service" campaigns to court the favor of impoverished Blacks, including free medical clinics, public ambulance services, and the "Feed the Children" program. The SDS, publicly viewed as a non-violent group primarily composed of educated Whites, has worked to assist the BPP in its attempt to gain a veneer of legitimacy. In addition, the SDS has also served as a platform to spread the BPP's misinformation regarding the prevalence of racial discrimination and police violence, attempting to create systemic distrust with the potential to undermine the basis of American society. This symbiosis creates a significant threat of either or both groups' anti-American rhetoric receiving widespread attention; as a result, it has been a high priority of both the Foundation and GoI-06 to take every opportunity to break apart their coalition.</p>

</div>
<p>As a result of an operation undertaken by the mundane COINTELPRO department of the FBI in 1968, the names and addresses of many members of the SDS were revealed. One of the identified members, Aaron Dumourne, was a highly-effective propagandist who disseminated the ideology of the group to the student body at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dumourne often spoke at public gatherings and demonstrations, and interviews revealed that he was consistently successful in manipulating the opinions of attendees to these events. As a result, the FBI marked him as a target for suppression.</p>

<div class="mobile-exit">✖</div>
</div>
<p>Leveraging paranoia of government infiltration and an acquired diary, COINTELPRO agents were able to create sufficient distrust to remove Aaron from official SDS membership in 1970. Despite this, Aaron continued to independently support the movement financially and socially, and remained a significant influencer of local public opinion of the war despite his diminished position. Due to Aaron's continued insistence on inhibiting the FBI's attempts to subdue the SDS and maintain public support for the war, it was decided to utilize SCP-9470 to remove him.</p>
<p>On 11/03/1970, a warrant for Aaron's arrest was issued under Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> due to his part in a disruptive demonstration in Arizona. A team from GoI-06, posing as members of local law enforcement, stopped Aaron while he was returning to his apartment and informed him that they were to take him into custody. Aaron complied with the agents and entered their vehicle, where he was quickly incapacitated and restrained.</p>
<p>The agents transferred Aaron to a nearby GoI-06 field building, where he was given to the handler of SCP-9470-12. SCP-9470-12 mimicked Aaron's appearance and personality at the direction of its handler before being given to the agents, who lead it to their vehicle and transported it to a county jail. Following the procedure, Aaron was treated for his injuries and transferred to Foundation personnel for incorporation into D-class stock.</p>

<div class="mobile-exit">✖</div>
</div>
<p>A member of a cooperative press agency was willing to record a video interview with SCP-9470-12 while it was incarcerated. During the interview, SCP-9470-12 was instructed to act passive and meek, stuttering often and taking long pauses before speaking. It was also told to answer questions of ideology and policy with grand platitudes, and to act evasive when pressed for specifics. When asked about the group's relationship with other radical operations in the area, SCP-9470-12 responded by making several casually disparaging statements inspired by strategies developed in the Chicago COINTELPRO office, including that "we at the SDS are the brains, while the Black Panthers are our brawn." Overall, the interview provided a large sum of material with which to create a exposing program against the SDS.</p>
<p>The interview was released a week later, with immediate results. Local public opinion of the SDS shifted dramatically, with bystanders ignoring or outright jeering at public demonstrators; even those who opposed the war saw the group as "airheaded blowhards". Informants within the SDS also reported that the program had a powerful demoralizing effect on all members who watched it, and several viewers left the organization entirely out of shame. Many who had originally doubted the veracity of the forged diary Aaron had been expelled for, including several of his closest allies, reconsidered their position and accused him of working for the government by deliberately misrepresenting the movement.</p>
<p>Informants also reported increasing unrest in the relationship between the SDS and the BPP, which led to an extension of the operation. With approval from Assistant Director Meyers, SCP-9470-12 was instructed to self-terminate using a hacksaw blade which was covertly provided to it by an agent embedded within the jail. After it had done so, the investigating police were guided to put suspicion on a group of Black Panthers who were also being held at the jail. Although Aaron had been renounced by most of the SDS, many were still heavily affected when news of his death and the results of the investigation were revealed. The event served to place extreme tension in relationship between the SDS and the BPP, and informants within both groups have reported great success at pushing their respective leadership to take aggressive stances against each other.</p>
<p>Overall, this usage of an SCP-9470:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a persistent annoyance for counterintelligence operations.</li>
<li>Damaged the local credibility of the SDS.</li>
<li>Inflamed the relationship between the SDS and the BPP, hampering the groups in their attempts to threaten the American people and their way of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, this operation is considered a complete success. The Department of Continuity is very pleased with the efforts of the involved agents, and their creativity and acumen are to be regarded as stellar examples for future operations to draw from.</p>

<hr/>
<p>There is another option, but it comes with a catch. I've attached an old version of the document for SCP-9470, since the newer one is missing a lot of detail. There are few important things in there that are out of date:</p>
<p>First, Operation Breadwinner died with the official COINTELPRO program; although nothing incriminating the Foundation was revealed, the Director of Continuity decided the risk for public attention was too great. They still helped the FBI in other ways (I've written an analysis of their teamwork handling the AIP which might interest you), but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>Second, all but one of the SCP-9470 instances seem to have been terminated. I can't get much information about when or how that happened, though. The latest file I can access that mentions them as a group is an offhand reference in a document written in August of 1991, referencing some kind of "internal security" project. The next earliest file is their 1994 containment procedures, which refers to SCP-9470 as a single entity. It's pretty clear there were other containment procedure revisions between those dates, but they're all above either of our clearances.</p>
<p>Last, Meyers is no longer responsible for SCP-9470. He was relieved of duty as Assistant Director of Continuity near the tail end of 1992, with Mary Schultz as his replacement. Since being assigned, Schultz hasn't approved any operations involving SCP-9470 (this is the catch I mentioned); I'm not sure if she shut it down because of personal inclination or due to pressure from above, but you'll likely want to have a good argument prepared if you choose this route.</p>
<p>Good luck,<br/>

<p>Good Afternoon, Dr. Schultz,</p>
<p>I've been looking into a problem I've been assigned and I believe SCP-9470 could be used to help me solve it. I have attached a dossier on <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">GoI-5869</a> (ignore the name, it's postmodernist nonsense). Would you be free to have a discussion sometime next week? It shouldn't take more than an hour.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>
