<p>SCP-7031 prior to containment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7031 is contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. It is to be fed twice a day.</p>
<p>Testing of SCP-7031 is to be conducted with approval from Head Researcher Joseph Statham. SCP-7031 must be administered a dose of Class-A Amnestics following the conclusion of each test to prevent it from becoming uncooperative.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach, security personnel are allowed to use lethal force against SCP-7031 should standard recontainment protocols be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>SCP-7031 must receive psychological counseling sessions once a week by the on-site therapist Carol Hulsey. These sessions are to be conducted on Dr. Hulsey's office.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7031 (formerly identified as Emma Charlton) is a 24-years-old human female of British descent measuring 1.65 Meters in height and weighing 57 Kilograms.</p>
<p>SCP-7031's anomalous property manifests whenever it is fatally injured. Immediately upon neutralization, SCP-7031 will trigger a retrocausal anomaly which nullifies the cause and circumstances leading up to its neutralization.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7031 came to the attention of the Foundation on 12/02/2015 after a video showcasing SCP-7031's anomalous property during a robbery on New York, United States was uploaded on the video sharing website <em>LiveLeak.</em></p>
<p>The video in question was successfully taken down by Foundation personnel one week after it was originally posted and Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers") was dispatched to locate and bring SCP-7031 into Foundation custody.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Joseph Statham.</p>

<hr/>
<p>[Begin Log.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Good day Ms. Charlton. I presume you have been informed of the reason why you're here.</p>
<p><em>PoI-9262 makes a light nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> Y-Yes, well, sorta. Everything the other guys told me about this… 'Foundation' is that it's like the Men in Black and does things with supernatural stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> More or less, but that's besides the point. [Pause.] So, what can you tell me about your anomalous ability Ms. Charlton?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> My… Oh, the uh, the thing. Uh… Not a lot? it just sort of happens, you know. Every time I… Well, die, my vision sort of goes black for a few seconds, and then i'm just back like i just woke up from a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Every time you die?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> Yes, uhm… [Pause.] I fell from the stairs on my house when I was like… Five or so? I don't remember. I had a car accident when I was Fourteen, and some… Jackass shot me in the head last month.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> I… think that's what happened, at least. It was so fast that I didn't realize it at first.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> I see. Could you perhaps elaborate on what you experience whenever it happens?</p>
<p><em>PoI-9262 remains silent for a moment and began to fidget with its hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> It feels almost like falling from a really, just a <em>really</em> tall place and then being forcefully shoved into a locker. [Pause.] It's not comfortable, at all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Hmmm. Does this also occur when you're injured?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> I wish, but… No, only when I die apparently.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Does your family, friends or anyone else know about this?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> No, no. I don't think so at least.</p>
<p><em>There's silence for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Well then, that would be all for today Ms. Charlton, it was a pleasure to-</p>
<p><em>Dr. Statham is interrupted by PoI-9262.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> Hey, wait a minute! You guys, uh… [Pause.] Fuck. Can I… Can you guys send me home? This place is making me feel sick.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> I'm… Afraid that's not possible, Ms. Charlton.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> W-What? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> One of the Foundation's primary missions is the containment of anomalies, of beings like you. We can't just integrate you back into society.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9262:</strong> Huh? T-That's-… You fuckers kidnapped me! I-I was just in my house a-and then y-you all break in a-and-</p>
<p><em>PoI-9262 begins to hyperventilate and show signs of a panic attack. Dr. Statham stands up from the interrogation table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Thank you for your time, Ms. Charlton.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7031.2:</strong> Psychological Counseling Sessions.</p>
<p>Following the previous interview and its refusal to cooperate with Foundation personnel, it was determined that SCP-7031 required psychological screening and evaluation. As such, several sessions were scheduled with the on-site therapist Carol Hulsey to determine SCP-7031's mental state.</p>
<p>Below are transcripts and excerpts of the most relevant sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Good morning Ms. Charlton, it's a pleasure to-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Jesus Christ, finally.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Somebody finally calls me by my actual name and not '7031' like I'm some sort of science experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Right. I understand that it can be frustrating Ms. Charlton but I assure you that my colleagues are just following protocol and not doing it out of malice.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> I don't care, my name is not a fucking number.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Well, you won't have to worry about me calling you by a number then.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hulsey chuckles. SCP-7031 is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> So, why don't you tell me something about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Like?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> You know, likes, dislikes, hobbies, anything you'd like to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> …Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> To get to know you better.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 is silent for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Alright, what the hell is this? First I get kidnapped, then you asshats throw me away in a room with the bare fucking minimum and now you want to 'get to know me'? Like we're fucking friends or something?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hulsey sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Yes, i understand that your situation is-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Oh fuck off, you're not the one being treated like a freak here. You don't know shit.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> You're right, I don't.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Is there anything else you'd like to let out…?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Another time it is then.</p>
<p>[End Log.]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>As I predicted, SCP-7031 demonstrates the same pattern of behavior as most humanoids do during their initial time in containment. I recommend making some modifications to SCP-7031's chamber to make it look less like a prison cell and make its stay more comfortable.</em><br/>

<p>[Begin Log.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Good day Ms. Charlton.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> G'day</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> How are you feeling today? I've heard that yesterday was your first test.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Eh, what can I say? It was just a physical, nothing particularly interesting. Although…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Although?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> I feel like I'm forgetting something, but I don't know exactly what. It's weird.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Hmm. Forgetfulness could be a sign of stress, anxiety or depression, so it's probably related to that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> If you say so.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> So, there's something I have been curious about ever since I was appointed as your personal therapist. I understand that it's a sensitive topic, but, how did you manage to get through your previous experiences with death?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> [Sighs.] What a question, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> You don't have to answer right now if you don't want to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> No, no, It's fine. Should've guessed this conversation was going to happen eventually, so might as well have it now.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Now, I don't remember a lot because, you know, I was a little kid back then, but basically…</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> I used to live in a two story house at the time, and my bedroom was in the second floor. That specific day my parents were outside buying stuff while I was sleeping… and you can probably imagine how this is going to end. [Pause.] So I woke up, don't remember exactly why– maybe i was thirsty, or whatever, and decided to go downstairs. And when I was doing that… I tripped, and fell down, and hit my head a couple of times on the way down.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> And that's it, that's the story of how I died for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> You're… Surprisingly calm about this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yeah, well. It really wasn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> [Tilts her head.] How so?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> I mean, I was confused alright, really confused, but not exactly traumatized or anything like that. My mind just didn't really register what happened at the time, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Hmm, I suppose that makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Fuck no, but I did say i'd do it, didn't I? And besides, I'd finally be able to open up about this without people thinking that i've gone crazy, so that's nice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Okay then. Just take your time, alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Sure thing.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 then sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Here goes nothing. To begin with, this happened in 2005, I was about 14 at the time, and I had a friend named Alice.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> She and I were… Best friends pretty much. We did everything and shared everything ever since we met, we…</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 is silent and scratches its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yeah, I mean– Anyways. One night we were at the birthday party of another friend that ended at around nine pm and her mother came to pick us up.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Now, I don't know if she relaxed or- or whatever given that the streets were so damn empty, but… another car crashed with ours, and you know, it's- it's uhm…</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 let's out an exasperated sigh and looks down.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> Are you-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yes, yes, I'm fine. I just need a moment.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hulsey nods. There's a silence for 11 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> It all happened so fast. Sone lights appeared for less than a second, and then the next thing I see is… You know. [Pause.] All three of us died instantly, but I didn't remain that way.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 then looks back at Dr. Hulsey.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Wish I had.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-7031</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This fragment is an excerpt belonging to a longer session. Please contact Dr. Carol Hulsey or Dr. Joseph Statham to see the full transcript.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> You know doc? I lied.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> About what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> About how many times I died. Truth is, I killed myself once.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> You… Committed suicide?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yes, that's what I said</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> That is a rather heavy subject to just drop like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> It is? [Shrugs.] I guess I've become desensitized to talking about these topics then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hulsey:</strong> … Alright, please go on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Right. So, after the… Accident I became an emotional wreck for a while. I got therapy and medication and whatnot, but it was still hard you know? Specially since no one believed me when I told the part where I died.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Can't say that I blame them. I wouldn't believe me either if I were in their shoes, but you know. One day, I was feeling particularly shit and some intrusive thoughts began to make their way in my head.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Thoughts like "Why did I not stay dead?" And that stuff. I convinced myself that I would die for good if I ended it myself, so I made a noose with a scarf and… Well, that didn't work.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> You know? Standing there like nothing had happened was… the most painful and liberating experience in my entire life. I couldn't die, but I also didn't have to worry about risks or if there was an afterlife or not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> It really, <em>really</em> was a one of a kind moment.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7031.4:</strong> Incident 7031-Alpha.</p>
<p>On 27/05/2015, an incident involving SCP-7031 occurred during testing of the object.</p>
<p>Researcher Turner had submitted a request to Head Researcher Joseph Statham to obtain possession of a MK-II XACTS device under the suspicion that SCP-7031's anomalous ability may be temporal in nature. The request was granted and Researcher Turner was given permission to proceed with the test.</p>
<p>Below is a transcript taken from a security camera of the incident in question.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Good day SCP-7031.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Good day doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Could be worse, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> That's good to hear. Could you describe what happened yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yeah yeah. [Pause.] I walked to the center of the room and put the blindfold on - why do I have to put a blindfold anyways?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> It's part of the protocol, SCP-7031.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Your protocols are fucking weird. Anyways, I began to feel weird after putting the thing on, like something was poking at my head, and it got progressively worse after a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Has this happened before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> Was there anything else out of the ordinary?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7031 remains silent for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> I did have a strong feeling of Deja Vu while walking into the room but I didn't mention it because… Who the fuck doesn't have those?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> But also, I did have the feeling that something was drilling through my brain after waking up, but otherwise… No, that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Statham:</strong> I see. [Pause.] That would be all for today SCP-7031. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7031:</strong> Yeah, its whatever.</p>
