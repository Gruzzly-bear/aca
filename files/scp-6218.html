<p>The Department of Discretion spread a disinformation campaign in 2002 which discouraged space exploration, interest in the cosmos, and faster than light travel. The media and many academic institutions were planted with the idea that the universe is expanding and that humanity is trapped within the Milky Way's local group.</p>
<p>Provisional Site-6218 has been constructed on the surface of SCP-6218. It is currently operational and manned by 18 rotating D-Class personnel from Site-9, who warp in and out with Triple-T<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and maintain the site's machinery. Provisional Site-6218 is to be used for dangerous experiments involving pre-approved anomalies, a list of which is found in Addendum 2.6.2010.</p>
<p>No one, under any circumstance, can stay on its surface for longer than two hours.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #fff">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>SCP-6218 refers to a spherical body outside of the observable universe<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> that contains the full universe.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> It is estimated to be 2,108 billion light-years in diameter. For reference, Earth's solar system is 0.3 light-years in diameter.</p>
<p>The surface consists of black dust, primarily carbon. Its atmosphere is lethal to most humans, consisting of a previously unknown compound designated Y-2108. Despite the size and apparent mass of the surface, it has a disproportionately low amount of gravitational pull. Its force is roughly 0.2g, slightly more than Earth's moon.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #fff">Discovery:</span></strong></p>
<p>SCP-6218 was discovered by the crew of IV-38<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> while flying outside of the observable universe investigating another anomaly. They noticed that there were fewer stars visible on the starboard side of the ship than on the port side. The gradation between the two hemispheres was photographed and recorded in figure 1.</p>
<p>IV-38 traveled into the hemisphere without stars and noticed that light from some of the stars was reflecting off of a single surface, SCP-6218. Attempting to fly around SCP-6218 to gauge its size, they determined from its curvature that they were on the inside of a sphere. They touched down and took samples, resulting in our basic knowledge of its makeup. They left the expedition early because they expressed a feeling of fear while on the surface.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The discovery made by the brave crew of Intergalactic Vessel 38 is both fascinating and disconcerting. We're classifying it as a new SCP, number 6218. I'd bet that it's the biggest one ever.</p>
<p>The entire universe is contained within a massive cave. For once, this anomaly is containing us.</p>
<p>At first, I felt a little disappointed by this discovery. Infinity just sounded more exciting to me. Then I realized something: if it has an end, then it's knowable. Someday, humanity will have charted the entire universe.</p>
<p>I propose that we build a provisional site on SCP-6218. Because of its distance from Earth alone, it could prove an invaluable containment location for dangerous anomalies.</p>

<p>The O5 council approved Director Moriette's proposal with a vote of 9-4, and Provisional Site-6218 was established. The appointed head of the site is Professor Boris Kovalenko.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Update Regarding Prov Site-6218</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Director Moriette, I would like to thank you again for appointing me to this position. It's an honor to be in charge of such an important scientific discovery. But something just happened recently, and I thought you would like to know.</p>
<p>We started construction this morning. One of our crew had a rather alarming encounter with his dead fiancé on the surface of SCP-6218 this afternoon. Before long, another was seen carrying an invisible child, and another claimed that his stalker had followed him to SCP-6218.</p>
<p>These things all turned out to be nothing more than mirages, but they affected everyone working there, on the first day of construction no less. They had only been up there for four hours. This is no cabin fever, I think the surface of SCP-6218 might be hallucinogenic in some way. I'll need an expert in cognitohazards and such to look into this for me. God knows I'm never stepping foot up there after this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'll need more men. The cost for the psych evaluations has already put a sizable dent in our budget. The icing on the cake is that doctor Skye<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> said they were unfit to work.</p>
<p>There was one thing of note that came out of the evaluations, though. Every single one of their hallucinations told them to leave.</p>
<p>Please respond.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Update: Lost progress in construction</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Director Moriette, your two-hour solution for the hallucinations worked like a charm! We had some minor incidents here and there, but they've been ironed out.</p>
<p>However, I'm afraid I have more bad news. There was a series of earthquakes, and it looks like they won't stop any time soon. We figured it would be a one-off incident, so we waited until we thought it stopped the first time, and around four days into construction it happened again.</p>
<p>Looking into it further, we found that these earthquakes occur regularly, every 8 to 10 days. They can last up to 30 hours, but that's not the interesting part. They're passing over the site like a wave, and the wave's origin is from a single direction, I'll call it the east.</p>
<p>We tried building somewhere else, lightyears away from the original location. Wouldn't you know it, more earthquakes. We tried two more times. Same intensity, same interval, different point of origin. Tests showed that the areas were hallucinogenic as well.</p>
<p>We've wasted a lot of the budget already. I think we'll need more funds and more men if you want us to continue. Not only that, the schematics we have now aren't going to cut it. I believe that while the risks of the project may cause psychological pain to some of the builders, this is important for the greater good. Whatever's causing these earthquakes is a force on the scale of all existence.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Update: Experiment's Results</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>I'm fairly confident now that the schematics we're using will work. We should finish up construction sometime around 2010. With that date approaching, I began the first project looking into the cause of SCP-6218's earthquake. I rented a Foundation craft and we tried following one of the earthquakes as it passed the site. We couldn't.</p>
<p>My instinct is to simply say it was too big, but that doesn't do it justice. When everything is rumbling, it looks like nothing is rumbling, if that makes sense. From that vantage point, I could tell that the secret lies underground.</p>
<p>Once we're done building the site, the first big job will be digging a quarry into SCP-6218. I hope you agree.</p>

<p>Director Moriette, we chose a location for the quarry: a crater near the site. The obvious problem with digging into SCP-6218 is going to be the earthquakes. Every level that the miners dig out will be reinforced by metal plates and wooden beams to ensure that the progress lost from every quake is minimal. I will update you as I move forward.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> There was a murder</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Director Moriette, an update. The makeup of SCP-6218's crust is a smattering of minerals typical to many terrestrial planets, and the layering is as expected. The plates are holding up well enough, but the workers are complaining about having to replace the beams every time.</p>
<p>So some background, one of our workers had an accident. He cut open his spacesuit. After the initial panic, we discovered that humans can breathe in the atmosphere of SCP-6218, even though Y-2108 contains little to no oxygen. After that, the workers asked to work without their spacesuits. So I let them, thinking nothing of it.</p>
<p>I think this is what lead to the murder last week. One of my workers, D-27134, hallucinated that D-35090 was a man by the name of Matthew Jeffreys. Jeffreys was D-27134's old roommate, whom D-27134 murdered two years prior, earning him his D-class status.</p>
<p>It wasn't until today that we discovered that Y-2108 is behind these hallucinations. If we had known sooner, I wouldn't have had to lose any workers. But we didn't, so from now on the workers need to wear oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>Thankfully, D-35090 was in the D-class because of a particularly heinous crime, so when you think about it he deserved to die. I'm hazy on the details, but if you tell that to those workers in a tizzy it should calm them down.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Director Moriette, we've dug 2.3 kilometers down now. Today, the miners struck a pit of black sludge. I've attached an image below. The substance appears to be made up of dead organic matter, like tar. We can't be sure that's what it is though.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, we can't dig around it. I think we need someone from the Parabiology department to get up there and give it a look. Hopefully, we can refine it into a fuel source.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Sludge on the surface of SCP-6218</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hello Professor Kovalenkno, my name is Lee Eun-Choi. I'm an expert in the parabiology department.</p>
<p>I had a look at the sludge your crew uncovered. It isn't just any sludge; it's a membrane. This kind of membrane is found in animal cells. The coating of oils on its surface indicates that it's a skin cell. The average skin cell, on a human, is 30 micrometers large. For reference, this is about as thick as a strand of hair.</p>
<p>This 'cell' is the size of a lake. If it behaves like cells on an average organism, then there are presumably trillions upon trillions of these cells, making up some kind of cosmic superbeing.</p>
<p>This particular cell is dead, but that doesn't mean that the superbeing is as a whole. It's common for skin cells on the outermost layer of an animal to be dead. The workers on-site told me about the earthquakes and how they work. I believe that the earthquakes are caused by this being's pulse. The scale fits, and I don't see any other explanation for the ground rumbling like that.</p>
<p>-Lee.</p>

<p>Director Moriette, there's a being underneath SCP-6218. I just received word from the scientist you sent up there.</p>
<p>Let's call this being SCP-6218-B, and change SCP-6218 to SCP-6218-A. If Eun-Choi is right about the earthquakes, then we need to take immediate action. The earthquakes indicate that the being extends all over the surface of SCP-6218-A. We need to understand what it is.</p>
<p>The problem is, again, it's too big. We can't comprehend the being's shape from outside without considerable effort. This is going to sound crazy, but I propose we build a submarine and send a team of specialists in to dive into its cells.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Amber. I got the design ready. Here it is.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> I'm calling it "The Syringe" because of the bit that's sticking out. It pries the membrane open wide enough for us to come and go without any trouble. It'll also need to come attached to cranes so we can drop it into the pit in the quarry.</p>
<p>Since SCP-6218-B is so big we probably won't provoke it. The only problem is that it'll need a crew because long-distance control isn't going to work. Something on SCP-6218-A is messing with the transmission.</p>
<p>I put some memetic shields in the hull to protect against the hallucinations, but since you said it was the air, I don't think that will be a problem because it already had to be airtight.</p>
<p>So yeah she should take the better part of a month to build. I think that's everything. Email me if you have questions.</p>
</div>
<p>Agent Ignatia's design was approved, and its construction was completed on August 22nd, 2018.</p>
<p>Selected for the mission were four agents of MTF Xi-5: Roscoe Williard, Amber Ignatia, Ivy Skye, and Lee Eun-Choi. Each of them took part in a month-long training regimen preparing them for the mission. Their goal was to find a cell's nucleus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> and retrieve any amount of genetic information on SCP-6218-B.</p>
<p>The operation began on August 30th, 2018. The mission is cataloged below in the form of routine progress reports, taped by the mission's lead researcher, agent Lee Eun-Choi.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Alright, so 6218-B's pulse just passed. I think we're ready.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> It's just like the simulations, people. Clear for drop?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Hold on… clear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> Okay, drop 'er in!</p>
<p><em>The Syringe drops from the cranes and into the membrane as directed. This makes a loud slapping noise.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> That was nasty.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Is everyone alright?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> It wasn't that far, we're fine. Positions everyone!</p>
<p><em>Agent Williard begins the Syringe's specialized function of breaking through the cell membrane. The vessel dives into the cytosol.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>Agent Ignatia, the mission's pilot, turns on the lights. The Syringe has no windows, so the crew looks out through a series of monitors connected to cameras on the vessel's exterior.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> What do you see, Amber?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> There's that thing right there, looks like scaffolding, but also a web. I think it's holding the cell up.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> It's rotting pretty bad. Looks like it could collapse any second.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> The cell <em>is</em> dead. I think this might have functioned as a cytoskeleton<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> when it was alive. Alright, what else?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Nothing really. Just the scaffolding. It's gonna make navigation tough, I'll have to slip between the openings, and it's swaying like a drunkard. This may take a while.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Alright, uh… it's not supposed to be this empty. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>The Syringe navigates through the cytoskeleton for a few hours. The cell is mostly hollow save for the cytoskeleton. Irrelevant audio omitted.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Hey, I found something. Come take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> Whoa.</p>
<p><em>The Syringe has made it to the bottom of the cell. It is covered in a pile of corpses in various stages of decomposition.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> It's a big pile of dead fish.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> What the hell are they doing here?</p>
<p><em>Papers shuffle around.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Beats me. They don't look like any fish I've ever seen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> More importantly, what killed them?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Trust me, I'm working on that. It doesn't look like they were eaten, at least. Whatever it was, I was very wrong about this thing. We should be careful going forward.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Alright, so we have a fish out there. I still feel weird calling them fish, but it's floating. I can't tell if it's alive, but we haven't seen one floating yet. It looks like an invertebrate. There's this big sac thing coming out of its torso. It's full of some sort of liquid, and its mouth has that liquid flowing out of it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> It has too many eyes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Yeah. Lots of eyes. Alright, other updates… Why are the fish dead? My current hypothesis is that since we're still in the epidermis,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> the death of these fish probably coincided with the apoptosis<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> of the cell as a whole. Then, they must have sunk to the bottom over time because of gravity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> They're part of the cell?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> They've been in every cell so far. They don't look like organelles, but that's what they must be.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Alright, so we broke into a living cell, and it's fascinating! There's a whole ecosystem down here. This must be the dermis.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Looks so different in motion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Wish we could see farther than five feet in front of us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> That's submarine expeditions for you. Never as exciting as you think they're gonna-</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Guys, look look look!</p>
<p><em>A small aquatic creature swims outside the Syringe. It pokes at the light below Camera Starboard-4 with a prehensile appendage, keeping pace with the Syringe.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Aw. Lee, what's that thing do?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> I don't know. It's really intelligent, whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> You sure? I think it just likes the headlight.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. For an animal, especially an invertebrate, this thing's pretty smart. Object permanence, curiosity…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> It's just an organelle, isn't it? Why would it need intelligence like that?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> I've been working on a hypothesis for a while now, um… many living things have symbiotic relationships with bacteria. See, mitochondria<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> are believed to be older bacteria, that made their way into the bigger cells billions of years ago. Animal cells kept the mitochondria inside them as they reproduced, so now we can't live without them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> So it's a mitochondria?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> No, I think I've been looking at it wrong, trying to compare it to something from Earth, something that's our size. These cells could be more complex lifeforms than we thought.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> So this little guy inside the cell could be made of cells himself?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Who knows, maybe the gods aren't so different after all.</p>
<p><em>The creature darts away.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> There he goes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Jesus!</p>
<p><em>A large serpentine creature nearly collides with the Syringe. The sound of crashing metal is heard as agent Ignatia maneuvers the vessel away to avoid contact.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> What the fuck is that?!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Is everyone alright?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> I could barely see it coming.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> Look at that thing! It's <em>huge!</em></p>
<p><em>The Syringe navigates away from the creature. The creature continues on its path through the cytoskeleton.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> I don't think it saw us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Did anyone get a good look at it?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> I couldn't see all of it, but it looked like an eel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> At least it's gone.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> I think so. There's just nothing, as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p><em>They travel further into the nucleus. The whispers get progressively louder.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> I'm sorry, does anyone else hear that? Sounds like a bunch of gibberish.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Yeah, I hear it too. Is someone whispering?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> I'm not crazy at least. It's coming from outside the hull, all around us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> That can't be right. The headlights would be shining off something.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Maybe something's busted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> I checked every nook and cranny. The ship should be fine.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Are those…?</p>
<p><em>The Syringe's headlights land on a group of humanoid figures clinging together. They are buoyantly suspended in the cytosol, nude. Their mouths are in a perpetual state of motion, in sync with the whispers.</em></p>
<p><em>Each agent's count of these humanoids varies, but all of them reported 30-70 visible. They form a tight, spherical mass. Despite the constant motion of the humanoids, the mass remains fixed in its location.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Oh my god, those are people!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> They can’t be, can they? There’s no way they can breathe out there.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> What are they saying? I can’t make it out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Look at those eyes. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. We should get away from–</p>
<p><em>The humanoids outside The Syringe simultaneously stop whispering and turn to face the crew, specifically agent Eun-Choi.

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> W-what the hell?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> Fuck! Who the hell are you? Am I hallucinating?!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Shit! I see him too! That makes no sense though, is this a mass hallucination?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Wait, Jackson?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Fun's over, time to leave.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> What the- Oh my god!</p>
<p><em>The humanoids swim in the cytosol toward the Syringe. They place their hands on the hull and begin whispering again. These whispers are now known to directly manipulate SCP-6218-Autumn, but in the moment, the agents panic.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> What do we do?!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> They've got us surrounded!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> What about this guy?!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Forget him, let's just get out of here!</p>
<p><em>Eun-Choi switches off the tape as the humanoids begin to scratch at the hull. After that, agent Ignatia rams the Syringe against them. They do not resist, letting go as the Syringe moves.

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> What, think I'm gonna vanish on you? That'd be stupid. I'd never do that to you.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Ain't it obvious? I'm all in your head. A bad trip, if you will.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Then why did I hear your voice when I played the tapes back?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> You listen to the tapes? You were there.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Answer the question.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Tell me anyway. I'm curious.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Curious. You always did look gift horses in their mouth, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> I take it you're not gonna tell me.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Who died and made you king? No one, that's who. So here's my question; why are you playing the detective again? You don't belong beside these people. They're brave. They're smart. What are you?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> I don't know what I expected out of this. You were never gonna give me anything, were you?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Come on, Lee. This ain't you. What happens when you get home, huh? Are you going back to your desk job? Why pretend to be someone you aren't? Let's just hit the v, like old times.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> We are the Serpent.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> Finally. So what does this "Serpent" want?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> We’re everywhere, inside and out. We’ve been wrapped around this sphere for an eternity. And we will be long after your kind breathes its last.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Keeping you in? You think we're concerned about keeping you in? No, we're keeping <em>it</em> out. This sphere holds something sacred, something that's dying out. It isn't the same out there, if we let a single drop of it into the sphere, then all of this will have been for nothing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Eun-Choi:</span></strong> And what is this rare thing you're so worried about?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">6218-Autumn:</span></strong> Life! Life! Don't you see yourselves for what you are? You're so small, so naïve, so fleeting, lacking unity and lacking purpose, yet still brimming with indescribable feelings. You're a miracle, and you're trying to fuck it all up. Why?

<p><em>Agent Eun-Choi rushes at SCP-6218-Autumn. His fellow agents attempt to intervene, but before any contact is made the Syringe lurches, knocking the crew to the floor. SCP-6218-Autumn laughs.</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> I think the hardest part about the pulse reaching us was that we were so close to the surface. I'd just caught the first hint of daylight when the current started to hit us. Cytosol doesn't work like water, you know, it's more like molasses. But the current was as strong as any ocean shift.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> Still can't get over the dead fish.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Right, right. The current was taking those dead fish from the bottom of the cell and flinging them at the hull. Next thing I knew, the current was pulling us along with them. It made us slam into that scaffolding, I think it was called a cytoskeleton.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> Yeah, the whole cell was caving in around us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> Not that you could tell, it was dark as always. I had no time to react to the rubble. It's a wonder the whole thing is still airtight after all that. That never really made sense to me, because we shouldn't have made it out of there. I shouldn't have even been able to pilot the Syringe against that fucking current.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Kovalenko:</span></strong> Hm. That explains the state of the ship. Now, the monster that was chasing you. Tell us what you know about that.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> I think that guy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-21" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-21')">21</a></sup> called it the blood, because that's what it was. Blood. I didn't get the best look at it, to be honest. I was just focused on getting us out of there as fast as possible. Whatever it was, it called out to me. I had to fight the urge to turn back because I knew if I did we'd all get swallowed up by it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> I think it was trying to say it was sorry. For what, I don't know. I couldn't think straight, you know how it is in the field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> I think it was more than that. I can't remember what it looked like at all. Every time I try my mind just wants to turn somewhere else. I start feeling cold for some reason. It must have done something to our heads.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Kovalenko:</span></strong> And where do you think it went?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Skye:</span></strong> I don't- hang on, why <em>did</em> it stop chasing us?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Kovalenko:</span></strong> Bite marks? I didn't see any of those. I checked thoroughly. Could you be thinking of something else?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Williard:</span></strong> No. It got us. Most of it was a blur, but I know that sound. That was teeth on metal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Kovalenko:</span></strong> I don’t know what to tell you. The ship was ruined, but there was nothing like that. Do you think it’s connected to what happened to Lee?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #c5c5c5">Ignatia:</span></strong> I don't know anyone named Lee. Not at the Foundation, at least.</p>

<p>Through further questioning, it became apparent that Xi-5's memories of agent Lee Eun-Choi, as well as the collective memories of anyone who knew him, had been erased. None of them had been amnesticized. The only evidence that Eun-Choi existed is the physical documentation of his work (tapes, emails, notes).</p>
<p>The O5 council met on September 11th to discuss what was to be done about SCP-6218-B. Instead of continuing research into SCP-6218, a plan was made which complied more closely with SCP-6218-B's demands. Provisional Site-6218 is still to be maintained, but knowledge of SCP-6218-B is restricted to clearance level 4.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. The observable universe is not the entire universe, only as far as the laws of physics allow light to travel before it can no longer reach Earth.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>.

Short for Intergalactic Vessel 38. All Foundation issue intergalactic vessels come equipped with Anomalous Object <span style="filter:blur(4px);">Ex Altiora</span>. This anomaly stops time around an object so long as it is not biological matter. This acts as instantaneous travel between points A and B, no matter how far apart those points are in space. This anomaly, along with complex AICs, was how the Foundation advanced so far ahead of the non-anomalous world.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. Agent Ivy Skye, the Psychiatrist on Site-9.</div>

The cytosol is the liquid substance that suspends a cell's organelles. Organelles are to a cell what organs are to the human body: mechanisms that help the whole run as it's supposed to.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-10"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-10')">10</a>. The Cytoskeleton is the physical structure of a cell. The 'scaffolding' Ignatia pointed out is a series of intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments function as bones do in the skeleton of a vertebrate.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-11"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-11')">11</a>.

SCP-6218-Autumn refers to a manifestation of one of agent Eun-Choi’s hallucinations. It took the form of one Jackson Autumn, Eun-Choi’s former neighbor.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-19"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-19')">19</a>. This is about incident 9.5C.1984. In short, it was the supernatural disappearance of Jackson Autumn from the Prince's Estate Apartment complex. Of the many witnesses, all but agent Eun-Choi chose to be amnesticized. Eun-Choi instead opted to join the Foundation as a researcher. Currently, this incident is unexplained. SCP-6218-Autumn's knowledge of it is also a mystery.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-20"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-20')">20</a>. SCP-6218-Autumn sung this. It's in reference to THE SNAKE, a song by Lana Lubany which would not be released until 2022.</div>
