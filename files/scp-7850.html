<p>SCP-7850-B</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7850 is kept within a low-maintenance enclosure fitted with hidden cameras for the purpose of observing the object. Civilians are to be directed away from the enclosure as per standard procedure.</p>
<p>Local civilian equipment previously capable of receiving SCP-7850's transmissions have been adjusted properly under the guise of FCC regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7850 is a slightly damaged Sharp Color TV Model originally discovered in the Coconino National Forest, Arizona. Humans within a 10 meter radius of SCP-7850 experience a mental compulsion to avoid harming or manipulating the object, with the intensity of the compulsion growing the closer they are to the object. Non-humans seem to be immune to this compulsion, with animals of the <em>Felidae</em> family appearing to be inversely affected by it.</p>
<p>Periodically, an adult house cat, designated SCP-7850-B, will manifest nearby SCP-7850. When aware of humans physically observing it, SCP-7850-B displays no unusual behavior and interacts with others amicably. When SCP-7850-B believes that it is unobserved, it will proceed to SCP-7850 and vocalize loudly, causing the object's screen to open as if it were a door.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Researchers have been unable to recreate this, even with trained domestic House Cats</span> SCP-7850-B will then enter the object and lay down, causing the screen to close. SCP-7850-B will typically remain inside for 4-8 hours before exiting it and demanifesting. While they are inside, SCP-7850 will broadcast up to 7 messages encoded in binary. If at any point SCP-7850-B becomes aware of it being observed during this process, it will immediately demanifest and broadcasts will cease.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> During an otherwise non-anomalous meteor shower, Arizona residents living near the Coconino Forest reported a small unidentified object crashing within the forest; the Foundation was made aware of this after a resident filmed themself holding SCP-7850-B and commenting on the anomalous compulsion created by SCP-7850.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7850.1:</strong> SCP-7850 Broadcast Archive</p>
<p>Notable SCP-7850 broadcasts are filed below. Line separations denote that the broadcasts occurred on a different manifestation of SCP-7850-B.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> After this transmission, SCP-7850-B has been seen carrying wires or other miscellaneous items in its mouth, before taking them into SCP-7850.
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>ONCE AGAIN THIS IS CAPTAIN BUDDY, I HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS REALM WHILE NICE IS FILLED WITH IMBECILES AND HEATHENS WHO WONT HELP A POOR VESSELLESS CAT. I HOPE THE APEKIN OF THIS REALM SMITE DOWN YOU INSOLENTILES WITH HIGH POWER LIQUID SPRAYERS.</p>

I BROUGHT BOTH IN CASE BUT THERES NO MANUAL HERE.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Presumably refers to the two cartons of milk SCP-7850-B had brought onto SCP-7850 prior to this transmission, one of which was chocolate flavored.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>GOD DAMNIT. MAY THE FILTH CURSE YOU ALL. I USED THE WRONG ONE AND NOW I HAVE TO GET MORE. I HATE THIS REALM.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 7850.2:</strong> Incident 7850 ALPHA</p>
<p>During an observed SCP-7850-B and SCP-7850 interaction, a coyote wandered into viewing range of its enclosure. Before personnel could remove the animal, SCP-7850-B exited the object and upon noticing the coyote, hissed and immediately retreated back into SCP-7850. SCP-7850 then transmitted the following messages:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I WAS WRONG I SEE NOW THAT THE FILTH HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD UPON THIS REALM AND BLIGHT THE HIGHER FELINES OF IT.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>UNTOLD HELLS SCOURGE THESE LANDS, I MUST EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
</div>
<p>Afterward, SCP-7850 made a loud, violent mechanical noise before beginning to lift upward. The object began radiating an immense amount of Gamma Radiation as cameras recorded a metallic aperture protruding from the bottom of it. SCP-7850 then launched upward at approximately 25km/s, entering the atmosphere in 11 seconds before it demanifested.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Last known image taken of SCP-7850</p>

</div>
<p>Moments before demanifesting SCP-7850 broadcasted the following message:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>MAY YOUR WOES BE MANY, AND YOUR DOG DAYS FEW.</p>
</div>
<p>No further activity nor sightings connected to SCP-7850 have been reported since this incident. Anomaly is pending reclassification.</p>
