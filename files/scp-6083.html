            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6083</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All direct contact with SCP-6083 is handled by and at the discretion of its current handler, Senior Researcher Jones. SCP-6083 is currently held in a modified humanoid containment chamber fitted with several amenities at the request of Senior Researcher Jones.</p>
<p>In the event that Senior Researcher Jones dies or is otherwise rendered incapable of performing her role in the containment of SCP-6083, a replacement researcher is to be assigned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6083 is a nine year old human child, James Brown, born on 01/11/2016. Its body is heavily scarred, most noticeably around the face and its left eye, which has been fully blinded due to a slashing wound. SCP-6083 demonstrates abnormally high emotional intelligence and is able to accurately read the emotions of those in its direct proximity when those emotions are directed at SCP-6083 itself.</p>
<p>Due to a set of currently unknown factors, some individuals gradually lose their ability to perceive SCP-6083. This process is known to cause subjects to experience mild to severe headaches. This anomalous effect is currently thought to be triggered based on a set of unknown conditions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Once an individual becomes fully unable to perceive SCP-6083, they will forget all details of its existence. Reintroducing the fact of SCP-6083's existence to effected individuals momentarily allows them to acknowledge it, but has failed to restore any sensory ability to detect SCP-6083. SCP-6083 is unable to manipulate this process at will. Amnestic and mnestic treatments have proved ineffective at reversing or slowing this process.</p>

<p><strong>Jones:</strong> So 6083-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> 6083? Is that my new name?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Oh, my apologies. Would you prefer if I used your normal name, James?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Yes please. 6083 just sounds weird.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Yes I suppose it does. Doesn't it?</p>
<p><em>Jones appears to drift off in thought, as SCP-6083 stares intently at her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Miss, your necklace.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 points at the amethyst pendant Jones is wearing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> It's really pretty.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Thank you very much. I made it myself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Wow! You must be really famous if you can make something this cool!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> No, I'm not. Really. I'm nothing special.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> That's not true. You're the first person who talked to me since I came here. That makes you really special.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I suppose you're not wrong about that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Oh. And-and-and you don't feel sorry for me or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Is that so special?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> (<em>nods</em>) It's really rare that people don't just look at me and feel bad. You're really special, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I see. Well thank you for thinking so highly of me. (<em>pauses</em>) About people feeling bad when they see you. Does that upset you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> I don't like when everyone around me gets sad. I think that no one should feel sad when they look at me, otherwise no one can be happy and play with me.</p>
<p><em>Jones smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, I'm afraid I can't play with you James, but I can promise I won't be any sadder when you're around. Ok?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Okay, Miss. I promise I'll be good so that I don't make everyone sad.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> (<em>mutters</em>) Oh, if only it were that easy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Sorry. It's nothing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> You're weird, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) Yeah. I get that a lot.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Will more people come play with me soon?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Probably not too soon, but I'll come back to talk to you tomorrow and ask you a few questions. Ok?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Can we play just a little bit after we talk? I know you said we couldn't, but come on. Just a little bit. Please?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, maybe if you're good.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Ok!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Then, I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Jones</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-6083</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was conducted as a follow-up to SCP-6083's first interview on 14/05/2024. Given SCP-6083's generally positive mental state during the first interview, Senior Researcher Jones was permitted to begin questioning it about its anomalous properties.</p>

<p><strong>…</strong></p>
<p><em>Jones walks into SCP-6083's cell and sits down next to it. It is playing with the plastic cutlery that was provided with it's most recent meal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Hello again James.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Hi Miss.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 mimics the sound of an aeroplane whilst waving around it's cutlery.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I see you've found a way to have fun already.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Look. It's an aeroplane!</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 continues to play with it's cutlery. Jones waits for a few minutes before clearing her throat to attract SCP-6083's attention.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> James I did come all this way to talk to you. Would you mind landing the aircraft a second so we can have a chat?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 lowers the cutlery and briefly slides it along the ground before leaving it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Okay, Miss. I'm all done now. What did you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I wanted to ask you a bit about how you got here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Umm… The people at the orphanage started ignoring me for some reason, so I started to get in some trouble. The police had a big argument with the adults and then the men in suits came and took me here.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I see. Do you have any idea why the other people started ignoring you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> I think it might have been because of the family I scared away. They seemed really nice, but they were really awkward around me. I think they got a little scared of my face.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I can't blame them. Just look at that devilish smile!</p>
<p><em>Jones pinches SCP-6083's cheeks as they both laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> <em>Jones, please refrain from unnecessary contact and small talk with the anomaly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Alright. Alright. You could at least let me and the kid have <em>some</em> fun.</p>
<p><em>Jones briefly glares at the camera in SCP-6083's cell before resuming conversation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, you heard the man. I guess we gotta do this the boring way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> No fair! I thought we were gonna get to play!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I'm really sorry James. I'll definitely make it up to you. How about this? I'm sure this room is a bit boring for you. How about I help you redecorate? I can bring a toy or two with me next time too. So, could you please forgive me this one time?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> (<em>pouting</em>) Mmmm… Ok, I guess. I wanted to play now, but if it's not your fault I can't be mad at you. But next time promise you can play with me!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Ok. I pro-</p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> <em>Don't make promises you can't keep Jones.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Oh, come on! You can't just let me play with the kid for a while?</p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> <em>Sorry, it's not my call. The higher-ups have been really cracking down on us whenever we don't follow standard procedure what with the incident at Site-11 last month.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Does that mean I won't get to play with you, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> No way! Don't worry about that wet blanket. I can deal with him later.</p>
<p><em>Some background noise is picked up through the PA System.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> So we'll get to play soon?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> 100%.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Great. I'm gonna make sure you stick to that.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Don't worry about that. Just start thinking of ideas for what you wanna do when we play together next time. Should I bring Monopoly? Hmmm… I'll think of something good. Unless you know what you want to play?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> It's fine then. I'll think of something. In any case, was it everyone who ignored you? Or just a couple people who were mad at you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> The only person who didn't ignore me was Thomas. He used to hit me, but when everyone started ignoring me he got worried. I think they let him in on it after that though, because he started doing it too.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I see. So was that around the time the police got involved?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> (<em>nods</em>) The police came I think a day after Thomas got in on the prank.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Ok. That's all good then. I think I'm beginning to understand what happened.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Does that mean I'll be going back to the orphanage soon?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> No, I don't think so. It's not good for people to be playing such a mean prank on you. I think you'll be staying here for a while James.</p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> <em>Jones, the Site Director says they want to see you in their office, now.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Really? Oh for- Alright, James I think that means we'll have to finish here for today, but I'll definitely keep my promise to you. Don't worry. Next time, I swear we'll get to play together.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 seems upset, but remains quiet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Awww… Come on, now. Don't give me that look. I even swore I'd play with you next time. Ok, look. Pinky promise.</p>
<p><em>Jones kneels down to face SCP-6083 and extends out her pinky finger. SCP-6083 does the same and the two lock pinkies before moving their hands up and down, as in a handshake.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Cross my heart. Hope to die.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Now if you don't keep your promise you have to stick a needle in your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I guess I had better keep that promise then, huh?</p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> <em>Jones, the Site Director is waiting on you. Terminate this interview at once.</em></p>
<p><em>Jones walks to the door of SCP-6083's cell and briefly turns around to wave at it before leaving.</em></p>

<p><strong>End Log.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> For her breach of conduct during this interview with SCP-6083, Senior Researcher Jones was initially issued a formal warning and was put under probation for three months. However, at the recommendation of the Site psychiatrist, who observed that SCP-6083's mental state was improving as a result of Jones' actions, her punishment was withdrawn and she was permitted to continue her friendly advances towards it.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 6083-3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Jones</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-6083</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was conducted shortly after SCP-6083's cell was refurbished at the request of Senior Researcher Jones.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Begin Log.</strong></p>
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
<p><em>Jones enters SCP-6083's room holding a wrapped present. She sits down next to SCP-6083, which is playing with a model car given to it by Jones during a previous interview. She fidgets momentarily, before clearing her throat to attract SCP-6083's attention.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Oh. Hi again, Miss. You're early today.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, I thought I should bring you something to celebrate the redecoration. This room feels much more <em>you,</em> now. Doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Yeah I didn't like the old room. It was so boring I felt like I was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, you don't need to worry now. I'll make sure you don't get bored and can have all the fun you want!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Can I see what you got me?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Of course. Here.</p>
<p><em>Jones hands SCP-6083 the present and it quickly tears open the wrapping paper. Inside the paper is a jewellery box containing a handmade topaz pendant, matching the amethyst pendant Jones is wearing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> It's a pendant just like yours! But why is the stone different?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> That's your birthstone, topaz. This one is mine, amethyst. So we have matching pendants of our birthstones. I thought I'd use your birthstone instead of just using amethyst, since that's why I used amethyst for mine in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Thank you so much! I'll treasure it forever and ever!</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 takes the pendant out of the box and hands it to Jones.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Put it on me! Put it on me!</p>
<p><em>Jones takes the pendant and hooks it around SCP-6083's neck.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> How does it look?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> It just might look better on you than it does on me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 hugs Jones. Guards situated outside of SCP-6083's chambers began moving to intervene before Jones signalled them to stand down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> So, James, do you want to talk like we normally do? Or would you rather we do something else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Talk! I like talking to you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 lets go of Jones and sits down on the floor of the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> So, what do you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Hmmm… We've already talked a lot about me. Tell me about you.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, there's not much to talk about. I'm not very interesting compared to you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> I'm sure that's not true, Miss. Just tell me a story about you. Please?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, let's see… I could tell you about how I got this job. That's probably the most interesting thing I can-</p>
<p><em>Jones stops as the lights cut out due to a power failure. The cell door slams shut and locks itself. The recording of the interview also briefly cuts out before the backup power starts. Jones is holding SCP-6083 when the recording restarts.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> What happened? Why did the lights go out?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Something bad happened somewhere else in the building. We'll have to stay put here for a bit.</p>
<p><em>Jones signals the guards outside the cell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> You guys need to get out of here to stay safe. We'll be fine in here. Go help with the re-containment effort.</p>
<p><em>The guards nod and leave the area.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Sorry about this. We'll probably be stuck like this for a while, but we should be fine just staying put.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> So, does that mean we can keep on talking?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Sure. That'd be a way to pass the time at least.</p>
<p><strong>PA System:</strong> ALERT: A containment breach has occurred in the Keter-wing. All containment cells have been locked until the Site is secured. Please evacuate to a safe location as dispatched Mobile Task Forces work to re-contain the escaped anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> What does "keter" mean?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> It's what we call a containment class. Basically if something is very difficult to keep from escaping, it's "keter".</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Is it dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Is a keter dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> A lot of them are. Definitely most of the ones on this site are.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 shows signs of becoming distressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Then why did the guards leave if it's dangerous? What if we get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> It's fine James. This is actually about the safest place we could be. We're in a secure containment cell and we're on the opposite side of the site to the breach. I promise you we'll be fine.</p>
<p><em>Distant gunfire can be heard. SCP-6083 is now visibly distressed and starts trembling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> It's ok, James. It's ok. Everything's fine. We'll be alright. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> (<em>quietly</em>) Miss, I'm scared.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> You poor thing. I'll protect you. Don't worry. Just trust me. Ok?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 nods and hugs Jones tighter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> There, there. You're gonna be alright.</p>
<p><em>Jones pats SCP-6083's head and holds it closely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> You want me to tell you that story then? It might take your mind off the scary stuff.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6083 nods.</em></p>
<p>[CONVERSATION REDACTED FOR INFORMATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES]</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> So that's about it. (<em>pauses</em>) Sorry. Now that I've said it all aloud, that story isn't actually very fun. I guess my life just isn't quite as interesting as yours.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> That's not true Miss. Your story was really cool! Especially when the people you work for showed up. That was really exciting!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Yeah, that's something you can never fault us for, I guess. The Foundation always keep things interesting, one way or another. (<em>pauses</em>) Say, do you want to play a game now? I think it'll still be a while before anyone else gets here, so we've probably got some more time to kill.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Ok. What can we play?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, we have a couple games here that we've played before,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> but there's also some new stuff too.</p>
<p><em>Jones looks through a small pile of board games stacked in the corner of SCP-6083's room for a short period, before picking out a game. She pauses and looks down for around half a minute, before turning towards SCP-6083.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Want to play Pictionary?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Sure!</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Do you know how to play this one?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> We draw pictures and try to guess what the other person is drawing. I'm not very good at drawing though…</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> That's where the fun comes from! At least give it a shot, James.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The two go on to talk and play Pictionary for just over 40 minutes before Jones stops mid sentence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Miss? What's wrong?</p>
<p><em>Jones appears not to notice SCP-6083's question. And begins rubbing her head apparently in pain.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Ughh… What was I doing again? Why did I take out this game?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6083:</strong> Miss? Are you ok? What's going on?</p>
<p><em>Jones recoils for a moment, seemingly surprised at SCP-6083's presence. After a moment, she regains her composure and smiles at SCP-6083.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Sorry James, I just zoned out for a second. Don't worry about that.</p>
<p><em>The two resume their game for another 14 minutes before members of MTF-Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") arrive at the cell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nu-7 Operative:</strong> We've got a researcher locked in with an anomaly here! Someone get this door open now!</p>
<p><em>Nu-7 members force open the door before moving inside and separating Jones and SCP-6083. Once separated from Jones, SCP-6083 begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Wait! What are you doing? Stop! You're scaring the kid!</p>
<p><strong>Nu-7 Operative:</strong> Keep away from the anomaly. We'll subdue it momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> (<em>struggling against the Nu-7 operatives</em>) Stand down you morons! He's not dangerous! I-</p>
<p><em>Jones starts to clutch her head in her hands. She starts shaking and looks visibly distressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Just stand down. Please…</p>
<p><em>The Nu-7 operators restraining SCP-6083 release it and it immediately runs to Jones, who hugs it tightly against her chest.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6083-1</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the events documented in Interview Log 6083-3, Senior Researcher Jones fell victim to SCP-6083's anomalous effect and has been rendered unable to fulfil her role as SCP-6083's overseeing researcher.</p>
<p>A replacement researcher will be assigned shortly.</p>
