<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As there is no feasible way of containing SCP-8412 available to the Foundation at this time, current efforts are to be made to minimize the impact of SCP-8412 occurrences on the subject’s surrounding community. Foundation web crawlers Iota-09 (STRAWMAN) and Omicron-06 (SHARPSHOOTER) are to filter online databases for any potential occurrences of SCP-8412 and flag them as suspicious. All flagged occurrences are to be investigated by embedded Foundation assets in the area.</p>
<p>If determined to be a genuine occurrence, it is to be reported as a non-anomalous disappearance to local law enforcement, suggesting foul play involved. Upon the remanifestation of the subject, their body is to be quickly recovered and cremated. Current research into SCP-8412 is to be focused on the following in decreasing order of priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining the method with which SCP-8412 selects subjects.</li>
<li>Predicting future targets of SCP-8412 (if possible).</li>
<li>Determining the spatial/dimensional location of SCP-8412-1.</li>
<li>Physically accessing SCP-8412-1 independently of SCP-8412.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Determining if voluntary exit from SCP-8412-1 is possible.</span> See <strong>Addendum SCP-8412-4</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8412 is a phenomenon wherein at any given time, one human subject will be instantaneously transported to an extradimensional location of unknown origin, hereafter referred to as SCP-8412-1. The human subject is transported with any articles of clothing that they were wearing at the time of transportation, along with any items that they were carrying at the time.</p>
<p>Although subjects are seemingly transported at random, when observing the population of prior victims of SCP-8412 occurrences, noticeable trends are observed which implicate a higher susceptibility to SCP-8412 occurrences in several demographics. A partial list of trends and extrapolated risk factors are compiled below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The age range of the vast majority of SCP-8412 victims is 18-45 years of age<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Within this age range however, there does not appear to be a trend towards any particular age cohort.</li>
<li>Instances of SCP-8412 seem to exclusively target the “core anglospheric” countries, with emphasis placed on the United States and the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>In regards to the racial/ethnic/sexual/gender demographics of SCP-8412 victims, all cohorts have been found to be relatively equal with a 20% chance with a +/- 5% margin of error for any given individual belonging to a specific racial/ethnic/sexual/gender demographic. This specific aggregation of victims has been determined to be pseudorandom when compared to the demographics of the populations from which SCP-8412 selects.</li>
</ul>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A sample of SCP-8412-1 victims' Eysenck Test scores.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>A majority (77%) of SCP-8412 victims have had an outspoken<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> political leaning. Within that cohort, fewer than 20% have fallen within 50 points out of 120 within the center of the Foundation’s Eysenck test<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, suggesting a proclivity towards particularly uncompromising/radical individuals.</li>
<li>1% of SCP-8412 victims have had any formal experience in a debate forum, socratic dialogue, moot court, or any other type of moderated discussion forum.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-8412-1 resembles an interior room with the dimensions of approximately 6m x 12m x 4m. All surfaces of SCP-8412-1 are white and presumably devoid of any identifying features. No light source can be determined within SCP-8412-1, with luminosity remaining at a constant 12 candela in all directions. Within the space of SCP-8412-1, there exist ten standard metal folding chairs of the same make and model and one table. Eight of these folding chairs are arranged surrounding and facing the center of the room, with the table present at the center. The remaining two chairs are seated at the table, facing each other, aligning with the north and south<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> of SCP-8412-1.</p>
<p>SCP-8412-2 are a series of humanoid entities that presumably reside within SCP-8412-1. All instances of SCP-8412-2 are completely covered in what appears to be grey artifacts of clothing, which includes a hoodie, pants, socks, shoes, gloves, and mesh mask. Each instance of SCP-8412-2 in regards to outwards anatomy and behavior seem to be for all intents and purposes identical to that of baseline humans.</p>
<p>When a subject is transported to SCP-8412-1, they will spontaneously appear seated at the north chair with eight instances of SCP-8412-2 each seated at one of the eight chairs surrounding them. Within a period of ten seconds of a human subject’s manifestation, one instance of SCP-8412-2 will approach the south table and declare their apparent name, and their stance on a particular topic, occasionally including their rationale for holding that stance. They will then begin to engage the human subject in an impromptu debate regarding the aforementioned topic, which the human subject will invariably disagree with<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. The nature of the debate will vary depending on the SCP-8412-2 instance, with recorded debates ranging from relatively calm and civil engagements to openly hostile and contemptuous, on the part of both the human subject or SCP-8412-2 instance.</p>
<p>These debates do not appear to have an upwards time limit, however none so far have been recorded to last more than ten minutes. At certain points within a debate, the remaining instances of SCP-8412-2 observing it will proceed to display instances of the color red in various ways, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having their clothing instantaneously change to the color red.</li>
<li>Vomiting an unidentified red liquid.</li>
<li>Spontaneously bursting into red flames.</li>
<li>Glowing red.</li>
<li>Emitting red confetti from the surface of their clothing.</li>
<li>Producing and eating what appears to be a red apple.</li>
<li>Producing and waving a red flag.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a majority of SCP-8412-2 instances display the color red, the current SCP-8412-2 instance engaged in debate will cease and return to their previous seating, whereupon another instance of SCP-8412-2 will approach the south chair and sit, repeating the prior activities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The cycle of debate and replacement will occur in SCP-8412-1 until the human subject expires. Given the lack of food or water within SCP-8412-1, this invariably occurs in less than 3 days. Upon expiration, the human subject will demanifest from SCP-8412-1 to their location directly prior to their initial transportation to SCP-8412-1.</span> See <strong>Addendum-8412-4</strong>.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8412 only occur after the previous subject has <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">expired</span> demanifested. The period between manifestations, excluding the time a subject spends in SCP-8412-1, ranges from three weeks to one month. SCP-8412-2 instances do not seem to remain constant between SCP-8412 events, with each instance adopting a wholly new and unique identity upon commencing a debate with a new human subject.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown the method in which SCP-8412 transports subjects to SCP-8412-1.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-8412-1: History:</strong> SCP-8412 is first believed to have been discovered on 7/22/2016 by Foundation webcrawler Sigma-03 (DOOMSCROLLER)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> after it flagged several disappearances in the Los Angeles metropolitan area as being likely anomalous in nature. As Foundation personnel did not have access to SCP-8412-1 at this time, the true nature of SCP-8412 was not able to be ascertained. Due to this lack of information, SCP-8412 was initially filed under the Foundation’s <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-extranormal-events" target="_blank">Log of Extranormal Events.</a></p>
<p>However, on 2/7/2021, during routine exploration of SCP-████, D-15420 became the subject of an SCP-8412 occurrence, instantly disappearing alongside his equipped standard-issue audiovisual exploration recorder and embedded tracking chip. Upon manifestation in SCP-8412-1, his tracking chip was rendered inert, however, his issued audiovisual recorder was still functioning, and thus site command was able to remain in contact with D-15420 and gather information on SCP-8412-1 and SCP-8412-2. The transcript from the subsequent recording is as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Bergusson:</strong> You getting this, Andrei?</p>
<p><strong>Popovich:</strong> Already on it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> So, I understand that your stance on Groundhog day is, unfortunately, positive. I would like to know exactly why you would support such an atrocious so-called tradition.</p>

</div>
<p>Following the loss of contact, D-15420 was observed to have walked back to the center table to further engage the SCP-8412-2 instance. Upon re-examination of the recording by Foundation interpreters, it was determined that D-15420 proceeded to re-engage the SCP-8412-2 instance in debate regarding if Groundhog Day should be observed in the United States. The debate quickly assumed a political lens, whereupon D-15420 got extremely agitated and went to stand up. While presumably attempting to illustrate a point, D-15420 slipped and fell, hitting his head on the table and expiring immediately, whereupon video feedback with the audiovisual device was lost until the next occurrence of SCP-8412-2. SCP-8412 was promptly given a SCP designation.</p>
<p>Upon review of Exploration Log 8412-01 by the Ethics Committee following an inquest by Site-19’s RAISA’s department, Dr. Kylar Bergusson was issued a citation for general unprofessional conduct. He was mandated to attend a month of psychiatric counseling with a concentration in anger management and attend no less than three Foundation teambuilding seminars.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-8412-2:</strong> Partial Log of SCP-8412 Occurrences: Following the initial discovery of SCP-8412-1, the Foundation was able to gain more of an insight to the nature of SCP-8412 through the embedded audiovisual device on the north wall. Unfortunately, due to the proximity of the north wall from the center of SCP-8412, the audio receiver was unable to gather coherent input. However, in the vast majority of cases, Foundation interpreters were able to reconstruct the content of debates had within SCP-8412 through usage of lip interpretation and artificial intelligence construct CHERRYPICKER.aic in the case of SCP-8412-2 with 98% certainty.</p>
<p>Since the initial discovery of SCP-8412-1, approximately 97 SCP-8412 occurrences have been observed and recorded by the Foundation. On 7/22/2023, the audiovisual device’s battery died, and the Foundation has been unable to establish contact with SCP-8412-1 since.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> That’s absolutely not what I said in the slightest. All I am saying is that in society they do face a degree of otherization when it comes to-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>Hernandez:</strong> No, you did say that! You literally stated that lactose intolerant people were “segregated-”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> First of all, I didn’t even say that, I said that certain establishments segregate menu items designated for lactose intolerant people, second of all, segregation doesn’t mean literal apartheid, all it means is that-</p>
<p><strong>Hernandez:</strong> When is anything having to do with lactose intolerance at all segregated from-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> When items designed for them are purposefully priced higher than their dairy counterparts, for example, Starbucks was recently faced with a lawsuit for this exact-</p>
<p><strong>Hernandez:</strong> Yeah, but that doesn’t mean that they’re intentionally-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Yeah, it kinda does? An executive didn’t just trip and fall one day-</p>
<p><strong>Hernandez:</strong> That’s not what I’m saying. All I’m saying is that-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Then what else could you possibly mean-</p>
<p><strong>Hernandez:</strong> I mean that other reasons exist besides purposefully trying to alienate lactose intolerant people to make those menu adjustments-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Do you believe in women’s rights?</p>
<p><strong>Hernandez:</strong> What.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> What I wanted to establish with you is some common ground so we can come to an understanding better than you had with Adrian, is that alright with you?</p>
<p><strong>Clark:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p><strong>Clark:</strong> I am.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Oh, perfect then. So you can agree that when Jesus tells us things like to turn the other cheek and love thy neighbor, he’s telling us to not harm each other, right?</p>
<p><strong>Clark:</strong> Define harm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Well, I’d define harm as bringing unnecessary suffering-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>Clark:</strong> Define suffering.</p>

<p>❦ <strong>Clark:</strong> What do you mean by being put in state of pain-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> I can’t help but feel like you’re arguing in extremely bad faith-</p>

Senior Researcher Issac Johnston (Foundation)<br/>
One SCP-8412-2 instance<br/>
<strong>—————————————————————————————————————————</strong><br/>
<strong>Topic of Discussion:</strong> The utility of the Foundation’s Anomaly Classification System.<br/>
<strong>—————————————————————————————————————————</strong></p>
<p>[BEGIN EXCERPT]</p>
<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> All I am saying in regards to the ACS is that I believe that it is currently the most comprehensive and approachable method of categorizing anomalies in the modern era. I-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> And that’s what you believe, yes, but the truth of the matter could not be further from what you described. If you look at the literature comparing information and security breaches from 1993 to now, you’ll see-</p>
<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> Even if I were to accept your proposition that there have been more breaches in the later years of the Foundation than in the early days, which I don’t concede, by the way there are more than enough variables that you’re not accounting for-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> I’m aware of that angle of the argument, and I’m saying that the literature that you refuse to read accounts-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>Johnston:</strong> You’re not accounting for the scope of operations the Foundation has compared to 1993, the fact the vast majority of breaches are simple misplacements of safe class anomalies which get categorized the same as the far more hazardous-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> I know of those arguments and I am saying in the literature, that again, you refuse to read which has been peer reviewed by multiple experts in the containment specialist field biannually since 2000, accounts for those variables and even if you omit those instances, the number of breaches which suspiciously align with usage of the ACS-</p>
<p>❦ <strong>Johnston:</strong> I haven’t read the literature because I don’t have it, and you’ve conveniently failed to provide the names of the people involved in its writing and review.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Sorry I don’t memorize the full names of all the authors and contributors of every single paper I read? I-</p>
<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> Well, I’m more than capable of properly citing my own evidence, Maria Jones, RAISA Director in <em>The Organizational Merits of the Widespread Adoption of the Anomaly Classification System on SCP Artifacts-</em></p>
<p>❦ <strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> Wow, an article that starts with “<em>The Organizational Merits of</em>” I wonder if this could in any way be biased. Even if we ignore the statistical data showing the consequences of its use, we can circle back to the initial fact that the nomenclature is simply absurd, and-</p>
<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> I’m not accepting your position that my article is biased, but I still haven't seen your article even substantiated or echoed by other professionals in the field-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8412-2:</strong> If you’re gonna keep doubting my sources instead of actually addressing the point, then fine. Here.</p>
<p><em>[The SCP-8412-2 instance produces a sheaf of papers from what appears to be underneath its chair and places them on the table. Johnston appears to skim through the papers.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Researcher Issac Johnston expired and demanifested from SCP-8412-1 on 4/4/2024. When recovering his body, Foundation agents found 3 pages of what seemed to be an official Foundation report in line with the description given by the SCP-8412-2 instance from the prior excerpt. Upon examination of the pages, most of the information contained within them was found to be true, albeit highly classified. It is unknown how this information was able to enter SCP-8412-1.</p>
<p>Foundation employees aware of the existence of SCP-8412 are henceforth highly discouraged from indulging SCP-8412-2 instances if the topic of discussion pertains to the Foundation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8412-3: Incident Report 8412-4-22:</strong> On 4/1/2022, Junior Researcher Gary Pulotti was transported to SCP-8412-1, whereupon he proceeded to engage SCP-8412-2 instances in a debate regarding systemic racism in the field of psychology. At first, Pulotti seemingly engaged with the topic in a cordial manner consistent with his knowledge on the topic, however at approximately 00:10:09, Pulotti began refusing to engage with the topic or rationale presented by the various SCP-8412-2 instances, with his subsequent responses consisting of the phrases “no”, “nuh-uh”, “didn’t happen”, “huge if true”, and variants thereof. This visibly agitated the SCP-8412-2 instances which eventually stopped engaging with Pulotti altogether. Five minutes after all instances of SCP-8412-2 ceased engagement, Pulotti violently exploded, which caused him to instantly expire. His remains demanifested from SCP-8412-1 in expected manner.</p>
<p>Upon re-examination of footage of Incident Report 8412-4-22, through analysis of Pulotti’s breathing patterns and body language, it was determined that Pulotti was being facetious in his negative responses.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8412-4: Incident Report 8412-7-23:</strong> On 1/7/2023, Researcher Brett Caravan was transported to SCP-8412-1, whereupon he engaged in a mostly cordial debate with the present SCP-8412-2 instances. At approximately 01:23:57, the following excerpt was recorded:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Caravan:</strong> You know what, I will have to concede that point. I haven’t thought about it that way before.</p>
</div>
<p>The SCP-8412-2 instance which Caravan was debating at the time proceeded to offer Caravan a handshake. He accepted and was then instantly demanifested from SCP-8412-1, and reappeared in the atrium of Site-19 where he was initially transported. At the time of writing, Researcher Brett Caravan is the only living individual to have been able to exit SCP-8412-1.</p>
