            <h1>SCP-1809</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1809</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1809-A is to be housed within a containment cell furnished suitably as a living area. Item requests are to be reviewed prior to approval or denial. The cell is to be monitored, and all regurgitations and/or excretions are to be analysed prior to disposal or storage. SCP-1809-A is to be fed twice daily as per Protocol SF-01. Microscopic analysis is to be conducted within a separate area in which individual instances of SCP-1809-1 may be observed and/or extracted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1809 is a collective of sapient microscopic organisms inhabiting cytoplasms within most permanent and quiescent cell types within a human male, ████ █████████ (referred to as SCP-1809-A). SCP-1809 is a former arborist with no professional links to cellular biology, cellular experimentation or other possible origin for SCP-1809's effect; SCP-1809-A claims to have been entirely oblivious to SCP-1809 inhabitants prior to discovery. SCP-1809 was discovered following SCP-1809-A's apparently unrelated skin cancer resulting in a cellular defect, to which a specialist private cancer treatment facility was referred, healing the impairment; SCP-1809 was discovered during a follow-up microscopic analysis of the affected area, in which the surrounding unaffected cells exhibited anomalies later identified as instances of SCP-1809-1.</p>
<p>SCP-1809-1, the individual microscopic inhabitants of SCP-1809-A, resemble exoskeletal crustaceans. Instances of SCP-1809-1 emit intermittent pulsations of light from within an interior source; extensive observation reveals SCP-1809-1 to be constantly communicating via morse code. Topics of conversation primarily consist of the wellbeing of SCP-1809-A (referred to as "Him" or "He" between SCP-1809-1) and "quality of life" between individual instances (see Addendum). Despite this, language analysis has proven difficult due to extensive time taken to emit light pulsations.</p>
<p>When a cell is selected, SCP-1809-1 will attempt to penetrate the cell membrane, invariably allowing for a safe opening to within, in such a manner so as to prevent lysis. Once inside, SCP-1809-1 will attempt to rearrange all internal subcellular organelles such as nuclei, without physically harming the cell interior. Following this, SCP-1809-1 will remain in a dormant and immobile state unless physically interacted with. Instances of SCP-1809-1 are asexual and do not appear to require sustenance. Further analysis of SCP-1809-1's behavioural patterns is yet to be conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1809-01:</strong> Morse translation of a conversation between two (2) instances of SCP-1809-1 inspecting a neuron.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]ow is he?<br/>
He's fine. No illnesses as far as I can tell. What d'you think? Is this one to your liking?<br/>
Very much so. In fact, this is among the best.<br/>
Indeed. And of course, such a fine view of the nervous system from the axon terminals is irresistible, is it not?<br/>
I love it.<br/>
What's your verdict?<br/>
I'll take it. I can't resist those dendrites.<br/>
Sir, you have yourself a deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> One (1) instance of SCP-1809-1 included within the above conversation remained within the neuron for three (3) days prior to the appearance of five (5) larger instances of SCP-1809-1, all of which appeared to physically enforce the removal of the first instance from the cell.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1809-02:</strong> ██/██/████ - SCP-1809-A excreted and regurgitated several scraps of a paper-like substance composed primarily of thinned and dyed muscle tissue. The initial origin and method by which the muscle tissue was altered and transported in such a manner is unknown. Visible on the substance was clear text; individual scraps are included below:</p>
