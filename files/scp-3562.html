<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Edgewood High School <span style="background-color:yellow;">is to be indefinitely closed</span> to the public under the pretense of the presence of asbestos. All SCP-3562-1 instances <span style="background-color:yellow;">are to be separately held</span> in standard containment lockers at Site-82. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Access to SCP-3562-1 instances <span style="background-color:yellow;">may be requested</span> by all personnel working at Site-82 of Level-3 clearance and above.</span> SCP-3562-1 instances <span style="background-color:yellow;">are not to be viewed</span> under any circumstances. Site-82 and the surrounding area <span style="background-color:yellow;">is to be monitored</span> by armed security personnel.<br/>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3562 is an anomalous phenomenon which first manifested within Edgewood Public High School in ███████████, Virginia on <span style="background-color:yellow;">09/04/2017</span> <span style="color: #e00221">September 4, 2017</span>. All written and typed documents present within the school following this date <span style="background-color:yellow;">have been infected by SCP-3562</span> <span style="color: #e00221">passive voice</span>. Infected documents, designated SCP-3562-1, retain their anomalous properties when removed from school grounds, <span style="background-color:yellow;">but the infection has not been observed to spread beyond documents brought within the school</span> <span style="color: #e00221">outdated information</span>. SCP-3562-1 instances are characterized by the spontaneous yellow highlighting of certain words and phrases, as well as the appearance of red text. This text usually consists of critiques regarding the infected document’s grammar, word choice, and sentence structure, as well as the use of rhetorical devices and MLA formatting<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Depending on how well the infected document meets these criteria, a numerical grade between 0% and 100% will appear on the document, as well as a letter grade between A and F. If a document receives a numerical grade of 59% or lower, the phrase <span style="background-color:yellow;">“SEE ME AFTER CLASS!”</span> <span style="color: #e00221">Add citation after quote</span> will be present adjacent to the grade.</p>
<p>If an individual views an instance of SCP-3562-1 with a grade of 59% or lower, said individual will undergo a temporary spatial displacement the next time they pass through a doorway or other architectural opening, entering an extradimensional location hereafter designated SCP-3562-2. <span style="color: #e00221">Too short! Paragraphs need a minimum of five sentences.</span></p>
<p>Little information has been accumulated regarding the events that transpire within SCP-3562-2, as <span style="background-color:yellow;">recording equipment consistently fails within 30 seconds of displacement</span> <span style="color: #e00221">No electronics in class!</span>, and all subjects return from SCP-3562-2 with no memory of what occurred. What is known is that SCP-3562-2 resembles a high school classroom, with no windows or other doorways present, and that it is inhabited by a single humanoid entity, hereafter designated SCP-3562-3. SCP-3562-3 appears to be a female between 1.5 and 1.8 meters in height. However, exact details of SCP-3562-3’s physical appearance are <span style="background-color:yellow;">unknown</span> <span style="color: #e00221">none of your business</span>, as images captured prior to equipment failure are always heavily distorted.</p>
<p>Subjects return from SCP-3562-2 approximately one hour after displacement <span style="color: #e00221">if they behave</span>. Returning subjects, hereafter designated SCP-3562-4, possess numerous physical alterations within their frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, resulting in extensive modifications to their cognitive processes. The most notable of these changes include:<br/>
<span style="color: #e00221">Don't use bullet points!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eidetic knowledge of several classic literary works, including <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, <em>Moby Dick</em>, <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, and the complete works of William Shakespeare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A notable increase in reading comprehension skills on both a pragmatic and semantic level. This includes both the ability to understand the literal context of a narrative work and the ability to interpret symbolic and allegorical meanings through the semiotic connotations of certain words and phrases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A notable increase in average reading speed. SCP-3562-4 instances can read approximately <span style="background-color:yellow;">900</span> <span style="color: #e00221">nine hundred</span> words per minute while still maintaining full comprehension of the text.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A compulsion to speak and write in a linguistically correct format, to the point where SCP-3562-4 instances are physically incapable of using incorrect grammar or spelling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Complete immunity to all Class-IV and below text-based memetic hazards. The mechanism behind this immunity is not yet fully understood, although it is hypothesized to be an extension of the advanced ability to break down semiotic connotations within narrative works exhibited by SCP-3562-4 instances. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Further experimentation regarding the possible applications of this ability is currently being overseen by head researcher Dr. Franc.</span> <span style="color: #e00221">Outdated information</span></li>

<p><strong>Addendum 3562.1:</strong> <em>Incident Report: 04/09/2018</em> <span style="color: #e00221">???</span></p>
<p>On <span style="background-color:yellow;">04/09/2018</span> <span style="color: #e00221">April 9, 2018</span> at 2:45 pm, a Foundation-wide alert was released by Site-82’s Memetic Hazard Detection System, indicating the presence of an uncontained memetic agent within the site’s digital archives. In the following minutes, all contact with Site-82 and its occupants was lost. Upon the restoration of contact, it was discovered that <span style="background-color:yellow;">39</span> <span style="color: #e00221">thirty nine</span> personnel from Site-82's memetics department had become instances of SCP-3562-4. Furthermore, Head Researcher Dr. Franc and Assistant Researcher Dr. Dean were no longer present within the site. Their location is currently <span style="background-color:yellow;">unknown</span> <span style="color: #e00221">detention</span>.</p>
<p>Upon examination, the contents of Site-82’s private servers were found to be completely erased with the exception of a single text file. The contents of the file are attached below.<br/>
<span style="color: #e00221">Paragraph is too short, and poorly weaves into the quote.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright, I’ve wiped the entire archives. That should take care of that <span style="background-color:yellow;">bitch</span> <span style="color: #e00221">disrespectful and inappropriate</span>. Still, I think it’s too late for me. At this point I’m either going to starve to death in this room or face whatever she has planned for me beyond that door. Before I go, I’m going to explain everything. I’ll upload this onto the site’s network so everyone will know what happened.</p>
<p>I was overseeing an experiment that involved exposing an SCP-3562-4 instance to a copy of SCP-████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, when SCP-3562's properties suddenly and radically changed. Up until now, SCP-3562 only infected physical documents brought into the Edgewood School, but today SCP-3562-1 instances started popping up on our server left and right. I don’t know how many people were infected, but I know that I was one of them.</p>
<p>My assistant and I managed to stay clean long enough to access the site’s main terminal, but we were infected during the process of wiping the system. My assistant decided to just get it over with. He left through the front door almost immediately. He said <span style="background-color:yellow;">he was going to try to kill her</span> <span style="color: #e00221">inappropriate</span>. That was over four hours ago.</p>
<p>I think I've explained everything, and I'm tired of waiting. It's time for me to face her too. I'll try to take her out as best I can. I <span style="background-color:yellow;">don't know what will happen</span> <span style="color: #e00221">will be punished accordingly</span>, but at least I'll <span style="background-color:yellow;">go down fighting.</span> <span style="color: #e00221">serve as an example for other students.</span></p>
<p>Pray for me,<br/>
Dr. Franc</p>
