            <h1>SCP-1895</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1895</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1895 is contained within a standard safe-class containment cell equipped with one 120V AC power outlet to facilitate testing. SCP-1895 should be unplugged and unpowered when not undergoing testing.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-1895-A created should be filed with Site-52's central document repository for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> All testing of SCP-1895 is suspended until a method is developed to test for possible changes in causality due to SCP-1895's effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1895 is a modified 3 reel "Wheel of Fortune" slot machine manufactured by International Game Technology. The serial numbers have been removed from the machine, hindering attempts to determine provenance.</p>
<p>SCP-1895's anomalous effects manifest when it is touched by a living human being while it is powered and in an inactive state. The object will not activate a second time for anyone that has previously activated the device. Once activated, 1000 credits will be credited to the machine<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and it will become playable as per standard rules of non-anomalous versions of the machine.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> SCP-1895 will retain memory of the number of credits it is set to despite loss of power or disassembly.</p>
<p>The second anomalous effect will occur once the payout button is depressed. Once payout is selected the machine resets to 0 credits<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and a claim ticket (SCP-1895-A) is generated.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-1895-A lists the name of the person that activated SCP-1895, the final number of credits, and a personalized message. These messages will generally either have a congratulatory or consolatory tone based on the final number of credits when the instance was generated. In most cases, a positive or negative event in the individual's past is detailed, including events that the subject had not known of beforehand. In 12% of SCP-1895-A messages recorded, an event is specified followed by details of what might have occurred if that event had an alternative outcome. In 8% of recorded cases, possible future occurrences are alluded to. Experiments have been inconclusive as to whether SCP-1895 has predictive abilities.</p>
<p>SCP-1895 was originally located in the McCarran International Airport located in Clark County, Nevada. It was seized by the Nevada Gaming Control Board following complaints of a rigged game. The Foundation recovered the object and distributed class D amnestics to affected users and enforcement agents who had been exposed to SCP-1895.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1895-A-EL-S:</strong> The following are examples of SCP-1895-A instances generated during experimentation. All experiments were performed using D-Class to activate SCP-1895 unless otherwise noted.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-1895-A-001</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> J███ M█████<br/>
<strong>Credits:</strong> 1000<br/>
<em>Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Name displayed is the legal name of D-54003. Instance was generated after immediately selecting the payout option after activating SCP-1895.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-1895-A-005</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> The [REDACTED]<br/>
<strong>Credits:</strong> 1201<br/>
<em>Congratulations, they didn't find all of the bodies. You only received 3 life sentences.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Name was an alias used by the press to describe D-09345 before his apprehension, who was serving 3 life sentences before induction into the D-Class program.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-1895-A-007</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> T████ "█████" L██████<br/>
<strong>Credits:</strong> 971<br/>
<em>Bad news, all that worry about when (or rather <strong>if</strong>) you're going to get out has given you an ulcer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A medical examination of D-09432 did confirm the presence of a previously undetected ulcer.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-1895-A-012</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> R██████ C██████<br/>
<strong>Credits:</strong> 256<br/>
<em>A terrible ending. Of all the times to get stuck with mashed carrots, you had to eat them for your last meal.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>D-54322 broke testing protocol and read the generated instance of SCP-1895-A. After this, he became distressed and assaulted security personnel on hand for testing and attempted to leave SCP-1895's containment cell. He was terminated during the struggle. Testing protocol was changed to remove D-Class from the containment room after activation of SCP-1895.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-1895-A-019</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> D-█████<br/>
<strong>Credits:</strong> 615602<br/>
<em>CONGRATULATIONS! You are the big winner! Instead of killing your kid sister in a tragic accident, causing your parents to break up and you embarking on a life of crime until you ended up in the D-Class program, you got to have a stable home and a background studying at a prestigious university before joining the Foundation!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Research Assistant M███████ was used for this test run when the progressive jackpot was hit. SCP-1895 began emitting colored streamers from the claim check slot for approximately two minutes. Following this the above SCP-1895-A instance was generated, and SCP-1895 was reset as though the payout button had been pressed. No record of D-█████ was located in Foundation records. Assistant M███████ is currently being held per the zero tolerance escapee policy, and all testing suspended until the full nature of SCP-1895's effects can be determined.</em></p>
