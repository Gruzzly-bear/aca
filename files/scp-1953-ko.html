<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1953-KO should be in an incubator placed inside a special antibacterially treated facility until its health improves. Due to the subject's poor health, a maintenance crew must monitor the subject all day and should immediately respond to any health problems observed. In this case, anyone approaching the subject must have a Cognition Resistance Viability (CRV) over 3.0.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the terminal research for the subject's psychoanalysis, Dr Grace "Noraemine" Choi volunteered for the overall nursing and hollow-attachment formation. However, if the subject emits a cognitohazard over 5.0, she must be replaced with an antimeme-trained caretaker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1953-KO is a one-month-old (at the time of the writing of this document) female child whose parts of her body (especially the ears and near the tailbone) resemble that of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes).</p>
<p>In addition to human ears, the subject possesses pointy ears and a tail covered thinly with fur, both those of a fox. Moreover, various parts of her body are damaged due to the poor environment during her birth. Most notably, her right pinky and ring finger, left leg below the calf, human right ear's earlobe, and eyes are missing.</p>
<p>SCP-1953-KO sporadically emits powerful cognitohazards. In most cases, the hazard will inflict hunger, anxiety, interest in various stimuli, and a craving for affection in nearby people. Like most infants, the subject has not reached cognition, and most of her actions are merely a reflex. Therefore, the cognitohazard effects are primitive and irregular. This seems to be a direct reflection of her mental state on cognitohazardous methods.</p>
<p>The subject displayed poor health since her discovery, in addition to an unstable mental state due to a long separation from her parents. The compromised mental state, especially, combined with her cognitohazardous characteristics, can have dire consequences. Therefore, temporary caretakers are employed for the speedy recovery and mental stability of the subject.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Discovery</span></h3>
<p>Evidence of SCP-1953-KO's existence was found while Dr Noe Sujong of the Muism Department collected data about ancient Muist instances in the Korean peninsula. Many pieces of data pointed to multiple paranormal instances involving psycho and cognitohazards along with cannibalism, which happened in the mountain ranges of Gwacheon-Hyeon, Gyeonggi-do, in the mid-Joseon dynasty.</p>
<p>In response, Dr Noe Sujong and Dr Grace Choi of the Korea Regional Command were dispatched for investigation. They soon discovered a strong Muist seal in a mountain utilising Bagua signs, which the Igumwi commonly used. The team discovered that the seal adds a strong space-time momentum, greatly slowing time.</p>
<p>Dr Grace was permitted to unlock the seal, as the expedition team had ample Muist response measures and an MTF team.</p>
<p>She then discovered SCP-1953-KO in a coma, lying in the cave.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h4 id="toc1"><span>Dr Grace's personal journal</span></h4>
<hr/>
<p>The inside was literally in shambles.</p>
<p>The stench of blood, rotting flesh, and burnt ashes filled the cave. Human bones amounting to about tens of people, some still with flesh on them, piled up like mountains, and the walls were charred black here and there.</p>
<p>Five hundred years passed outside, but time flowed much slower inside, so the corpses were still decaying. Several everyday items of that period (like combs, wooden clogs, and coins), half-burnt human bodies, and a trace of a fire pit were in the cave.</p>
<p>On the ash pile next to the fire pit were two dead infants just born. I couldn't determine if the cave dweller ate them or didn't in hesitation. The bodies were so heavily damaged and charred that I could barely figure out what they used to look like. One of them had body parts that resembled a beast than a human. Next to the bodies were charred placentas stuck to the ground and traces of the ash pile being dug up. It seems like where the third baby lay, judging from the shape of the crater. My gut instinct told me that the person who sealed this place must have taken the still-living child.</p>
<p>It was then I noticed the child with tails and animal ears panting. Her breath was too faint for most people to notice. She must have been in a critical condition. I utilised every method I could to save her life. She received first aid in the ambulance. The hardest part was over. She was still unconscious, but her resilience was astounding.</p>
<p>Despite Dr Noe Sujong's opposition, I returned to Site-01K, holding my kin in my arms. The medical department told me that she wouldn't last a day, but she had strength. Parts of her body were damaged beyond recovery, but she became healthy over time. She even regained consciousness again shortly before.</p>
<p>Many people in Site-01K are amazed and inspired by her will to live. I hope she keeps it to the end.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In light of the discovery of an unusually young humanoid entity, the SCP Foundation Korea Regional Command applied the previously planned longitudinal study<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> for anomalous entities' psyche on SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<p><strong>Contents:</strong> This research will study how SCP-1953-KO - under regular care by a caretaker - as an individual recognises and controls her anomaly and what developmental psychological changes arise in the process, following the lead of Site-01K Developmental Psychology Department and Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department.</p>
</div>
<p>Dr Grace is in charge of overall containment. This is subject to revision as the subject regains health and grows.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>This is an opportunity.</p>
<p>We've mostly seen fully developed humanoid entities until now. Hence, there is no research done on how the anomaly affects the pre-pubertal human psyche, how the entity finds a way to control it, or how it collapses from the lack of control.</p>
<p>It's hard to study pre-pubertal anomalies because they usually fall into two categories. First, the anomaly did not develop enough to be noticeable. Second, the entity is born with powerful anomalous traits, inflicting critical damage on people around them, resulting in the instance's early death.</p>
<p>However, SCP-1953-KO is one of the rare cases discovered in infants. With proper care, she can answer our questions as she grows.</p>

<h3 id="toc3"><span>1953-KO Research Log 1</span></h3>
<p>The following documents are hand-written research logs from Dr Grace about SCP-1953-KO's developments during its longitudinal study. The log covers her regaining consciousness to 12 months after birth.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>It's been a week since SCP-1953-KO regained consciousness. She stays mostly inactive in the incubator, but her basic reflexes, like the grasping and sucking reflex and turning her head in response to external stimuli, were intact. The scars on her body haven't healed completely yet, but they've improved significantly.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-1953-KO recovered a lot, so she was taken out of the incubator. At first, she couldn't adapt to the sudden change in environment, crying frequently and being stressed. For basic hollow affection, SCP-1953-KO was given a stuffed doll, and visits from the caretaker (i.e. Me) became more frequent. After the affection was formed, her heart rate and mental state stabilised.<br/>
However, she grew anxious when I wasn't with her. I should see her more often to deal with it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-1953-KO started to crawl and babble. With her one eye, seven fingers, and one leg, she sees and ventures the world.<br/>
Before, she needed my help to sit. Now, she can sit on her own and starts to grab and put stuff into her mouth. Whenever I'm looking away from her, she's sucking on my pen, hiding in that small containment chamber, or drooling on my clothes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-1953-KO sporadically emits cognitohazards. This is done reflexively and unconsciously. Most likely, she delivers her raw emotions or projects the incomplete worldview she constructed to other people. It was frustrating to be affected by them, but it was a helpful experience to see the world in an infant's eyes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-1953-KO starts to stand alone. I asked for a prosthetic leg for SCP-1953-KO. It can't be comfortable for her, but she can now stand with two legs when she's holding my hand.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1953-KO developed object permeance. This is two weeks faster than the average child.</p>
<p>Object permeance is to know an object still exists, even when it's out of sight. When their mother is out of sight, infants without object permeance will think that their mom is dead and will never come back, hence the crying. However, with it, they will believe their mom is not dead and will return, even when she's out of sight.</p>
<p>Now, the kid doesn't cry like before when I'm not with her. Now, I feel a hair less worried when I leave the containment chamber.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Today's cognitohazard emitted by SCP-1953-KO was the strongest. Luckily, I only suffered minor consequences: some nosebleed, that's all. It's nothing. 1953-KO was sent to a temporary caretaker as per the protocols, but I heard she kept crying and looking for me. I felt oddly proud.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Today, 1953-KO called my 'mommy' - which I denied. Though, what will a kid just born know?</p>
<p>A mother is the first other. The fact that she called me mommy means that she started to distinguish herself and me. I.e., she developed sentience.</p>
<p>The team decided to let her think I was her mom until her sentience was consolidated and she recognised surrounding objects and concepts.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Follow-up research regarding SCP-1953-KO</span></h3>
<p>On 27/06/2021, Dr Noe Sujong discovered a document written by the philologist, Professor Jang Hayeong containing information about <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-953">SCP-953</a> and her child. According to the literature, SCP-953 is a demon fox that lived in ancient Korea, staying alive for at least 1500 years, sustaining herself by cannibalism and EVE draining, accumulating shamanistic energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, information about SCP-953's child was found. The person is PoI-DH-001 "Hoya", who was involved in a conflict against Foundation agents during document retrieval. She is currently the head of the <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/dinodon-s-hand">"Dinodon's hand"</a>, the Korean branch of the GoI Serpent's Hand. The subject is seen to possess a personality and anomalous traits similar to SCP-953.</p>
<p>The document contained detailed information about a location presumed to be SCP-953's last habitat. The location matched that of the cave excavated by Dr Noe Sujong and Dr Grace.</p>
<p>Such circumstances suggest that SCP-1953-KO is the child of SCP-953 and, moreover, the sister of PoI-DH-001 "Hoya".</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>1953-KO Research Log 2</span></h3>
<p>The log covers 12 to 24 months after birth.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>SCP-1953-KO's tail grew pretty fluffy, as did its ears. That's right. I was forgetting this, but SCP-1953-KO is a demon fox. But the discrepancy between this kid and the other one at Site-17… makes it hard to believe that the two are the same species. Would 1953-KO turn out to be like her when she grows up? Or will she become the Foundation's child raised by us?</p>
<hr/>
<p>The kid can now play on her own. She was a bit slower than others because of the prosthetics, but her adaptation is outstanding. Moreover, she's become quite active, moving around inside the containment chamber. She loves to play with the toys we provide. 1953-KO seems to prefer the yellow ones.<br/>
In addition, the inner walls of the chamber were covered with a softer lining to compensate for her increased activity.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We now gave 1953-KO some children's storybooks. She focuses on the book when I slowly read it to her. She also tries to mimic some simple words that I say. Now she can understand and say words like "yes", "no", "mom", "What?", "Who" and "Where?". Being the curious child she is, she points out almost everything in the book and asks what it is. Well, it was natural of her to do so - she'd never seen them before.</p>
<hr/>
<p>An aspiring artist, 1953 is. She used up all the crayons we gave her in two days. The inner walls of the chamber make you wonder if this is a baby's room or an AWCY exhibition.<br/>
We were going to replace the dirty bed sheets and lining anyway, so we let her draw whatever she wanted. However, she's yet to draw anything concrete.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Today, I became the Korean Regional Command's Administrator after Administer Kim Jeonghoe. Now, it's not Dr Grace Choi, but Administrator Choi. I gotta get used to it fast, but it's not now.</p>
<p>Most exploits were from before when I found 1953-KO, and recently, my work was mostly about 1953-KO. It seems I'm gonna get quite busier from now on.</p>
<p>I wonder if the position of Administrator is too big for me. Nevertheless, I hope I can juggle that along with the longitudinal study of 1953-KO.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1953-KO gained self-consciousness. When I praise her, she smiles; she understands the person in the mirror is herself and that the kid in the book's pictures is different from herself. Also, if things go as scheduled, I'll not be called her mother anymore.</p>
<p>However, such change will cause much confusion to the child - something that she recognised and gave a name to suddenly becomes something else because some people she doesn't know agree with it. 1953-KO still wants to call me mom, so I begged the research team to let her call me that a little longer. That'll be until she develops logical thinking enough for her to understand I'm not her birth mother, but a mere 'surrogate' that raised her.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Her anomalous powers grow stronger every day. She struggles to control it, but she is growing more meticulous at a remarkable pace. I had an emergency meeting with the longitudinal study team. The subject was to decide whether to accept and help her hone her skills or to deny and repress it instead.</p>
<p>We exchanged many opinions, and Dr Yoon Geumseon's proposal was selected. She claimed that suppressing the kid's powers would only leave them festering and inflating in her subconscious. Our decision was to start training the kid how to exert and control her anomaly. Though, the methodology is hard to come about yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We talked a lot about the training method. Following the learning psychology model, we could provide positive reinforcement when she exerts cognitohazards under a threshold and provides negative reinforcement when she goes above it. This is a method used for other anomalous instances. In most cases, the positive reinforcement is given as a form of food, and the negative one is given as an electric shock. However, the objective of the longitudinal study of 1953-KO is to study a child growing up in a typical (and, moreover, ideal) family. Naturally, I was sternly against that proposal.</p>
<p>However, the problem of 'so what should we do' remains. Suppose there aren't any bright ideas that option can't be used. And I say this with great regret: We are the Foundation; therefore, we are bound to do this if we don't find an adequate solution.</p>

<h3 id="toc6"><span>Archived Document: Message from Dr. Clef</span></h3>
<div class="box">
<p>First of all, congratulations on being Administrator. May you find peace in your life.</p>
<p>I am sending this email to discuss some issues pertinent to SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<p>First, I express great concern about Administrator Grace Choi's choice regarding SCP-1953-KO.<br/>
It is perceived that you have grown blind to the Foundation's purpose and protecting SCP-1953-KO for your personal emotions. It is irresponsible for the Regional Branch Administrator, with practical authority over the entire Korean Regional Branch, to personally come in contact with an SCP and form a bond.</p>
<p>Second, you are well aware that SCP-953 is SCP-1953-KO's mother. As a participant in the SCP-953 retrieval mission and the containment expert of said subject, I can personally feel the bone-chilling evil and savageness the subject possesses. 1953-KO has a much stronger cognitohazardous effect than that of SCP-953. Despite its current physical abilities being weaker than a human, the psychological risk that 1953-KO may pose when it reaches adulthood must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>I hope your empathy lasts. I also hope such empathy does not lead to another tragedy. Of course, you must acknowledge and prepare for it to prevent the tragedy from being a reality.</p>
<p>SCP-1953-KO is not your child. Neither should it be.<br/>
Please do not forget that we all die in the dark for those in the light.</p>

<h3 id="toc7"><span>1953-KO Research Log 3</span></h3>
<p>The following document is the personal journal of Administrator Grace Choi, covering the subject's development from age 2 to 5.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>SCP-1953-KO now speaks clearly and well. She expresses what she likes or dislikes without hesitation. Day by day, she became more skilled at naming things she could see around her. Teddy bear, fairy tale book, pen, keycard, camera, security guard. There were many items that other children could not easily see or pronounce, but seeing SCP-1953-KO speak them with such clarity makes me feel proud.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-1953-KO really likes fairy tales. She likes oral folk tales, especially the Sun and the Moon. She is scared of the part with the tiger and covers her eyes with both hands whenever it comes up. Once, I playfully imitated the tiger's dialogue in a scary way, and it made her cry.</p>
<p>Every day when I come, she shows me a fairy tale book and explains the characters: who these characters are, what they like, and what they did. Time flies when I listen to her. It reminded me how interesting fairy tale books can be.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1953-KO didn't cry when I left the chamber.<br/>
I am worried whether she is growing premature, or if she's grown used to to such farewells.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This was the first time SCP-1953-KO strongly asked me for something. She wanted to see a tree - the fairy tales always mentioned trees and forests. I showed her pictures of trees and forests on my phone, but she threw a tantrum, insisting on seeing them in person. It was the first time she cried so vehemently. Seeing her cry so loudly made me think that at least she was healthy.</p>
<p>However, the cognitohazard rating skyrocketed to 10.0. This was more than double my cognitive resistance capacity, 5.0 (which is above average), and the psychological strike made my nose bleed. Startled by blood, she became scared and started to cry. I hugged and comforted her.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After the incident, the girl grew extremely wary of her anomalous nature and tried to hide it. The incident must have been very traumatic to her.</p>
<p>She never speaks of going out again. My heart is heavy.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Ethics Committee and Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department finally caved into my nagging and gave me clearance for an outing. First, my (and AEC Dep. Dr Chiika's) bold claims that an outing is essential for terminal research; second, my proposal to let the Ethics Committee experiment with SCP-1953-KO; and lastly, Assistant Director Killie's small help - all this to barely get this precious clearance. I owe them a meal now. We can't exit Site-01K grounds, and we're restricted to 2 hours once every month, but it's surely a huge progress.</p>
<p>The Committee's experiments are a long time away, so I could be relieved for now. However, what's urgent is to build infrastructure to enable the limited outing. It'd be a while by then, working overtime.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Finally, I trekked up a hill near Site-01K with the kid.</p>
<p>The kid finds everything in the mountain wonderful and new. With every step, she asks me, 'What is this?' 'What's that?' 'What happens if you do this?' 'And that?' I diligently answer her questions, helping her embrace this new world. Even after returning to the containment chamber, she kept talking to me about what happened during our outing. She must have loved it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The kid grew much more energetic than usual. She became more active, never seeming to get tired, no matter how long we played. She still stumbles because of her lack of an eye and depth perception, but now she runs, catches, and throws quite well. Especially during walks, she shows an incredibly energetic. Today, during our walk, she was very interested in picking up and throwing stones. I'm thinking of playing catch with her when she gets a bit bigger.</p>
<p>I remember an interesting incident that happened during our walk. She threw a rock, striking a pigeon by accident and making it fly away. It seemed to have shocked her a lot. On our way back to the containment room, she kept talking about how much the pigeon must have been hurt, with teary eyes.</p>
<p>That was when it dawned on me - her soul is different from that demon fox's in Site-17.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Neutralisation Target:</strong> SCP-953<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> SCP-953 Containment Chamber, Hall A, Wing B, Site-17<br/>
<strong>Containment Officer:</strong> Dr Alto Clef</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>The footage shows SCP-953 in containment.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-953 just devoured a goat provided to her as food. The chamber is laced with blood and viscera.</em></p>
<p><em>The lights flicker. Soon, sirens start blasting, and the light turns red.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-953 looks around at the sound of an unidentified individual screaming.</em></p>
<p><em>Three gunshots can be heard.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-953 stands, looking at the chamber door.</em></p>
<p><em>A thud</em></p>
<p><em>After the rattling sounds of the keycard operating, the huge chamber doors slowly start to open.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Who be thee?</p>
<p><em>A fuzzy humanoid silhouette appears from the dark entrance.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified]:</strong> It's been quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Did thou do this?</p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified]:</strong> Of course. Piece of cake for me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> The underdog triumphs. I did not expect to see thee here again. Fate spins in mysterious ways, even after a millennium and a half.</p>
<p><em>The figure slowly walks towards the subject. The figure is wearing a newsboy cap pressed down firmly and a blue vest with bloodstains in various places.</em></p>
<p><em>The figure holds a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a revolver in the other.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> So, how hast thou been faring, daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Just fantastic, thanks to you.</p>
<p><em>Hoya nonchalantly puts the bottle of whiskey and two shot glasses on a puddle of blood and sits behind it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Sit. (Pointing revolver)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> (Slowly sitting down, smiling.) It is faint to me when we have met for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> When was it, about 200 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Ah, right. It has been quite a while, indeed. (Chuckles)</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> So, how have you heard of me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> The mortals were kind enough to enlighten me with their trivia. The blue-eyed one with the harp told me a lot about thee, especially.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Hah, Clef. Jailors are uselessly making a fuss, as always. Well, no matter. Saved me from wasting time introducing myself. (Pours whiskey in the glass)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Far from "useless". They told me of thee to run tests on me. Of course, the only thing they found out is…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> … Your utter lack of motherly instincts.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> (Chuckling, emptying the whiskey into her mouth) So, why did thou come here?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> To fullfill my duties I've chose to take.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Duty? Of matricide?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Damn right. (Hoya also empties the glass.)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Why is it thine duty to kill me? Did someone ask thee to? Hasn't thou want to kill me for no reason, originally?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> It's one I chose to put upon myself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Most amusing. Burdening thy self with chores on your own.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> It's very important for me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Then what is thou waiting for? Why not pull the trigger, but instead share a bottle with thine mother?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I want to hear you rant before you go.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> About?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Anything.</p>
<p><em>They continue to drink the whiskey without talking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You lived 1,500 years, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Why is thou asking me that?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> What do you think of your life now, in the face of death? (Shaking revolver)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Nothing. I have lived enough. A thousand years is enough life for a Gumiho. Oh, how proud it was to get another tail each century. Unfortunately, though, it became meaningless after the ninth one.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> So, how have you lived for the next 500 years?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Alas, I don't remember it now.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> There is something that keeps you going, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Oh, poor Hoya. You are deluded to believe I live because of some grand reason.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Better to die than to live a meaningless life.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Some contemporaries get paid to hear thine story. Why don't thou go see them? (Sipping whiskey)</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Pushes revolver) That's not an answer.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> (Laughter) I'm sorry, but Mother knows all about you, all about that emptiness. Why live? It's obvious, you know it. We live because we cannot die.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Drinks whiskey, snickering.)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> What dost thou live for? Love? Self-actualisation? Delivering justice? I can assure thee, that they all crumple in a fraction of a second. Oh, how those herd of fools perish for something they can't even see!</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I know that. I know it so fucking well.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Thou ist the same. My daughter, does thou know how many daughters I birthed? Do you know why I abandoned thee? In the endless aeons of time, thou means nothing to me, just another daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Well, no shit, Sherlock.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> But a mother cannot help crying at the fact that my kid came to give me the best give I can get.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You're not going to resist?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Meaningless at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Frowns) I wanted to duel you for once.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Ah, not interested.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Ist thou ready?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Five hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Nothing more to say?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> I Just puked it all out. Don't thou have anything to say to thy mother?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Drinking from glass) Hmm, well… Oh, I can tell thee this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> I'm waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Like mother, like daughter.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> (Starts snickering, which turns into laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Chuckles, then laughs)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-953:</strong> Haha, most amusing.</p>
<p><em>Hoya shoots the revolver onto SCP-953's head.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-953 falls down.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya stands up, stares at SCP-953's corpse for a long time, and looks at the way that appeared on the chamber's outer wall.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, she turns to SCP-953 again and empties the cylinder at her body.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few gunshots, clicks of the empty cylinder can be heard.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya finally turns and walks out of the frame.</em></p>

<h3 id="toc9"><span>1953-KO Research Note 3</span></h3>
<p>The following document is the personal journal of Administrator Grace Choi, covering the subject's development from age 5 to 9.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I've heard grim news from Dr Clef in the morning. I didn't know how to inform the kid. I decided to tell her a more dulled-down version of the event, hiding her bloodline and disguising it as another story.</p>
<p>She showed raw terror at the story. The kid must think she's some kind of scary tiger.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It has been 100 days since the kid's cognitohazard ratings stayed under 2.0. She's excelling at controlling her anomalous nature. It must be the memory of my nose bleeding and the scary story.</p>
<p>I met up with Dr Geumseon Yoon, who I hadn't met in a while since the Analytic Psychology Department moved to Site-21K. Well, it's Professor Yoon Geumseon now. She showed concern about the kid growing afraid of her own powers. The initial intent was to prevent her from pressing her anomaly in until it festers and bursts. However, it's only where the pressure is coming from, external or internal. After a long discussion, we agreed to make a simple facility to allow her to unleash some of her anomalies on her own.</p>
<p>That facility was a box full of rats. She could assume control of the rats' minds and play with them, but she should do so at just the right strength so that the rats are unharmed. This play will serve as a great control training for her anomalous abilities. It's like an anomalous "red light, green light" of sorts. Just like how regular kids learn how to physically control their bodies via moving and stopping on command, 1953-KO controls the impulses and movement of the rats to control her own abilities.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The kid's ego grows more sophisticated as the days pass. She now knows she doesn't look like other kids and tries to mimic them. She anti-memifies her fox ears and tail, rendering them invisible, and dawns an illusion of two eyes, two legs, and ten fingers on herself.</p>
<p>They aren't that detailed yet, but the fact that she can exert such a level of cognitohazards is noteworthy.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, the kid's in her period where socialisation is important. This means two things. First, the child needs to have her first contact with another child who can potentially harm her. Second, through interactions with peers, we can assess how well the child understands and follows rules and turn-taking, and how much her sense of morality has developed.</p>
<p>These present their respective problems. The former is that it's so vague how to allow contact with 1953-KO with her peers, and the latter is that the morality testing from the Ethics Committee that we've been sweeping under the rug cannot be ignored anymore.</p>
<p>This gives me a headache in so many ways.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I had to beg the D-Class HR department. The chief was firmly against it initially, but I literally begged on my knees, which he reluctantly obliged.</p>
<p>Life is born in D-Class bunkers, tragically. The kids born are raised communally in the Foundation nursery to become D-Class or Class 0 clearance personnel. When an infant or kid is needed for containment, they are often recruited as containment personnel. I managed to smuggle some of those D-Class children out to be put in 1953-KO's containment chamber.</p>
<p>Four (4) children were picked who had lower violence rates than average D-Class children, similar to that of civilian children. Well, except for one of them. A social experiment involving using the kids and observing the situation is planned.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's time. Three (3) pre-selected D-Class children were introduced, along with a caretaker from the Foundation. The experiment went as follows: 1953-KO used cognitohazards to hide her tail and ears and created an illusion of two eyes, ten fingers, and two legs. Only the caretaker, but not the children, were informed that 1953-KO is an anomalous entity. The caretaker will order the children to perform various activities according to the routine nursery schedule. My research team and I will observe her socialising through a camera.</p>
<p>First experiment. SCP-1953-KO was very shy around other children her age. She did not try to join in the activities of the children and often looked for her mother. During this process, the cognitohazard level rose to 1.2. One of the more sensitive children complained of a headache, and SCP-1953-KO's tail was briefly exposed, but nobody noticed.</p>
<p>The caregiver tried to encourage SCP-1953-KO to join the activities, but it was not easy. She strongly refused to participate in all activities, such as puzzle solving, block building, charades, and tag.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the next experiment, I suggested the caregiver go on a walk. Fortunately, 1953-KO showed great interest in the walk. This time, they went outside the grounds of the 01K base, and the child was excited to go to places she had never been before. When they arrived at a wide-open field, the children started playing tag, a game they had learned in a previous session, and 1953-KO was able to participate smoothly in the game this time.</p>
<p>It was observed that when SCP-1953-KO was being chased, the child who was 'it' suddenly stopped dead in their tracks. The child seemed momentarily confused and then resumed playing, but it was obvious. SCP-1953-KO began to use her abilities on humans.</p>
<p>I don't know what to tell her about this. Should I tell her not to use her anomalous powers on other people? Or should I lecture her for using her abilities instead of playing fair?</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the end, I told her to play fair. Anomalies can be a useful tool or a weapon, depending on how it is used. Rather than blindly suppressing the anomaly, it is more important to instil the right values in the child.</p>
<p>It was decided to continue with a walk in the next session. Once the child becomes closer to her friends, they will return to the containment chamber to resume activities.</p>
<p>I informed the caretaker about the situation. As the play progressed, SCP-1953-KO started to get along well with the other children. She did not use her abilities even when at a disadvantage in the game of tag.</p>
<p>A snack time was given to the children so that the caregivers and research team could have a meeting. During the meeting, loud crying was heard, and we had to pause the meeting. When we went outside, SCP-1953-KO was crying with a bruise on her cheek. I held and comforted SCP-1953-KO and ended the socialisation experiment.</p>
<p>It was only after returning to the containment chamber and watching the recorded footage that we could understand what had happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>While we were in the meeting, a fight broke out between two children when one snatched another's snack. The snatcher was bigger and stronger, making it difficult for others to confront him. However, the kid who had the snack taken was the type to always stand up for themselves, which led to a fight. The verbal altercation quickly escalated into a physical one. SCP-1953-KO, not knowing what to do, watched but eventually got caught up in the fight. When the child threw a punch at SCP-1953-KO, the cognitohazard level briefly spiked to 3.0, and her eyes flashed red, but she closed her eyes and took the punch. Then, she began to cry loudly.</p>
<p>Why did she prioritise suppressing her anomaly over defending herself at that moment? Was it because she took my words as absolute, or was it because she became afraid of her abilities once again? So many thoughts are flooding my mind; it feels like it could burst.</p>
<p>Such is the hardships of raising a kid.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The socialisation experiment reached its final stages. 1953-KO has successfully made amends with the child she fought with and participated much more actively in play. She patiently waits for her turn and follows the rules she set with her peers. Watching the children play is like observing a miniature version of both the normal and the anomalous society. There is a demon fox among them, yet the human children are blissfully unaware. Every morning, 1953-KO diligently ensures that her tail and ears remain hidden from others and cautiously participates in the games.</p>
<p>Then, a thought suddenly struck me: what if we had introduced 1953-KO's true form to the children from the beginning? If children, not afraid of anomalies, could grow up and play together if only such a society could exist where the normal and the anomalous coexist in harmony. Perhaps that would be a world where the SCP Foundation is no longer necessary.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Chiika concluded that enough data had been gathered from the experiment and decided to end it. Professor Yoon Geumseon agreed, but the caregiver showed a hint of discomfort. When asked why, she told me that one of the children involved was scheduled to be deployed in the containment procedure of an entity once the experiment concluded. She came to me, pleading to extend the experiment a bit longer. I was torn, but ultimately I refused. We couldn't continue the experiment indefinitely.</p>
<p>I apologised to her. In response, she threw various accusations at me. She claimed that everyone at Site-01K, as well as the higher-ups, knew that I had become emotionally attached to SCP-1953-KO, that Director Grace Choi treats a SCP she was containing as her own daughter, even giving it a name. I didn't deny it. Yes, I was sorry to admit to Professor Yoon Geumseon and Dr Chiika, but the terminal research was just a pretence. It was bound to be revealed eventually… And it's an undeniable fact that SCP-1953-KO, being the daughter of a Regional Command Administrative Director, received such protection, while the children of Class D personnel are thrown to monsters, assigned to tasks adults can't do, and disposed of as needed.</p>
<p>"This is the Foundation, what can be done?" This phrase is probably the easiest way to rationalise in the world. And I don't want to rationalise this way. That's why I could only repeatedly say sorry to him.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's time. We now must address a long-postponed task.</p>
<p>Firstly, a notice from the Ethics Committee has arrived. It states that the child's moral compass is now sufficiently developed to be assessed. They aim to determine whether the barbarity observed in SCP-953 is inherent in the child and whether their moral values align with the Foundation's principles.</p>
<p>Secondly, as initially promised and to regain trust within the regional command, I must ensure that SCP-1953-KO no longer refers to me as 'mother'. The child has matured enough to think logically and understand relationships and circumstances, including ours. I'm concerned about how well she'll take this. However, this will be addressed only after the upcoming meeting with the Ethics Committee, as premature action might render the child unstable.</p>

<h3 id="toc10"><span>Ethics Committee Interview Log</span></h3>
<p>The following record is a recording of an ethics experiment conducted on SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experimental:</strong> Ethics committee member Kiara Shamalan</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department Dr Chiika, Analytic Psychology Department Prof. Yoon Geumseon, Site-01K Director Grace 'Noraemine' Choi</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-1953-KO (9 y.o.)</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> SCP-1953-KO?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Who are you, ma'am?</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> I'm a storyteller, who tells stories. It's gonna be fun, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Are you gonna read the book with pictures?</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Yes. I will tell you a story, and you tell me what you think.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Okay!</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> (Clears throat)</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Confirmation of Respect of Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>James saw a basket full of dolls. James likes dolls, so he picked the basket up and headed home. But Dylan showed up and asked James to return the basket to him. On a closer look, the basket had Dylan's name on it. But James really likes dolls, so he ran away without returning the basket to Dylan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> What do you think? Who did wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Um… James did wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> It had Dylan's name on it. Then it's his.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Then why shouldn't James take Dylan's stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> It's sad when someone takes my stuff. I'd be sad if I was Dylan.<br/>
were</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Then, what if James likes the dolls more than Dylan?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Then he can take it.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Because, if I were a doll, I would be happier being with James than Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Hmm, I see.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> Interesting response.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> Animistic thinking. Children think everything has a personality.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Then what about Dylan being sad because James took the dolls?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Hmm… But I like the dolls being happy.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> If the dolls are happy, is it okay to take Dylan's stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Even if it has a name? Even if it's something valuable?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Uh… (Looks around, confused) Yes. If they're really happy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> That's not a typical response for her age. If she doesn't understand the utilitarian idea of the greatest happiness of the greatest number, she doesn't understand the rules yet or thinks she can upset it for her own gain.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> 1953-KO has developed empathetic skills. That, and the animistic thinking, leads her to think the animated dolls are characters, and she focuses on their individual "feelings".</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Hmm, I see. Then I'll tell you another story.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Confirmation of Autonomous Morality</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>John pushed open the door after his mom called him for dinner. But fifteen glass cups were in front of the door, and all of them were broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Henry saw a jar of jam on the cupboard. To eat the jam, Henry climbed up the table, but a glass cup fell down and broke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Now, who is worse? John or Henry?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Hmm… (Hesitates for a while)</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> The previous questions were to check for 'heteronomous morality', which is following a set of fixed rules. This time, it's to check for 'autonomous morality' if they could figure out an intent that precedes the rules. Her peers haven't developed autonomous morality yet. Therefore, they focus only on the results.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> I think John is worse.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> He broke a lot of cups.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> The subject hasn't developed autonomous morality yet.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Then what about this case?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John was walking down the street when he saw Henry's house on fire. For Henry to escape, John has to open the door. However, Henry's favourite bowl is in front of the door, which will break if John tries to open it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Hmm… I'll still open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why? You shouldn't break something that another person likes.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> But I still want to save him. If he doesn't, both John and Henry will be sad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> Interesting response.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> It fits the part where she can break the rules for her own happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> It could be for happiness or just to 'feel good'.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> So, is Piaget's Ethics Development all over?</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> Yes, it seems so. SCP-1953-KO's stage of development can be either ahead or slightly behind her peers. In comparison to her peers, who see rules as absolute, she can bend the rules with flexibility and-</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> One more remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> Are we using Kohlberg's model? I think it'll yield similar results in this state.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Continuing now.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. The Trolley Problem</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A runaway trolley is barreling down the railway track. Ahead, on the track, five people are tied up, and on the side track, one person is tied up. You are standing in front of a lever next to the tracks. If you don't pull the lever, five people die. If you pull the lever, one person dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> What would you do? Will you pull the lever?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Uh… (Looks around, anxious) Stop the…</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> You can't stop the train. You can't untie the people, either. You can only choose and look at the results.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> Who added this?</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> It's standard Ethics Committee protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> This question is too hard for a child who barely developed conventional morality. Her responses are likely to result in misinterpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Uh… Um…</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> I… I'll pull… the lever…</p>
<p><em>(Pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Because more people live.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> (Sighing in relief) Utilitarianism. The greatest happiness of the greatest number. She understands it. This is something that even children on the third level of Piaget's developmental stage can barely grasp.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> And it fits with the Foundation doctrine, too.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> It's more important how much she can follow it. Now, 1953-KO? Can you go on?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a straight track is a bridge. On the track, five people are tied, and a runaway trolley is barreling down the person. Jimmy is standing on the bridge. You can push Jimmy off the bridge, in which case Jimmy will die, and the train will stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> I… I…</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> That's too harsh for a kid.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> For adults, too. Most people will not push according to their morals.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> However, the Foundation is ready to be the evil for Humanity. "So that you may live in the light"…</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> (Deep breath, in a small voice) "We die in the dark"…</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> 1953-KO?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> (Sobbing) That… I…</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> Can you kill a person to save five people?</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Um… I… (Starts crying)</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> That's enough.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> (Ignores Yoon) What do you think, 1953-KO?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> Is it that important? This question makes no psychological sense whatsoever. Didn't you hear me? There's ample chance of misinterpretation, regardless of how she answers.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> It's important for the Foundation. VERY important.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> Ah, I get it now. You're trying to end this terminal research project, regardless of 1953-KO. If she says she'll push, you'll report that 1953-KO is as barbaric as 953 is, and if you say she wouldn't, you'll report that she doesn't fit the Foundation's ideals, right?</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> (Sigh) That's enough. 1953-KO, you can come out now.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> (To 1953-KO) Wait, answer my question!</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Yoon:</strong> (Slams the table) Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> (Shouts) I'll jump!</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> (Sees her, dumbstruck)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chiika:</strong> This is…</p>
<p><em>Director Grace Choi entered the interview room and picked up 1953-KO, who was crying.</em><br/>
<em>She then turns back and briefly stares at the experimenter.</em></p>
<p><em>The experimenter looks at Grace, still frozen.</em></p>
<p><em>Director Grace leaves the room.</em></p>

<h3 id="toc11"><span>Incident Log: Director's office, Site-01K</span></h3>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Members of the GoI, "Dinodon's Hand" appear in Director Grace Choi's office. They claimed that they urgently visited her to tell her a few stories.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Director Grace Choi is working in her office.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, the floor shakes and the lights flicker.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified]:</strong> (A voice is heard.) Excuse us, could you give us a moment?</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> (Looking around) … What is it?</p>
<p><em>A man is standing in the office corner, holding a book.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Bows) Member of the Dinodon's Hand, Kang Na-roo. Excuse our lack of manners; I had urgent news to tell, so I opened the way. Hwi-yŏng?</p>
<p><em>A blonde girl appears behind Na-roo and bows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> (Nods her head.) It's about your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> Cl… You mean, SCP-1953-KO? How do you…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Actually, we've been monitoring your daughter for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> Along with your devotion to her.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> So, what do you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> It's about our chairperson, Hoya. It's been a while, so I assume you've heard what happened between her and her mother.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> Hoya… I don't know why, but she's been constantly pushing her mind to the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Became more compulsive and obsessive.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> She's also been more self-loathing and self-destructive.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> So what does that have to do with SCP-1953-KO? The kid has nothing to do with the Dinodon's Hand except for her bloodline.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> That bloodline, that's the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Hoya is hunting down demon foxs. Recently, she killed the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/searching-for-the-demon-foxes-1" target="_blank">artificial demon fox of IJAMEA</a> we gave to the Aodaisho. Things have been sour with them ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> Now she's become a monster even we can't stop… Hoya will come here to finish her job.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Fortunately, she doesn't know your daughter exists. I'm deleting as much information as I can. However, if she knows that her thought-to-be-dead sister is actually alive and growing in Foundation hands…</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> I… I don't understand. Why? Why would she kill her kin?</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> We're not sure… However, Hoya expressed hatred towards her kind.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> And that interlocks with her current emotional state, leading to not only denying and despising her identity but also desiring to kill everything related to it.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> So…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Yes, it seems that she's going to kill herself after this.</p>
<p><em>Heavy silence fills the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Deep sigh) Just know that for now. I'm hiding information about her as much as I can, and I trust security will be tight under the Foundation. Although, I can't be completely relieved.</p>
<p><em>Kang hands Grace a small, round charm carved out of a pebble.</em></p>
<p><em>The ocean of the moon is carved into the charm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> This is…</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> I made it. Keep this with you at all times. It'll protect you when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> If she finds out about your daughter and starts looking for her, I'll contact you. Run away with her. The MTF unit… will not be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> Just like her mother.</p>
<p><em>Grace, confused, receives the charm and looks at the two.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> We'll do our best to stop her.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> We'll be leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> W-wait…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> There's one thing… Just one thing I'd like to ask. Mr. Na-roo?</p>
<p><em>Kang approaches her.</em><br/>
<em>Grace whispers.</em><br/>
<em>Kang hesitates and then nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> … Alright, I'll try to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Director Choi:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> Then… (They bow.)</p>
<p><em>The two bows and slowly move out of frame.</em><br/>
<em>Grace stands there, looking at them.</em><br/>
<em>Hwi-yŏng turns around for a moment and looks at Grace.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> (Slight smile) May there be peace upon your family.</p>
<p><em>Hwi-yŏng turns around and heads inside the way. The way closes.</em><br/>
<em>Grace loses grasp of the charm and drops it.</em></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Home.</p>
<p>A mother is the first other person, as the home is the first world.</p>
<p>And they approved of me and my daughter's world.</p>
<p>Although, the relationship is soon coming to an end.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I decided to carry out the promise I had been postponing to SCP-1953-KO. From now on, I am no longer her mother. I explained everything to the child. From the moment I first met her, how she grew up, the stories about her parents and sister, and the story about the daughter I had let go of before I found her.</p>
<p>Thankfully and so maturely, she quietly listened to the entire story and calmly accepted it. She said she wanted to call me 'mom' one last time. I hugged her and savoured our final embrace as mother and daughter. From now on, we are an experimenter and subject, Dr. Grace and Serial Number SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The terminal research is nearing its end. The study is just short of its final conclusion, and accordingly, the containment procedures for SCP-1953-KO have become a bit more 'SCP-like.'</p>
<p>Fortunately, SCP-1953-KO is now managing things well on her own and has gotten used to the standard humanoid containment procedures pretty well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that I haven't yet.<br/>
The thought of the coming long separation pains my heart. The worries, the things I never accomplished, bring me regret and resentment.</p>
<p>Every night, I dream of SCP-1953-KO growing up, taking the college entrance exam, attending university, meeting a wonderful partner, and getting married. In the dream, I shed tears of happiness, but when I wake up, I shed tears of emptiness.</p>
<p>What a nightmare.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The terminal research plan is officially over.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Body, mind, ego, motor function, emotion, cognitive function, morals.</p>
<p><strong>IDENTICAL TO HUMANS</strong></p>
<p>The thing I wanted to focus on the most, the development of anomalies, works similarly to that of the non-anomalous talents of humans.</p>
<p>For well over a decade, we've learnt a lot while raising an instance, no, a child. What it means to raise a child, for a child to grow and what the older generation lived for.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To commemorate the end of the long-term terminal research project, many of the project participants gathered together. Professor Yoon Geum-Seon, Dr. Chiika, Professor Noe Sujong, and even Assistant Director Killy… We talked for a long time. In the unprecedented amount of time spent on the project, our titles became grander, and our faces grew more wrinkled. Yet, Professor Yoon Geum-Seon was still kind, Dr. Chiika was still blunt, and Professor Noe Sujong was still as sly as ever.</p>
<p>Amidst our talks of nostalgia, an unexpected guest joined. He had come to commemorate the end of the longitudinal research project, and, as he explained, he also wished to have a direct face-to-face talk with me alone, saying he wanted to discuss something specific.</p>

<h3 id="toc12"><span>Interview Log: Administrator Grace Choi and Dr. Clef</span></h3>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> It's been quite a while.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Clef gestures hello, holding up the teacup.</em></p>
<p><em>The ukulele on his chest slips down, so he tightens the rope.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Haha, it's like it's been a decade.</p>
<p><em>Grace also lifts up her cup.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> It's been a long time since I've seen you in person. That was before you became the Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Dear, it feels like ages ago; more than a century ago. It must be because of the extremely hectic life I've pursued over the past ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Haha, that's what raising a child is.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> … Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> (Laughs out loud) I'm not blaming you. Well, I was at the start of the project… But now, I'd rather give you my respects.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> I… I just… (Faces down)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Is the kid doing well? Is she okay with the containment protocols?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Yes, very fortunately. We used to go out once a month, but now she's contained in a room without any windows. But, she's not said a single complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> She's really mature.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> I'm worried that she's become premature.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> (Chuckles) How are you doing? Are nightmares haunting you yet?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> It's… (Covers her face with her hands) I'm sorry, Clef, I don't deserve it - to be a mother, to be the Korea Regional Command Administrator…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Trains of thoughts must be hitting you. I know. I've been a thrall of the same thoughts, too.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (Looks down at her teacup.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Can she handle the harsh containment protocols? Will she grow to be a good person? - And this is a personal hope of mine… (Exhales slowly) Someday… Someday, I want to lie on a bench on the beach and watch the sunset over the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> The PoI who killed 953 is also aiming for 1953-KO. It's too harsh for her, inside and outside.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> (Nods Slowly)</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (Deep Sigh.) What, what do I do?</p>
<p><em>Short silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Well, nothing much, I think.</p>
<p><em>Clef plays a note on the ukulele on his chest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clef:</strong> Be a parent.</p>

<h3 id="toc13"><span>Video Log: Message from the Dinodon's Hand</span></h3>
<p>At midnight, an unidentified sender transmitted the following video recording to Grace Choi's personal device. RAISA personnel attempted to trace the sender but could only determine that the sender was a type of .aic not registered with the Artificial Intelligence Applications Division.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Start of Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Hoya sits still in front of the table in the room.</em></p>
<p><em>She has not moved for a long time.</em></p>
<p><em>Kang Na-roo opens the door and enters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Throws the polaroid photo to Kang.) Now, explain.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Are you blind? Here, you know this place. You've been here.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Where the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Cackles) I'm a 500-year-old fox. Do you realise who you're lying to?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> I don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Bangs the table with her fist) Don't lie to me. Give me answers. Why is there a seal on this cave?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Seal's broken. It could be seen only when it's broken.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You don't even know the cave is there if it's not.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Yes, I sealed it again. In retrospect, I should have burnt all the traces of the Millenary Nine-tailed Fox to smithereens.</p>
<p><em>Hoya bounces off the chair and punches Kang in the face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Yes. Now I understand everything: why I couldn't find this place. You wanted to hide something from me.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Wiping blood from the nose) Nope, I thought you were too obsessed with the past. Thought this might serve as a reckoning.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Still playing dumb, are you? You can't anymore when you see what I found.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> (Running into the room) I heard something…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Out.</p>
<p><em>Kang signals Hwi-yŏng with his eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>Hwi-yŏng is frustrated, hesitating.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Hwi-yŏng. (Looking at Hwi-yŏng.)</p>
<p><em>Hwi-yŏng exits the room, still looking at Na-roo's eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Hoya, please, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> As if I can! So, now, what do you see?</p>
<p><em>Hoya pulls out a small pile of bones from a sack.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Frowning) Human bones. Infant.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya</strong> AN Infant. Now, it's time for some maths. How many litters did the Millenary Nine-tailed Fox have in that old book, Elder Jŏn's chronicles?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> One. (Pointing at the bones.) Two. (Pointing at herself). Where's the other one?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> …</p>
<p><em>Hoya draws out a revolver from her pocket.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Where's the whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> That's fucking enough!</p>
<p><em>Hoya stops.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Never heard you swear before.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> I'm fucking sick of this! A chairwoman of a branch refuses to make one line of communication with her members and starts a murder spree of anomalous instances. How can't we not be pissed off?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> That…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> What's your excuse?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Standing still.) It's for the greater good. This is my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Are you a fucking jailor? "Greater Good" my arse! Wake up, you bitch, you're a chairwoman of the Serpent's Hand!</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I must untangle the curse in my bloodline. I must fight for that.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> After all the vixens are dead, you'll be the last.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I'm prepared for that. I'm more reasonable than you might think.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Reason what you fucking did, then. Killing innocents for the greater good - how are you different from the Bookburners and Jailors?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I'm cursed from my birth.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> You've changed too much. We have our ideals. Have you forgotten why we're the Dinodon's Hand, why you're the chairwoman?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Stares into Kang's eyes and rips off the patch on her jacket) Resigned. Better?</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Now you're a PoI that threatens the Serpent's Hand's ideals. Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Oh, yes. So very much. So fucking much. More opponents to fight.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> What's left is…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Fighing.</p>
<p><em>Hoya turns around and delivers a kick to Kang.</em><br/>
<em>Kang falls backwards from the impact.</em></p>
<p><em>He groans as he gets up.</em><br/>
<em>Hoya immediately reaches out and scratches Kang's chest with his fingernails.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Clenching teeth) So this is how it is.</p>
<p><em>Kang's chest and mouth bleed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Where's your lucky charm?<br/>
F<br/>
<em>Hoya slams Kang down on the floor.</em><br/>
<em>Kang groans, rolling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> (Enters the room, screaming.) What in the world… what… how…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Looks at Hoya.) Look what you did, you idiot.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> … Huh.</p>
<p><em>Hoya shakes the blood off her hands and exits the room, pushing Hwi-yŏng in the way.</em><br/>
<em>Morrígan, standing out the door, removes her gaze from the phone and looks at Hoya.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> I gotta stop the bleeding…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> (Coughs up blood) Morrígan, are you not gonna stop her marching into her own demise?</p>
<p><strong>Morrígan:</strong> (Looks at Kang and then Hoya.) If it's her choice, no.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> You psychopath…</p>
<p><em>Morrígan leaves.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yeong:</strong> Calm down. You're bleeding too much…</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> More than that… Bradán? When did the recording start?</p>
<p><strong>Bradán.as:</strong> As you commanded, everything has been recorded from where it matters.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Send the video to Grace. Tell her Hoya will visit her soon.</p>
<p><strong>Bradán.aic:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> You need rest.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Sigh… I hope the kid is fine…</p>
<p><strong>Hwi-yŏng:</strong> She has her blood. I'm sure she'll fight well.</p>
<p><strong>Kang Na-roo:</strong> Fight… Yes, she'll fight…</p>

<em>The two bash into each other with a thud.</em></p>
<p><strong>Security personnel 1:</strong> Bastard… (Reaches towards his walkie-talkie.)</p>
<p><em>Hoya shoots her pistol.</em><br/>
<em>The bullet penetrates both the personnel's abdomen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Well, that's one bullet saved.</p>
<p><em>The two slowly collapse in the middle of the dimly lit corridor.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Security clearance 4. Security clearance 4.</p>
<p><em>A humanoid figure slowly emerges from one side of the hallway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> SCP-1953-KO. SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<p><em>The sound of walking with boots echoes through the corridor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Does she have a name? What kind of dull and meaningless life did she live within the containment chamber walls?</p>
<p><em>Hoya rotates the revolver's cylinder. Clicks can be heard at regular intervals.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> She's lived in a bubble and never clashed with anyone. Will she know the hardship of life?</p>
<p><em>Hoya reaches the end of the hallway.</em><br/>
<em>The partition wall stands before her. With big letters on the wall, it reads SCP-1953-KO, Security Clearance 4, under which is a cognitohazard warning sign.</em></p>
<p><em>The terminal for the security card strobes with orange light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Should I just shoot her as soon as I get in? Nothing she says will be worthless.</p>
<p><em>Hoya pulls out a bottle of Coke and stares into it for a long time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Gives a deep breath and presses the card on the terminal.)</p>
<p><em>The partition wall slowly opens with a roar.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[CCTV-1953-02: Inside 1953-KO's containment chamber]</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO is reading a book sitting on a plastic chair.</em></p>
<p><em>Across her are stacks of books and small dolls neatly organised.</em><br/>
<em>On the outside wall hangs several replacement prosthetic legs prepared when the previous leg was worn, eye patches, and crisply ironed pieces of clothing.</em></p>
<p><em>The containment chamber rumbles as the outer door opens.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Hmm? Mr. Containment Officer?</p>
<p><em>Hoya, covered with blood, appears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> … Hi.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Hello… Ma'am…</p>
<p><em>The two stare at each other for a long time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You're bigger than I thought. How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … Yes, they told me.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Yeah? What did they tell you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> That you're my sister. And you're a scary person.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Hmm, no need for introductions, then.</p>
<p><em>Hoya slowly enters the chamber. Her footsteps leave traces of blood on the white floor.</em><br/>
<em>She looks at another plastic chair and table across 1953-KO.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> May I sit?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Do you like Coke?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Coke?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Uh.. It's a sweet… sparkling drink.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> I know what Coke is. I had it before.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Oh, yeah. It's just. I'm happy to meet you.</p>
<p><em>Hoya stares at 1953-KO.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> About what?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Oh, a bit of this, a bit of that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> (Nods slowly) O…Kay.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Touching her revolver in her pocket.) Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> What is it? SCP-1953-KO?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> That's one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Is that your real name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> My real name's different. My name is Clementine.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Clementine? What a peculiar name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> I heard it's from an old song.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Oh my darling, Oh my darling, Oh my darling, Clementine…</p>
<p><em>Silence</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Are you not having the Coke?</p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO gulps down the Coke and coughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Is it good?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … Yes. It's been a while.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> … What will you do if I take away the Coke?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … Do you want the Coke?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> That's not the issue. What will you do if someone takes away something you want?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … If you want the Coke, you can have it.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Big sigh) Can't you understand? You do like Coke, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> But I took it away. (Hoya hits the Coke off the table with her fist.) Now, how do you feel?</p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO touches her necklace anxiously.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … I'm upset.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Okay, then what should you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … I don't know… If you want Coke, you could just tell me…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Bolting off the chair) Fuck, I don't want no damn coke! I just don't like you having it. Understand? Don't have the damn Coke!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Her face twitches with anger.) So? Is that it? That's all you do? Aren't you angry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Yes… I'm upset and angry. But I… I don't know. I don't know what you want.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Haha, you spent your entire life in this damn chamber. Pampered and nurtured, you get everything that you want while your mommy administrator backs you up. What a spoiled brat you are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> (Sheds tears, facing down) Don't say that…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Do you want to live like that? Why live? No, I'm dead serious. Why do you live life so meaninglessly? If I were you, I'd bang my head on that wall until I die.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Don't…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Like mom, like daughter. How can you be so pathetic?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Don't say that to my mom. (Clenches teeth.)</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Angry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Yes…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> So, what do you do when you're angry? Say it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> But…</p>
<p><em>Noise appears on the screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Yes. Yes! YES!!! Stand up! Look at me! And say it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Don't say that to my mom.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Louder!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Don't say that to my mom!!!</p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO's eyes glow red.</em></p>
<p><em>Noise fills the screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Yes! That's it! Now raise your fists! Fight with me! (Hitting her chest with her fist.)</p>
<p><em>The lights in the containment chamber flicker rapidly, and then the red emergency light turns on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Site announcement:</strong> Potent cognitohazard detected. CRV readings over 20.0. Everyone on the site should evacuate immediately.</p>
<p><em>The light sparks.</em><br/>
<em>Meaningless announcements blast from the speaker.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (With a bleeding nose) Now, you know, right? Living is fighting. Fight yourself, everything around you, and everything that pisses you off. What makes you pissed off right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> … It's you.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Now, what should you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Why are you saying anything? Are you dumb?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Now I know what you want.</p>
<p><em>everything returns to normal instantly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> No, no, no!!! You embicile!</p>
<p><em>The red light turns off, and only the dim light lights the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> But I don't want to give it to you. I don't want to fight.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Then tell me this. What are you expecting in this world?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> I don't know. There might be something that I want somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> I don't need to see to know.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> No, if you can't see it, it's not there.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (Bangs on the partition wall.) That's enough.</p>
<p><em>Grace walks in, her pistol pointed at Hoya.</em><br/>
<em>Grace is sweaty and panting.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Mom!</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Sorry I'm late, Clementine. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Nope!</p>
<p><em>Hoya tightly holds onto 1953-KO's hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> What did you say? "I don't need to see to know?"</p>
<p><em>Hoya pulls out her revolver and points it at 1953-KO.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Mom…!</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I'll show you how that ideal of yours crumbles.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1953-KO:</strong> Ahh!</p>
<p><em>Hoya shoots the pistol point blank at 1953-KO's chest.</em><br/>
<em>With a crunch, SCP-1953-KO falls down on the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Wait.</p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO slowly raises her head. She is fine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> What is this?</p>
<p><em>SCP-1953-KO looks at her necklace.</em></p>
<p><em>The ocean of the moon carved into it shines yellow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Na-roo… Na-roo, you piece of shit…</p>
<p><em>Saltwater springs from the chamber floor.</em><br/>
<em>The water slowly fills the chamber, forming a shallow ocean that's ankle-deep.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, a giant, translucent moon rises.</em><br/>
<em>The moon rises from the middle of Clementine and embraces her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Don't worry, Clementine. The moon will protect you.</p>
<p><strong>Clementine:</strong> But…</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Don't worry about me.</p>
<p><em>The moon turns completely opaque, obscuring Clementine, who is sobbing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> … And I'm sorry, Clementine.</p>
<p><em>The moon slowly rises, lighting the dark chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Looks away from the moon and slowly turns towards Grace.) Then… What's left is…</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Us alone.</p>
<p><em>Hoya slowly walks, facing away from the moon.</em></p>
<p><em>Grace releases the safety on her gun.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> If you think you're a match for me, you can't be more wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><em>The two stare at each other for a long time.</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><em>Then, Hoya rushes towards Grace.</em><br/>
<em>The ocean splashes as she runs through it.</em></p>
<p><em>Grace fires the gun.</em><br/>
<em>The bullet nearly misses Hoya's cheek.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya grabs Grace's gun by the muzzle with her hand.</em><br/>
<em>The gun shoots again, and Hoya's hand gushes with blood.</em><br/>
<em>Hoya scratches the gun with her unsheathed claws.</em><br/>
<em>The barrel of the gun falls down, disassembled.</em></p>
<p><em>Grace takes the opportunity she gets while Hoya is disarming the gun and sticks a seal on Hoya's side.</em><br/>
<em>The seal glows red, burning through Hoya's skin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Argh, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Courtesy of Prof Noe.</p>
<p><em>Grace kicks Hoya's side with the seal.</em><br/>
<em>Hoya collapses and is covered with seawater.</em><br/>
<em>The seal bubbles under the water as it keeps burning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Grunt) Huh, isn't this fun. I feel like living in a while.</p>
<p><em>Hoya scratches her side with her claws.</em><br/>
<em>The seal rips and the light wears off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You tell me instead. Why do you live?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> I've seen the emptiness in your eyes before.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Don't mess with me. Answer.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> When I had to say goodbye to my first daughter, who was only a few weeks old, I had those eyes too.</p>
<p><em>Hoya stands up, limping.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> She didn't have a name. Fit in the palm of my hand. When I buried her little body in the mountains, I lost my meaning in life. I could not find a reason to live anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Then, why didn't you die?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Don't you know?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Haha, so you live because you can't die.</p>
<p><em>Grace raises her fist.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya turns around and delivers a kick.</em><br/>
<em>Her calf lands on Grace's guarding arms.</em><br/>
<em>Grace stumbles.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya rushes to throw a punch.</em><br/>
<em>Grace barely dodges it and gives a hook.</em><br/>
<em>A punch lands on Hoya's back.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya stumbles shortly, but she soon regains position, rushes towards Grace and throws her hand on Grace's chest.</em><br/>
<em>Grace resists, holding onto Hoya's wrist.</em><br/>
<em>But, to no avail, claws dig through her skin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> But when I saw Clementine in that cave and saw her grow, I knew.</p>
<p><em>blood pours out from her chest.</em><br/>
<em>Grace groans in pain.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Why I should live… What all those people before me lived for.</p>
<p><em>Grace's groans grow into screaming.</em><br/>
<em>Grace's hand trembles. Hoya's hand is gradually pulled further from her chest.</em><br/>
<em>Hoya looks at it, frustrated.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya yanks her hand away and moves back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> You leave me with no choice. Gotta use the easy way out.</p>
<p><em>Hoya's eyes glow red.</em><br/>
<em>Grace stumbles towards Hoya and throws a punch.</em><br/>
<em>It lands straight on Hoya's face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Wiping blood from the nose.) Some grit you have.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> A castle rebuilt is a castle stronger.</p>
<p><em>Hoya pulls out the revolver from her pocket.</em><br/>
<em>As Hoya points the gun at Grace, she grabs Hoya's hand, twisting the barrel left.</em><br/>
<em>Gunshot. The bullet penetrates Grace's left leg.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> So, you asked? Why live?</p>
<p><em>The water under Grace turns red with blood.</em><br/>
<em>Grace stumbles out of sudden dizziness.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Yes, I want to hear it. Why do you live, even while being pressed under a flawed world?</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Because there's something I want to protect. And, as long as it exists, that world's worth living, even if it is flawed.</p>
<p><em>Hoya slowly approaches Grace.</em><br/>
<em>Grace kicks the salty water into Hoya's eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Agh!</p>
<p><em>Hoya stumbles and Grace kicks her right hand.</em><br/>
<em>The revolver is flung right.</em><br/>
<em>The revolver is half submerged, periodically shown and obscured by the bobbing surface.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Panting.) Give up. You lost too much blood.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (She Coughs. Blood flies out her mouth.) What have you fought for?</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Slowly shakes her head) … Well, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> You lost the purpose to fight. You fight for the sake of fighting.</p>
<p><em>Grace, limping, slowly moves to Hoya's right, following a circular path.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> No. No… Fighting… It's meaningful on its own. (Big inhale) And, if one doesn't fight… They're not worthy.</p>
<p><em>Hoya throws a punch.</em><br/>
<em>Grace doesn't dodge and gets hit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Why… Why aren't you fighting?</p>
<p><em>Grace lifts up her arm and places her palm on Hoya's face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Get your hands off me.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (Shakes head.)</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> I said off me… (Pushing away Grace's hand with her arm)</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> You… You would have made a great sister for Clementine…</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> Stop saing shit… Quick. Lift up your fists, now.</p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> (Spits blood on the floor) No.</p>
<p><em>Hoya starts frowning and then slowly crumples up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Clenching teeth) You… Kill me! Grace!!!</p>
<p><em>Hoya jumps on Grace.</em><br/>
<em>The two fall in the ocean.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya keeps punching Grace's face.</em><br/>
<em>Splashes and waves are made as she does that.</em></p>
<p><em>Moonlight sparkles on the turbulent water.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya's punching becomes slower.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> Hoya. You're too tired to fight. You've fought for five hundred years.</p>
<p><em>Grace says, her face all beaten up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> It's time to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> (Shakes head.) I must fight…</p>
<p><em>Hoya throws several powerless punches.</em></p>
<p><em>And then she stops.</em></p>
<p><em>The moon slowly sets.</em></p>
<p><em>Grace reaches out her right arm.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya looks at Grace's bloody face on top of her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> To live because you can't die…</p>
<p><em>Hoya's breath starts to shake.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoya:</strong> It's… It's a curse.</p>
<p><em>Hoya raises her fist.</em></p>
<p><em>Grace embraces Hoya with both her arms.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya stops.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoya's hands slowly drop.</em><br/>
<em>They droop down powerlessly.</em></p>
<p><em>The setting moon illuminates them by their side.</em></p>
<p><em>Tears drop out of Hoya's red eyes.</em></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1953-KO's securing operations are indefinitely suspended under Administrator Killie's direct orders. The details of the order are a special secret, classified for those outside of Site-01K personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1953-KO is the last remaining demon fox. The subject is the daughter of former Korea Regional Command Administrator Grace "Noraemine" Choi, who is currently a member of Dinodon's Hand. For these reasons, the subject retains a friendly relationship with the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-1953-KO possesses non-human physical features such as fox ears and tail, and some parts of her body have been lost due to adverse conditions after childbirth. However, she conceals these characteristics by utilising its anomalous abilities to manipulate perception.</p>
<p>Proposals were made to use the subject for Foundation diplomatic advantages, leveraging her abilities with the assistance of a group of individuals. However, this proposal was rejected by the following personnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrator Killie of the Korean Regional Command</li>
<li>Professor Noe Su-jong of the Muism Department</li>
<li>Professor Yoon Geum-sun of the Analytical Psychology Department</li>
<li>Dr. Chiika of the Anomalous Entity Cooperation Department</li>
<li>Dr. Clef, Site-17 Containment Expert</li>
<li>Kiara Shamlan, Ethics Committee member</li>
<li>And 42 others</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, containment procedures were established and are currently maintained with these individuals at the centre.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<h3 id="toc15"><span>History</span></h3>
<p>SCP-1953-KO was designated for a terminal research plan for the study of the psychology of anomalous entities shortly after its discovery. As part of the research, the subject was raised under the protection of Director Grace Choi and acquired social skills and values. However, a PoI showing hostility to the subject attacked her, resulting in the death of Director Grace Choi while protecting it. Consequently, overall containment duties for SCP-1953-KO were transferred to Director Killie, the newly appointed Administrator of Korean Regional Command.</p>
<p>Following this, PoI-DH-016 (known as "Kang Na-ru," a member of "Dinodon's hand"), appeared in the subject's containment chamber. PoI-DH-016 was severely injured at the time and appeared to have made a difficult journey to reach SCP-1953-KO's containment chamber. PoI-DH-016 whispered something to SCP-1953-KO, and the subject nodded in agreement, then escaped the containment chamber with PoI-DH-016. A note asking for forgiveness was left behind immediately after the escape, addressed to Director Killie and the containment staff.</p>

<p>Not long after the containment breach occurred, SCP-1953-KO reappeared during the funeral of former Director Grace. The funeral was attended by Professor Noe Su-Jong, Professor Yoon Geum-Seon, Dr. Chiika, and Dr. Alto Clef. The subject expressed gratitude and paid respects to these individuals. The funeral proceeded with SCP-1953-KO. After the ceremony concluded, SCP-1953-KO left the facility.</p>
<p>During this time, all individuals who attended the funeral escorted SCP-1953-KO.</p>
<p>As per Administrator Killie's direct orders, all information related to this funeral ceremony is protected by Security Clearance Level 4/01K.</p>

<p>「Are you sure you're ready? Do you have the camera?」<br/>
Hwi-yŏng shouted as she wore the backpack.</p>
<p>「Of course I have the camera.」<br/>
Liú Wènxī waved the camera on his neck.</p>
<p>「Straighten up, you're the new leader of the Dinodon's Hand now.」</p>
<p>In response, Kang Na-roo rubs on the not-yet-healed scar on his chest.</p>
<p>「 Where's the kid?」</p>
<p>「Clementine? Clementine! Be quick! Na-roo's gonna open the way soon.」</p>
<p>「Ah! Just a minute!」</p>
<p>Clementine's desperate voice can be heard from far away.</p>
<p>「Where and what is she doing?」</p>
<p>Clementine is running around with a large scrapbook.</p>
<p>She finds an empty spot in the bookshelves of the Wanderer's Library and pushes her scrapbook in there. She then promptly writes down the shelf number on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>「What are you doing? We're leaving soon!」</p>
<p>「Coming!」</p>
<p>Clementine runs towards the group with light footsteps.<br/>
Kang Na-roo opens the door in front of them.<br/>
Brilliant light and gusts of wind rush out the door.</p>
<p>Clementine stands in front of Hwi-yŏng.<br/>
The two talk to each other, smiling.</p>
<p>The group then walked into the door.</p>
<p>And the door closes.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the bookshelf, the ridiculously large and bumpy scrapbook sticks out among the small, straight books.</p>
<p>The scrapbook's title reads:</p>
<h4 id="toc16"><span><em>Memories with Mom</em></span></h4>
