</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4565</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Historical manuals and reference books regarding the Albigensian Crusade are to be acquired and then stored in Warehouse 14-3.</p>
<p>Existing information, online or in academia, concerning the above-mentioned event, is to be analyzed by Foundation historians and adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>All historical artifacts or items found in the southern French province of Occitanie are to be assessed for anomalous properties and contained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4565 was a 20-year anomalous military campaign that occurred from 1205 to 1225 between Vatican-assisted Crusader Knights and the Cathars of France<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The war was instigated by Pope Innocent III, whose aim was to obtain the "keys of the Kingdom of Heaven<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>" which were believed to be in the possession of the five main houses of Carcassonne.</p>
<p>The houses of Carcassonne were led by Duke Raymond V who was headquartered in the former province of Languedoc. The war concluded with the deaths of Viscount Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter V of Aragon and the destruction of South Languedoc.</p>
<p>It is theorized that SCP-4565-1 was obtained by the Knights Templar<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, however, with the group's dissolution in 1312, its current location remains unknown.</p>
<p>This campaign is especially significant due to the conception of various anomalous military organizational techniques that would be recreated by Foundation pre-cursors in later years. The most significant of these would be the concepts of efficient team-based anomaly suppression groups and the utilization of anomalies to combat or suppress other anomalies.</p>
<p>The former would later eventually develop into "<em>Rixantes Luce Sacra</em>" groups<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and the latter would later be used as historical precedence for the acceptance of the "Thaumiel" object class.</p>
<p>The purpose of SCP-4565-1 has yet to be discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: All primary and secondary source documentation and evidence regarding this SCP was obtained from the Vatican Holy Office for Secrets and Prophecies (<em>Secretorum Camerus Prophetias</em>). The veracity of all information about SCP-4565 has yet to be corroborated by any third party reference.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<blockquote>
<p>To the most friendly, the most humble count of Carcassone, Raymond V of Toulouse, son of Raymond IV, son of Aquitaine III, House of Trencavel, by the grace of God and the blessings of God onto the entire House.</p>
<p>From the follower of his holiness, the executor of God's Will, the leader of Narbonne, Archbishop Gebhart Kosmas.</p>
<p>Good tidings to you, o' friend of God. You will hereby be aware that the highest office has come to be aware of the illness that pervades the lands of Languedoc.</p>
<p>The call of heathenism and blasphemous ideology has scourged and spread through Toulouse. The benevolent, Pope Innocent the Third, has come to find a solution and as such, I advise to follow the steps that have come to you.</p>
<p>Listen 'o Count, the Council of Cardinals has learnt of many faithful items of which all shall be taken in God's name. The first of which is the Grail, which has been found in Jerusalem. The second is the Ark, which has been found in a new land to the West. And the third is the key, which has been found rumored to be in Languedoc.</p>
<p>That key, which Saint Peter held to his corpse when the sun swallowed the land and all of God's children wept, is said to with you.</p>
<p>The call of the divine is upon you, o' great sir. We fear that the key will be stolen by those pagans that plague the land, as the once-great churches lay bare. Already, the five great cathedrals have been usurped by the heretical sects.</p>
<p>We advise at once to follow his holiness's message to at once deliver the keys which will grant us passage to the highest level. Sainthood and Kingship await, once it has been delivered.</p>
<p>In hopefulness, respect, faithfulness, and God-given duty, the Bishop Aphex, Duke of Auvergne, was present and witness to the writing of this message.</p>

<p>The following information is taken from the original transcript of "<em>The Cathar Crusades: A History of Genocide and Magic</em>" by Severus Iona, 1854.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 3: Old Bonds Burn and New Relations Sprout from the Ashes</span></p>
<p>…Raymond V denied the notion that he owned the key to Heaven and accused Archbishop Kosmas of slander against his governorship.</p>
<p>The period in which this letter was sent was the height of Cathar conversion in southern France and simultaneously occurred while the tensions rose between the Church and local leadership. By this point, five provinces had already been mostly converted.</p>
<p>Due to the anti-priesthood tenet of the sect, the area was in direct opposition with the Catholic Church. In 1201, the archbishop of Milan listed Catharism as an "enemy of Catholicism" and this was used as an excuse for the incoming Crusade.</p>
<p>In 1203, plans for the Albigensian Crusade began when various barons of southern France called for independence from King Phillip II. At the same time, Raymond V married Beatrice Alba, the granddaughter of King Peter V of Aragon, to secure a military alliance in time for the oncoming conflict.</p>
<p>Plans were established by the Catholic Church to utilize various occult technology stolen from Constantinople and Jerusalem during the Fourth Crusade which ended five years prior in 1202. In 1204, the Council of Cardinals announced the start of the Crusade and called for volunteers from Northern France.</p>
<p>Due to the rather low amount of initial Crusaders, Pope Innocent III permitted the use of psyche-altering machinations that persuaded more individuals to join the conflict…</p>

<p>It is believed that Cathars used thaumaturgic magic to revive beheaded prisoners of war and force them to fight. The exact amount of dead soldiers used is unknown but it is estimated to be about 1,000-5,000.</p>
<p>Records of these anomalous entities date to 1212 when they were first used in the Siege of Carcassone. It is generally thought that they were quite ineffective in battle.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 12: The End and Its Consequences</span></p>
<p>During the siege of Toulouse in 1228, Viscount Raymond VI obtained the key from its storage place in Lastour. Later, when the siege ended, a massive blast engulfed Toulouse and many other neighboring cities.</p>
<p>The true cause of the blast is unknown, but it is theorized that it was caused by the magician Jeronium Malgerious, the acting Archbishop of Catalonia.</p>
<p>After the full defeat of Raymond VI and Peter V, the French King Phillip II occupied the region. The Catholic Church oversaw the rebuilding effort, especially of the city of Toulouse, in which they assigned the Knights Templar.</p>
