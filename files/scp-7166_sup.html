            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7166</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Reports regarding survivors of lightning strikes are to be investigated, and said survivors monitored for any anomalous activity. In the event an individual survives multiple strikes within their lifetime, they are to be questioned, in order to ascertain any similarities between instances.</p>
<p>If any underlying cause for SCP-7166 is discovered, research into possible methods of neutralization is to be prioritized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7166 is a phenomenon affecting individuals who are struck by lightning. This phenomenon does not appear to affect all victims of lightning strikes, but SCP-7166 has been found to occur at higher frequencies if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The individual is struck by lightning, but survives,</li>
<li>The individual retains higher brain functions,</li>
<li>The individual resumes everyday activities after recovering from the lightning strike (e.g. work, leisure, family, etc.), and</li>
<li>These activities place the individual outdoors.</li>
</ul>
Individuals who meet these criteria, designated SCP-7166-1, will become significantly more likely to experience lightning strikes. This effect appears to be cumulative with repeated strikes, as individuals who survive more than two strikes become far more likely to experience a third strike, and so on. This effect will only demanifest following either SCP-7166-1's cessation of outdoor activities, loss of higher brain functions, or death.<br/>

<p><em>Talked with one of the other researchers, name's Adrian. Or, Dr. Mather, rather. First person I've talked to here who seemed to actually care what I had to say. Or, at least, pretended to care. The way he talks reminds me of Jason: paints these big sweeping pictures with words, tries to get you just as excited as he is. Certainly the least intolerable person here. He talked at length about the different ducks he'd seen here. I guess I pretended to care, too.</em></p>
<p><em>This storm is supposed to be a nasty one. Apparently all staff are going to be sequestered in a storm shelter on the premises. I'll either have to peel off from the crowd when they head that way, or sneak out once everyone's inside. Either way, no one can know. I don't want anybody else getting caught up in this mess.</em></p>

<strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7166-EX</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Explained</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of 17/6/2022, SCP-7166 is to be considered non-anomalous.</p>
<strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7166 was a proposed anomalous phenomenon responsible for an increased likelihood of lightning strike survivors to be struck again. SCP-7166 was hypothesized using circumstantial evidence, including records regarding Walter Summerford, Roy Sullivan, and Jason Sanderson. SCP-7166 was eventually determined to be unquantifiable, and the probability for lightning strike survivors to be struck again was determined not to have exceeded projected numbers.<br/>
