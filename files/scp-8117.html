            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8117</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8117 requires no Special Containment Procedures outside of monthly check-ins to determine if the anomaly has been neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8117 is an invisible transversal plane currently affecting Agents Kathleen Norton and Samuel Hawke. It is a solid, horizontal barrier. Although it does not exert any pressure upon the agents, neither Hawke nor Norton are capable of moving above it. Additionally, the barrier moves downwards permanently to match the lowest height reached by the top of Agent Hawke's head. Although the position of the barrier is only changed by Agent Hawke's position, Agent Norton is affected by it in the same way.</p>
<p>SCP-8117 was discovered by Agents Norton and Hawke on 09/22/24. The agents had been reassigned as temporary lab assistants as part of a mandatory psychological recovery program. They had entered the basement in search of supplies for Dr. Manson. Approximately thirty minutes later, Dr. Manson investigated the open basement door and heard the distressed voices of the agents below. Upon review, footage of Agents Norton and Hawke discovering the anomaly was found.</p>
<p><strong>Video Transcription: 09/22/24</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Agents Norton and Hawke are seen walking down into the basement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What did Manson say he needed again?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Sulfuric acid and a pair of rubber gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What does he need that for?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hell if I know.</p>
<p><em>Hawke reaches the bottom of the stairs and walks forward before stopping briefly and squinting his eyes. He reaches his arm back to rub his spine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Had to flare up now, didn't it.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What was that?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Nothing. Go look for Manson's shit.</p>
<p><em>Hawke and Norton move to separate areas of the basement. Hawke looks into the sub-basement entrance before walking towards the nearby shelves. They begin examining the dozens of stocked shelves lining the walls. Norton scans the brackets and stops suddenly, her gaze shifted upward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Found the sulfuric acid.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Good. Grab it and come help me find the gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>Hawke flinches at Norton's words. After a moment, he straightens himself and returns to his search. Norton reaches her arm up to grab the chemical, but stops mid-air. Her hand is pressed against the air, the outline of her palm flattened.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><em>Hawke's head spins around and he immediately begins approaching Norton's location.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> What is it? Did the container break?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> The air, it's—</p>
<p><em>Norton lifts her other arm up, both hands now touching the barrier above her. She moves them around, tracing it across the room. Hawke appears distressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> What the hell are you doing, Norton?</p>
<p><em>Hawke stares at her in confusion for a moment before raising his own arms. His hands stop parallel to the top of his head, reaching the same height as Norton's.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Okay, breathe in, breathe out. Remember the anomaly classification steps—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> That's only for when you're in the field. I'll just go tell Manson about it and he can send his little lemmings down here.</p>
<p><em>Hawke makes his way to the stairs and takes a step. As he does, his head hits the invisible barrier and he stumbles backwards. Norton's hands are pushed down a few inches and she recoils. Hawke walks back up to the stairs, now slightly hunched over, and presses his hands against the barrier. His arms strain as he struggles to try and shove the invisible force up. After a few minutes, he stops, his breath coming out in heaves. He turns to Norton, who still has an expression of fear on her face, and lets out a deep sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> The first step is to determine the level of danger.</p>
</div>
<p>Following the discovery of SCP-8117, Dr. Manson was assigned to it and tasked with retrieving the two agents. He performed a series of experiments for this purpose, which have been documented below.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Outcome</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hydraulic Winch</td>
<td>A harness was fitted onto Agent Hawke's back when it was confirmed that only the two agents are affected by SCP-8117<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. A winch was then attached to the harness and mounted to the floor just outside the basement. After 4 minutes, the barrier had not moved, and additional force would have caused harm to Agent Hawke. When a researcher detached the winch from Hawke's back, the agent lost his footing and stumbled, lowering the barrier further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scranton Reality Anchor</td>
<td>An SRA was brought down by Dr. Manson and placed between both agents. Ten minutes after activation, Agent Norton attempted to walk up the stairs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> but was unsuccessful. Agent Hawke looked incredulous throughout the experiment and asked Dr. Manson if he "knows what the fuck he's doing?" Agent Hawke claimed this was obviously not a reality-bending SCP and quickly became more aggressive until Dr. Manson's departure from the basement.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tunneling</td>
<td>After it was confirmed that every part of the basement was covered by the barrier, a team was sent down to drill through the walls and determine if the barrier extends beyond the basement. After reaching a spot located just outside of Site 19, Agent Norton was instructed to push upwards. Her attempt was unsuccessful. On the walk back to the basement, Agent Norton began having a panic attack. Upon returning, the site psychologist was contacted and brought to Agent Norton.</td>

</table>
<p>Upon review of footage and testimony by Dr. Manson and Dr. Caddel<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> it has been deemed appropriate to perform a psych evaluation of both agents. Due to their unique circumstances, the evaluation will have to take place with both of them present.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Log: 09/25/24</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> Good morning agents. I assume Dr. Manson informed you of this.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yep, he did.</p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> Alright, good to hear. Now, I read through both of your personnel dossiers. You have my sympathies. I imagine it's hard to lose your whole squad—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> They were soldiers. Death is always a possibility, and they knew that.</p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> I see. How have you been handling their deaths?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I've been doing just fine. Like I said, it's something we've been prepared for.</p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> You seem quite agitated in spite of that.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It's cause I've been down in this fucking hole for three fucking days. The Foundation sent in a halfwit with an SRA to fix this shit. Does it look like reality is going haywire? No, it doesn't. It's just a wall of air. It's like bringing a Geiger counter to a house fire.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> They're just doing everything they can.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Were they "doing everything they can" when they sent in an under-prepared MTF to deal with a fucking Type-Green?</p>
<p><em>There is a brief silence in the recording.</em></p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> Agent Hawke, there's no need to become aggressive. I'm here to help, and Agent Norton is only trying to calm you down.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> What if I don't wanna calm down? You asswipes, you just want to keep me complacent. Don't want me telling anyone else how much you fucked up with that mission.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Sir, it wasn't their—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Don't call me sir. I'm not your boss.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I was just trying to say that it wasn't the Foundation's fault. They didn't know it was a reality bender—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Type-Green.</p>
<p><em>Norton can be heard taking a deep, shaky breath. She sounds like she's on the verge of tears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> They didn't know it was a Type-Green. We got overwhelmed and—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Of course the new recruit's sucking up to big brother. You think they're gonna hear this and think you're an asset? Think they're gonna give you a promotion for 'loyalty'?</p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> Agent Hawke, that is enough.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hell, if the Foundation isn't to blame, then who is? Who could <em>possibly</em> be at fault?</p>
<p><em>Agent Norton can be heard crying faintly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Maybe it was the new kid messing everything up.</p>
<p><strong>Caddel:</strong> Apologies. I'm going to have to cut this meeting short. Can we get a guard down here to separate these two before Norton has another panic attack?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You sure are a good psychologist, Cad. Why dontcha bring up the death of my squad again, maybe that'll get us out of this shithole.</p>
</div>
<p>It is the opinion of the research team overseeing SCP-8117 that all attempts at rescue should cease. It is presumed that the anomaly extends far beyond the site and cannot be broken by any available means. While the research team was prepared to create a rotation of personnel to keep the agents company, Agent Hawke requested that no one be sent down. Due to the unique circumstances of SCP-8117, a raised bed was constructed for Agent Hawke so that he can rest without lowering the barrier. There will be weekly supply crates with rations and basic amenities sent to Agents Norton and Hawke. No further support will be sent.</p>
<p>For the purposes of record-keeping, all of the notable video logs regarding SCP-8117 can be found below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Video Transcription: 09/26/24</strong></p>
<p><em>Agent Norton can be seen sitting down against one of the shelves. She appears to be doing breathing exercises. Agent Hawke is pacing in another area of the basement. He falters frequently, reaching his arm back to massage his spine. He appears to be examining the walls of the basement, intermittently reaching to touch the barrier above him. He stops suddenly, looking up at one of the fluorescent lights for a moment, then walks over to Agent Norton. His foot catches in a small divot in the ground, slipping briefly before catching himself. He stands over Norton, his fingers fidgeting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hey, Norton…</p>
<p><em>Norton tenses up slightly, but continues her breathing exercises. She doesn't look at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Look, I didn't mean what I said back there. Anytime there's a suit around, it's easy for me to get stuck on something. I don't have a problem with you. Are we good?</p>
<p><em>Norton doesn't respond to Hawke. Her tension dissipates and she stops her breathing exercises. Hawke looks around the basement before turning back to Norton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Listen, I-I'm- Fuck. I'm sorry, okay? It's not your fault. You did what you were taught to, and that's the best anyone could have expected of you. It was a shitshow, and you got caught in it on your first day.</p>
<p><em>Norton looks at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Why are you so convinced the Foundation did this to us?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I don't think they did it <em>to</em> us, but they certainly let it happen without lifting a finger.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Were we missing any equipment?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No, it was more than that.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Did they not give us enough information?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No that's not—</p>
<p><em>Hawke stops speaking and takes a deep breath in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It's the Foundation's fault.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> But if—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> End of discussion.</p>
<p><em>Norton goes silent. Hawke appears agitated and rubs his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> God, Sam, what the hell are you doing.</p>
<p><em>Hawke leans up against the shelf Norton is sitting at.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I don't want to talk about dead soldiers. It doesn't do anything good for you or for me. Understand? I'm not trying to be an asshole, I'm just being logical.</p>
<p><em>Norton nods her head. She yawns and rubs her temples.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> How you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Fine, I guess. I just hope the Foundation sends someone down soon. Anytime there's a creak, I look at the stairs, but no one's there. And every time they're not there, I—</p>
<p><em>Norton chokes on her words and does her breathing exercises for a moment. Hawke waits for her to continue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I just need to know they're still trying.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> They wouldn't give up this easily. I'm sure they're crunching to figure a way outta this mess.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I hope.</p>
<p><em>Hawke rubs his forehead for a brief moment before speaking again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hey, while we're waiting for them to come up with a plan, we might as well try a few of our own.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Like what? We deal with reality threats, not… this.</p>
<p><em>Hawke walks to one of the shelves and appears to search for something.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Y'know, I used to be a Mole Rat.</p>
<p><em>Norton shifts slightly and looks over at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> A Mole Rat?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yup. Damn good one too. I once had to dig through three solid meters of coal slurry and burning tar. Some concrete and an invisible barrier? That's easy.</p>
<p><em>After a moment, Norton stands and starts looking through shelves herself. Hawke looks over his shoulder at her and seems to smile before turning back around. Eventually, Hawke pulls something from the bottom of a plastic container.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Norton, get over here. Got something that could help.</p>
<p><em>Norton returns to her seat at the wall and Hawke stands in front of her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It's an alarm.</p>
<p><em>Norton waits for Hawke to continue. When he doesn't, she speaks again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Some anomalies are generated by a collective mental effort, whether it's intentional or not don't matter. What matters is that we might've made this barrier, and if we did, we just have to knock something loose in our heads.</p>
<p><em>Hawke cranks the alarm without looking at the LED screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I don't have a clue when this'll go off, but it'll be loud as hell when it does, and that might just be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Are you sure this will work?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No. But it's a possibility.</p>
<p><em>Neither of them speaks. After a few minutes of waiting, Agent Hawke can be seen smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You ever had a drink before?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> A few times, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No, I mean a real drink. Something that'll knock your eyes out of socket.</p>
<p><em>Norton looks concerned.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Do I want that to happen?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> A 'course you do. I asked for some strong stuff in that care package they sent us. And hey, maybe it'll give us the kick we need to get out of this mess.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><em>Hawke rummages around in a large crate in the center of the basement. He removes cans of food and water bottles before finally grabbing a bottle of Tito's vodka.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> This stuff's even cheaper than Smirnoff. You want some?</p>
<p><em>Norton can be seen smiling hesitantly. She starts to stand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><em>As Hawke begins walking over to Norton, the alarm goes off. He jolts and almost drops the bottle of vodka. Both of them appear startled. Hawke reaches his arm up towards the ceiling, but is cut short by the barrier.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Well, that's one thing checked off the list.</p>
<p><em>As he begins walking again, his foot gets caught in the divot in the ground. He trips, then loses his balance. He lands on his hands and knees and the bottle of Tito's breaks as it hits the ground. Glass shards shoot across the floor and stab into his flesh. His legs give out and force him into a prone position, only a few inches above the floor. Agent Norton cries out in surprise just before her body folds forward, her head pushed into her lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Fuck! Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><em>Norton's eyes can be seen darting around. She tries to lift herself up, but the barrier keeps her down. Her shoulder muscles can be seen straining against it. The spilled vodka starts to soak into Hawke's clothes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Norton? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I-I can't move… I'm stuck like this.</p>
<p><em>Norton begins panicking. She tries to perform her breathing exercises. They are ineffective.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hey, hey! Listen to me. Don't think about any of this. Just listen to my voice. You're fine. Everything will be fine.</p>
<p><em>Norton continues to hyperventilate. Hawke reaches an arm forward and touches her hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I'm here, you can feel me. You're not stuck. I can tell you what to do, but you're going to have to listen closely.</p>
<p><em>Norton is still panicking, but she nods her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Okay. Now, move your head forward, get it out of your lap.</p>
<p><em>Norton does as Hawke instructs her to do. Her eyes are closed tightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Now, unfold your legs out of the criss-cross position.</p>
<p><em>Norton struggles briefly, but manages to get herself unstuck. She is now lying on her stomach perpendicular to Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Alright, now just crawl to the sub-basement stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Oh god. We're never getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yes we will. You're just panicking. You'll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> But you just keep telling me that the Foundation fucks everything up. Do you really think we can leave? Or am I just going to die down here?</p>
<p><em>Norton begins crying. Hawke starts to crawl forward slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Listen to me, Norton. The Foundation won't screw this up. The Foundation didn't- the Foundation didn't fuck up the mission. They <em>will</em> save us. Trust me.</p>
<p><em>Norton opens her eyes. She rubs away the tears and takes a deep breath in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Now, make your way over to the sub-basement.</p>
<p><em>Norton slowly makes her away across the floor towards the stairs. She accidentally cuts her hand on a glass shard and curses under her breath before moving around the debris. She reaches the stairwell and crawls down until she can stand again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I'm down here now. Can you make it?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p><em>Hawke's chin scrapes along the floor, the rough concrete scratching against his skin. His vodka-soaked clothes chafe against him with every movement. Blood drips from his knees and elbows periodically. He crawls in a plank position, presumably to prevent the barrier from falling to a level that would prevent him from moving entirely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> God, my back…</p>
<p><em>Hawke can be seen stopping for a moment, trying to catch his breath. He continues a moment later, his movements strained.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Norton, get over here and be ready to pull me through.</p>
<p><em>Hawke finally reaches the stairwell, his body shaking from the effort. He puts his arm out for Norton to grab. She takes hold and wrenches him out of the basement and onto the stairs. The barrier falls a little lower, but they both have room to stand. The remainder of the footage shows the agents standing or sitting down to catch their breath.</em></p>
</div>
<p>This footage was reviewed by Dr. Manson. He immediately sent a researcher down to check on the physical and mental health of the agents. Their supply crate was carried down to the lower level soon after. Both agents were told that experiments were still being run and help was on the way. Although many members of Site Staff were against this course of action, it was taken for the sake of Agents Norton and Hawke’s mental stability.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Video Transcription: 09/27/24</strong></p>
<p><em>Norton is pacing back and forth in the basement while Hawke watches. Hawke's clothing is spotted with dried blood. There are glass shards scattered along the floor. Both agents appear exhausted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You should really get some sleep, Norton.</p>
<p><em>Norton stops for a moment. She stares at the floor and breathes in deeply before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You're gonna crash if you don't rest soon.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What if you fall again?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What if you fall again, but this time I can't get out. Or I get crushed in my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Listen, kid, that kind of thinking won't do you any good. Focus on what's happening now, not what might happen. If you don't, your mind'll just gnaw away at you.</p>
<p><em>Norton stops again and proceeds to sit down, leaning against the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Alright, good. Now, lets talk about ways out of here.</p>
<p><em>Hawke grabs a notepad and a pen from a nearby shelf. It appears to have been written on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> We tried praying, both of us pushing the barrier at the same time, you went down to the last sub-basement to see if there just so happened to be some magical device that could save us. None of it worked.</p>
<p><em>Norton's expression falls.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hey, don't start with that yet, I'm not finished. None of it worked, but that isn't <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What else is there to do?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> We can try a Way.</p>
<p><em>Norton looks surprised.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Those are real?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yup. You probably don't have clearance for that information, but who cares at this point.</p>
<p><em>Hawke walks over to the wall opposite Norton and turns to her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> They're not easy to make though. They demand some effort, or else they'll just fizzle out. And if you mess them up, some weird shit happens.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Are you sure it'll work?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Well, best case scenario is we get out of the bounds of the barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> And worst case is we get crushed on our way through.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No, worst case is we don't do anything at all and we rot down here until we die.</p>
<p><em>Hawke stares at Norton for a moment. She appears deep in thought.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Okay, what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>[EXTRANEOUS FOOTAGE REMOVED]</strong></p>
<p><em>Hawke and Norton are standing facing each other. Norton is holding a bundle of wires, duct tape, a map of Site 19, and pocket knife. Hawke is holding several bloody glass shards and a standard-issue MTF helmet. Hawke drops the helmet on the ground, the inner portion facing up. He takes the glass shards and crushes them in his hands. Blood drips down and into the helmet. Norton cuts the wires open, exposing the copper. She examines the map and finds the sub-basement they're in, taping one of the wires to it's position. She tapes another wire to the cafeteria. Once she's done, she spools the remaining wiring into the helmet. Norton backs away towards the nearest wall as Hawke approaches the helmet, a lighter in his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Let's hope this works.</p>
<p><em>Hawke drops the lighter into the helmet. The blood and the wiring react to the fire immediately. Arcs of electricity flow through the wires towards the map as the blood erupts upward, droplets floating in mid-air. The map is scorched save for the two spots marked by wires. The electricity returns to the helmet and stimulates the blood. It appears to be morphing and solidifying into a circular shape, but there isn't enough blood. Hawke steps forward and squeezes his hand into a fist, letting more drip out. The electricity latches onto it and travels through his hand and up his arm. He's blown back towards the wall, hitting his head and falling into a seated position against the concrete.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Sir!</p>
<p><em>Norton is pushed down to her knees. As she starts making her way towards Hawke, she accidentally disconnects the cafeteria wire. The floating blood shakes in the air as she reaches Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Sir, are you okay?</p>
<p><em>She checks him for injuries and see's blood dripping from the back of his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Please, please wake up!</p>
<p><em>The half-formed Way stops shaking. Norton begins crying and tries to awaken Agent Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> It can't happen again. I can't let it.</p>
<p><em>The floating blood solidifies in the air and light emanates from it. Norton turns towards it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What the-</p>
<p><em>The Way suddenly folds in on itself and explodes outwards in every direction. There is an inordinate amount of blood considering how much Agent Hawke expelled. Norton screams and begins hyperventilating. She performs her breathing exercises, although their effectiveness appears to be minimal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Come on, wake up. Please. I-I can't—</p>
<p><em>Agent Norton closes her eyes. She grabs onto Agent Hawke's body and begins dragging him towards the next sub-basement entrance. Hawke's body slouches and the barrier goes lower, knocking against Norton's head. Her face hits the concrete floor and she curses before spitting out a glob of blood. Norton, now crawling, pulls Hawke's body across the floor at a slow pace. She stops, exhausted, and cries again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I'm sorry, sir. I'm so sorry. I'm so tired, I—</p>
<p><em>Norton looks at Hawke's body. Her expression changed slightly. The helmet, still soaked with blood, fizzles, presumably a remnant of the destroyed Way. An apple manifests inside of it. Norton's breathing slows, although she still appears to be panicking. She continues dragging Hawke's body, her arms straining with the effort. She tries to use her legs, but her feet constantly slip on the blood-slicked floor, forcing her to pull herself forward and then tug Hawke along after her. She eventually reaches the stairwell. She slides into it and then drags his body through. She drapes him over her shoulder and walks down the stairs. The remainder of the footage consists of Agent Norton holding Agent Hawke up. When he eventually wakes up, she almost immediately falls to the ground in exhaustion.</em></p>

<p>Upon review of the previous video log, it has been decided by Site Staff that further intervention will only consist of transporting the supply crate to their current sub-level. No correspondence concerning neutralization of the anomaly was sent.</p>

<p><strong>Video Transcription: 09/28/24</strong></p>
<p><em>Hawke can be seen leaning against a wall with Norton lying down nearby, asleep. Hawke's legs are shaking, presumably from exhaustion. A few moments later, Norton wakes up. As her eyes adjust, she looks at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Thanks for saving me back there, Norton. You could've just left me, but—</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> It's okay, Hawke.</p>
<p><em>Neither speaks for a moment. Hawke's eyes close briefly, before opening suddenly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I'm sorry you can't get any rest.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It ain't your fault. Besides, I've been on watch for long missions before. It's no big deal.</p>
<p><em>Norton stretches her arms and takes a seated position.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What kind of missions?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hunting down Type-Greens. Some of 'em don't realize their own strength, so when the big military guys show up, they start running scared. So we end up chasing them across towns, once even across the whole state. Obviously we weren't the only ones, but we couldn't afford to stop anywhere, so just took turns sleeping while someone else stayed awake. It's not like it would've done much good though. Bennings snored so loud, anyone could sneak up on ya.</p>
<p><em>Norton smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I never really talked to Bennings. He seemed… closed off, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Nah it wasn't that. He was a big, strong guy, but he had some trouble with new people. Took me a month to have even one conversation with him, but after that he wouldn't shut up for the life of me.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> How long did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> About eleven years or so.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Wow. I thought most MTF's went through members quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yeah, most of 'em do. But we were good. We were really good.</p>
<p><em>There's a brief silence. Hawke is smiling and looking down at his hands as he picks at his nails. He looks up, seeing Norton listening intently, and goes on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You remember Guajardo?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> She used to be part of the Mole Rats. Well, they got sent into some hellhole and their comms went down. Whoop-de-doo, the Mole Rats died again. Who could've guessed? But <em>she</em> didn't die. She came outta there two weeks later with a broken collarbone, a few fractured ribs, and another squad-mate draped over her back.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Did she get sent to your team after that?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Hell no. I was the one she had over her shoulders. She'd saved herself and another person from a reality bender. The suits weren't gonna waste talent like that. She got her own team and they let her pick the members. I was her first option.</p>
<p><em>Hawke chuckles to himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> She got a few more, and then we were off. Lotsa people died at first, but every year those fatalities got shaved thinner and thinner, until we had the full squad. When we got stuck with Oscar, I was sure he'd get fried or spaghettified in two days, tops. But he didn't. He once shoved an SRA and a grenade into the open stomach of some egotistical god-child and blew them to bits.</p>
<p><em>Hawke's expression changes almost imperceptibly. He looks down at the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> He was a real firecracker.</p>
<p><em>His smile falters and he stops leaning against the wall. Norton becomes visibly concerned.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What's wrong? Did something happen?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It's nothing, just… There's no point in it.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> In what?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I already told you. Dead soldiers and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> But you looked so happy.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I shouldn't be.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Because they're gone. And talking about them won't change that.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> But that doesn't mean—</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You're a new recruit. I know you don't get it, but when people die, you just gotta move on.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> But you aren't moving on! You're just standing in the same place, waiting for it to stop.</p>
<p><em>Hawke shakes his head and rubs his forehead.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You just don't get it…</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Do you think it's been easy for me?</p>
<p><em>Hawke looks down at Norton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I watched them all die, Hawke. Guajardo got shredded into thousands of pieces of notebook paper. Sato got burned and liquefied by globs of oatmeal. Bennings… Bennings dragged me out of there, he saved my life. And then he got crushed by a giant apple. I saw his blood oozing from under it. I can't just <em>forget</em> about that! And neither can you.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Type-Green's are dangerous. Any soldier with their head screwed on right knows that—</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Stop calling them soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> They were your friends! Can you just admit that? They're not numbers in a stat report. They're not strangers. They're not casualties in a war. They were your <em>friends</em>!</p>
<p><em>Neither of them speaks for approximately two minutes. Norton looks at the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Just wait until it goes away. Or crushes us.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> So you're just giving up? The Foundation is still trying to help us, and you're going to ruin our chances?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> They're not coming for us, kid. You should've realized that.</p>
<p><em>They stare at each other. Norton wipes away the tears around her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> You're alive.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> And they're not.</p>
<p><em>Hawke glares at Norton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> The fuck does that have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Do you think this is what they wanted for you? For you to lie down and die? Is this what they get for their deaths?</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> It was meaningless. They weren't sacrificing themselves, they weren't trying to save anyone. They just died.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> That isn't the point.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Well then what is the point? Tell me, if you know so much.</p>
<p><em>Norton looks sympathetically at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> I don't know. But I think we both know this isn't it.</p>
<p><em>Hawke's glare relaxes into a neutral expression.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I bet it's real easy to act like that when you didn't even fucking know 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> You're right. It is.</p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You think you've seen something awful? You think seeing some stranger get burned alive is a little rough?</p>
<p><em>Hawke waits for Norton to reply. She doesn't.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You know what's rough? Seeing those awful things every time you put your shirt on in the morning. Every time you drive to work. Every time you blink.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Do you think I don't?</p>
<p><em>Hawke rubs his eyes with the palms of his hands and looks at the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You don't-</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Stop saying I don't get it! We were both there! We both saw them die!</p>
<p><em>Hawke squints his eyes and reaches back to rub his spine. He tenses, then leans against the wall. Norton's face loses its aggression.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> We can help each other, Hawke. But I can't do that if you aren't willing to. I know it's hard, and it's going to get harder, but if you don't try, it's just going to eat you alive.</p>
<p><em>Hawke slides down the wall slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> You know what's worse than getting eaten alive? Seeing their faces behind my eyelids, just staring at me. And every time I do, it hurts a little more, cause I know they won't be there when I open 'em.</p>
<p><em>Both agents stare at each other. Hawke breathes in shakily. Norton stands up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Are you just gonna let us both rot down here?</p>
<p><em>Hawke continues slowly sliding against the wall. Norton approaches him and tries to hold him up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Please. Sir, I don't wanna die down here.</p>
<p><em>Hawke's eyes are motionless. He doesn't appear to be comprehending Norton's words, or he simply doesn't care. Norton's head presses up against the barrier.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Just stand up. We can still get out of here. We can try the Way again. Something will work.</p>
<p><em>Norton's shoulder tenses against the barrier and she is forced to crane her neck. Her expression becomes more agitated. She pulls one hand back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Get up!</p>
<p><em>Norton slaps Hawke across the face. His eyes lose their glazed appearance and he falls over from the unexpected impact. Norton's body hits the ground suddenly. She curses and tries to stand, pushing against the barrier as she takes shallow breaths.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Trying will only make it worse.</p>
<p><em>Norton cries for several minutes while Hawke remains quiet. Once both are silent, Norton turns to look at Hawke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> I'm gonna get some sleep, Norton.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><em>Both of them are silent for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> When you said they weren't coming for us, did you mean that?</p>
<p><em>Hawke doesn't respond for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hawke:</strong> No. They're bringing help. Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>Norton:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
</div>
<p>On 10/01/24, a team was sent down with a new supply crate for the agents. Hawke and Norton were found lying on the ground, deceased. Cause of death determined to be blood loss and dehydration respectively.</p>
