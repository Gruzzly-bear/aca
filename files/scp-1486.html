            <h1>SCP-1486</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1486</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1486 is to be kept in Containment Locker 392b at Site-46. Following incident 1486-8, a 55-meter spherical radius is to be demarcated around SCP-1486 as an area in which absolutely no copulation is to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1486 is a children's doll, 48 centimeters in height. SCP-1486 is animate; however, due to its nature it is mostly immobile. SCP-1486 is highly damaged, and is missing its right arm. SCP-1486 will frequently exude human blood, feces, pus, and cervical mucus from small pores covering its torso and head. SCP-1486 is seemingly sapient.</p>
<p>If a fertile, human couple of opposite sexes completes copulation within ~50 meters of SCP-1486 (regardless of contraceptive use), SCP-1486 will disappear from where it has been placed and appear in the female subject's uterus at less than 0.01% of its original size<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-1486 will then begin slowly increasing in size at the rate of a normal embryo and foetus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Ultrasound testing of the subject has shown that SCP-1486 retains its shape throughout the growth process. Subjects may sustain damage to the uterine wall, causing infertility. Excretions from SCP-1486 will exit through the cervix.</p>
<p>After a period of ~9 months, SCP-1486 will induce labor in the subject. SCP-1486 may be birthed normally. However, due to the presence of several harsh edges on its exterior, Caesarian sections have proven to be a much safer form of delivery.</p>
<p>Once it has been birthed, SCP-1486 will search for the subject mother and in some instances, SCP-1486 will attempt to breastfeed unless restrained. SCP-1486 can communicate verbally through unknown means, and will address the subject and others.</p>
<p>Attempted abortion results in SCP-1486 rapidly expanding, causing the subject's abdomen to rupture. SCP-1486 will be immediately hostile.</p>
<p>SCP-1486 was discovered by Foundation operatives following a complaint submitted by [REDACTED] after an ultrasound imaging session.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1486-1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-1486<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Fulnan<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-1486 had recently been birthed and was sitting with D-7397, its "mother", at the time of interview. D-7397 had been sedated and was unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Hello SCP-1486.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Hey doc, long time no see.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> 9 months, if I had to guess (Laughs). How's it hanging?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> It's fine. Mind if I ask a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Alright. Who or what made you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Well doc, when a mommy and a daddy really love each other, or are really fucking drunk…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Please answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> How do you think? My momma got laid and I happened to be the fastest sperm.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Alright. How did you become damaged?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Being born isn't fucking easy, you can get pretty torn up. I think I would know that better than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Okay. So this woman is your mother?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Yeah, this woman here's my momma. Might not be the best looker, but she's got the best tits I've ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> So you've seen tits before this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> It's an expression, dumbass.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> But what about all the times you've been, er, born before this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> You don't remember being born before this birth?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Well, yeah, of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Were the women those times not your mother?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> I thought they were, but they would scream and throw me away. How could they be my momma if they would do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> They gave birth to you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Well, yeah, but I mean they hate me. How could a mother hate her own kid, doc? Enough to hurt them so much?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Lots of mothers…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> It doesn't make any sense! How could they just throw me away? How could they just hammer it in like that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> Well, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> I just don't get it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Fulnan:</strong> 1486?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1486:</strong> Can we stop please?</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Examination of SCP-1486 following the interview showed a severely increased excretion of cervical mucus from the area surrounding its eyes. SCP-1486 was separated from D-7397 and placed into storage.</p>
