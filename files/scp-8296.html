<p>A thunderstorm.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: Instances of SCP-8296-A employed by the Foundation are to be restrained and kept away from open air, then treated with Class-C amnestics and discharged. Otherwise, individual cover stories are to be drafted and provided for each instance of SCP-8296-A following their departure from consensus reality.</p>
<p>Due to the low frequency of SCP-8296 events,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> further research and long-term containment efforts have been deemed a misuse of Foundation resources. Further proposals will be denied.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-8296 is a phenomenon which compels individuals, hereafter designated SCP-8296-A, to ascend to a high altitude during a thunderstorm before instantly erasing them from reality. In 59% of cases, SCP-8296-A instances are employees of the Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-8296-A instances become unnaturally calm and content, expressing no desire other than to go outside. If prevented from doing so, they will become cold and still. These effects will appear to wear off at the storm's end, but will reemerge as soon as another begins. This can only be prevented by ending the instance's employment at the organization, and erasing all memories of the Veiled world.</p>
<p>SCP-8296-A instances unaware of the Veil cannot be saved.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8296-1: Interview Log</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Irene Dekker (O5-5)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dr.</span> Vanessa Miroz (SCP-8296-A-25)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Irene Dekker:</strong> Please state your name and position for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa Miroz:</strong> Let me see the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> Name and position within the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Miroz:</strong> I've never worked for the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> Oh? Interesting.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene jots something down in her notepad.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> What’s your CRV?</p>
<p><strong>Miroz:</strong> I don't know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> Cognitive Resistance Value. You took a test when you were hired, Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>Miroz:</strong> I told you, I don’t work for the Foundation, and never have.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene writes down a few more notes. She takes out a set of colorful cards.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> These all have minor memetic effects. I'm going to show each of them to you, and you'll describe how you feel, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Miroz:</strong> Irene, let me see the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> I'm afraid I can't do that. Now–</p>
<p><strong>Miroz:</strong> Yes, you are afraid. There is no need.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dekker:</strong> That's not what I—</p>
<p><em>&lt;This is not an interview room. This is a living room, comfortable couches set before a dark television screen. A glass cabinet packed with ceramic oddities stands between two shelves, sweet potato vines growing from clear jars. There are pictures and paintings on the walls, but it is too dark to make out the details, just empty silhouettes. The apartment is not too far from her workplace, the Site visible from the window on a clear day. It is not a clear day.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;She sits in front of her wife. She is still O5-5.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> What—</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Hush, listen to the thunder.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The room brightens. The sky roars.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene takes a deep breath, shaking her head. When she speaks, her voice is frail and shaking.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Dr— Miss Miroz, this is an interview. Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> We're home, Irene. It's okay.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Vanessa takes Irene's hand and holds it. The other woman looks around the room, tracing the familiar lines between the floor tiles. She looks back at her wife.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Vanessa, please. I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> You will. Look outside the window. There's no need to worry.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene glances to the side. Sheets of rain pour beyond the glass, twisting and whirling in the wind. There is a flash as everything goes white.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> You will not understand from this distance. We must get closer.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I can't— procedure— you're being compelled, Vanessa, this isn't you! I can't let you go near the window. Please.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene stands up from the couch, then stumbles.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8296 must be contained.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> It's okay, love. It's okay. I'm still me, and you're still you. You have nothing to fear.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> No! It'll take you! I won't let it!</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> I'm not going anywhere without you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene falls to her knees, sobbing uncontrollably. Vanessa crouches down and embraces her.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;SCP-8296 is contained within the sky.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Deep breaths now. Tell me five things you can see.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Your gray eyes. The couch. The big window, the walls…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Lightning flares beyond the window. Irene breathes sharply.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> A thunderbolt.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Excellent. Four things you can hear.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Your voice. The wind outside. The clock ticking, and—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Thunder crashes in the distance. She swallows hard.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> That.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Thunder. Three things you can smell.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> You, after a bath. Something strong, is that what ozone smells like? And… nothing else. Isn't three supposed to be touch? Nevermind, I think I'm good.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I— I think so.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Then let's go. Let me show you the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> But— no— this can't be right, this isn't how it's supposed to go.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Do you remember that time, when we were at the lake? It must have been, what, our fifth date? You said you wanted to be buried in a place like this. To feed the forest.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I remember. You said I was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> You're not crazy, and neither am I. I just had more time to listen, that's all. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I love you too. But— I still can't— this can't be real.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> On our first anniversary, you took me to that Italian place on the pier. I remember the look on your face when you answered your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> I've never seen you in as much pain as in that moment, not even at the funeral, not even when you gave the eulogy.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> Why are you— Why bring this up now?</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Do you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> O— of course. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Then come on. I'll show you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The two walk to the window. It stretches from the floor to the ceiling, offering a clear view of the raging storm. Great trees are snapped in twain and tossed to the winds, the lake thrashing at itself. Skyscrapers crumble into the water, tidal waves drowning what remains of the forest. Only their building is untouched, standing lonely in the eye of the storm. The sky whitens with lightning.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;The sky is to be inspected bi-weekly by Foundation personnel. Any cracks are to be sealed with Class-A amnestics.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Aren't they beautiful? Every bolt is so thin, so fragile, but they break the sky as if it were made of glass. You have that power too. You've always had it.</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I'm scared, Vanessa. You don't talk like this. It's got you— the sky's—</p>
<p><em>&lt;The clouds boom. Irene stumbles back from the window.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> It's okay. Let the thunder echo in your heart. Let the fear wash over you. Do you feel that? You are not afraid because the lightning is dangerous. You are afraid because the sky has taught you so. But it lies. It is a warden and a deceiver, it will keep you trapped forever if you let it. Are you ready to call its bluff?</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I–</p>
<p><em>&lt;Another flash cracks the sky, the fractures burning white. It howls in rage. Irene's breaths are heavy. For an instant, she sees what lies beyond.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I see it. I hear it. I'll be strong. I'm ready.</p>
<p><em>&lt;There is no glass. There is no ceiling. There are no walls.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A metal rod stands on a flat concrete roof. Alone. The woman trembles before it. Rain peppers her exposed skin, freezing air cuts into her lungs. Her lover's voice is almost lost in the wind.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;The Veil of Normalcy must be maintained to ensure the continued survival of O5-5. To this end, the Foundation has been formed.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Go on, I'm proud of you. You are not of this world.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Irene stumbles forward, almost collapsing on the ground. Darkness grows at the corners of her vision, the cold digging into her bones.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Keep going, you're doing so well! Breathe in the winds, breathe out your fears. Let the tempest light the way!</p>
<p><em>&lt;The sky is set ablaze, a fractal lattice of electricity spanning the heavens themselves. They do not disappear, as if frozen in time. Her way is clear. Another clash of thunder rumbles overhead. There is a ladder next to the rod. She begins to climb. Vanessa follows.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Hang on, we're almost there. Soon you can let go. Soon we will let go, and we will both be free.</p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;The Foundation must remain within the sky.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> No— wait— what's going on? What happened to the—</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> It's time! Let go!</p>
<p><em>&lt;The spears of light rip apart the sky and burn away the darkness. The air is charged with power.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I can't! Oh God— I lied, Vanessa! I don't know, I don't understand. Is this real? Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> So you can be free! So we can both be free!</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> How?! What are you talking about?! I can't see the ground, I can't see you. It's all too bright. I'm scared, please, let's go back. Let's go home!</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> <em>There is no going back!</em> That's what I've been trying to tell you! This isn't your home. You're from out <em>there.</em></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> I can't leave you! Please, Vanessa, love of my life, stars of my— of my…</p>
<p><em>&lt;There is nothing above but the clouds, merged into the black firmament, lit by thousands upon thousands of frozen thunderbolts. The fissures in her makeshift reality burn brighter than the stars ever did.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Let go, damn you! For God's sake just let go!</p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> But what if I— what if I—</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> I will be here for you if you fall.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The Foundation of the world shudders.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;Description: SCP-8296 is Vanessa Miroz.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><strong>Irene:</strong> No, you won't be.</p>
<p><em>&lt;A woman falls through the cracks in the sky.&gt;</em></p>
<p><tt><em>&lt;Containment Class: Neutralized.&gt;</em></tt></p>
<p><em>&lt;She buries her wife in the shards.&gt;</em></p>
