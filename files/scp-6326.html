            <h1>SCP-6326</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6326</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6326 is currently located in Zone-6326, a cordoned off area of woodland near the town of Aider, Washington. Zone-6326 is known to the public as a wildlife reserve for an endangered species of mushroom and is to be monitored by surveillance equipment and daily patrol of the perimeter. SCP-6326's habitat is to be monitored for the presence of other animals, particularly fish, deer, elk, and moose, with populations of the aforementioned animals kept at normal levels as to be natural food sources for SCP-6326.</p>
<p>Attempts by civilians of Aider to access the area are to be handled by local law enforcement. Online disinformation methods include obviously fraudulent reports of sightings, poorly edited photos claiming to depict SCP-6326, and pages debunking the existence of the anomaly. Residents of Aider are permitted to believe in the fictionalized version of SCP-6326 as a "cryptid."</p>
<p>Agent Ira Watts is currently undercover in Aider in order to gather information from residents about SCP-6326.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6326 is a hexapedal mammal that resembles a combination of a human man and a grizzly bear. Colloquially known by locals as the "Manbear," SCP-6326 is often described as having a centaur-like build, with the upper torso, front legs and head of a bear attached to the shoulders of a white male human body. SCP-6326 moves primarily by crawling on its humanoid hands and feet, but has been observed running bipedally on occasion. It displays similar behavior to non-anomalous bears, subsisting on a diet of fish, scavenged or hunted game animals, and vegetation, and hibernates during winter months. Its humanoid body differs from a non-anomalous human in the following respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>thicker epidermis with higher resistance to extreme temperatures</li>
<li>coarser body hair</li>
<li>slightly larger body proportions</li>
<li>denser bones</li>
<li>thicker and harder fingernails</li>
<li>denser muscle mass</li>
<li>various differences in sizes of internal organs</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite its possession of a partially humanoid body, SCP-6326 displays a level of intelligence no higher than non-anomalous bears. While it uses its humanoid hands for hunting and other means of survival, SCP-6326 does not appear to have the capacity to make or use tools.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">

</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-6326 regularly patrols a route considered to be the edge of its territory. Upon attempts to remove SCP-6326 from this area, SCP-6326 will vanish and reappear at a random location within the territory. It is noted that removal from the area is upsetting to SCP-6326, and upon reappearance it will become extremely aggressive. While aggravated, SCP-6326 has been observed punching and kicking objects with its humanoid limbs.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-6326 came to the attention of the Foundation after a photo of the anomaly began circulating throughout online cryptozoology forums. All occurrences of the photo were deleted, as were other pieces of credible evidence. The town of Aider, nearby SCP-6326's territory, has developed a deeply integrated local culture surrounding the anomaly, with themed businesses, clubs, public artwork and a small (but not insignificant) tourism industry. Considering the success of Foundation disinformation, very few residents or visitors of the town sincerely believe SCP-6326 exists, treating it instead as a local legend.<br/>

<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Afternoon, Ira. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Fine. Somebody made a mistake with this paperwork. I got a briefing packet for an undercover job in some backwater cryptid fanclub. I think this was supposed to go to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> SCP-6326?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Yeah, the uh, "Manbear" thing.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> No, that's for you.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> That's your next assignment. We're glad to have you back.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> This can't be my assignment. I'm way overqualified for this.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Maybe once you've had more time to heal, we can look into getting you something less slow.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Look, I can do task force work fine with one arm.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> And one eye?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Yeah! And one eye! I'm not going from Lambda-5 to this horseshit.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Come on, kid. It's not that bad.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Not that bad?! Have you seen the cover story they gave me? Who came up with this?!</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> You're going to have to do it, Ira.</p>

<p>Dr. Gaiser,</p>
<p>I am requesting an assignment transfer. I do not believe that I am an appropriate fit for this assignment. My skillset does not align with the responsibilities required of me here, and I strongly feel that this anomaly would be better served by someone with more experience with civilians.

<p>Ira,</p>
<p>Your request is denied. Due to the nature of your injury and how you acquired it, you are not cleared for advanced threat missions for at least several years. I understand your frustration, but this is the closest thing to field work I could get for you. Unless you want a desk job, you're stuck with the Manbear.</p>

<p><strong>Watts:</strong> How do you know it wasn't just a hoax? Kids going out to the woods to plant tracks and trick people?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-6326-1:</strong> Because the world is weirder than that, young Mr. Ramsey. Plenty of strange and magical things out there. If you know where to look!</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I'll take your word for it.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-6326-1:</strong> You'll learn when you're older!</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Yeah. I'm sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-6326-1:</strong> Are you going to the next meeting? I've got some real interesting stuff to show!</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> What kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-6326-1:</strong> Let's just say my granddaughter figured out how to get pictures off my camera telephone.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Did you say it was <em>inside</em> your house?</p>
<p><strong>Member A:</strong> Yes. It was eating my trash. With its little human hands.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Did it look anything like a raccoon?</p>
<p><strong>Member A:</strong> It can change its shape.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> …It can change its shape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Member B:</strong> And my psychic says that dreams can predict the future, so I pay attention and I write it all down. Last night, I had a dream that I was playing this video game, and the Manbear was there. He was in the video game. But also the video game was a game of my stepdad's house, and the Manbear was my stepdad. I haven't figured out what it means yet.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I need to interview other people at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Member B:</strong> Anyway. The most important dream I had was actually a few months back-</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Ohh my god.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Member C:</strong> And then it ran off into the woods. It was too big to be a regular bear.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> And it couldn't have been a moose?</p>
<p><strong>Member C:</strong> I dunno. Maybe. Okay, can I ask <em>you</em> a question now?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Is it about my arm?</p>
<p><strong>Member C:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Is it about my eye?</p>
<p>[Member C does not respond]</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Because no you cannot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Member D:</strong> Like, don't you ever wonder if he's ripped?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Are we still talking about the human bear hybrid monster in the woods?</p>
<p><strong>Member D:</strong> Yeah. He lives in the woods and hunts with his bare hands. Don't you think he'd be jacked?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I guess?</p>
<p><strong>Member D:</strong> And they say he's bigger than normal people.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Hoping this isn't going where I think it's going-</p>
<p><strong>Member D:</strong> What I'm saying is that I bet he's hung.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I hate it here.</p>

<strong>Log taken from a video conference between Agent Watts and Dr. Gaiser</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Nice to hear from you, Watts. Excited for that new intel, you sounded very enthusiastic over the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Oh, I'm <em>very</em> enthusiastic.</p>
<p>[Several seconds of silence]</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> What are you wearing?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> It's called merch, Gaiser. Look it up.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Why are you wearing Manbear merch?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Because I'm undercover. It's what Keaton Ramsey, documentary film student would do. I'm all in now. Number one Manbear fanboy, that's me.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Oh. I see. You're being shitty on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> What is that hat made out of?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Papier mache, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Okay. I'm ignoring all this. What did that PoI have? Anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> It's all extremely interesting, if you're a <em>real</em> fan. Did you know it was once seen flying over Aider on Christmas Eve?</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Maybe you should come back when you're feeling less childish.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm being so sincere right now. I am taking my job very seriously. Do you see my hat? Only a serious man would be wearing all this. I have traversed splinter realities and fought subdimensional monsters with my bare hands, and this is essentially the same and not at all a waste of my abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Just tell me what you found out from the old man.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> He's got really hard evidence that the Manbear was sent to earth by <em>aliens.</em> A very grainy picture on a flip phone from 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Is it credible? Is it actually aliens?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Totally. Why would I have any reason to doubt the world's leading Manbologist? See for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> This is clearly a picture of something being thrown out of a helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Yeah, I know it's a fucking helicopter!</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Watts, you better cut the attitude or I'm gonna have to write you up for insubordination.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> You wouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Gaiser:</strong> Only because I'm genuinely worried you might be having a mental break.</p>

<p>Ira,</p>
<p>Good news. I spoke with Commander Conley and he agreed not to have you fired. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that you're on thin ice. I pleaded mental instability following your injury, but that's not going to hold up forever so you had better be a MODEL of good behavior at your next position. You cannot pull something like this again.</p>
<p>That being said, I have found a new assignment for you. You'll be getting the details in a couple days. And I better not hear you complaining. Beggars can't be choosers.</p>
<p>I'm sure you want to know what we found out about that helicopter photo you found? It's pretty fascinating.</p>
