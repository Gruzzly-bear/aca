<p>A still from an episode of SCP-9093 showing a PIU agent training</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All television stations and streaming platforms within the Greater Utica Area are to be monitored by Foundation agents to limit possible veil breaking incidents. If any broadcast stations within the Greater Utica Area are found to be hosting SCP-9093, MTF Gamma-62 “Solar Flares” are to be deployed. A power outage warning should always be issued before deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9093 refers to <em>Righteous Justice</em>, a crime fiction television program that airs exclusively within the Greater Utica Area. At any time, it may manifest itself and commandeer an existing broadcasting station, after which the station will only air SCP-9093. If SCP-9093 is not removed from a commandeered broadcast station for over three hours, it will manifest on local streaming services, making removal significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>SCP-9093’s source is impossible to geolocate, and may only be removed from an attached station via targeted signal jamming of the affected station. After 3-6 hours, SCP-9093 will detach from its selected station and demanifest. Cutting power to the station has proven ineffective. If SCP-9093 has reached local streaming services, it will only demanifest after 8-16 hours of having no possible way to be viewed, so can only be removed via a targeted power outage.</p>

<p><em>The scene opens on the inside of a moving armored vehicle. Special Agent Ross and three heavily armed PIU agents are seated. The scene lingers awhile before Ross speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Alright gentlemen, I'm aware I've asked a lot of you, but if we don't stop these people our country will be destroyed from the inside. If any of us die today, it's for our country. We can’t allow these drugs to be distributed.</p>
<p><em>All of the agents nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Glad we're all on the same page.</p>
<p><em>Ross taps his earpiece.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Abrahms, give me a lay of the land.</p>
<p><strong>ABRAHMS:</strong> Everything from the fence until the building itself is open, and you should be able to use the bearcat as cover once you're out. We have no intel on the inside, but it's safe to say it'll be pretty tight so exercise caution.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Sounds tough, but we'll get this guy.</p>

<p><strong>ABRAHMS:</strong> Be careful Ross!</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> I don’t need to be careful, I live to serve and protect!</p>
<p><em>The camera switches to a ground shot outside of the vehicle as the back doors swing open, before panning towards the warehouse. Ross and the agents jump out and begin engaging multiple armed individuals by the entrance to the warehouse.</em></p>
<p><strong>AGENT HILL:</strong> Fuck, they've got machine guns!</p>
<p><strong>AGENT BURNS:</strong> Vasquez is down!</p>
<p><strong>AGENT VASQUEZ:</strong> My fuckin’ fingers man!</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Gas 'em!</p>
<p><em>The scene pivots to one of the agents who is loading a grenade launcher with a canister.</em></p>
<p><strong>AGENT BURNS:</strong> Launching gas!</p>
<p><em>The camera follows the canister in slow motion as it launches into a group of prone individuals then explodes into smoke. The camera pans to Ross behind the truck.</em></p>
<p><strong>ABRAHMS:</strong> Ross, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> We've got shots fired, but I'm pretty sure we got 'em.</p>
<p><strong>ABRAHMS:</strong> Anyone hit?</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Vasquez, but he'll live.</p>
<p><em>Ross turns his head, then the camera pans towards Agent Hill who is walking towards the group of individuals, who are now all coughing, wheezing, and vomiting.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Hill?</p>
<p><strong>AGENT HILL:</strong> You think you can just shoot my friends?</p>
<p><em>Agent Hill fires into the group until his magazine is empty. Scrolling red text with a black background saying "Agent Hill is in a heightened emotional state so he may seem abrasive but is still justified in his actions" appears and cycles through three times.</em></p>

<p><strong>MELDES:</strong> We don't want any trouble, okay? Please just let us go.</p>
<p><strong>NELSON:</strong> I can't do that until you give us the hostages!</p>

This episode of SCP-9093 is the first time the line "I/We live to protect and serve" has been used by anyone besides Special Agent Ross, illustrating its gradual metamorphosis from a character specific catchphrase to a series specific catchphrase.

It follows Officer LaMott on his first patrol, and Special Agent Ross and High Inspector Abrahms as they try to determine who killed the CFO<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>of a well known company.</p>

<p><strong>NELSON:</strong> Shit, yeah.</p>
<p><em>The lights and sirens activate as the patrol car pulls out onto the highway and then gets behind the speeding vehicle.

<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> That was easy.</p>
<p><strong>NELSON:</strong> Don’t say that; it’s bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> Oh, who's going out?</p>
<p><strong>NELSON:</strong> Both of us, for safety of course. Traffic stops can be lethal if you aren't careful.</p>

<p><strong>EOD TECH:</strong> Looks like it's mostly just clothes, but we did find some marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>NELSON:</strong> Well, you don't get 'em right every time, but at least the narcotics division has something to do, eh?</p>

The introduction of a new main character into SCP-9093 had never happened before this episode. It is unknown what caused SCP-9093 to introduce Officer LaMott, but it has been used very frequently following its introduction.
<hr/>
<p>This episode aired on October 3rd. It follows Officer LaMott as he has to kill someone for the first time, and Special Agent Ross as he attempts to track down a notorious con man.</p>

<p><em>The shot opens on a one-way mirror into an interrogation room and slowly zooms into the inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> I just don't know what I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> I've seen the bodycam footage, I know it must've been hard. Just know that there's no need to justify yourself, it's obvious that you're in the right.</p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> Really? I just feel so bad about it.</p>

The woman turns her head back to look at LaMott and slightly drops her left arm. LaMott responds by raising his gun and shooting the woman four times in the back.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> She obviously lowers her arm towards her hip, like she was going to grab a gun. You did well.</p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> Yeah — yeah! If I didn't shoot her and she had a gun, she could've killed me!</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Exactly! I was afraid you'd been scarred by what had happened. It can be hard to serve and protect, but it’s what we do.</p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> I just hope I don't get one of <em>those</em> juries.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Yeah, they don't understand what it's like, do they? They sit on their little pedestal of procedures and "the proper ways to do things" while we get killed in the streets. We're out there kicking down doors and taking down the bad guys, and they sit on their asses and pull us up on every little thing we do.</p>
<p><strong>LAMOTT:</strong> Yeah, if I'd kept on trying to warn her, like they're going to insist I should've in the trial, I wouldn't be sitting here, and more criminals would be out there.</p>
<p><strong>ROSS:</strong> Since the dissolution of the old states it’s not just the criminals on the streets we need to worry about. These days, they're calling the shots in court too, and locking up our boys, they forget which side they're on!</p>
