<p>SCP-9062 upon discovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Personnel are only permitted to make physical contact with SCP-9062 for testing purposes. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Site 9062</span> Site 9062-B has been established around SCP-9062 to prevent civilian access. Personnel caught by SCP-9062's dimensional shifts are considered lost, and no attempts are to be made to retrieve them.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9062 is a cube-like structure, hypothesised to exist in a higher dimensional plane than our own. Its standard size is 9 x 9 x 9 metres, though has been observed to shrink to as small as 2 x 2 x 2 millimetres, and expand as large as 30 x 30 x 30 metres. There is no known upper or lower limits to how much it can alter its size.</p>
<p>SCP-9062 is capable of off-ground levitation - most often suspending itself in-place in the air as it changes its size - though typically rests on the ground. The reason for this is unknown; possibly as a method of conserving energy and/or to appear more "natural" within baseline reality.</p>
<p>Almost the entire surface of SCP-9062 is covered in prongs of uniform length. When an object makes physical contact with SCP-9062, the prongs nearest to the point of contact will envelope the object, before SCP-9062 alters its size. As this happens, the object will gradually disappear; starting from the point of contact until the entirety of the object is gone. It is theorised the object is not destroyed, rather taken to the hypothesised higher dimensional plane.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9062 was discovered in the countryside of ██████ █████, Hampshire, United Kingdom on 02/04/2023 beside a public hiking trail. As there was no way of physically moving SCP-9062, Site 9062 (henceforth referred to as Site 9062-A) was established around it for containment and study purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9062-1:</strong> Noteworthy tests</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A 1 metre wooden pole.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Upon making contact with SCP-9062, the pole rapidly began to reduce in length until disappearing altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the force with which SCP-9062 engulfed the pole, the researcher handling it was lurched forward and nearly made physical contact with SCP-9062 themselves. Future tests will be carried out using remote drones to prevent the risk of accidental human contact. - Dr. Joyce.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 2</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A standard commercial basketball.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The hemisphere making contact with SCP-9062 rapidly vanished, exposing the interior of the ball. Unlike when similar balls are punctured, the ball did not deflate, and maintained its shape before disappearing entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 3</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A standard issue Foundation tracking beacon.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Beacon signalled its location up to the point where it made contact with SCP-9062, whereupon signal was lost upon the beacon disappearing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 8</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A Zeta-Class issue Foundation tracking beacon.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Same as test 3, though the beacon continued to signal its location as the point of contact with SCP-9062 instead of losing signal, despite seemingly not being physically present. This continued for the next week where signal was lost, presumably when the beacon ran out of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 20</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-5228.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject instructed to reach out their hand and touch SCP-9062. D-5228 expresses extreme distress but no apparent physical pain as they're engulfed by SCP-9062, despite the fact their bone, muscle, and connective tissue is exposed as if the arm was amputated. Brain, lungs, intestines, and other organs are subsequently exposed as SCP-9062 continues to engulf them, before subject disappears entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subject disappeared faster than all other subjects tested as of yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 9062-2:</strong> Dr. Joyce's statement on SCP-9062</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say you, a human living in the 3D world, were to discover a 2D version of Earth. It might look like a bunch of drawings on an ordinary sheet of paper came to life. Then say you wanted to interact with the 2D world, so you push an ordinary ball through the sheet. From your perspective, the ball would just move as it always does when it travels from point A to point B. From the perspective of the 2D people, however, it would appear as if a circle just appeared from nothing, grew in a manner that violates the law of conversion of mass, then began shrinking until it disappeared. This, in the simplest terms I can explain, is what SCP-9062 is; someone or something in a higher dimension than ours is pushing an object through 3D space.</p>
<p>We don't know how or why this is happening. We know that SCP-9062 has led to casualties every time an object or person has made physical contact with it, so we can only assume malice if a sentient entity is causing this. Mercifully, as long as SCP-9062 remains undisturbed, it has proved to be harmless thus far.</p>
<p>Some on my team have suggested reclassification of the object to safe on this grounds. I caution the Classification Committee against such a decision. SCP-9062 is unpredictable and dangerous. For all we know it could, as it were, get bored<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> one day and actively seek items to consume.</p>
<p><em>- Dr. Joyce, Director of Site 9062-A</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 9062-3:</strong> Containment breach</p>
<p>On 05/11/2025, after a prolonged period with no testing, SCP-9062 began to gradually shrink in size until disappearing from Site 9062-A. SCP-9062 was rediscovered on 08/11/2025, several miles away in ██████, Wiltshire. Site 9062-B was quickly established to recontain SCP-9062. Regular contact, including that of human subjects, with SCP-9062 is pending Ethics Committee approval.</p>
