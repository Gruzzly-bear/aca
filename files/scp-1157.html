            <h1>SCP-1157</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1157</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-1157 are to be kept in separate 3m x 2m x 3m quarters connected to a secure common area in Sector-07. Curfew is to be enforced at 11pm EST every evening until 6am the following morning. Security must consist of 12 armed guards trained in crowd suppression. SCP-1157-1 is to be kept in isolated quarters not connected to the main containment area.</p>
<p>All staff working directly with any instance of SCP-1157 are to maintain the highest level of information security. No mention is to be made of Foundation staff names, project information, or containment procedures within the SCP-1157 containment area. Verbal communication with SCP-1157 is to be kept to an absolute minimum unless authorized by Dr. Torres. No clothing or equipment used when interacting with SCP-1157 can contain any identifying information. Personnel, including members of MTF Gamma-7, are instructed to carry only digitally encrypted forms of identification when involved in containment or study of SCP-1157.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 "Pied Pipers" has been formed to track down and detain any un-contained instances of SCP-1157. Basic information, photographs, fingerprints and DNA samples from SCP-1157 have been distributed to major law enforcement organizations. Coordination with local government and other MTF units will be approved on a case by case basis. Lethal force has been authorized as a last resort.</p>
<p>During a bifurcation event, SCP-1157 personnel are to initiate Protocol-G7 before wake up call.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1157 is a Caucasian male with brown hair and blue eyes. The subject's anomalous nature was first discovered when an instance of SCP-1157, designated SCP-1157-1, surrendered to the local police in ███████, AZ, claiming to be a member of a terrorist cell. When a bifurcation event occurred while SCP-1157 was in police custody the subject was brought to the attention of the Foundation and transferred to Sector-07 for containment and study.</p>
<p>At intervals of approximately 4 weeks all instances of SCP-1157 will undergo a simultaneous bifurcation event at 3:08AM EST. While SCP-1157 sleeps each subject will split into two identical instances. The event is accompanied by a burst of light and energy which disables any recording devices. Any clothing or other items worn by SCP-1157 will be deposited on the bed underneath the subjects.</p>
<p>Protocol-G7 is to be enacted immediately after every bifurcation event. The containment area is to be flooded with a gaseous sedative. A security team equipped with gas masks must enter the containment quarters and remove one of each resulting subject pairs for euthanasia, study and disposal.</p>
<p>SCP-1157 displays a limited form of shared consciousness. While each instance exhibits their own personality and can make individual choices they also experience the surface thoughts and impulses of all other instances.</p>
<p>Based on subject interviews, at the time of SCP-1157's initial detention at least 5 bifurcation events had already occurred. During containment there have been 3 observed events. To the best estimation the current status of SCP-1157 is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 instances contained.</li>
<li>34 instances confirmed deceased.</li>
<li>45 instances euthanized during containment.</li>
<li>86 instances unaccounted for.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-1157-1/1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Torres</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following initial containment, the 2 instances of SCP-1157-1 were separated and individually questioned.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 06/18/20██ - 3:45PM EST&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> Can you explain the nature of your condition, please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1157-1:</strong> I go to sleep, and when I wake up there's one more of me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> And this has happened before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1157-1:</strong> A few times. Last week makes five. There's thirty-two of me now…No…I will not…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1157-1:</strong> Heh. They can hear us, you know, the rest. &lt;Subject smiles&gt; They're not happy with me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> You can hear them all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1157-1:</strong> Yes. A bunch of scared bullies shouting in my ear. I saw what they did. I saw what I was becoming…No…Not me. You. I made a choice! &lt;Subject shuts eyes, breathes deeply&gt; I'm sorry. There's a lot of them now. It's overwhelming sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> I can imagine. Would you like some time alone?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1157-1:</strong> &lt;Subject laughs&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Torres:</strong> Oh. Right. My apologies.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Despite being in a separate sound proof interview room, SCP-1157-1/2 was able to repeat the conversation verbatim.</p>

Utilizing intelligence gathered from SCP-1157-1 interviews, MTF Gamma-7 successfully located and detained 3 more instances of SCP-1157 before they could go into hiding. However, operations for the next several weeks turned up only empty apartments and dead ends. SCP-1157-1's usefulness has diminished rapidly as other instances are now aware of his cooperation and are providing deceptive intelligence.</p>

<strong>07/10/20██</strong><br/>
Following a second bifurcation event SCP-1157-1, now consisting of 4 separate instances, showed increasing signs of distress. An argument over SCP-1157-1's complicity in Foundation activities resulted in a physical altercation and the death of the subject advocating against cooperation. All instances of SCP-1157-1 have been put into indefinite sedation to avoid mental coercion by the growing collective.</p>

Intercepting e-mail correspondence between loose SCP-1157 allowed us to locate a safe house used by numerous subjects. MTF Gamma-7 was met with small-arms fire upon engagement, forced to terminate 2 instances, captured 7. Computers and correspondence found on the property indicate that SCP-1157 is aware that an organization is tracking them, but they have no knowledge of the Foundation itself.

Interviews with instances of SCP-1157 reveal a narcissistic personality and increasing distrust and contempt for anyone that is not SCP-1157. Subjects have also shown increasingly skillful attempts at tricking researchers into revealing sensitive information. Outside of SCP-1157-1 the subject remains uncooperative.</p>

<strong>08/29/20██</strong><br/>
Agent Thomas was lost in our latest engagement with SCP-1157, along with 2 other Gamma-7 members. The bastards have spent the last month training and stockpiling weapons. The warehouse we tracked a subject to held enough SCP-1157 to outnumber us 3-to-1, all armed. Even after capturing 16 and killing 31 there are likely even more SCP-1157 unaccounted for now than there were when we first discovered them. I'm submitting a request for at least a tripling of Gamma-7's numbers and resources. If we don't lock this down in the next month or two we're going to start seeing these guys on every street corner.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Torres - SCP-1157 Head Researcher</strong><br/>
<strong>09/22/20██</strong><br/>
The contained instances of SCP-1157 attempted a riot to break out of Sector-07 immediately following a bifurcation event. Using their increased numbers SCP-1157 assaulted the Protocol-G7 team. Reinforcements allowed security to resolve the situation, at which point Protocol-G7 was completed without further incident. Containment procedures were revised and SCP-1157 were restricted to individual quarters for one week. 5 days later each instance of SCP-1157 carved the following into the wall of their quarters: <em>"You cannot contain me. Should one escape your grasp thousands will arise within the year."</em></p>

<p><strong>O5 Memo:</strong> <em>Requests to have contained instances of SCP-1157 reduced in number denied. Our sedated instances of SCP-1157-1 continue to increase in number. If Gamma-7 can sufficiently reduce the number of militant instances we may soon have a sympathetic majority capable of converting the rest. Until that point we want SCP-1157 to believe they have the upper hand. - O5-██</em></p>
