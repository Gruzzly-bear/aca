            <h1>SCP-1482</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1482</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-178 has been built around SCP-1482, with the cover story that the Site is a retirement home for elderly individuals affected by dementia. A chain-link fence around the perimeter with CCTV monitoring is to be maintained. Any unauthorised individuals attempting to access Site-178 are to be detained, interviewed and – if they present no clear threat – released after being provided with a Class-C amnestic.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1482 is a structure resembling a residential building located in ██████, Shetland, Scotland.</p>
<p>SCP-1482 appears to be composed entirely of several-hundred objects not typically used in construction (collectively referred to as SCP-1482-1) attached together with string, rope, glue and conventional staples. These objects include: metallic objects such as knives, forks and sheet metal; wooden furniture; living, healthy and in some cases, partially vivisected specimens of <em>Bos primigenius</em> (domestic cattle), <em>Salmo salar</em> (Atlantic salmon), <em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em> (giraffe) and <em>Orcinus orca</em> (killer whale), as well as various members of the Orders Anura (frog) and Lophiiformes (angler fish). The living components of SCP-1482 have been determined to constitute under 10% (ten percent) of its parts, the rest consisting of non-living and artificial objects. These living specimens do not appear to require sustenance or excrete waste.</p>
<p>At 3 (three) known locations on SCP-1482, organs resembling human vocal cords are attached directly to an animal instance of SCP-1482-1 with staples; these vocal cords are identified as SCP-1482-2. Periodically, SCP-1482-2 will produce intelligible vocalisations in heavily slurred Scots English. The specific content of these vocalisations varies, but will typically involve one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complaints of being unable to see or hear, often with the mention that SCP-1482 can feel and smell in detail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Complaints of the interior of SCP-1482 feeling “cold”, “cald”, or in some cases, “baltic”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Requests that a non-specific listener enter SCP-1482 to warm it up, and provide company.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attempts to convince individuals who have entered SCP-1482 to stay indefinitely, make extended contact with the organic parts of SCP-1482 to confirm their presence, and protect the structure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Requests that individuals exiting SCP-1482 cease doing so. Exclamations of this nature tend to be shouted or yelled with increasing urgency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Screaming, distorted sounds of distress and assertions that if an individual who has recently exited SCP-1482 does not re-enter, "the bad men” or “madmen” are "gonnae come and have an empty<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>”.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-1482 was recovered from the custody of Group of Interest 3BA-Alpha-C (“the Chaos Insurgency”), following the group's evident attempts to manipulate SCP-1482’s anomalous properties to enable longevity and non-reliance on nutrition in humans. The organisation had largely abandoned projects involving SCP-1482 by the time the Foundation became involved.</p>
<p>Analysis of files recovered from the CI have revealed limited information regarding SCP-1482. From these documents and the testimony of witnesses, it has been determined that SCP-1482 was the former residence of █████ K███████, noted zoology enthusiast, and that the vocal apparatus of the residence at one point functioned to provide information on various animal species. Ms. K███████ has yet to be located.</p>
<p>Further investigation has revealed that, prior to the involvement of the CI, the structure consisted exclusively of animal parts.</p>
