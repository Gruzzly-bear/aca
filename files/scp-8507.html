<p><strong>Note:</strong> Excerpt of an interview with Andrea Murtaugh, one of the first riders of SCP-8507 on opening day, who was located via the use of newspaper archives and [REDACTED]. Murtaugh was interviewed under the guise of being for an episode of podcast "Strange Coaster Parables".</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Wundercoaster? <em>(laughs)</em> Now, why do you want to ask me about that decrepit old piece of shit?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I see. You people sure don't skimp out on your research, do you?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh, don't you worry about me. My mind might be foggy in a few places now, but my memories that day are still as sharp as a tack.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It started with the queue leading up to the Wundercoaster. There was a tape, played over the loudspeakers, with "Madam Wunder" - the creepy bitch - greeting everyone and getting them excited for the coaster. Standard stuff, for the day.</p>
<p>Until <em>it</em> happened.</p>
<p>Something must have fucked up when the recording was done, because suddenly the only thing myself and the dozens of other kids in line could hear was something that sounded like it came straight out of Hell itself.</p>
<p>The hiss of the tape became like the crackling of fire. I could swear I heard screaming from the loudspeakers, though it might have just been from the crowd…and myself.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sorry, it's just…I can still hear that din in my mind sometimes, even all these decades later.</p>
<p>Eventually, it stopped, and Hoag himself came up and apologized to all of us, saying that the tape must have gotten garbled. The thing was, though, even as a kid, I had a gut feeling he wasn't sincere. Like he was more worried about his perfect opening day being ruined than how terrified the kids in line were.</p>
<p>However, we all did calm down eventually, as the prospect of going on a brand new roller coaster for the first time made us forget - even for a bit - all about what was assumed to be a technical error.</p>
<p>My dad and I got lucky; we ended up in the very front of the first cart.</p>
<p>It wasn't that great, in hindsight. The seats were uncomfortable, and the bar restraint was too tight against my stomach. But I didn't care, back then, because I had the privilege of getting the best view of the coaster.</p>
<p>Too bad the Wundercoaster stalled before we even went up the first incline.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh, it only took them about twenty minutes for the operator to reset the ride. I could tell that Hoag was pissed beyond belief when we came back down. I could see him arguing heavily with another man wearing a hat, though I couldn't make out what they were saying.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the second attempt went off without a hitch, and we got free popcorn and cotton candy to make up for the mess.</p>
<p>Shame what happened to the coaster later. Especially a few years ago…</p>

<hr/>
<p>Yeah, I remember that day.</p>
<p>I was so excited to ride the coaster that I ran ahead of my mom and got onto the first seat I could.</p>
<p>It was exhil… fun. I never experienced anything like it before or s-since. The way it twisted and turned, the wind blowing against my face, how high we went up…</p>
<p>But then, I felt the bar release right as we went to drop.</p>
<p>I…I don't remember much after that.</p>
<p>I woke up in the hospital to my parents arguing with Hoag, threatening to sue him to hell and back. But the guy didn't even seem bothered by it; he almost looked bored.</p>
<p>Finally, he told them, "You can spend everythin' you have tryin' to sue me, which'll end with you penniless and payin' my lawyers' fees. Or you can shut up and accept this."</p>
<p>He then handed them something, and they quieted down.</p>
<p>I only found out later that it was a check for $100,000.</p>
<p>I heard that they claimed it was just a malfunction with the bar, but I know better.</p>
<p>I guess I should count myself lucky. At least I couldn't be there, in 2012…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Um, can you let me keep a bottle of that s-stuff you gave me? It feels nice, to be able to think clearly again…</p>

<p>Call was made at 10:15 PM by a Jane Doe from a payphone near Wunderpark. Caller was hysterical, claiming that one of their friends had been ran over at the "Wundercoaster".</p>
<p>Four officers were dispatched to Wunderpark at 10:30 PM, in order to corral witnesses and collect statements. All students corroborated Ms. Jane Doe's statements, specifically noting that the coaster seemed to run on its own, with the operator being nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Paramedics were called in order to collect the body parts of James Collins, which had fallen off of the roller coaster and onto the ground and supporting infrastructure.

<hr/>
<p>For a roller coaster that isn't as well known, the Wundercoaster at Janisse, Missouri's Wunderpark might be one of the most cursed ones I've ever heard about. It doesn't seem like a year can't go by without someone losing their wallet, getting hurt, maimed, or dying on that thing.</p>
<p>I was there yesterday, actually, when the coaster experienced yet another "malfunction". If you can call a wheel flying off and decking someone in the head a "malfunction".</p>
<p>I'm surprised that Hoag can even keep this park running afloat, with all the payouts he's had to make over the decades. I'm sure this time won't be any different.</p>
<p>You know what's a strange thing about this one, however?</p>
<p>I was standing in line for the Wundercoaster, before it all went down, and when I looked to the side, I saw a man in a brimmed hat, watching the passing trains go by with some strange intent. The only time I saw him break eye contact with them was when that wheel popped off. I could've sworn he <em>smiled</em> when it happened.</p>
<p>I don't know who it was, and he seemed to disappear into the crowd that gathered around the injured woman who'd been unfortunate enough to be in the wheel's trajectory.</p>
<p>But I had a strange feeling about him…</p>

<p>Sampling of claims surrounding SCP-8507, with Foundation commentary attached.</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>SCP-8507's incidents are caused by the vengeful spirit of Samuel Otte, taking revenge on Robert Hoag for his death. - <span style="color: red">False</span>. The Department of Spiritual Affairs examined SCP-8507's site thoroughly and could find no trace of Otte's spirit residing within the premises.</li>
<li>SCP-8507's incidents are due to the plot of land being built over a Niúachi burial ground. - <span style="color: red">False</span>. This claim hinges on an outdated and stereotypical superstition; and regardless, there is no evidence to suggest that members of the Niúachi tribe ever resided in what's now Janisse, Missouri.</li>
<li>SCP-8507's incidents have no supernatural cause at all, and are simply very unfortunate accidents. - <span style="color: red">False</span>. The chances of all of these accidents having mundane causes is unrealistically high, as determined by the Analytics Department.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Summary of the camera's conetns. Extraneous footage has been removed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;00:00:00&gt;</strong> A young man, later identified as amusement park content creator Beck Horner, records himself in closeup, making an introduction for his Youtube channel. He claims his intent to attempt to smuggle the camera onto SCP-8507 and film the experience.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:05:30&gt;</strong> Horner removes his camera from its bag, as the cart he is situated in begins to move. The next two minutes of footage are incomprehensible and blurry, but the sounds of SCP-8507 turning and passengers cheerfully vocalizing can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:07:45&gt;</strong> The train begins ascending SCP-8507's peak. Horner adjusts his camera to point upwards, showing that the entirety of SCP-8507's highest point is obscured by fog.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:08:13&gt;</strong> The train enters the fog. Cheers by Horner and the other passengers turn into noises of confusion when they don't reach SCP-8507's drop.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:08:25&gt;</strong> The fog completely obscures the camera's view.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:08:29&gt;</strong> Horner and the other passengers begin to scream.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:08:42&gt;</strong> The sound of crackling fire abruptly comes in, clipping the camera's audio.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:14:23&gt;</strong> The passengers are still screaming; audio analysis confirms that Horner's screams are the loudest.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;00:46:42&gt;</strong> One by one, the screams of the passengers cease.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;01:00:00&gt;</strong> The distorted sound of the fire almost completely overwhelms any remaining audio. A thump, presumed to be from Horner's camera, is heard.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;01:02:03&gt;</strong> The fog and the sounds of fire abruptly cease. Visuals are restored, and show Horner's camera freefalling an estimated 1100 feet in the air.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;01:05:17&gt;</strong> The camera crash lands inside of the cornfield in Chelsea, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;02:47:05&gt;</strong> Footsteps can be heard. The feet of a well-dressed man can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;02:47:50&gt;</strong> The man chuckles. The camera's battery runs out.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> During the end of the Foundation and the UIU's joint investigation, Bobbi Hoag was apprehended at her home in St. Louis, Missouri, and was brought to Site-ARCH for an interview.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The last time I saw my Grandpa, he looked like he was already on the verge of death's door. Pale, gaunt, already losing weight from the stress…it was like he was more skeleton than man.</p>
<p>My dad didn't really like talking about Grandpa, even before the worst of the incidents started happening. So seeing him in such a wreck… I almost pitied him. <em>Almost.</em></p>
<p>I tried making small talk with him, asking how he was doing, and he snapped at me, fire in his eyes. "How the fuck do you <em>think</em> I'm doin'?" he roared at me.</p>
<p>He calmed down after a few moments, resting against his headboard and glowering at me. "Did you have more to say," he grumbled. "Or did you just come in here to waste what's left of my fuckin' time?"</p>
<p>I, of course, asked him what he was talking about, and he just…stared at me. Stared at me like he was trying to look right through my body and into my soul. Finally, he just let out a sigh, and beckoned for me to come closer.</p>
<p>He told me to pull out my phone, and record what he had to say, "for posterity", he told me.</p>
<p>…I still have the recording, if you want it….</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;RECORDING BEGINS&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Hoag:</strong> —The damn thing recordin', or not?!</p>
<p><strong>Bobbi Hoag:</strong> Yes, Grandpa…</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> Good, now sit your ass down and listen!</p>
<p><em>(BH sits down, the sound of her chair creaking audible)</em></p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> I was twenty four years old, Fresh-faced, with a master's in engineerin', and havin' a dream to make a name for myself in the rollercoaster business, like that Wynne fella in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Who's—</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> <em>Shush</em>! … Anyway, I pitched my idea to as many influential people as I could find, tryin' to drum up interest for the idea for my own theme park. But I just got laughed in the face by every single person I came to. They told me things like I was "too inexperienced", "didn't have the cash", "a fool to take on the likes of Disney and Wynne…"</p>
<p>And it all got to me. Hard.</p>
<p>I was driven to drink, in the dingiest bar I could find, when <em>he</em> approached me.</p>
<p>He was a tall fella, and I couldn't see the top half of his face because of the shadow his brimmed hat gave. I could see, though, that he had a crooked nose, and an even more crooked smile.</p>
<p>He had the gall to clap me on the shoulder, and drawl out, "Why so glum, chum?"</p>
<p>Normally, I would've just slapped his hand away, but…</p>
<p><em>(Silence on the recording for 10 seconds)</em></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> …Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> …I don't know why - maybe it was just the buzz the liquor was giving me - but I felt like I could trust this man. And so I broke down, dumping my woes onto this complete stranger, who just stood there silently the whole time.</p>
<p>I looked up at him with bleary eyes, expecting him to dismiss it all.</p>
<p>But his grin only grew wider.</p>
<p>"Well, you're in luck, friend," he said. "I happen to be a man with certain…connections, and I can do much more than make your dream a reality. I can make it surpass your wildest expectations."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my ears. It sounded almost too good to be true. But I felt sobriety creep back up onto me, and I asked, "What's the catch?"</p>
<p>The man just chuckled. "Nothing you have to worry about for many, many years," he reassured me.</p>
<p>I shoulda seen that for the warning sign that it was, but I was drunker than a skunk and bein' told my dream could come true.</p>
<p>He then pulled out a checkbook, and signed a check for a million dollars right there at the bar, slidin' it towards me.</p>
<p>I only hesitated for a moment, to look at the signature - "Mr. Nick" - and then snatched it up.</p>
<p>That wasn't the only thing "Nick" gave me. Soon, I had some of the best contracters, construction workers, and advertisers from the whole state workin' around the clock to help make "Wunderpark" a reality!</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn't all smooth sailing. There was the death of Samuel Otte, but I managed to bounce back from it pretty quickly…</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the park was open, and despite a few setbacks, things were goin' swimmingly. I had a successful local amusement park, a steady supply of income, and while I didn't have the nationwide fame I'd been wanting, I still made a name for himself in the local circles!</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> The incidents?</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> …Yeah.</p>
<p>There was that kid that got concussed, then the college student, then all those people getting stuck. I would always find myself in a panic every time it happened, wonderin' if this was the "catch" that "Nick" had told me about! But I'd managed to pay my way out of the troubles that came to me.</p>
<p>And for the one time I couldn't, even with some of the best lawyers I could afford during that damned class action suit, I still managed to make my way out unscathed!</p>
<p>…I could never prove it, of course. But I had a feeling that sunuvabitch played a part in getting me off the hook!</p>
<p>…Then I had that dream…</p>
<p>…The night before <em>it</em> happened…</p>
<p>"Nick" and I were sittin' across from each other in armchairs, only a small table with cigars between the two of us.</p>
<p>"The time to pay your debt is approaching, old chum," he told me, taking one of the cigars and lighting it with just a flick of his fingers, taking a few puffs from the damned thing so smoke would blow in my face. "You best prepare yourself."</p>
<p><em>(Silence on the recording for 30 seconds)</em></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> …Grandpa? …Grand—?</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> I shoulda never trusted that fuckin' bastard. I knew, right then and there, "Nick" had been responsible for everything that'd soiled my beautiful coaster! That he'd been Jewin' me—</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> <em>(Simultaneously)</em> Grandpa, you can't say that—</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> — since day <em>goddamn</em> one! Every death, every injury, every hit to my bank account and reputation, it was all because of that bastard!</p>
<p>I don't know who, or <em>what</em>, he really is, but he'll rue the day he fucked with—!</p>
<p><em>(RH gasps)</em></p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> He's here…</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> …Grandpa… There's no one there…</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> No no no no no no, please! I didn't mean it, Nick! S-stay back… I'm beggin' you, stay away from me—!</p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Grandpa… There's—</p>
<p><strong>RH:</strong> Stop! D-don't come any closer—!</p>
<p><em>(The sounds of a body thumping against wood, the creaking of a mattress, a rattling gasp of air)</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;RECORDING ENDS&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>…My Grandpa was dead.</p>
<p>I put my hand on his arm, and jerked away immediately after.</p>
<p>It was cold as ice, like if the warmth had been completely sucked out from him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, I don't believe in no devils, or whatever my Grandpa thinks he saw before he passed, Doctor.</p>
<p>I think, personally, he was just trying to find a way to shift the blame on somebody else, even to the very end.</p>
<p>But <em>something</em> had terrified him in those final moments, and I don't want to ever find out what it was…</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Post Scriptum:</strong> Bobbi Hoag was given a class-C amnestic and released back to the public. A file on Entity of Interest-8507 "Mr. Nick" was opened shortly thereafter.</p>
