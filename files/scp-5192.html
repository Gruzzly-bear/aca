<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> CCTV and Satellite footage is to be monitored in an attempt to detect SCP-5192 instances. If an instance is detected, it is to be disarmed via a weighted mannequin being thrown through the store door. If this does not trigger SCP-5192's activation, a single D-class worker is to be deployed into the instance.</p>
<p>Footage from Addendum 001 is currently being cross-referenced against missing persons databases. For confirmed matches, forged corpses and cover stories are to be produced, with the former positioned for discovery by local law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5192 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting abandoned commercial stores globally. On occurrence, SCP-5192 will displace the current interior of the store and replace it with an empty interior, with the walls, ceiling, and flooring constructed out of an unidentified metal.</p>
<p>The storefront will also be affected. The title of the store will change, or a name placard will appear if not already present, ostensibly offering implausible products and services; examples include "FREE MANSHUN FOR U" and "WE GIV U GOLD 4 3". The title of the store will be written in the local area's predominant language, and frequently includes errors relating to syntax, spelling, and grammar.</p>
<p>Upon a person, or group of persons, entering an SCP-5192 instance, the anomaly will activate. A metal shutter will fall over the shop front, and those trapped within will be transported to an extradimensional location (Plane 5192-α). After a short duration of time, ranging between 2 and 8 minutes, the shutter will reopen autonomously, and the store's original interior will have been restored.</p>

<div class="interview">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> An instance of SCP-5192 was detected in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. A team was dispatched to investigate, including D-1891. The D-class was equipped with an ocular camera implant, and was instructed to enter the store to investigate.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>D-1891 stands before the SCP-5192 instance. The sign outside reads "ERAZ YUR DEBTS". The windows are boarded, but a sign hung on the door reads "OPEN".</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Okay, I'm heading inside now.</p>
<p><em>(D-1891 enters the store. It is abandoned, save for a wooden table at the back of the room, upon which rests a white, organic material.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The walls, ceiling, and mesh flooring are comprised of what appears to be a rusted metal. D-1891 looks down at the mesh floor they are stood upon. Only darkness can be seen below it. They look back up, and walk to the table. At closer distance, the organic material is identifiable as a mass of salted herring.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Err… hello? Is anyone there?</p>
<p><em>(Without warning, a metal shutter slams shut over the storefront, sealing off the door and windows.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Oh no.</p>
<p><em>(The entire room suddenly begins to fall downwards at speed. Approximately 5 seconds into this process, water begins to flood into the room through the floor. D-1891 attempts to avoid the liquid by climbing on top of the table. These attempts are soon thwarted, as gravity within the room inverts, sending D-1891, the table, and the water crashing onto the roof-turned-floor. The room is soon completely submerged.)</em></p>
<p><em>(D-1891 begins to struggle for breath, as the darkness above slowly grows lighter. He gasps for air, and inhales a mouthful of water, clutching at his throat.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, the crate emerges from the water, and the liquid is drained out as it is shaken from side to side. The shadow of a large, unseen entity can be seen through the mesh of the ceiling, holding the crate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Unidentified]:</strong> Let's see what we got 'ere then…</p>
<p><em>(The ceiling of the crate is revealed to be a lid, which the entity removes, revealing their form. Looming above D-1891 stands a crustacean entity resembling a gigantic Maine lobster<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, hereafter designated SCP-5192-1.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-1:</strong> Wahey, we've got a live one!</p>
<p><em>(D-1891 begins to scream. A second entity, SCP-5192-2, moves into frame. In the background of the shot, a mast and equipment visible indicate D-1891 is now located on a form of fishing boat - the sound of the ocean tide hitting the boat can be heard. Their implanted geolocator has ceased functioning.)</em></p>

<p>A specimen of <em>Homarus americanus</em>, which SCP-5192-1 and -2 resemble, being prepared for consumption, by staff in the O5 kitchen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Blimey, this one's a talker ain't it?</p>
<p><em>(As D-1891 looks up at the entities, the sky above can be seen. Despite the bright daylight, two fluorescent green moons can be seen, along with as-yet-unidentified star constellations).</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Oh please don't hurt me, I'll do whatever you want, oh Christ, please listen to me, I'll do whatever I promise, just-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-1:</strong> Ever wonder what they're sayin'?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-1:</strong> Ha! Me neither, throw it in the pile.</p>
<p><em>(5192-2 reaches into the metal crate, and picks up D-1891 with its right claw. D-1891 flails in an attempt to break free, striking the entity with its fists and feet.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Oh, we'll be having none of that mister.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-2 expands its left claw, stretching the white rubber band pulled over it. It lowers the band over D-1891's torso, and places it there, locking his arms in place.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Now, off you fuck.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-2 flings D-1891 into a container close to the centre of the boat's deck. He closes his eyes for the duration he is air bound, and lands with a wet thud, ceasing his screams. Upon opening his eyes, D-1891 discovers he is surrounded by the corpses of fourteen adult humans. Their blue faces indicate oxygen deprivation through drowning as the cause of death.)</em></p>
<p><em>(D-1891 begins to hyperventilate, before pausing as they spot another living human, sans rubber band, across the container from them. Through post-incident analysis, this individual has been identified as Luca Brambilla, from Milan, Italy. A missing persons report for Brambilla was filed the day subsequent to the incident.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Unable to stand, D-1891 scrambles over to them, pushing themselves along with their feet.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Hey, hey you, we've got to get out of here. Do you have any idea where we are?</p>
<p><em>(Brambilla stares at D-1891 with a look of shock on their face, before opening their mouth to speak:)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brambilla:</strong> [Unintelligible.]</p>
<p><em>(A series of short, high-pitched whistling noises are vocalised by Brambilla, as they retreat from D-1891.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> The hell is your problem? Come over here and untie me!</p>
<p><em>(Brambilla keeps their distance from D-1891, then goes down on their knees and begins to pray. As they do, they resume vocalising the whistling noises.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> You can't understand me either… that's great. Just great. GREAT!</p>
<p><em>(D-1891 begins to thrash, kicking their legs wildly at the container's walls. For 89 minutes, they make no further vocalisations, with the exception of sporadic laughter, and no other noteworthy events occur. The sky above can be seen moving, confirming the boat is in motion.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[LOG REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><em>(The boat comes to rest.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Right, I'll take these up the dock — see you shortly.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-2 approaches the container holding D-1891, Brambilla, and the corpses. It picks it up in its claws, and begins to ambulate across the boat. From D-1891's vantage point, the surroundings are unable to be discerned.)</em></p>
<p><em>(After 15 minutes, SCP-5192-2 stops, and engages in conversation with another, unseen entity, SCP-5192-3.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Alright Norris, how's it going?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Welcome your highness! It's so good to be graced with your company.</p>
<p><em>(Both entities are silent.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Is that a joke?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Of course it's a joke! Where the hell have you been? Lunch service started 20 minutes ago!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Easy mate, winds were against us today, sea too. Come take a look.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-3 approaches the container held by -2, and looks inside. The entity resembles an Atlantic Rock Crab.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> It makes a noise reminiscent of sighing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> If that's all you got, that's all you got. I'll take the lot.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-2:</strong> Dead ones too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Aye. Chowder's on the menu today.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-3 takes hold of the container, and carries it inside a nearby building to a room resembling a commercial kitchen.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Ingredients are 'ere! What's the orders?</p>
<p><em>(A fourth entity, SCP-5192-4, comes into view. It is similar to -1 and -2 in appearance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-4:</strong> One thermidor, one boiled.</p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Oh please, not like this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Great, you can handle them both.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-4:</strong> Err… are you sure, boss?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Question me again and you'll get the thick side of m'claw round ya head. Get to it!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-4 approaches the container, and stares at its contents. After a moment, they reach in and pick up Brambilla, before placing him down on the adjacent worktop counter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Please, no.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-4 takes a kitchen knife, handle modified to fit a crustacean claw, and makes an incision on the back of Brambilla's neck. The human emits his loudest vocalisation yet, and begins to spasm.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Christ, you've nicked it! What have I told you before, it needs to be one clean cut. Get out the way…meat'll be all tense now, 'less we're lucky.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-4:</strong> I asked if you were sure…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Quiet! Just take care of the other whilst I sort your mess.</p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> You bastards watching at the other end, it's your fault. You're the reason it's like this.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-4 returns to the container, and picks up D-1891. He does not struggle. As he is lifted up, a greater section of the establishment is exposed to D-1891's ocular camera.)</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-5192-3 can be seen removing Brambilla's spine with its pincers, butterflying the torso, and proceeding to pour a white sauce into the chest cavity. Brambilla's left leg twitches throughout.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A serving window provides a viewpoint from the kitchen to an adjacent dining room. The area is densely populated with crustacean entities. The majority appear to be eating meals comprised of human components. SCP-5192-4 arrives at a hob, where a pan of boiling water is on the heat.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1891:</strong> Oh no, no no, please no! No!</p>
<p><em>(With its spare claw, SCP-5192-4 lifts the lid off the pan.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-4:</strong> Here we go, little fella.</p>
<p><em>(The entity drops D-1891 into the boiling water. )</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[D-1891'S VOCALISATIONS REDACTED]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-4:</strong> God, I hate it when they scream.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5192-3:</strong> Oh, that's not screaming. It's just air escaping from their face holes.</p>
