<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4057</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4057 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. Interaction is prohibited for all personnel without 5/4057 clearance or higher until a countermeme is developed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4057 is a female human of French descent named Marie Williamette, the daughter of O5-7. When SCP-4057 is viewed by any living being, the subject will perceive her as being in imminent danger. The form of danger perceived varies, but is in the majority of cases an anomalous entity which seeks to harm SCP-4057. The effect is memetic, virulent and self replicating <strong>(See Incident 4057-A)</strong>. As a result, any subject that has viewed SCP-4057 will spread the memetic infection when they are viewed. SCP-4057 has requested visits from members of the O5 council. The request has been granted.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 4057-A:</strong> On 02/08/64, SCP-4057 presented itself to Site-19, surrounded by 5 civilians expressing concern for her condition. The civilians were believed to be the first instances of SCP-4057 infection. The civilians were administered Class-A amnestics and allowed to return to society. This marked the containment breach of SCP-4057. The memetic infection spread at an exponential rate, affecting approximately 100% of the world population by 1967. The meme then self replicated within infected subjects, increasing the severity of the memetic effect and leading to the (as of the time of writing) ongoing PK-Class Perceptive Breakdown Event. There currently exist 14 persons inoculated against the memetic effect, namely all 13 members of the O5 council, and SCP-4057 itself.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>To the O5 council,</p>
<p>Secure, Contain, Protect. Our three axioms I helped create decades ago, and in my selfish quest to enforce one, I have failed in carrying out all three. I believe an explanation is in order.</p>
<p>Five years ago, my husband was killed. I don't know by whom, but all I know is that he was killed as a means of getting to me. I wept for days, and poor Marie… I knew I couldn't let it happen again. I considered an MTF, too conspicuous, too invasive. I considered undercover operations, a group of people, maybe have her teacher at school replaced by an operative who could keep her safe. But then it dawned on me: memetics would be the perfect safeguard. A meme, affecting just her, that would tap into the maternal and paternal parts of the mind. The part of you that sees a child walking down the street alone and feels the need, the obligation, to ask if they're ok, to show them kindness and the way home. Who needs bodyguards when the entire world can be your shield?</p>
<p>I went to Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark and gave them a task. Save my daughter. Save my little Marie. The right price was offered, enough to sway their minds to my view, and it was finished in a matter of weeks. The coffee in one of the O5 meetings was conceptually tied with the countermeme, and you were all innoculated, plain and simple. No-one had to know. Marie was so happy, seeing every researcher and D-Class in the site being so kind to her, a small sliver of hope in a world full of incomprehensible nightmares. It went against every fiber of my being, I knew I was breaking something sacred, betraying the Foundation. I deliberated over my decision for months. I knew it had to be done however, or Marie would have been killed, or tortured, or… <em>something</em>, years ago.</p>
<p>But they made a mistake. The meme was virulent.</p>
<p>It was intended to be a single instance, that would deconstruct outside the host; that way only those near her would worry. But it started to grow inside her, and it didn't die out in the minds of those affected. They became infected, and spread the meme. We didn't realize until years later, when my darling girl was already in containment, when crowds of people who had never even heard of her started trying to break down the walls of Site 19, worried sick for a girl they never knew. But it didn't stop. It kept festering and growing inside all the infected, and the worries kept getting worse and worse, becoming more than just an abstract concept, becoming a creature, your worst nightmare that you never knew existed out to get this little girl. Now, people are dying because the hallucinations are so visceral, so <em>real</em> that their brain shuts down completely from the shock.</p>
<p>This was my selfish idea, my hubris that lead to all this. Marie is so scared, locked in a tiny windowless chamber with walls 10 meters thick, all because of me. I have no doubt I will be amnesticized after this, possibly even here and now, but I implore you: let me finish and administer the countermeme. Let me clean up my own mess. If I can't even do that, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.</p>
<p>Secure, Contain, Protect. Let me prove to you that I still can.</p>
<p>~ O5-7</p>

<p>Love makes us do the most irrational things, and -7 was so full of love, for her darling Marie, for her husband, and it clouded her judgement. We were the only two women on the council at the time, so we shared a certain… Sisterhood, I guess you might say. That was why I stood against every other council member in that final vote. I wanted her to know that she wasn't alone in loving, that we all still felt <em>something</em> despite the weight of our position, that I was still there for her. She was amnesticized and demoted to a junior researcher, and she still works here to this day. We're prohibited from talking to her, for obvious reasons, but… I still feel so, so sorry for her. I can't say I've ever known the maternal bond as a mother, but I knew it as a child, and it is the strongest bond known to man, or woman for that matter. I understand why she did the things she did; had I a daughter, I would have done the same.</p>
<p>I still see her sometimes, however. Observing from a distance, seeing the work she does, seeing Marie, now a beautiful woman working in memetics, ironically. She was amnesticized too, as was everyone else at the Foundation and the world at large, it came as part and parcel of the countermeme. But the countermeme didn't affect every species. I frequently join Marie for walks in the woods, wearing the clothes and bearing the credentials of a fellow researcher. The way the animals adore her, fuss over her, it's…</p>
<p>Regardless, I understand how painful it will be to say goodbye to your friends and family, only to have them amnesticized. It used to be that a cover story was created saying you died. Believe me, amnestics are far less painful for all involved. This is a part of our history that we can't afford to repeat. It nearly destroyed us the first time, and with the delicate balance we maintain now, it would most certainly destroy us were it to happen today. I hope your preparations go smoothly, and O5-1 through -13 will all welcome you with open arms as the new -2.</p>
<p>Secure, Contain, Protect.</p>
<p>O5-2</p>
