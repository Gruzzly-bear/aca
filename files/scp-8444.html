<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A thirty-meter interdiction zone and perimeter are to be established around the opening of SCP-8444. Exploration and experimentation requests regarding SCP-8444 are to be authorized by SCP-8444's research heads before proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8444 is the designation for a Type-III interdimensional aperture located in Minneopa State Park, MN, USA, and the Class-Green self-sustaining pocket dimension it leads to.</p>
<p>Initial expeditions have shown that the interior of SCP-8444 is capable of sustaining human life and is inhabited by other lifeforms (collectively referred to as SCP-8444-A), many of which display anomalous thaumaturgical abilities. Chemically and biologically, substances and organisms within SCP-8444 are relatively similar to that of baseline reality, barring some anatomical, chemical, and thaumaturgical differences.</p>
<p>The primary inhabitants of SCP-8444 appear to be a species of vaguely humanoid creatures (designated as a subset of SCP-8444-A). They are green in coloration and possess short, slender bodies, and distinct, high-set features. All instances are hairless, however, many members of the species possess manes of long chitinous material, extending from their backs to their feet. They appear to possess a high degree of sapience. As of writing, no contact has been established.</p>
<p>SCP-8444's portal will open once every seven days for a period of between five and ten minutes. Access to SCP-8444 at other times is believed to be impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8444-1:</strong> Expedition</p>
<p>On 2027/09/01, Head Researchers Adam Kline and Willow Aguirre entered SCP-8444 on a multi-day expedition to investigate the topology of the dimension and the lifeforms inhabiting the anomaly. The SCP-8444 research team declined the use of a Mobile Task Force for the operation, citing operational issues with a large team, and thus, a two person team was chosen instead. They were also tasked with performing several experiments submitted by the SCP-8444 research team and collecting various samples throughout the locale. The establishment of a temporary forward operating base in SCP-8444 was also of priority.</p>
<p>They were provided with food and provisions for seven days, clothes and tents, camping gear, and various scientific instruments necessary for conducting experiments within SCP-8444. Aguirre was also provided with a pre-trained ROSETTA.aic instance loaded onto a handheld device, capable of spontaneously learning and translating unknown languages.</p>
<p>A log of their expedition has been included below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> You know, I've been looking forward to this for a while.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Wow, really? You've <em>never</em> mentioned it once.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> <em>[Laughs.]</em> Oh, come on. You know I like this sort of stuff. <em>[Pauses.]</em> I'm surprised that you agreed to come in the first place, Willow.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> I dunno, I never thought you'd be into doing this sort of thing. At your last project, your whole team went without you.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Well, times have changed, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I'm with my friend this time.</p>
<p><em>[COMMAND speaks over the pair's walkie-talkies.]</em></p>
<p><strong>COMMAND:</strong> You're cleared for entry. Conditions look nominal. Good luck in there, you two.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE fastens the strap on her backpack.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Lets go.</p>
<p><em>[The pair steps through the aperture into SCP-8444. As they do, the camera cuts out for a brief moment, before transmitting again. A chime sounds, indicating a change in atmospheric pressure.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Within SCP-8444 is a massive purple-green forest dimly illuminated by a large, setting pink sun, casting long shadows across the horizon. Dotting the landscape are small huts constructed with sticks, purple leaves, and an unidentified white wooly substance. Smoke billows from large, circular chimneys extending out of the roofs of the huts, and a warm, orange glow emanates from each of the windows. The trees are tall and wide, and their leaves create a large canopy above the ground.]</em></p>
<p><em>[KLINE and AGUIRRE are standing in a small clearing, surrounded by rocks. Carved on each of the rocks are carvings in an unknown script. A brief rush of air flows past the pair, startling AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><em>[In the distance, a massive, winged avian creature soars beneath the canopy of leaves. It caws at the two researchers, before flying back through the leaves, towards the open sky.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> It's… beautiful. Even more beautiful in person.</p>
<p><em>[KLINE and AGUIRRE begin walking towards the huts in the distance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Do you– are you sure it's a good idea to go towards the houses? What if they, you know, <em>attack?</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> The houses?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No, the people, silly. The rovers never got close enough to find out.</p>
<p><em>[Toward the huts, small, green humanoid creatures can be seen walking around and speaking to each other. The creatures are elf-like in appearance, and visibly shorter than either AGUIRRE or KLINE. Their voices are barely audible at such a distance, and not in any currently known language. They do not seem to notice the researchers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> They’re… kinda cute. Maybe we <em>should</em> try to approach them.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Look who wants to talk to the elves now, huh? The sun's setting soon, I think we should probably look for a place to set up camp. We can investigate a bit tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE and KLINE walk towards a clearing in the distance. Once they arrive, KLINE sets up the tent and camp while AGUIRRE collects samples of the water and foliage.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Once she arrives back at the camp, KLINE sits down on a fallen log and attempts to start the stove. He tries once, but the stove does not light. He tries again, and it still does not light.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Come on–</p>
<p><em>[KLINE tries to light the stove three more times, before giving up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> <em>[Grunting.]</em> Is this thing broken? Why doesn't it light?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Maybe propane fuel doesn't work here.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Maybe. Note that down, if you could. We're gonna need fire for some of the tests OPCOM sent over. <em>[Pauses.]</em> Firewood'll work, I think. Most of this stuff is wet though, I think I'll have to go a bit deeper to find dry wood. Stay here and man the tent. I'll be back in no time.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Alright. Be safe.</p>
<p><em>[KLINE begins towards the forest, away from the clearing and the huts. AGUIRRE enters the newly erected tent and begins setting up various monitoring devices and experiments from a large case on the ground. Extraneous logs have been removed.]</em></p>
<p><em>[At around 2109 hours, AGUIRRE is startled by a loud scream coming from the direction of KLINE. She exits the tent and looks around. By now, the sun has nearly set and the forest is dark. AGUIRRE runs towards the direction of the screams.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam!? Adam!? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><em>[There is no response. Another scream is heard. AGUIRRE pulls out her walkie-talkie and radios KLINE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam, can you hear me? Over.</p>
<p><em>[She gets no response. She runs further toward the direction of the screams.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam!</p>
<p><em>[In the distance, a pair of glowing red eyes can be seen. A man's body is visible, faintly illuminated by the setting sun, calling for help. As AGUIRRE hesitantly approaches, she can see that it is KLINE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Willow! Help!</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam! I'm coming!</p>
<p><em>[The creature holding KLINE can be seen more clearly now. It is a large wolf-like entity with red fur and one large ear on the top of its head. It holds KLINE in its mouth, yet he does not bleed. It growls.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Strained, tentatively.]</em> Drop him! Now! Please!</p>
<p><em>[The creature begins to run away from AGUIRRE, letting out a loud howl as it does so. She startles and falls to the ground, before standing back up.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE runs towards the creature. However, as she does so, the topology of the landscape shifts, and she now finds herself running perpendicular to the direction of the creature. As they continue further and further from the light of the huts, she encounters more and more spatial anomalies. The creature does not seem to be affected by these.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Panting, out of breath.]</em> No, please, no. Come back!</p>
<p><em>[The creature runs off towards a mountain in the distance, away from the light, taking KLINE with it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Please, someone help! Please!</p>
<p><em>[By now, the shouting has alerted the entities from the village of the researchers' presence. A group of seven small, elf-like humanoid creatures have gathered behind AGUIRRE. One of them squeaks. As she turns to acknowledge the sound, she sees them and startles again, once more falling to the ground. She accidentally knocks one of the creatures down as she falls, and it lets out a squeal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh, god, please. I'm sorry, I don't mean to hurt you, please.</p>
<p><em>[The creatures are short, about 1.5 meters in height, with thin, slender bodies and lacking hair. Long locks of chitinous material extend down from their arms, terminating at their feet. Their faces are vaguely humanoid, with long, distinct features and large, pointed ears on the tops of their heads. A small gold orb floats above each of their heads, providing light. They look down at AGUIRRE. They look up towards the creature in the distance. They begin speaking animately to each other.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a moment, AGUIRRE tentatively stands up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I— what do I… whatever. Screw protocol. Please. Do you know where they went? Can you– can you please help?</p>
<p><em>[The entities immediately fall silent. The look towards her. Six of them begin slowing skulking backward– however, one of them stays behind (designated SCP-8444-A1).]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Can you– do you understand English?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 does not respond. It stares back at AGUIRRE with a look of confusion and curiosity.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Wait, no, of course you don't. Hold, on, wait…</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE attempts to search for the ROSETTA.aic instance in her bag, before realizing that her bag was left at the camp. Instead, she begins gesturing at the entity, making slow hand motions. A look of confusion spreads across SCP-8444-A1's face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, this isn't…. Wait. Come with me. Quick.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE gestures toward the entity to begin following her as she runs back toward the base. It begins running after her. When she arrives, she begins digging through her backpack and finds the ROSETTA.aic instance. She powers it on and begins speaking.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Can you hear me? Can you understand? Hello?</p>
<p><em>[The device begins translating. SCP-8444-A1 looks up in surprise, before nodding incessantly. It begins to chirp at the device in understanding.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Hello? Yes, yes. I do. You are not one of us. Who are you? What are you? What are you here for?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh my god. It worked. I'm a human– that doesn't matter. Please. We have to find my friend. Please, help me find my friend.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Who?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> My friend. Adam. He looks like me, but… <em>different</em>.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 looks up at AGUIRRE with confusion.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> "Friend"? I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You don't– I guess that doesn't translate well. A fellow human. Someone who looks like me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> The one being taken by the Rufus?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> The <em>what</em>? What— whatever. Yes! Please help me find him!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I do not expect that they will see kindly to a rescue attempt.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Please, I need to. I need him back.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You must understand that they are dangerous creatures. Why do you want to save another from an inevitable fate? They will take you as well. They have taken more and more each time.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I– I don't care. He’s my friend. I have to find him, and I can't go alone. I don't know where to go, I don't know how to find him. You must know. Please, help me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It will be dangerous. I have never been to the far lands. Xar is not a forgiving place.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> But you <em>know</em>. You know how to get there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have… seen it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> So why won't you help me?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have never journeyed with another before. Any mistake will likely mean death.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Please, just try. Trust me. I'll let you work on your own if you want. It'll be like I'm not even there.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> So what do you say? Will you help me?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Alright. Provided you give one favor in return.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You seem to be an individual of very much means and cunning. You are able to speak the language of the Baba without being taught, you have constructed a shelter without the use of the trees. Please, I ask you this.</p>
<p><em>[A faint yell can be heard in the background. AGUIRRE looks up but SCP-8444-A1 does not.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Help protect this town and this land from the beasts. Figure out a way to remove them– to keep them out.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yes. I– of course. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Good. Is that a deal?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><em>[The two shake hands. SCP-8444-A1's small, slender hands are easily dwarfed by AGUIRRE's.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How do you suppose we, you know, find him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> There is a castle over in the far regions of Xar where the Rufus take their victims. We will need to go up there to rescue him. But we must wait for the next sunrise. It is not safe to go in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay. I'll wait here until morning. Can I find you back at the village, or–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Here? It is far too dark here. You will be taken just like the other one.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Where do I go, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You may… stay with me, in my hut, since you are going to help deal with the Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I– okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Please do not thank me, kind traveler. What do you call yourself?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Willow. Willow Aguirre.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> A beautiful name.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Baba.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Baba. Baba. Thank you, Baba. Oh, and before I forget. Where are we, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Here? This is the land of Pira.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>[END LOG]</strong></em></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>Because the aperture connecting baseline reality and SCP-8444 had already closed, Willow Aguirre could not contact Site-39 OPCOM to request an exfil operation. Due to this, Aguirre attempted to rescue Adam Kline herself, with help from a local SCP-8444-A instance. Attached below is an excerpt from her personal logs, written that night.</p>
<div class="notation">
<hr/>
<p>It really is a beautiful house.</p>
<p>Like most things magic, it's bigger on the inside. SCP-8444-A1 let me set up my sleeping bag in the main room while it took the upstairs one. There's a warm blue fire in the corner of the house, and a little walled garden on the other side. As I write this, I'm lying down atop a straw/wool cushion in the corner of the room. At least I think it's wool. It's a lot more comfortable than it sounds.</p>
<p>Apparently, its name is Baba. Actually, all their names are Baba. It's weird. We didn't really talk much. I was absolutely exhausted, and I wasn't really comfortable talking about… anyway. We have a lot to do tomorrow.</p>
<p>I miss home.</p>
<p>Forget about all the experiments. The plan for tomorrow is relatively simple. At least it sounds that way, but I know it won't be. We travel north towards a land called Xar. We should get there the day after tomorrow if we travel swiftly. There's a castle there where the Baba keep their prisoners. From there… it's hard to tell.</p>
<p>I have to stop myself from constantly thinking about Adam. It only makes it worse. But I just can't imagine having to go back through that portal without him.</p>
<p>We'll find him. We have to.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8444-2:</strong> Rescue</p>
<p>The following morning, Aguirre and SCP-8444-A1 began their mission to rescue Adam Kline. A log has been included below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE and SCP-8444-A1 stand at the edge of the village. They are walking toward the direction of a large mountain in the distance. It is bright in the daylight– they are surrounded by thick, colorful foliage, while strange bird-like creatures vocalize from the sky.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you, again. For your help. I know this isn't exactly orthodox, but…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Do not mention it. We have a deal, remember?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Right. Yeah. Everything here is so… new.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> That reminds me. Where are you from, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I guess I can't talk about the Fou– the people I work with, but I guess I can talk about where <em>I'm</em> from. I– us humans, are from Earth. I live in a home, kind of like your hut, but with other people.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> There are others in your home?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> My mom. My wife Lily.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Wife?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. Like someone you love and choose to spend your life with.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> “Love”?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Don’t tell me you don’t know what that means either. <em>[Pauses.]</em> Besides, why are you asking me all this anyway?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Just… curious.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, fine. I’m sorry. It’s just— this is all weird and new to me and I’m just worried for my friend and everything here is just so… different. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> And I’ve never been one for adventures.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I don’t know… alright, fine. When I was a kid, there was a forest behind our house. One day, I went out with my dad <em>on an adventure</em> to go look for berries. There was a gorge, and he fell down into a river that day. Never learned to swim. We got him out, but… he couldn't walk for weeks. I've always hated heights. That's why I hate adventures. It's like… a death wish.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> How did you remember all that? From your childhood?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Don't know. I haven't been here long. Well… not long enough to forget, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Was it scary?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. But afterwards, it was mostly… sad</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I feel like… as if I am sorry for your sadness.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. Thank you. That's very kind.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE and SCP-8444 are hiking up the side of the mountain, with visible difficulty. The two suns shine directly overhead.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Let me ask you something. Who is this person you care so much to rescue?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I guess I never told you. They're my friend.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Perhaps that did not translate well. Who are they? What makes you care so much to rescue them?</p>
<p><em>[Silence. AGUIRRE sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I met him on a project a couple years back— your “rotations”, I guess, and he was my supervisor. That was my first project and it was… absolutely brutal. That was right when my dog died, too— a dog is an animal is humans keep for company. He found me crying in the break room one day and he helped me through it. He taught me how to be… okay and not okay. We've been friends ever since. That’s why he matters to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Is that what a friend means?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> That is… it makes me feel warm inside. I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I think I get it, yeah.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. The pair continue up the mountain. Extraneous logs removed.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 and AGUIRRE have passed the summit of the mountain, and now continue down the northern face. Their pace is much quicker, and AGUIRRE hikes down with difficulty as her backpack weighs her down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Careful.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thanks, I–</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE slips. Her backpack pulls her towards the left as her body slips toward the right. Her right leg strikes a rock and her head falls to the ground. She screams as her right arm bends backward and is crushed under the weight of her backpack.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Oh– Willow! Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Jesus– it… <em>[Deep breaths.]</em> God– it hurts so goddamn–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Here. Put it down. Careful.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 gingerly sets AGUIRRE's arm down on the ground. She closes her eyes in visible pain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Do not move your arm. Quick. I can set it. This should help with the pain.</p>
<p><em>[Beads of sweat drip down AGUIRRE's face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Wait– no! What are you– what are you about to do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Just a quick spell. You won't even feel it happen.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No, I can't–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Do you want to heal or not?</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE breathes deeply.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 places its hands above AGUIRRE's right arm. It closes its eyes. After a moment, bright sparks begin to glow around her arm. AGUIRRE looks over in apprehension before the sparks disappear and SCP-8444-A1 opens its eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Keep your arm still, for a while. Wrap some gauze around it.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE reaches into her backpack with her left arm, before wincing in pain and retracting it. SCP-8444-A1 enters AGUIRRE's backpack and pulls out a large roll of gauze. It begins to wrap it around AGUIRRE's right arm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Better. Thank you. I remember when my mom used to sit with me like this when I was sick.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Your mom?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. She– I don't remember much, but I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> What were they like?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Kind. Loving. Can't have asked for anyone better. I miss her.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> That word you used again. “Loving.” What does it mean, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How do I explain this? It’s a word that… have you ever been so strongly infatuated with something before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Perhaps. But never with another.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hmm. Aren’t you lonely, all by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What makes you get up every morning?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> …Usually hunger.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Laughs.]</em> No, seriously.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I— I’m not sure. I… I have myself. I have my garden. I have my house.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have magic. I have memories. <em>[Pauses.]</em> My mother taught me how to string memories when I was very young.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> A form of magic. I can string them into books and etch them into stones. I have a collection of memories and stories from when I was small. I have that to keep me company.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That's… that's very nice.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I'm not sure I like this, SCP– Baba.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> It's… scary. I've never done anything like this before. This is so… so exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I thought you wanted to rescue your… “friend”.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What if he's dead already? What if they take us, too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> But what if they are still alive? What if they were waiting for you?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How do you know, though?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You cannot know. But we can hope.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How– how?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have memories still strung from my childhood. In my first rotation, my mother did not think I would make it here. Not many Baba do. I would not grow. I could not walk.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE looks up toward SCP-8444-A1.]</em>/</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> But my mother kept feeding me. She kept me warm. And in my third cycle, I grew. I made it. I still have that memory hanging from my ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> One never knows. One foot in front of another, I suppose. One breath after the next. Just keep moving. Remember your friend.</p>
<p><em>[Tentatively, AGUIRRE stands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> We're coming, Adam.</p>

<p>As nightfall approached, the pair continued towards Xar.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[The camera activates, showing a dark, thick forest. In the distance is a large, black landscape, obscuring the horizon. The pair continue to walk towards it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> So what is Xar like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Not pleasant. I have only seen glimpses, never the whole thing. I was taught from a very young age that Xar is not a very good place to be. It is said that Xar is where the Rufus take their victims.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How many people– how many Baba, I should say, have actually been to Xar?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> This rotation? None so far. I have always heard stories, though, from my mother when I was very small. Great tales of warriors entering Xar to unbind a lost child. Stories of Baba taken to Xar who are never heard from again. I heard many stories as a youth. I have not heard any since then.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Don’t you miss them? Don’t you miss your mother?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Most of what I remember of her I have stored as strings. They were good memories, but I was not taught to… miss.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Huh. You know, we humans tend to feel a lot of sadness when we leave old friends, old people. I still miss my old friends from, god knows, thirty years ago. I still sometimes miss my dad, too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Is this the "love" thing you were talking about earlier?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I guess. I suppose, yeah. It is love, in a way.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. The pair continue walking towards the landscape beyond. After a long silence, AGUIRRE speaks again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Does visiting Xar scare you, a bit?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1;</strong> Of course it does. You would be a fool not to be scared.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Then why did you agree to help me that night?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> There are things more important than fear in this world, Willow.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Like what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Easy. Bravery. <em>[Pauses.]</em> Despite all its <em>horribleness</em>, a small part of me has always wanted to see it in person, since I was child. I suppose it was my childhood speaking to you that night.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Well, I'm glad your childhood chose last night to make an appearance. Have you ever seen anyone else get taken by the Rufus?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Since I was a child.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. They continue to walk. A soft rustling sound can be heard, as AGUIRRE's clothes slide against the tall foliage.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I was thinking about your friend again. I liked that feeling. Even though it was not me experiencing it, I liked it. How do you get a friend?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Well… a friend is someone you love very much, in a different way. Remember what I was talking about earlier, about love?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Maybe. But I don't think I quite understand, yet.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hmm. Well, do you think you've experienced it before? Do you think anyone else has ever loved you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I am… I am not sure if I have. And if I had, I am not sure I would have recognized it. <em>[SCP-8444-A1 pauses to think.]</em> Perhaps my mother’s bond with me was "love", in a way.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It was… quiet. We lived together in a hut at the edge of town. It was near the end of the light's reach. We had two rooms– one we ate in, and one we slept in. It was simple. I liked it.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No, what were <em>they</em> like? Your mother.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Oh, them? They were… kind. She taught me language during the day and told me stories during the night. She made the best food I ever had. She hugged me when I was sick. It was… nice.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That sounds like love, Baba.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh yes. That sounds like love.</p>
<p><em>[A bird call is heard in the background.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Maybe it was love.</p>
<p><em>[The camera turns to show a view of the black expanse beyond. Silence.]</em></p>

<p>By nightfall, SCP-8444-A1 and Aguirre reached the approximate halfway point between the town of Pira and Xar. They set up a simple camp before preparing for the night; Aguirre eating her Foundation-issue rations and SCP-8444-A1 eating a selection of native foods brought from their home. An excerpt from Aguirre's personal logs has been included below.</p>
<div class="notation">
<hr/>
<p>Pira is quiet at night.</p>
<p>Baba and I are taking turns watching the tent. They woke me up for my shift about an hour ago– I figured now would be as good a time as any to write. We agreed that we should head to bed early tonight since we're both exhausted and we have a lot to do tomorrow. I've had no reservations about that. My arm is killing me. Baba's spell helped, but it still hurts like crazy. I'm almost out of painkillers. I don't know what I'm gonna do if it starts hurting even more. Are all expeditions always like this? I hope not.</p>
<p>Baba told me all about the castle. All about the spells that protect it. Legends they've heard. No one knows for certain– but the castle apparently holds some prejudice against Baba. Let's hope that isn't true. I don't want to have to go alone.</p>
<p>As much as this place scares me, I'm… finding myself liking it more and more. It's the sort of place that gets more beautiful the more you see it. We passed a ravine today, on the mountain. There were living rocks on the cliffsides and glowing vines hanging from the edges. It's really quite magical. You'd have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>Camping kind of sucks. I don't know how Adam did it. Every time he'd get back from a trip he'd spend the next week showering me with tales about all his adventures. I don't know how many of them were entirely true, but… they were interesting, I suppose. Many of them were funny. I appreciated it. And on the days he was gone… I think I missed him. A lot. I missed it when he'd drop by my office with a coffee and pretend to trip and then laugh with me after I realized he was just joking. And then we'd spend the next hour just talking and goofing off, and I'd always get ten items behind on work. But I guess I don't remember the hours that I worked as much as the hours with him, though.</p>
<p>I miss him. But we're getting close, I can feel it.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p>In the early morning hours of 2027/09/03, at exactly 0512 hours, Aguirre was awoken by SCP-8444-A1 to the sounds of screaming.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[The camera turns on, showing the dark interior of a tent. The camera rapidly rotates, revealing AGUIRRE; bleary-eyed, but awake. After a moment, she exits the tent, along with the camera.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Outside, the forest is completely dark; only a few nearby trees can be seen, visible from the light of a full moon in the sky. AGUIRRE clicks on a flashlight, fully revealing the exterior of the tent. In the background, SCP-8444-A1 can be heard, screaming.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Willow! Willow! Help!</p>
<p><em>[The camera swivels to show SCP-8444-A1, wielding a large stick at a red-haired wolf-like creature. The entity is slowly skulking towards SCP-8444-A1, growling and baring its teeth as it does so. Its eyes shine bright red.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh– oh my god!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE backs up slightly. She begins breathing heavily, and starts to move behind the tent.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Please! Help!</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What should I do?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Grab a weapon! And get more lights! Anything bright! My light won't last long against it!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE stands frozen in place, unresponsive.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Now!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE runs back into the tent, grabbing a large rubber tent hammer and a second flashlight. On her way out, she hesitates, before grabbing two emergency flares as well. She runs back towards SCP-8444-A1.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Willow! Shine the lights at it!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE turns on the flashlights and shines them at the creature. It groans in discomfort and backs up, rearing up as it does.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a moment, the creature roars. Now growling even louder than before, it charges towards SCP-8444-A1, eyes illuminating SCP-8444-A1's face. SCP-8444-A1 screams.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It's getting closer!</p>
<p><em>[Desperately, AGUIRRE pulls off the caps on one of the flares, wincing as she does so. She points them at the creature's face, rubbing the top of the flare as she does so.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A flash. The flare activates, shooting a jet of sparks at the creature. It rears backward, howling in agony as the bright light blinds its eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><em>[The entity turns back to glace at AGUIRRE, before running away, back into the darkness of the forest.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE turns to face SCP-8444-A1, who is lying on their back in the dirt. They turn to AGUIRRE, and smile.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You did it! You did it, Willow! You saved us! Thank you.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE is panting, out of breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> We're safe now. You did it.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE looks up at SCP-8444-A1. Sweat pours down AGUIRRE's face. She places a hand on her chest.]</em></p>

<p>At 2027/09/04, Aguirre was awoken by SCP-8444-A1. They consumed a quick breakfast and continued on their way to Xar.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE and SCP-8444-A1 are outside their tent. AGUIRRE is visibly anxious, glancing behind her shoulder every few seconds as if looking for danger. As they finish packing up the remains of their camp, they begin to walk towards Xar, visible as a dark landscape in the distance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> So what really are the Rufus, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> If not for prey, why do they do what they do? Why do they take people?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> That is a good question. The Rufus are… animal. Well– no; we are all animals, you and I. But they are savage. They are beasts. They cannot feel.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You must understand, that in Pira, us Baba have a very important connection with magic. With the arcane. The mysterious. And one of the most important and mysterious magics is that of the <em>soul</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. SCP-8444-A1 looks towards AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You see, all the living creatures in Pira possess a soul. Well, almost all of them. The soul is what gives life– it is what gives feeling. Without it, you believe that even the worst cruelties imaginable are kindness. You lose all sense of right and wrong. You become a monster.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> And… let me guess. The Rufus don't have a soul.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 nods.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> To not possess a soul is the worst abuse by nature any creature could experience. They cannot perform magic; the only magic they possess that that which has been left behind by the rest of the world. They feed on scraps.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Is that– is that why they do what they do? Is that what makes them so bad?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> The soulless are… not able to understand pain. They do not understand what they are doing. They live to… breed, to take, to <em>hunger</em>, not to feel.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> They must be able to feel… somewhat, though. Right? Otherwise, why would they do what they do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> They feel only by touch– by pain, not by emotion.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That's… sad.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> The reason the Rufus kidnap Baba is because we are the closest thing they have to a soul. They crave that existence. Without one, they can do terrible things. They want that feeling.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Why don't they have souls in the first place, then? What happened to them?</p>
<p><em>[Silence. SCP-8444-A1 looks visibly uncomfortable.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> A very long time ago– before I even existed– before my mother existed– the Rufus were not what they are now. They were normal creatures, like you and I, and they could perform magic.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What changed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Something came over them. They stole magic from the rest of the world. We went to war. And now… they are no longer the same as they were before. Neither of us are. It was a punishment of the highest degree.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You– you took away their souls?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You must understand– they took our magic. They took our livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> And you damned them to a lifetime of pain?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 looks down, towards the dirt.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> We live in perpetual battle now, after a single act of greed that occurred eons ago.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Do you forgive them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I– how?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 looks up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Let's see. If you could, would you bring them out of their misery?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I… I have never considered such a thing. I– the pain they endure must be… must be terrible.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Would you show them love? Would you let them back in?</p>
<p><em>[Tears are visible in SCP-8444-A1's eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have never shown… love before. I– don't know how.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Simple. Show that you care. Extend that kindness your mother showed you.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I would.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You have a good heart, Baba.</p>
<p><em>[The pair begin walking again. After a long silence, AGUIRRE speaks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Quietly.]</em> And there's no way to bring them back?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Not that I know of.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Well, I suppose, there is always… one way.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I have never seen it happen– in fact, no one I know will tell you about this, but there have been old legends of… intense deeds of mutual kindness giving them back a soul. Well, at least, the Rufus can share one.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Really? That works?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I do not think it is real. They are all legends. I do not know how it could even occur in nature.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> But all legends have their roots in fact, don't they?</p>
<p><em>[Silence. The pair continue to walk.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Right?</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Never let anyone or anything take away your soul, Willow. Never let them take away your ability to wonder. Never let them take away your ability to feel.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Without it, you have nothing.</p>

<p>At 2011 hours, SCP-8444-A1 and Aguirre approached the end of the tree line, marking the apparent boundary between Pira and Xar. They set up camp for a final night; an excerpt from Aguirre's personal logs has been included below.</p>
<div class="notation">
<hr/>
<p>We're at Xar now.</p>
<p>It's getting pretty dark, so we're going in the morning. I wasn't sure if the darkness was because of the time, or if it was because of where we were, but it's… unnaturally dark. My watch stopped working when we reached the border, so I'm guessing the latter. We're going to get to the castle early next morning; Baba says that's the best time to go since the Rufus will be tired.</p>
<p>Oh, and speaking of Baba. They were quiet tonight. No talking, just… silence. I hope they're doing okay. Maybe this place is starting to get to them. But I think they'll be okay. I'll be okay.</p>
<p>We have to be.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p>At 0421 hours, the pair began walking through Xar toward a large black castle in the distance. Anomalous suppression of visible light was observed throughout the region.</p>

<p><em>[Extraneous logs removed. SCP-8444-A1 and AGUIRRE are visible walking in the darkness towards a large castle in the distance, situated on a tall hill. The land is barren; the pair walk on dark black soil with small patches of white and gray. Small, decaying shrubs dot the landscape, alongside dead skeletons of vaguely humanoid origin. Glowing red-hot pockets of magma are visible in between the large, eroded rocks on the surface. In the distance, a thick black mist envelops the terrain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Are you sure it's… okay to walk here? There's lava all over the place. It's so dark.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 is silent.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Baba?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Just be careful.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, yeah. <em>[Pauses.]</em> That thing looks like a prison.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE points to the castle in the distance. SCP-8444-A1 does not respond, and instead stares out at the landscape. After a moment, AGUIRRE glaces towards SCP-8444-A1. It gazes in horror at the skeletons littering the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> C'mon. We'll be fine. They can't hurt us.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. A howl is audible in the distance. SCP-8444-A1 cowers slightly and visibly cringes.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The pair pass by a skeleton on the ground. It is vaguely humanoid, with small bits of flesh still not yet decayed, clinging to the side of the bone. Its face is still partially visible, contorted in a look of agony. A dirty, light blue towel covers a portion of their lower torso. It is embroidered with a cloud.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 bends down to take a closer look at the skeleton. After a second, its face stretches into a look of horror.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It's… they're Baba.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. SCP-8444-A1 continues to examine the skeleton. After a moment, SCP-8444-A1 exclaims in horror.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> They are all… oh my goodness. I– I knew….</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 begins to choke up and sob.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hey, hey. It's okay. What's… what's wrong? You can tell me. It's just a skeleton. It can't hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It is not that, it is just that… please, no. I don't want to see any more.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> No. I don't want to go further. Please. No more.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> We've gotten so far. We can't just– just turn back. Just tell me what's going on.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> What if we caught, Willow? What if they get us? What if we get turned into a skeleton like that?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hey, I thought you weren't scared of them. You'll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Will we?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hey, you can do this. Just keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah. One leg in front of the other. One breath at a time.</p>
<p><em>[A pause. SCP-8444-A1 takes a shaky breath and looks up at AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I am sorry, there is just… so much to take in.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah? Talk to me about it.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Something <em>took</em> my mother when I was very small. I barely remember it.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh my god– was it… was it a Rufus?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I do not know. <em>[Pauses.]</em> I have never known what love feels like. Not since, well…</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> But you have. And it was good, wasn't it? It was good.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It was good.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I am just worried that one of these, one of these <em>nameless skeletons</em> will be my mother.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That must be hard. It's okay, though. We'll just keep walking. And we'll make sure that if one of them is, you can take her home.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 nods. They slowly stand up again and face the castle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Ready to keep walking?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Let's go find Adam.</p>

<p>At 0752, they reached the bottom of the hill, having successfully avoided detection.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE and SCP-8444-A1 are stood in front of a large blackened hill. The hill begins at a shallow incline but begins to visibly steepen towards the top. At the top of the hill is a castle, finally visible and unobscured by fog. It is a long, black, triangular building, constructed from an unknown gray material, formed into bricks. On each corner of the castle, there sits a tall black turret, providing a view of the landscape below.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE steps onto the hill as SCP-8444-A1 follows behind. Slowly, she begins to climb.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Damn, that's steep.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE slowly moves up the hill, followed closely by SCP-8444-A1. AGUIRRE's large backpack visibly hinders her movement as she struggles to find footholds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Here. <em>[SCP-8444-A1 gestures towards a rock cropping out from the side of the hill.]</em> Put your foot here.</p>
<p><em>[The pair continue up the hill, silently. AGUIRRE is audibly panting. At approximately the halfway point, an entity is visible at the top of the hill. It howls, however, it does not appear to notice either SCP-8444-A1 or AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Quick! Get to the side. Stay quiet.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, okay, I– Whoa!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE loses her footing on the rock and tumbles down a few meters, finally catching herself with her hand. After a moment, she stands back up, black dirt covering her face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, it's just… <em>[AGUIRRE glances up at SCP-8444-A1, then looks slightly behind it.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A small group of red-haired entities has gathered at the top of the hill. They appear to have noticed the pair, and begin growling at them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Run!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 glances behind itself at the group of entities, before running down the hill towards AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Look! Over there! <em>[SCP-8444-A1 points at a small cave on the side of the hill.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The pair begin running towards the cave, carefully attempting to keep their balance as they do so.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hide!</p>
<p><em>[They enter the cave, hiding and pressing their backs to the walls of the cave. The inside of the cave is dark and smooth, and the floor is covered in small puddles. Fluid drips off the ceiling, gathering at stalactites. The ceiling is low and cramped, and AGUIRRE's head barely scrapes the ceiling.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE pulls out a small handheld flashlight from her bag and turns it on. It illuminates the walls of the cave, made of a dark, metallic rock. AGUIRRE looks towards SCP-8444-A1. They both nod.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The pair walk through the cave, which continues straight for ~25 meters before veering sharply left.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That looks like it goes towards the castle. Maybe there's an entrance somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Good idea.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE passes by a small metal trapdoor, embedded into the ceiling of the cave. She whistles in satisfaction.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> That looks like it.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE places a hand on the trapdoor and tries to open the latch.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Can you open it?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I think so, I–</p>
<p><em>[A loud clang is audible as the trapdoor suddenly opens, revealing a dark chamber beyond. AGUIRRE steps back in surprise, before shining her flashlight into the hole.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> There's a light at the very end of it. I think that leads to the castle. <em>[Pauses.]</em> Here. You go first.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE lifts SCP-8444-A1 by the legs and hoists it up to the hole.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Ooh. Okay. Here we go.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 reaches up into the trapdoor chamber and hoists itself up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You got it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Yeah, I–</p>
<p><em>[A flash of light engulfs the camera view. SCP-8444-A1 screams and falls to the floor of the cave. A burn is visible on the side of its arm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh my god, are you okay!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> What happened?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You reached up into it, and…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It blocked me from going in. Something kept me out. Something…</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You said the castle has something against Baba, right? Some sort of safety mechanism?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Yes… then it must be… the spell.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> There is a spell on the castle preventing Baba from entering without being bound. The Rufus cannot perform magic, but this castle used to be a prison for Baba after the Thousand Rotations War. After the war, the Rufus took the castle for their own. If I am not bound by the Rufus, I cannot enter the castle.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What?! Then how are we supposed to rescue Adam?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I only mentioned Baba. Other creatures can go in… unharmed.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE begins taking long, slow breaths.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You can do this, Willow.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No. No. I can’t go alone, I— I don’t even know where they’re hiding him!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Do you want to find your friend or not?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You can do this, Willow. I believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What if I get taken? What if they see me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Then you <em>run like hell</em>.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hey, you used it right.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What are you gonna do when I’m gone?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I will stay here. Keep the Rufus away. Find a way out for you.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You promise?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Promise. Just stay quiet. Put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Anything for my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You used that right, too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> You got this. Now go!</p>
<p><em>[After a second, AGUIRRE leaps into the trapdoor and begins to climb. She struggles for a moment, before dropping her backpack down the tunnel. SCP-8444-A1 catches it, and she continues to climb.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE slowly ascends the chamber, placing her back against the side of the tunnel and her feet on the other side. Gradually, she climbs until she reaches the halfway point between the trapdoor and the supposed entrance to the castle. She stops to take a long, deep breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I passed the enchantment.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE continues to climb, until SCP-8444-A1 and the trapdoor are no longer visible.]</em></p>
<p><em>[At last, she reaches the top trapdoor. The trapdoor is closed and constructed similarly to the trapdoor below. Water drips from the top onto AGUIRRE. She places the camera through a gap in the door.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Visible from the top of the trapdoor is a long, dark hallway. It is completely empty, save for torches lining the walls periodically. The torches emit a dim, blue light. It is completely silent.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a moment, AGUIRRE opens the trapdoor with a loud creak and hoists herself through. She is visibly exhausted, and pauses to take a breath, before quickly closing the trapdoor and looking around.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE runs to the side of the hallway, towards a small outcropping of bare rock. She hides behind it, as a large red-haired entity can be seen crawling past on a far hallway. She gasps, then covers her mouth with a hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh, god.</p>
<p><em>[After the creature is no longer visible, she quietly walks past the outcropping to a hallway extending out on her right.]</em></p>
<p><em>[There, a number of cells lined with iron bars are visible, but all empty. She gasps again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Whispering, to herself.]</em> Where are you Adam, come on…</p>
<p><em>[She begins to silently run down the hallway, towards another set of cells. She inhales quickly in surprise. There, inside the cells are dozens of green humanoid creatures, similar in appearance to SCP-8444-A1 (designated SCP-8444-A2 through A27). They are all visibly exhausted and starving, many too tired to acknowledge her presence. One of them (designated SCP-8444-A4) speaks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I– where's Adam?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A4:</strong> <em>[Quietly.]</em> Help, please.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I don't know if I can–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A6:</strong> <em>[Weakly.]</em> Please.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Have any of you seen a man? A human man?</p>
<p><em>[They shake their heads.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, I– <em>[Pauses.]</em> Can you all run?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A3:</strong> All but one.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay, carry them. I'm going to open this door, and then you're all gonna run.</p>
<p><em>[She quickly tries to pull open one of the cell doors, but it does not budge. She tries again, and a flash of green sparks flies out from the padlock. AGUIRRE winces in pain as her right arm struggles against the door. One of the creatures inside the cells speaks (designated SCP-8444-A2).]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> <em>[Breathing heavily.]</em> I– I can't…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A2:</strong> It will not open to your hand. It is magically locked.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What's the metal made of? <em>[Pauses.]</em> Only one way to find out.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE pulls a magnesium flare out from her backpack and points it at the lock. It begins to burn, then glows red-hot.]</em></p>
<p><em>[In the distance, footsteps are faintly audible, but getting closer.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A12:</strong> They are close, they are almost here. You must work faster.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE points the flare even closer to the metal, and at last, the lock chips off cleanly. The entities in the cell begin to cheer, but quickly grow silent as SCP-8444-A2 gives them a stern look.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Gingerly, AGUIRRE pries the door open with her arm. She winces and struggles against it. The footsteps grow louder.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A9:</strong> Please, quicker!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE continues trying to pull, but after a few moments, she cannot bear the pain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I– I can't…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A3:</strong> You can do it. Please. We need you.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I– I can do this. God… it– I can do it.</p>
<p><em>[Finally, AGUIRRE tries one last time to open the door. She places her arms on the door and begins to pull. She winces as tears nearly flow from her eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Just… a little further.</p>
<p><em>[At last, it opens with a loud bang.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Yeah! Let's go! Quickly, run!</p>
<p><em>[In the distance, the source of the footsteps are now visible. A group of three red-haired creatures are seen at the end of the hallway, ~100 meters away. They approach rapidly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Run!</p>
<p><em>[The group of SCP-8444-A1-like entities begins running towards the other end of the hallway, which breaks off into two separate routes. The creatures all turn left.]</em></p>
<p><em>[As the creatures approach closer, AGUIRRE, too, begins to run. She looks back at the creatures, throwing the half-burned flare in their direction. They cower.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE turns left at the junction and follows the rest of the creatures. There, at the end of the hall, is SCP-8444-A1, holding a large gate open outside.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Baba!</p>
<p><em>[All the creatures turn to look at AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No– them!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> WIllow! Where is your friend?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I don't know, I–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Keep searching! Check the western wing!</p>
<p><em>[As the rest of the creatures exit the castle, AGUIRRE stops just before the entrance gate, and turns right to begin running in the direction of another hallway.]</em></p>
<p><em>[She continues running, still chased by a group of red-haired wolf-like entities.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Throw them off, throw them off…</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE turns left, then right, then left again through a large maze of hallways. A man's voice is barely audible in the distance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> I hear… I hear… Willow. Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam! I'm coming!</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Help, please. Help.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE begins running in the direction of the voice, getting louder as she continues. The footsteps and growls of the creatures get quieter as she continues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Adam! It's you!</p>
<p><em>[At the end of a hallway, KLINE is finally visible, held in the mouth of one of the large, wolf-like creatures. It growls, releasing a large amount of spit onto KLINE's body.]</em></p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE pulls out another flare from her backpack and pulls the cap off, grunting in pain as she does so. She aims it at the creature. It winces. As it backs up quickly, its leg catches on the corner of a wall and it trips. Red blood visibly pools from the side of its leg, onto the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Hey! Drop him! Now!</p>
<p><em>[The creature backs up slightly, away from AGUIRRE, limping as it does so. It winces in pain again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Now! Don't hurt him! I mean it!</p>
<p><em>[The creature turns and begins to run, limping as its back leg touches the ground. It drips blood onto the floor. AGUIRRE follows quickly behind, as they continue through a maze of corridors. The creature begins to slow down as its injury begins to hinder its ability to run. Finally, the creature runs up a large set of blackened stairs, through another section of hallways, stopping at last at a swinging bridge. It collapses in pain.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The bridge is badly damaged, unable to hold the weight of even a single person. It is missing most of its steps, and the ropes on the side are frayed. Behind the bridge stands another turret of the castle. Stars shine brightly from the dark sky, illuminating the scene. The creature turns to look at AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Oh… oh god. It’s so— it’s so high.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE begins to breathe heavily and shudders.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Okay. Just… one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE takes a deep breath and steadies herself. She walks closer, cornering the creature on the bridge. It growls at AGUIRRE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Let him go! Please!</p>
<p><em>[The creature grunts in response. It bares its teeth at AGUIRRE. She does not step away.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Please, don't hurt him, I– I'll do anything! I can– I can give you your soul back.</p>
<p><em>[The creature is silent, then tilts its head slightly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I just want my friend back, please!</p>
<p><em>[Sounds of wind howling.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The creature steps forward slightly. AGUIRRE holds out her right hand. The creature moves closer, and AGUIRRE pets it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You have a big heart. I know that. You have a shattered soul, but there's something in there. Baba forgives you. I forgive you.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. AGUIRRE rests her hand on the creature's head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You must be in so much pain right now. You don't deserve this, do you?</p>
<p><em>[The creature looks down towards KLINE.]</em></p>
<p><em>[It looks up towards AGUIRRE. AGUIRRE pulls out a roll of gauze from her pocket and begins to patch the creature's leg.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I can't imagine how much that must hurt. To not be able to feel. To not possess a soul.</p>
<p><em>[The creature begins to whimper.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> But I love you. I forgive you. You can get your soul back. I know it. It's old magic, but you still can.</p>
<p><em>[The creature looks down for a moment, then up at AGUIRRE. It turns its head slowly. Finally, the creature bows its head down, placing KLINE on the ground. He coughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE walks forward towards the creature, who sits and turns to face the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You are so kind. You have a big heart.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Willow?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank god, Adam. You're alive.</p>
<p><em>[KLINE slowly sits up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Are you okay? Are–</p>
<p><em>[Behind them, a group of wolf-like creatures has gathered at the end of the hallway. They try to approach, before suddenly stepping back, looks of confusion and bewilderment on their faces.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> I'm okay, just–</p>
<p><em>[Suddenly, a flash of blue light envelops the camera, as a shooting star arcs through the dark sky. It pauses directly above the castle before it begins to descend onto the wolf-like creature next to KLINE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> What is that?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><em>[The wolf-like creature looks upwards at the blue ball of light, now shrunk to only the size of a small soccer ball, no more than 20 cm in diameter.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a moment, the ball of light hovers above the wolf-like creature's body, before entering its chest. AGUIRRE audibly gasps, but the creature only closes its eyes and breathes deeply.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The creature opens its eyes. They are now amber-orange, with a blue tint in the corner. It stands, walks to AGUIRRE, and sits.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> It's– it's you. You have a soul.</p>
<p><em>[The group of creatures in the castle begin to growl, slowly prowling towards AGUIRRE. The wolf-like creature next to AGUIRRE growls back, but the three creatures do not stop. AGUIRRE begins to back up. She reaches into her pocket for a flare, but it is empty.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No— no, stay back!</p>
<p><em>[The creatures continue to approach her. She continues to back up. Suddenly, her right foot slips at the edge of the tower, and she trips backwards, onto the swinging bridge. She screams. She catches the edge of the tower with her hands, as the rest of her body dangles off the edge.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Help! Please!</p>
<p><em>[KLINE attempts to crawl towards AGUIRRE, but winces in pain. The creatures continue to approach, growling.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Help!</p>
<p><em>[Suddenly, AGUIRRE gasps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Willow! Hold on!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 appears on the other side of the tower, climbing the large black rocks forming the wall. It climbs towards AGUIRRE, still dangling on the edge of the wall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Baba!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I’ll hold them off!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 pulls out a Foundation-issue flare.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I took it from your bag! I hope that's–</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> No— yeah! Just save us!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 points the flare at the creatures. Before even lighting it, they begin to run away.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 climbs up the tower and hoists AGUIRRE up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you!</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE climbs back onto the stone tower.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Anything for my best friend.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How far you’ve come.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Come on, Willow. Bring your friend. Let us go home.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> What about the deal? I still have to help you with the Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Willow, you have helped more than you could ever dream of. You gave it a soul.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8444-A1 gestures to the wolf-like creature sitting by KLINE.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> It's only one.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> One is more than I thought could ever have a soul. You… you saved it. You have done so much more than I ever expected. Not just for us, but for… for me, too.</p>
<p><em>[The wind whistles through the bridge.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> There is a group waiting for you. Let us go.</p>
<p><em>[A pause. The wolf-like entity wraps its head in AGUIRRE's arms. AGUIRRE smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> It's time to go home.</p>

<p>Willow Aguirre and Adam Kline successfully reached the town of Pira on 2027/09/06. On 2027/09/07, the gate to SCP-8444 reopened and the pair were successfully extracted. A log from their extraction is available below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></strong></p>
<p><em>[The camera activates, showing the exit portal in SCP-8444. AGUIRRE holds the camera, while KLINE is seated on a rock, his right leg in a makeshift cast constructed from clay and sticks. He holds a makeshift crutch in his hand. They are surrounded by a large group of SCP-8444-A1-like creatures, all chattering amongst themselves. SCP-8444-A1 stands next to AGUIRRE. AGUIRRE speaks to it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you. For helping us.</p>
<p><strong>KLINE:</strong> Yeah, thank you. I don't know how to thank you, I–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> No, no, thank you. Your friend has helped me more than you know. <em>[To AGUIRRE.]</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> I guess this is goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I don't know. We may be meeting again sooner than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Well, until then… It has been a great pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> You as well.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> I have… one question for you, though.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> How have the Baba never found this portal? Why have you never entered them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> They have never harmed or helped us. We do not interfere with what does not affect us.</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Huh. Until now, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> Until now.</p>
<p><em>[The portal begins to glow a bright green color. The crowd stops chattering and steps back. AGUIRRE turns to KLINE, and holds out a hand as he stands up. Radio chatter is audible over AGUIRRE's walkie-talkie.]</em></p>
<p><strong>COMMAND:</strong> Aguirre, Kline, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> We do, Command.</p>
<p><strong>COMMAND:</strong> Thank god. I mean– yeah. The aperture is steady, diameter three point five. You are free to extract.</p>
<p><em>[AGUIRRE turns to SCP-8444-A1 as they and KLINE step towards the portal. SCP-8444-A1 smiles. A howl is audible in the distance from wolf-like entity sitting at the treeline. Its blue eyes sparkle against the camera's lens.]</em></p>
<p><strong>AGUIRRE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8444-A1:</strong> See you soon.</p>
<p><em>[They step through the aperture. The image inside SCP-8444 becomes distorted and blurry before it is no longer visible at all. The sound of the crowd fades.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Exploration ends.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>[END LOG]</em></strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>Following the exploration, Aguirre exited with minor injuries, and Kline was treated for minor dehydration and malnutrition, along with a broken leg.</p>
<p>In 2028, the SCP-8444 research team, in conjunction with the Department of Interdimensional Relations, established an SCP-8444 forward operating base and established communications and diplomatic relations with the SCP-8444-A population. Dr. Willow Aguirre was selected to be the Foundation's primary contact point for SCP-8444 affairs.</p>
<p>Research continues.</p>
