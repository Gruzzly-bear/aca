<p>An SCP-1548 event during formation.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1548</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation satellites MALAKBEL-1 through 10 will monitor the south pole of the Sun for SCP-1548. Under Protocol Koyash-Veure, all Foundation space stations and off-planet bases within the solar system will have the monitoring of the Sun as their secondary mission objective. Connections will be maintained with major space agencies under Operation STYGIAN IRIS for enhanced monitoring of the anomaly, with accurate information on the phenomena restricted to specified personnel.</p>
<p>As it is not feasible to place limitations on all solar telescopes, it is expected that civilians will observe SCP-1548 on occasion. Foundation personnel embedded in scientific agencies will disseminate misleading information on SCP-1548 and all thaumaturgic symbols that manifest, describing them as unusual but natural phenomena. All other information of the anomaly and related symbols is subject to standard Foundation censorship protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1548 is the designation of various anomalous solar phenomena, primarily occurring at the south pole of the Sun. There are three types of known SCP-1548 events:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>SCP-1548-1:</em></span> Six equidistant ovular sunspots, approximately 40,000 km x 15,000 km in size, appear. The ends of the sunspots converge after 23 hours, often accompanied with the formation of a solar prominence<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> that typically takes the shape of thaumaturgic symbols. A coronal mass ejection will then occur around the sunspots, lasting 11 hours, with the prominence dissipating after 5 hours.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>SCP-1548-2:</em></span> Begins similarly to SCP-1548-1. A solar prominence then forms from the site of the sunspots and breaks off from the Sun, moving away from it and likely entering interstellar space. The event lasts for 2 hours.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>SCP-1548-3:</em></span> Sunspots form thaumaturgical symbols, which range in size. This can occur in conjunction with other events or separately. Unlike the previous two phenomena, these sunspots do not commonly manifest in any single area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first recorded SCP-1548 event was on 17-May-1983, where an SCP-1548-3 event was observed, showing Thaumaturgic Symbol-2201-V1 (<em>refer to Addendum.1</em>). The event was classified as Extranormal Event-9008 until similar occurrences were observed, leading to the classification of SCP-1548.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.1 — Thaumaturgical Symbol Identification:</strong> The Department of Thaumaturgy has successfully identified and determined the nature of several symbols seen in SCP-1548. Below is a list of the symbols, denoted with "V" if they are a variation of the symbol ("V1" denotes the original or first discovered version of the symbol).</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>TS-2201-V1:</em></span> Unnamed; only seen in SCP-1548. If inscribed on any telescopic device by a person with thaumaturgic abilities, the device will show psionic entities with malicious intent toward the user. After a total four hours of use, users without psionic abilities will experience symptoms of psychosis.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>TS-381-V2:</em></span> Known as the Kalaphastian Isle among various occultist groups. When affixed or projected onto a material, it will strengthen the material, enhancing its ability to absorb kinetic and electromagnetic energy. Materials may be hidden from sight as well.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>TS-1817-V7:</em></span> Known as the 12 Holy Owls of Serrinithium; origin among humans unknown. When the symbol is affixed to a weapon or object used with the intent to harm, any entity killed by the weapon will annihilate the immediate space around it. The size of the annihilation zone is proportional to the size of the entity killed. This annihilation zone has no effect on materials reinforced with TS-381.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of note is 61% of observed thaumaturgic symbols pertain to the anomalous <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/second-hytoth-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Ortothan</a> mythology and religious beliefs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> TS-1817 originates from Ortothan occultists in the 1800s, and TS-381 has been used by members of the Church of the Second Hytoth, a prominent Ortothan group of interest, in avoiding capture by the Foundation. Why this is the case is unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.2 — Event 1548-29:</strong> On 23-December-2016, several SCP-1548-1 events occurred in rapid succession. Although interpretation of these symbols is still underway, TS-381-V2, TS-1817-V7, and TS-2201-V1 manifested multiple times during these events. Twenty non-anomalous Ortothan language symbols and phrases for protection formed as well. 47 hours later, five SCP-1548-2 events occurred in the span of two hours.</p>
<p>Over the next month a dense cloud of ionizing radiation began forming around the solar system, surrounding the heliopause<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Although initially at largely unnoticeable amounts, the cloud increased in magnitude until no light from the outside universe could enter by 20-January-2017. The origin of the cloud is presumed to be from the sequence of SCP-1548 events, though the combined amount of particles produced was too small to form a structure on this scale. Of note is that Foundation telescopes have noticed thaumic tessellations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, resembling grids of pyramids, periodically forming along the cloud.</p>
<p>As the night sky is now entirely altered, Foundation censorship protocols cannot be fully executed. The dissemination of incorrect scientific information regarding the solar system entering a dense cloud of cosmic dust is in progress. Scientific information describing the actual nature of the ionizing radiation cloud will be censored as per Contingency Galileo-II.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.3 — Recent Phenomena:</strong> Following Event 1548-29 a high amount of significant anomalous phenomena have occurred. The following is a list of the events, updated as of 26-January-2017.</p>

Foundation satellites captured video of the event, showing that half of the spacecraft disappeared along the mid-line, jettisoning any crew still inside into the Earth's atmosphere. Radio signals were received soon afterward from beyond the heliopause. Although suspected to originate from the other half of the spacecraft, the decoded signals match no known spoken or written language.</td>

<p>Joint Foundation and Global Occult Coalition forces have been mobilized for large scale containment and threat neutralization operations. Cooperation with various governments to assist in coverups has begun, though these measures are hindered by the decisions of the Latvian, Estonian, and Georgian governments in declassifying documents on anomalous phenomena and Cold War paratech. All major containment sites are now under Level V High Security Lockdown until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.4 — Experiment 2154-37:</strong> On 12-June-1999, it was determined by a unanimous O5 vote to enact a long term plan to explore beyond the heliopause. Mission objectives were to confirm or deny hypotheses regarding extraterrestrial SCP objects and collect data on anomalous phenomena beyond the heliopause. As such, the Foundation probe Seraph-1 was constructed then successfully launched on 09-May-2000.</p>
<p>On 27-January-2017, an SCP-1548-1 event was initiated prior to Seraph-1 reaching the heliopause, forming the thaumaturgic symbols used in predicting the future. Following the SCP-1548-1 event, an SCP-1548-2 event was initiated and launched. This one, however, deviated significantly from normal trajectories and curved sharply about 100 AU away from the sun, towards Seraph-1. Seraph-1 crossed the heliosphere two days before contact was lost from the intense radiation inside of the solar prominence.</p>
<p>All information collected by Seraph-1 is currently under review and pending declassification.</p>

<p><em>Seraph-1 is ~100km away from heliopause. The entire region appears as a barrier of ionizing radiation, resembling a cloud and glowing a dull orange. Highly complex geometric patterns form on the surface, most 10,000km across. After an hour the probe begins passing through heliopause, entering interstellar space, and contact is lost. A connection is periodically reestablished over period of two days, though the only meaningful data obtained is a tachyon transmission from SCP-3417. After that period a stable connection with the probe begins. Many pieces of equipment were disabled by the radiation, though a rear camera continued to be operable.</em></p>
<p><em>Behind Seraph-1 are masses of high-energy radiation that resemble solar flares, encompassing the entire visible section of the heliosphere as a barrier. Thousands of thaumaturgic symbols are present in these flares, most unidentified. Identified symbols serve to provide various forms of camouflage, the largest being warding sigils used in the Ortothan religion to repel extra-universal entities. At the approximate location where Seraph-1 exited a large hole is forming, with the flares dissipating at its edges as it expands.</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Swarms of entities can be seen in the distance, surrounding the heliopause. The bodies of each entity are highly asymmetrical and possess numerous appendages and unknown structures. The only common features are a gray body coloration, segments that erratically flash various colors, and fractal structures. Sizes are estimated to range from 10km to 10000km, though some appear to be significantly larger on unknown scales.</em></p>
<p><em>Two of these entities (hereafter 1548-Ω-1 and 1548-Ω-2) pass by Seraph-1. 1548-Ω-1 is eel-like in shape with five arms extending from random sections of its body, along with a "mouth" made of impossible geometric structures. The end of its body is surrounded by arachnid limbs and frequently flickers into being translucent. 1548-Ω-2 is an oscillating and contorting tetrahedral object, leaving trails of black rocks that rapidly disintegrate.</em></p>
<p><em>As the entities near the hole the warding sigils glow red, causing red shock waves to appear around each one, significantly slowing their speed.</em></p>
<p><em>1548-Ω-2 "unfolds" its body and releases glowing white orbs, which reach the sigils and expand into spiral patterns. The sigils demanifest and the shock waves lessen in luminosity. 1548-Ω-1 passes through the hole and accelerates out of Seraph-1's view. High amounts of thaumaturgic particles are detected and the hole is rapidly enveloped by solar flares. Hundreds of concentrated blasts of thaumic energy are shot out of the new flares and pierce through 1548-Ω-2, vaporizing it in seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, the 27-January-2017 SCP-1548-2 prominence passes through the heliopause, encountering Seraph-1 an hour later. Contact is permanently lost.</em></p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p><strong>EVENT SUMMARY:</strong> On 30-January-2017, the Foundation orbital vessel SCPS Curtana was fully outfitted with experimental anomalous weapon and propulsion systems. It was deployed to neutralize 1548-Ω-1, which had destroyed Pluto and other Kuiper Belt objects following its entrance into the solar system. The vehicle arrived at 1548-Ω-1's location near Jupiter and engaged with the entity. Communication with the onboard crew was lost after 10 minutes. Footage from Foundation probes show the vehicle and entity become surrounded by a black substance and vanish.</p>
<p>2 hours later the substance dissipated, and the SCPS Curtana was observed to be rapidly accelerating towards Mars at near light speeds, with an organic mass resembling that of 1548-Ω-1 attached to it. In 30 minutes the vessel reached the planet and impacted it, creating a crater 400km in radius, ionizing the atmosphere, and turning the surface into a molten mass. An hour after, the surface began to be converted into a black organic mass, which spread out from the epicenter of SCPS Curtana's impact.</p>
<p>At this time an SCP-1548-2 event, the largest one on record, occurred, and the solar flare reached Mars when half of its surface had been converted. A violent explosion followed, the luminosity of which matched the Sun's luminosity when viewed from Earth. The resultant debris is expected to form a second asteroid belt within the next three months. Asteroid impacts with Earth are predicted to increase.</p>
<p>As this event occurred 10 hours ago, all related data is still under review.</p>
