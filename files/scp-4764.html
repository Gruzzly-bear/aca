<p>SCP-4764-1 is kept in Modified Containment Shelter #17-3200 at Site-4764. Once per day, an assigned researcher must enter the containment shelter and recite SCP-4764-1's unique key aloud.</p>
<p>SCP-4764-1's unique key consists of the lyrics to 'Holy Fucking Shit: 40,000' by American post-punk band Have a Nice Life. All researchers assigned to SCP-4764 are required to memorize this song upon assignment.</p>
<p>SCP-4764-2 cannot be reliably contained at this time but is effectively self-containing so long as SCP-4764-1 is contained.</p>

<p><strong>Discontinued Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4764 cannot be reliably contained at this time. However, its anomalous effects can be disrupted through sustained artillery bombardment.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") has been tasked with maintaining constant artillery bombardment upon SCP-4764 at Provisional Site-4764. Rate of bombardment is not to fall under 30 direct strikes per 24-hour period.</p>
<p>If bombardment ceases for longer than one hour at any time, and bombardment cannot be re-initiated, Mobile Task Force Omega-12 ("Achilles' Heels") is authorized to physically engage SCP-4764, via basic wrestling techniques and hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Due to SCP-4764's location close to major population centers, cover stories have been implemented denoting Provisional Site-4764 as an armed forces munitions testing site. Mass-application of amnestics has been approved for use in the event of an SCP-4764 containment breach.</p>
<p>SCP-4764 is known to possess some sort of key or password capable of deactivating its anomalous properties. This key is an unknown musical composition, released between 2001 and 2010 in the post-punk, post-rock and/or dark wave genres. Identifying and deploying this key is considered an 'Alpha-Plus' priority by the Site Directors' Executive Committee of the Whole and the O5 Council.</p>

</div>
<p>SCP-4764-1 is the designation assigned to a 15.6 m<sup>3</sup> area surrounding an ongoing &amp; temporally-locked event located in a field off of Tye Lane in Bramford, Ipswitch. As of now, Modified Containment Shelter #17-3200 has been built around it to both obscure it from outside observation and to act as a sound dampener.</p>
<p>This event, originally billed as "SLEDGE𐐒ACK", is a 38-minute concert put on by the British <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/are-we-cool-yet-hub">AWCY?</a>-affiliated punk band "PEOPLES CHOICE" and it has been locked in a temporal loop since June 6, 2018.</p>
<p>While researchers have been unable to pass the boundary of the temporal zone, it is possible to observe and record the concert itself.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4764 Event Log</strong><br/>
<strong>Band Members:</strong> Johan "JoJo" Streiborg, vocals, lead guitar; Bernard "Beast" Felstern, bass; Jim "Bones" Teylword, rhythm guitar; Amiee "GET FUCKED" Kirckland, drums.<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>The temporal loop appears to begin in the middle of an ongoing set, and the event begins right at the end of the band's previous song.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>[The last strains of the song ends with the vocalist holding a high-G note for 8 seconds, then the music stops.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> THANK YOU, you scummy fuckin' arseholes! This next piece goes out to the goddamn bobbies and the motherfuckin' Tories holdin' the leashes.</p>
<p><em>[The band begins playing a ballad for 287 seconds before being interrupted by a bottle being thrown from outside the temporal border to impact against the side of Streiborg's guitar, cutting his hand in the process.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> Oi, shit for brains! What the fuck was you expectin'?</p>
<p><strong>Kirckland:</strong> GET FUCKED, ARSEHOLE! ONE! TWO! THREE!</p>
<p><em>[The band resumes playing, but the time signature is significantly faster, and Streiborg continues to play despite the wound in his hand. After 127 seconds the song ends.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> Fuckin' better that time! Gotta get you shitstains riled up 'fore we can get some REAL fun goin'! WE ARE PEOPLES CHOICE! The charmin' motherfucker in the back is GET FUCKED, the hairy bastard on bass is Beast, Bones is wreckin' shit on the guitar. Me? I'm JOJO MOTHERFUCKIN' STREIBORG!</p>
<p><em>[Another song immediately begins, following the uptempo lead of the previous song. The song continues for 396 seconds, despite Streiborg and the others having to dodge plastic cups filled with a yellow-ish liquid and various bottles being thrown on stage. At the end of the end of the song, Streiborg and Felstern rip off their shirts, while Kirckland drinks from one of the bottles thrown on stage before smashing it against the side of one of her drums.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> Let's get ROWDY, motherfuckers! If you fuckin' wankers don't get your shit FLYIN' I'm gonna go back in time and fuck all of your ancestors until your DNA is 70% my spunk!</p>
<p><em>[Kirckland counts off another time signature and another song begins, this time even louder and faster than the previous songs. This time their music is accompanied by more bottles and masses of brown-ish material that splashes wetly on the stage and the bandmates. At one point a large mass impacts against the side of Teylword's face and he promptly vomits across the stage in front of him. After 411 seconds, the song ends.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> OH YEAH, now THAT'S what I'm fuckin' yankin' on about! You think you stank piss-monkeys can step it up another notch, eh? 'Cause this shit is about to fuckin' BREAK OUT!</p>
<p><em>[Another song begins, and this time the volume begins to peak past 160 decibels, requiring significant ear protection. At one point during the song, Streiborg steps to the edge of the stage and proceeds to projectile vomit onto the crowd, the fluid passing out through the temporal boundary and disappearing. After 396 seconds, the song ends and Streiborg picks up the neck of a shattered bottle. He begins to gesticulate wildly off stage towards the crowd.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> Now we've fuckin' GOTTEN somewheres. NOW we can REALLY start the motherfuckin' show. BEAST, fuckin' GO!</p>
<p><em>[He stabs himself in the chest with the shattered remnants of the bottle and begins carving several thaumaturgic symbols in his skin. Felstern starts to play a sequence of notes that his bass should not be capable of producing and a black foam begins seeping from the bass drum in front of Kirckland.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Streiborg:</strong> YOU wanted a show to end all fuckin' shows, well I'm gonna give it to ya. GIVE IT UP FOR <strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]</strong><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>[The foam begins to congeal in a mass at the center of the stage and Streiborg starts screaming incantations in an unknown language. At this point one of the researchers begins reciting the lyrics to 'Holy Fucking Shit: 40,000', and the temporal loop dissipates.]</em></p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> <em>Reciting the key word causes the event to completely dissipate, then it will resume again approximately 23.3 hours later.</em></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An investigation into the cause of this event, the importance of the vocal key, and how to effectively terminate this event is ongoing.</p>

<p>The Foundation became alerted to the potential inherent in this event due to several assets planted within GoI-0267 ("Are We Cool Yet?") independently filing reports warning of an imminent Breach-Of-Veil event.</p>
<p>The event was being advertised as an "OKKULT X-PERIENCE OF WYRLDENDING PORPORTIONS" (sic) and headlined the anartist punk band PEOPLES CHOICE. The band's front man Johan Streiborg<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> had been previously listed as a "Threat Entity" by the Global Occult Coalition and had been on several GOC elimination lists for a wide variety of actions that resulted in numerous civilian casualties and property damage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the Foundation assets within AWCY?, Streiborg had been censured several times by AWCY? leadership for his aggressive behavior and reckless tactics. The proposal for this event, itself, had been rejected due to the unstable nature of the rituals involved and Streiborg's membership in the anartist group had been revoked.</p>
<p>Despite this revocation, Streiborg blatantly posted plans to move forward with the concert, stating many times that he had a fallback plan if the ritual became uncontrollable.</p>
<p>A copy of the PEOPLES CHOICE project proposal is included as reference.</p>

<p><strong>[</strong><em>A 23-page manifesto from PEOPLES CHOICE frontman Johan Streiborg has been omitted for brevity.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Julio "Jules" Gonzales, a Class 3 Thaumaturgist and known associate of Streiborg's, was apprehended at the scene of the event. His mental capacity had been severely damaged by his attempt to stop the event from taking place, and it is believed that he was responsible for locking it in a temporal loop.</p>
<p>His on-scene interview was too incoherent to provide much useful data, though Foundation action specialists were able to deduce the basic nature of the event in question. Realizing the danger inherent in the performance itself, Lieutenant Major Brian Stokeworth of Mobile Task Force Omega-12 ("Achilles' Heels") attempted to break up the event by force.</p>
<p>Though this initially proved successful in disrupting the initial summoning of the SCP-4764-2 entity, it was insufficient to break the temporal loop put into place by Gonzales. Operational command decided to establish ballistic containment procedures until such a time as the key could be located by trial-and-error, or detainee Gonzales had recovered sufficiently to enact the closing ritual himself.</p>
<p>The following scrap of paper was found in detainee Gonzales' pocket at the time of apprehension. It is believed to have been written by Streiborg and given to Gonzales at some point before the concert began.</p>
