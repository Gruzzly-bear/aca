This base facilitates all excursions into the Island and acts as a hub allowing operatives to access the expansive transit network<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-2')">2</a></sup> and allow survivors to be transported off-island.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP-9198 refers to a hostile, hivemind-like organism that visually mimics the appearance of snow. Its diet primarily consists of siphoning any nearby sources of thermal energy and organic matter, which it utilizes to replicate on a massive scale. Despite its potential to trigger an NK-Class (“Grey Goo”) Scenario, SCP-9198 is currently contained within the confines of Montreal Island in Canada, effectively preventing a global catastrophe.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of SCP-9198’s sustained presence on the island has been a severe deterioration of local weather conditions. For the three years since containment began, the island has remained in a continuous snowstorm, with ambient temperatures routinely falling below −50 °C (−58 °F).</p>
<p>SCP-9198 is also capable of reanimating consumed human subjects into entities collectively designated SCP-9198-1. These entities consist of the skeletal remains of former victims, loosely bound together by residual connective tissue, tendons, and fibrous muscle strands. Recent tests conducted by Division B staff have determined that SCP-9198-1 do not exhibit any independent intelligence, functioning solely as an extension of SCP-9198's collective will.</p>
<p>Current projections indicate that SCP-9198 will eventually begin to starve, losing cohesion and organization as available food sources within Montreal become scarce. This process is expected to result in widespread self-cannibalism, ultimately leading to the anomaly’s self-neutralization by November 2030.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Addendum 9198-1A: Discovery</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The earliest documented reports concerning SCP-9198 originate from a surge of online activity in early December 2023. Posts across platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook detailed a sudden and anomalous onset of snowfall, accompanied by a dramatic drop in ambient temperature. These reports were further accompanied by the circulation of low-resolution photographs depicting figures now believed to be instances of SCP-9198-1 received from loved ones and colleagues who were located downtown.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The following is one of several surviving recordings documenting the initial outbreak of SCP-9198 activity. The individual responsible for the recording is believed to be Mathieu Tremblay, who captured the footage during a livestream on Facebook, providing a firsthand example of the event. A majority of the transcript contains dialogue spoken in French; therefore, translations have been provided where necessary.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>The timestamp places the beginning of the livestream at approximately 5:30 PM on December 5th, 2023, inside the Second Cup located on the corner of Saint-Catherine Street West. The footage is handheld and noticeably shaky, with brief blurs as the camera shifts; the muffled billowing of wind can be heard rattling the windows, and as the camera pans up from the counter, the worsening weather outside becomes clearly visible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Tabarnak, y fait fou raide dehors avec l’esti de météo qui nous a tombé dessus!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tremblay steps away from the counter as chatter from coworkers continues in the background, moving toward the window to get a clearer view of the outside.</em></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:100%;"><img alt="outbreak.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment:scp-9198-0/outbreak.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Still frame.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Mon dieu man, c'est terrible!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Snow begins to accumulate across the window of the shop. At first it appears natural, but within seconds it visibly spreads: branching outward, almost replicating. Tremblay shifts slightly to the left; the camera view follows, and the snow formation appears to adjust its growth in response, drifting toward their movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Attendez une seconde… c’est quoi ça?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tremblay raises a hand and gently presses it against the glass, seemingly out of curiosity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-6')">6</a></sup>. Within moments, his breathing sharpens and he begins to panic, attempting to pull his hand away. The phone is dropped as he brings up his other hand to assist. The camera, now angled upward from the floor, captures Tremblay struggling to free himself. A wet tearing sound is audible as he forcefully pulls his hand free, leaving tissue behind. Tremblay screams and runs out of frame, while distinct cracking noises begin to spread across the window.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay [Off-Camera]:</strong> Ostie! ostie! Ma main! Câlisse… j’me l’ai déchirée!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>The window suddenly shatters, and the howling wind of the outside overwhelms the microphone, severely distorting the audio. Snow floods into the shop almost instantly, rapidly engulfing everything in view. Distant screaming can be heard beyond the static. The footage begins to break down, glitching and losing clarity, before suddenly cutting off.</em></p>
<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Recognizing the escalating severity of the anomaly, the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) assumed provisional jurisdiction, establishing communication with the federal government and issuing a mandatory evacuation order for all inhabitants on the island and in the surrounding regions. ETTRA additionally severed the Québec interconnection power grid to Montréal Island, plunging the area into darkness in an effort to curb the anomaly’s growth.</p>
<p>As the risk of SCP-9198 breaching Montréal Island intensified, the O5 Council authorized an emergency containment directive involving the destruction of all primary access routes connecting the island to the mainland. This included major bridges, vehicular tunnels, and subterranean infrastructure. The objective was to eliminate any potential means of SCP-9198 crossing the natural water barrier surrounding the island and, if required, to convert the metropolitan area into a large-scale, improvised containment zone.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:100%;"><img alt="bridge.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment:scp-9198-0/bridge.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">

</div>
</div>
<p>The rapid escalation of the crisis soon drew international attention. Out of concern for national security, the United States deployed military units under PENTAGRAM to support Foundation efforts. In parallel, the Global Occult Coalition, operating under directives issued by the United Nations, also began providing assistance amid growing fears that the event could evolve into a global catastrophe. As Foundation containment assets became increasingly overextended, ETTRA and the O5 Council authorized the creation of a four-party joint containment task force, comprising OSAT, PENTAGRAM, the GOC, and the Foundation. This collaborative initiative was designated Operation PERMAFROST.</p>
<p>These developments culminated in the implementation of the current containment measures, which have remained effective since their initial adoption in February 2024.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Addendum 9198-1B: POI-9198</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Professor Daniel Rousseau (designated POI-9198) is currently believed to be responsible for the creation and initial release of SCP-9198. Formerly a Senior Researcher employed by the Foundation, Rousseau’s employment ended after a containment breach at the now decomissioned Area-11<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-8')">8</a></sup> to which he was assigned. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Ethics Committee concluded that his negligence had directly contributed to the incident and as such, his contract was terminated. Among the casualties during the breach was his wife, Researcher Janice Rousseau, whose body was recovered a short distance outside the facility. She was found collapsed in the snow in a pool of her own blood; with POI-9198 being discovered unconscious a short distance away.</p>
<p>Following the termination of his contract, Rousseau underwent standard Class-C amnestic treatment and was reintegrated into civilian life under a cover identity consistent with his prior academic and professional history. He resumed employment at the MUHC Research Institute’s CL3 laboratory<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-9')">9</a></sup>. In accordance with Foundation post-termination protocols, Rousseau was placed under low-intensity surveillance to ensure compliance with reintegration protocols.</p>
<p>Although the exact method remains unknown, POI-9198 is believed to have partially or fully reversed the amnestic regimen administered to him. Evidence suggests he regained full memory of his former Foundation duties, research experience, and classified knowledge. It is currently theorized that he utilized both this recovered expertise and the resources available at the CL3 facility to develop SCP-9198.</p>
<p>Following the release of SCP-9198, all Foundation monitoring of POI-9198 was lost. Attempts to reestablish contact or confirm his whereabouts were severely impeded by the hazardous conditions produced by SCP-9198, rendering aboveground excursions high-risk and resource-intensive. POI-9198 remained unaccounted for until a recent reconnaissance team successfully entered the exclusion zone and searched his last known residence, recovering several items of note.<br/>

<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Calvary Command, Team Delta at destination. Closest we can get to the POI’s residence without breaking to surface. What’s your call?</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> Start with comms and equipment check, Lead. Surface temps are pushing sixty below. Hope you dressed warm.</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Copy. Delta Team, sound off.</p>
<p><strong>Δ-1</strong>: Delta One, reading.</p>
<p><strong>Δ-2:</strong> Delta Two, coming in.</p>
<p><strong>Δ-3:</strong> Delta Three, Lima Charlie</p>
<p><strong>Δ-4:</strong> Delta Four, five-by-five</p>
<p><strong>Δ-5:</strong> Delta Five, hearing you loud and clear</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Comms clean. All Deltas are coming in crystal. Equipment’s checked and green across the board, Dispatch. Starting the countdown now.</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> Roger that. And watch your gauges, use the acid sparingly.</p>
<p><em>The team leaves the subway platform, ascending the concrete stairwell toward the surface. Glacier's suit registers a rapid temperature drop as they near the exit. Upon stepping out, they’re immediately battered by the howling winds and dense snowfall that wipes visibility down to a few meters.</em></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Can’t see a damn thing in this storm. Switch to modified thermals. Eyes open for anomalous terrain.</p>
<p><em>The camera feed switches into thermal mode; clusters of SCP-9198 brightly illuminated through the storm<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-639714-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-639714-10')">10</a></sup>. The team presses forward, following navigational markers on their HUDs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-2:</strong> Hound, got a few dash-ones on our left flank. What’s the play?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Ignore ‘em. They’re too slow to keep up, barely holding together as it is. Keep moving, we’ve got some ground to cover.</p>
<p><em>Roughly twenty minutes pass as they push through the storm. An apartment block finally materializes in the storm, little more than a silhouette against the snow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> This should be Rousseau’s place. Get inside team, let's haul ass. We’ve only got about forty minutes before we need to turn around.</p>
<p><em>The team enters and fans out, searching for the unit number.</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-5:</strong> Lead, got a match.</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Copy, Glacier. Deltas, on his position, double-time.</p>
<p><em>The team rallies around Δ-5, posted at the door. Δ-4 shoulders a sledgehammer and breaches. They pour inside, immediately encountering the corpse of POI-9198, hanging limply from the ceiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-1:</strong> Shit. Lead are we bringing back that body?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Don't have time to play detective Jack, we'll just have to pay our respects and ignore him. Our current priority is lab material. Anything that looks like notes: paper, drives, computer, all of it.</p>
<p><em>The team begins to scour the room as Δ-1 removes POI-9198 from the ceiling and covers his body with a nearby bedsheet, offering a silent prayer</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-4:</strong> Got a safe here.</p>
<p><strong>Δ-3:</strong> Laptop too. Orders, Hound?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> No time to crack the safe here. Whiteout, what’s your estimate on weight?</p>
<p><strong>Δ-4:</strong> Maybe twenty, maybe forty pounds. You want me haul it all the way back?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Afraid so. Outrider, take the laptop. Whiteout, secure the safe.</p>
<p><strong>Δ-2:</strong> Lead, dash-ones closing in on the building!</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Crap. Too tight in here for the spitters. Hammers out, put them down quick. We’re on a thirty-minute clock. Move!</p>
<p><em>The team draws sledgehammers and begins to efficiently neutralize the small group of SCP-9198-1 crowding the entrance. With Δ-4 slowed by the safe, Δ-5 moves up to cover him. The team breaks into a controlled sprint, weaving through the storm and avoiding concentrations of SCP-9198 as more shambling figures begin appearing around street corners.</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-5:</strong> Fucking hell, where are all these things coming from?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Doesn’t matter. Head for the station, now! Crosswind, Outrider, watch our rear and start spraying those things, now!</p>
<p><em>Δ-2 and Δ-3 unleash streams of acid onto the advancing instances, which buckle and dissolve under the spray. Despite their egregious injuries, they continue to crawl towards the team, undeterred by their impairment. Fifteen grueling minutes later, the subway entrance emerges through the storm. The team barrels down the stairs, the echo of distant impacts and thuds trailing behind them. They reach the lower levels and pause, momentarily catching their breaths</em></p>
<p><strong>Δ-3:</strong> Lead, why aren’t they following us?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Tunnel depths scramble their hive network. Any dash-ones that wanders down here locks up: turns into a statue. That’s why survivors tend to hole up in the transit network: warmer down here, and you’re less likely to run into those things.</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> You cut that close, Lead. Report.</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Mission successful. Retrieved Rousseau’s materials and we’re enroute back to Base.</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> Any idea where Rousseau might be?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Seems he wanted to go out his own way, found his body at the apartment. Hung himself, it seems.</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> Damn it. Recovered a suicide note?</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lead:</strong> Didn't have enough time. We were getting our asses swarmed by dash-ones. Barely made it out with some items you might find noteworthy. Speaking of dash-ones, your gonna want to pull my feed. Don't think I've seen that many of those things roaming around in one spot. Gotta be a record or something.</p>
<p><strong>Calvary Command:</strong> Noted, we'll debrief back at base. Good work Delta Team.</p>

MUHC kept my research position open, which is a relief. Familiar routines help. The doctors recommended I keep a digital journal: something to anchor myself while my mind “reintegrates.”<br/>

<p>Strange moment today.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I walked into a café near the institute. The barista greeted me by name, cheerful as anything. I couldn’t place her face , no flicker of recognition, nothing, but when she asked for my order, I answered automatically.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
No hesitation. No thought.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Like my body remembered something my mind refuses to touch.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>

Inside was a photo of me and a woman I don’t recognize.<br/>

But my chest tightened when I held it. A deep, aching familiarity I can’t explain. Something inside me… shifted. Changed. Like something fit into a keyhole.<br/>

<p>Professor Rousseau,<br/>
First and foremost: congratulations are in order. Managing to undo the amnestic treatment applied by the Jailors was no small feat. Some of us have been watching your progress from afar, and your developments with Janice have certainly piqued our interest.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We would like to offer you a choice. Work with us and you'll have access to resources the Foundation can only dream of, people who are as dedicated as you are to arm again their red right hand to plague us.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Decline, however, and we would be left with no other choice but to take matters into our own hands. You wouldn’t want that… would you, Professor?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We don’t intend to ask twice. Make haste with your decision.</p>

<p>A revelation tonight.<br/>

While working, I played music: an old habit. When “Daisy Bell” began, the organism stirred within her canister. Slowly. Gracefully. Like she was… listening.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The real Janice loved that song. We used to spend entire weekends hunting for old records. She said music made the world gentler.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Seeing the organism sway to that melody broke something inside me. She isn’t Janice. She never could be.<br/>
