<div class="scp-image-caption show">Photo of SCP-5380.</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-5380 is a homemade snowglobe with a paper divider placed through its center. On both sides of the divider, the phrase "I ❤️ U, Victor" is written. The (recently deceased) individual responsible for creating SCP-5380 has been identified as Leana Hernandez.</p>
<p>When shaken, SCP-5380 will shower the area it is located in with snowflakes and paper hearts, similar in appearance to the objects in the snowglobe.</p>
<p>Approximately five minutes after the initial activation, all objects created by SCP-5380 proceed to dematerialize, at which point, SCP-5380 is capable of being reactivated for the same effect.</p>
<p>At the bottom of SCP-5380, a message dedicated to the individual "Victor Hernandez" has been inscribed, reading:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>To Victor, my one and only beloved son.</em></p>
<p><em>"I let you into my world."</em><br/>
<em>"…And then, you became my World."</em><br/>
<em>—Ashiwarya Patra</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you'll live a good life.<br/>
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you more.</em></p>
<p><em>From, Your Mother.</em><br/>
<em>—Leana</em></p>

<h5 id="toc2"><span>Addendum 5380-1 — Discovery</span></h5>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-5380 was discovered when the individual "Victor Hernandez" (henceforth designated as PoI-1341) was sighted holding it within Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, BC. PoI-1341 was showing the object to his acquaintance when shortly after, SCP-5380 was dropped accidentally. As a result, the entire mall was showered with snowflakes and small paper hearts.</p>
<p>Two members of MTF Iota-3 ("Secrecy") were dispatched, utilizing cover story ("Cold Love"). Alongside this, the remaining members of Iota-3 were dispatched to locate and apprehend PoI-1341 and contain SCP-5380. On initial contact, PoI-1341 threatened violence against Iota-3, at which point he was incapacitated and brought into custody.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5 id="toc3"><span>Addendum 5380-2 — Interview</span></h5>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Three days after the apprehension of PoI-1341, as well as the containment of SCP-5380, PoI-1341 was interviewed for further information into the anomaly. A recording of the entire interview has been logged.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Ryne Monte<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Victor Hernandez (PoI-1341)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Good evening, Victor.</p>
<p><em>[PoI-1341 is unresponsive for a few seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> …Evening.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Ryne smiles faintly before continuing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions about SCP-5380?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> SCP-5380?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Yes, the snowglobe.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> …Right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Thank you for cooperating.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> <em>(Speaking in a quiet voice.)</em> What a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> If you could tell us when you came into contact with SCP-53— No, the snowglobe of yours, that'd be a great start.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> It was a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> A gift? From who?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> My mom. She died just recently, and it was her last gift to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> I'm… sorry, for your loss.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Don't— <em>(Deep breath)</em> sweat it. It's fine. Not your problem anyways.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Ryne hesitates to respond.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Do you know how she made it? The snowglobe, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> I don't know. We were too far from each other.</p>
<p><em>[PoI-1341 pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> My mom worked overseas. She went to Korea to teach a bunch of kids English. My dad at the time… he was dead. So my mom thought it was a great idea to work over in Korea, get a good stable job, and transfer the money to me so I could get on with life. I… had no idea she was working on a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> I see…</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Is there anything else? Can I have the snowglobe back?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Two more questions. Did she ever make anything like this back at your home? Even in Korea.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> …Yeah, she used to make a bunch of glasses and stuff. A real tiring job. She'd always make glass cups, vases, and shit before she moved to Korea. I guess she managed to get her hands on some of the equipment just to make… that last gift.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Right… And how about you? Do you know how to make anything like this?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> No. I tried it once and failed. Even after, I tried again as a parting gift to my mom. It just never worked out, I guess I'm not really capable, huh?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Ryne pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> I don't think that's what it is, if you don't mind me putting my two cents in. Maybe give it more time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> …I'll try. May I have the gift back now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> I'm very sorry, Victor. But we can't give you the snowglobe.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> It's… a policy thing.</p>
<p><em>[PoI-1341 is stunned]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Policy thing, huh? That's stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Look—</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> My mom and I never got in much contact after she moved, and you're taking the one and only thing that connects us together away from me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Look, Victor. We're sorry, but we just can't hand over the snowglobe.</p>
<p><em>[PoI-1341 takes a deep breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Is it possible if you could… bend the rules a bit?</p>
<p><em>[PoI-1341 pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Please.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ryne:</strong> Like I said, I'm sorry. We can't hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> <em>(His voice quivers)</em> Right… right, because of your rules. I get it.</p>
<p><em>[Tears form at the corner of PoI-1341's eyes. He slumps down in his chair and his face is facing the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-1341:</strong> Then I'm done here, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
Shortly after the interview was ended, PoI-1341 was escorted out of the room by on-site security.
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5 id="toc4"><span>Addendum 5380-3 — Delivery</span></h5>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>One month after the initial interview with PoI-1341, a package delivered to Dr. Ryne Monte was found within the Site-53 priority mail drop-off. Inside the package was a snowglobe wrapped in a heavy pile of sawdust. When a member of Foundation staff picked up the snowglobe to deliver it to the recipient, Site-53 and the surrounding area was hit by a rainstorm lasting fifteen minutes; this also caused anomalous indoor rainfall. No further deliveries containing items with similar properties have been received; investigations into the incident are ongoing.</p>
