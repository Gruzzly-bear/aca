<p>SCP-4299 <em>(circa 2015)</em></p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4299</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A greenhouse has been constructed around the garden occupied by SCP-4299 and a 50m<sup>2</sup> area surrounding the structure has been blocked from civilian access. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">General maintenance of the garden and the greenhouse are to be carried out as needed by specially trained Level-2 Personnel.</span></p>
<p>SCP-4299-1 instances are to be monitored until a Bloom Event occurs. Individuals affected by Bloom Events are to be immediately secured and amnestics are to be administered to any witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4299 is a sapient pink rose located in a small rose garden in Domfront, France. It is capable of verbal communication, producing speech from its stigma, and its petals move as if to imitate a mouth when it speaks. SCP-4299 is also able to move its stem to face the subjects it is interacting with and uses the leaves along its length as hands. SCP-4299 is highly conversational and will interact with any subjects which approach it. Removing SCP-4299 from its location will result in the rose in which the entity formerly manifested in becoming non-anomalous. SCP-4299 will then manifest again in another rose within the garden.</p>
<p>Subjects which interact with SCP-4299 for the length of a conversation experience lowered blood pressure, relaxation of nerves, and a sensation often described as 'soothing.' At the end of a conversation with SCP-4299, it will offer the subject interacting with it one of its petals. Should subjects accept SCP-4299's offer and consume the offered petal, they will become an instance of SCP-4299-1. Regardless of whether its offer was accepted or denied, SCP-4299 will refuse to engage in further communication with the subject.</p>
<p>In instances of SCP-4299-1, the effects of interacting with SCP-4299 are permanent, persisting through the administration of amnestics. SCP-4299-1 instances will also report a higher than average level of happiness and will not suffer from negative mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, etc.</p>
<p>SCP-4299 also appears to have a secondary anomalous effect of being able to change the writing found on paper. (See Incident.1223.)</p>
<p><strong>Bloom Events:</strong> Bloom Events occur upon the expiration of an instance of SCP-4299-1, regardless of cause. Naturally occurring Bloom Events typically occur in SCP-4299-1 instances of old age <em>(usually septuagenarian or octogenarian)</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and will take place in their home or similar places of comfort. The subject will enter a state of rest and fall asleep for upwards of an hour before ceasing all life functions. Upon expiration, the remaining corpse will demanifest and be replaced with pink rose petals. Petals created by Bloom Events are non-anomalous.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPERIMENT-4299-1:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Subject D-5341 was selected for the experiment due to a background of severe depression. D-5341 was introduced into SCP-4299 to test the immediate effects of the anomaly. D-5341 was outfitted with a radio transmitter as well as a body camera. The following is an audio transcript of D-5341 interacting with SCP-4299.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;<strong>BEGIN LOG</strong>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>D-5341:</strong> Alright, I'm ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Please walk around the garden. Do not touch the lapel microphone or any roses unless prompted by SCP-4299. You are to inquire upon its origin and engage it in conversation. Keep it talking as long as you can.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> Alright, Doc.</p>
<p><em>D-5341 rounds the garden, looking around and pausing before the fountain. He looks in, then approaches a rosebush.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Bonjour, jeune homme! N'est-ce pas une belle journée?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup><br/>
<br/>
<em>(D-5341 jumps.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> It's a fucking talking rose.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Oh, l'anglais? Ça fait un moment mais je suppose que je peux essayer…<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Please, take a seat!<br/>
<br/>
<em>D-5341 takes a seat on the ground before SCP-4299.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> …Okay. This is officially the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> I'm sure it can be a tad strange, but I promise you the weirdest things in life are usually the ones you won't forget!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> Uh…yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> I'm sure you must be a little co- Oh, goodness where are my manners! I am the Queen of Roses, my dear. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 mimics a curtsy.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> …huh.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Why so stiff? Je ne mords pas!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup><br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> I uh… I know it isn't my business, but could you please tell me how you became the way you are? Or at least how you can, uh…talk?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> I'm not sure what you mean by that. I've been watching over the roses for as long as I can remember. That's what makes me happy, and that's honestly all I could ask for.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> I see… Um… could you maybe explain a little more about that? Like, what it is you do exactly?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> My boy, you are a guest in my lovely garden, and we take turns here! I'd like to ask you a question too. How did you become the way you are?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> That isn't exactly something that I'm willing to go into. It's a bit of a sensitive topic.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> We all have some skeletons in our closet, non? Perhaps it would help you if you talked about it a bit? I'm open ears!</p>
<p><em>(D-5341 sighs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-5341:</strong> Okay, I get, I get it… I mean… I'm already this deep in, so I guess whatever I say doesn't matter… I did something that I regret. I made some decisions that I really shouldn't have. When I was in my teen years, I became friends with some shady people. Whenever I was around them, I would feel like I was someone, you know? I did anything to get their attention and to be accepted by them… And they just started asking me to do more and more and… I killed someone. I killed someone and I got caught, and I regret it. Not because I got caught, but… because I was so stupid to let myself get strung along so far! <em>(D-5341 begins to choke up.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Darling, you're too hooked on the past. <em>"Qui n’avance pas, recule, oui?"</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> On the outside, your experiences have made you think that you don't belong anywhere. But I can see inside of you. You have a heart longing for joy, but you do not let yourself move ahead. You don't have to forgive yourself right now, but you never will unless you start doing something!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> Gosh… I… I guess you're right. Man, I feel good right now…Why am I feeling like this?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> It's because you finally let go of your chains, you silly boy. Talking about your ails is the first step in becoming well.</p>
<p><em>(D-5341 sniffles.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>D-5341:</strong> God… I… I'm… so glad I could talk to you…<br/>
<br/>
<em>(D-5341 continues to weep. SCP-4299 leans forward towards the subject and caresses his leg with its leaf.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Shh, it's okay young one, let it all out. The happiness you are feeling at this very moment is beautiful, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>D-5341:</strong> Y-yeah, it is…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well, let me tell you something, dear. <em>(SCP-4299 reaches for its petals, producing one and offering it to D-5341.)</em> If you take this leaf and make it into a tea and drink it, you will be able to feel the joy you're feeling right now for as long as you want.</p>
<p><em>(D-5341 takes the petal and is silent for a moment.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> What do you say, dear? Will you join me in seeing life in pink?</p>
<p>&lt;<strong>END LOG</strong>&gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-5341 exited the garden and asked for the necessary tools to make tea. They were permitted to accept SCP-4299's offer and become an instance of SCP-4299-1. In the following weeks, D-5341 displayed a notable shift in attitude and disposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An appointment with the Site-55 psychiatrist was scheduled two months following Experiment 4299-1. Dr. May noted D-5341 did not display any traits typical of clinical depression and the subject reported to be content.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> The first anomalous instance regarding SCP-4299 was recorded on June 15th, 2015 after several eye-witness reports of a woman 'erupting into petals' were investigated. Mobile Task Force Pi-16 <em>(Hedgeclippers)</em> was dispatched to investigate the garden. The following transcription is of a letter recovered nearby the estimated location of the incident. Forensic analysis of the document identified the author as a 73-year-old woman named Mia Rosamonde. A cover story was created stating Rosamonde passed away due to cardiac arrest. Class-A amnestics were administered to witnesses of the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Maria,</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>You've grown up so much over the years.</em></p>
<p><em>Gosh, I loved watching you grow into such a beautiful woman.</em></p>
<p><em>Remember that one time when you were 5 when we went and ate an entire cake together? Then you fell asleep on my shoulder, and I carried you to your bedroom.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>I remember when I was just a girl, your grandmother used to sing me such a beautiful song. I believe it was called "La Vie en Rose"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. I wish I could hear her sing it again. I would say that I've lived my life in pink, everything has always been so beautiful to me ever since I first visited this garden as a little girl.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>I know it seems scary you're losing your other parent, but I want you to understand that the experiences we shared will never go away.</em></p>
<p><em>I love you so much, Maria.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Inside of this envelope, I'm leaving you a pink rose I picked from this garden. I made sure to find the prettiest one just for you. Hold onto this rose for me when it dries up, okay?</em></p>
<p><em>Love,</em></p>
<p><em>Mom</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research into Rosamonde's family record revealed a daughter by the name 'Maria' who passed away on September 15th, 2012. There are currently no living relatives remaining from the family.</p>
<p>MTF Pi-16 agent <a href="/scp-3358">Craig Hart</a> was the first to locate and interact with SCP-4299. Hart refused SCP-4299's offer as per mission control's orders.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4299.2:</strong> On June 25th, 2015, Dr. Carter was assigned as the primary researcher of SCP-4299. Below is a transcript of the first interview session.</p>

<br/>
<strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Hello, SCP-4299. My name is Dr. Carter. I've been assigned as your caretaker from here on out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Bonjour, Carter! Isn't it a lovely evening?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yes, I suppose it is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well, don't just stand there monsieur, take a seat where I can see you face to face.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Carter sits on the ground nearby SCP-4299.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Since you failed to answer this question for the D-Class we sent in a week ago, I'm going to have to ask this question myself. What is your motivation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Oui, it is really quite the tale!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 giggles to itself.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Will you please tell me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> How about this, Carter. If you let me ask you a question, then <em>maybe</em> I'll answer yours?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I'm not here to have a conversation with you SCP-4299. I'm here to ask you several questions so we could possibly learn more in regard to-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> You're speaking with me right now, oui? Does that not mean you are here to have a conversation with me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I suppose it does.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well, if we're both speaking to each other, why shouldn't we have a friendly chat?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Just answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> The best way I can answer that is with another question. You do value happiness, yes Carter?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I value your cooperation in-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Slow down, dear. I just want an honest response.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Carter can be heard taking a deep breath.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yes, I do value happiness.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> That is why I do what I can to make others happy. True happiness comes from giving to others, I've always lived my life in such a manner.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You realize that by giving your 'happiness' away, you're just harming yourself physically? Your petals are a part of you SCP-4299.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> You see, that is your problem, honey. I gave you an answer, yet you're far too wrapped up in your work so you hardly interact with anyone who wants to be friendly toward you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> What? No, I-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Don't you see? You're doing it right now silly! Loosen it up a tad. <em>“Vous voulez ce que vous avez et vous aurez ce que vous voulez”</em>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> I can see it in you, darling. You want love, but what you fail to realize is that you already have it.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Carter provides no response.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well, here is the first step in what you can do to change that.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 plucks one of its petals and hands it to Dr. Carter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> If you go and make this petal into a tea, I can promise you that you will learn how to see life in pink.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Carter stares at the petal for a minute before speaking.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> … No. I'm sorry, but I have to refuse.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well then. To each their own, I suppose. Au revoir, Dr. Carter.</p>

</div>
<p>Following the interview, SCP-4299 refused to speak with Dr. Carter any further. It was decided that in order to continue researching SCP-4299, separate interviewers would be required in order to gain more information on SCP-4299's anomalous abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4299.3:</strong> SCP-4299 was observed as wilting on July 26th, 2018. The entity's condition was closely monitored over a month-long period during which SCP-4299 shed most of its petals and looked sickly in appearance. Jr. Researcher Benjiro was instructed to enter the garden and approach SCP-4299 to investigate as a surrogate for Dr. Carter.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> <em>(Faintly)</em> Yes, I suppose I am, but that isn't my real name. That's just what the people that visit me call me, ha…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Mademoiselle, if you're here to try and learn how to see life in pink, I'm afraid I just can't help you. I don't know if I have it in me anymore…</p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Yes, well, my name is Madison Benjiro, I'm currently only a junior researcher so you don't have to call me Doctor or anything. I'm here to ask you a few questions today.</p>
<p><em>(Jr. Researcher Benjiro pulls out a sheet of questions from her right pocket.)</em></p>

<strong>Benjiro:</strong> I heard that you speak French as your first language. I'm not so sure how many researchers offer you this, but I know how to speak a little bit if it's easier for you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> No dear, English is just fine for me. I don't want to cause you to stutter.</p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Okay, English it is then. First question, why are you wilted? Is something bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Well… there is something that is bothering me. It seems as though nobody ever comes to me for help anymore. It's just… saddening. The people that come to me have all been very kind to me, but they just won't let me help them. I haven't been able to help a single person in 3 years…</p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Well, why should you have to worry about that? You don't have any stresses in your life, so why should you feel be feeling upset?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Why? It breaks my heart, Mademoiselle. These people that visit me now… all of them have troubles. Every time I've tried to help them, they've always just denied me… I don't understand what it is that I've done wrong. I want to say that I've been able to help them to an extent, but…</p>

<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Hey, come on now, calm down. You're okay.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 calms down, Jr. Researcher Benjiro kneels down on one knee next to SCP-4299. Jr. Researcher Benjiro folds up the questions sheet and places it inside her right pocket.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> I understand what you're feeling, okay? I've been working for the Foundation for a little under a year, these researchers can be cold. You can't let them get under your skin, okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> <em>(Sniffling between words)</em> Miss Benjiro… if I can't make people happy, then what is my purpose?</p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Well… when I was younger my mother told me once that your happiness can't be handed out to others; you need to start with your own happiness first. I think it's okay to talk and help other people, but if it starts affecting you physically or mentally then I think you need to consider taking a step back. There usually isn't an easy solution to every problem.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4299:</strong> Oh… okay… I'll have to think about this…</p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> Now then, could you straighten your stem a bit? I want to look at you clearly.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 straightens its stem and begins to face Jr. Researcher Benjiro.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Benjiro:</strong> See? There you go, that's a step up from what you looked like a minute ago. Now then, let's answer some questions, alright?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-4299 nods.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident 1223:</strong> Three weeks following Interview 4299.3, all the roses in SCP-4299's garden had spontaneously erupted into petals, including SCP-4299. 24 hours subsequent to the incident, the document initially recovered upon the discovery of SCP-4299 anomalously changed to have a new message on the back side of the paper. Said document has been transcribed below.</p>
