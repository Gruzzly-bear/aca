I wish you didn't start crying when I asked you not to do something. I wish you didn't tell me all that stuff about you <em>days</em> after we moved in together.

<p>The Vatican City's Relic Recovery Office located the first 13 corpses between 1962 and 1965. Soon after the Second Vatican Council's conclusion, Pope Paul VI turned the anomaly over to the Foundation for safekeeping. The existence of further instances was unverified at the time, but because of persistent legends surrounding Yehoshua Ben Yosef's travels, further research continued up until December 1997, when the number of instances found exceeded the abilities of the designated containment team.</p>
<p>Since then, containment has been moved from active to passive — the Foundation will investigate and acquire more manifestations of SCP-6109 if the anomaly is brought up by an outside group, but the Foundation itself will no longer actively track the anomaly.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Due to the consistent rate of which SCP-6109 instances are recovered, concerns have been raised over the <a href="/a-once-and-future-king">possibility of retrocasual manipulation</a>. Since each cadaver is proven to belong to Yehoshua Ben Yosef, but they all appear to have died along different timelines, the fact they are all existing in the present day may suggest a temporal anomaly.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the former containment procedures have been reenacted, with the <a href="/welcome-to-delta-t">Department of Temporal Anomalies</a> placed in control of the project (see <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong></span>).</p>
<p>Interfering with the historical Yehoshua Ben Yosef's life is typically prohibited in temporal operations due to its significance to human history; these provisions have been suspended due to a force already taking action.</p>
<p>Muhammad al-Taqi, a former Director of Tactical Theology, has come out of retirement to work as a Temporal agent. He was selected due to his advanced knowledge in the field of religious history, proficiency in multiple dialects of Mizrahi Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew, and previous communications with associated deities.</p>
<p>al-Taqi will be temporally relocated approximately one day after Yehoshua Ben Yosef is crucified, in order to determine where the living SCP-6109 instances manifest, and then begin tracking them. He has been provided with rations to last one year, including reed pens and papyrus scrolls to communicate with the Foundation across time.</p>
<p>Once al-Taqi indicates he has completed his mission, a retrieval mission will be launched. The specifics of the operation are currently under discussion.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum:</strong></span> The Vatican City's Relic Recovery Office privately investigated the home of Diana Duyser in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, after reports were filed concerning the appearance of an SCP-6109 instance in the crawlspace of her basement.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="Crawlspace_under_house.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6109/Crawlspace_under_house.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The area where Diana Duyser discovered the scroll.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though the instance could not be located, a papyrus scroll was discovered in its place, sealed with cloth between two pieces of glass. The scroll was created approximately 1,998 years ago; though the introduction and closing note were written in Biblical Hebrew, the main body is written in Judeo-Yemeni Arabic.</p>
<p>It was removed for study, and the occupants of the household were amnesticized.</p>
<p>The scroll was initially taken in for investigation, possibly for authenticity and veneration. Though the exact details of the investigation are unknown, the Office were able to deduce that the scroll was produced by, or at least associated with, the Foundation. The Office took immediate offense.</p>
<p>Despite attempts by the Foundation's ambassador, Sheldon Katz, Esq., to quell discontentment, the Office threatened to use the scroll as evidence against the Foundation's competence to the wider normalcy-protection community. In order for the Foundation to retrieve the scroll and stop its publicization, they issued the following demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The release of all information pertaining to the Foundation's investigation into the life of Yehoshua Ben Yosef;</li>
<li>The return of the body of the SCP-6109 instance who was killed in 34 CE;</li>
<li>A private, formal apology addressed to the Pope.</li>
</ul>
<p>The O5 Council deferred these demands to the Department of Temporal Anomalies. After three days of discussion, Temporal Anomalies acquiesced to the demands with no alterations.</p>
<p>The requested SCP-6109 instance is on-route to Vatican City by helicopter. Sheldon Katz, Esq., was given the scroll to personally present to Temporal Anomalies, and is currently drafting a message to the Pope.</p>
<p>The scroll has been translated to English, digitized, and attached to this file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>1</sup> To the Director — I am writing this segment after the account below. I am currently deep in a bog. It is hot, disgusting, and I am suspended in a canopy of leaves over a green river. There are many bugs and I miss home. In other news, I do believe I have discovered the source of our current predicament — allow my self to explain.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>2</sup> For two years I followed Him on foot, then camel, across three countries. From the tip of the Roman provinces to the deep heart of Lebanon, I have cornered Him at a dock. He plans on sailing, but refused to discuss where to with anyone — He offered a vague countenance to the man He rented the ship from, then spoke this:</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> "What do you wish to see from me?"</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> The man, who I now understand is a fisher from Galilee, laughed in His face. "I wish to hear your destination, son of man." Yehoshua laughed in return, and spoke: "I will tell you when I return." The fisher nodded, and He continued, "<a href="/are-we-cool-yet-hub">&lt;unintelligible&gt;</a>?" The fisher patted His shoulder in acceptance.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Though now I understand the purpose of the anomaly, I did not yet understand its method — so I continued to follow Him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Yehoshua set some objects down on the ship, that I did not see, then went into a nearby village to acquire a crew. It is here I snuck upon Him in a bar; while He spoke and drank with freebooters and piscators and drunk sluggards, I came upon Him and requested to join Him on His journey. He questioned me, if I understood His purpose of being here; I replied I did not, I merely wished to join Him in His resurrected glory. He shook His head. I do not know how or why, but He did not believe my words. I asked Him directly, and at first He waved me off — He twisted back to speak to me: I was permitted to join Him, He said, but I was not a true believer. He would prove His divine essence to me in time, but He could see in my heart I was not one of His own.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Though this did hurt me to hear, in some aspects I agreed. In time He acquired a small group of followers, 13 including myself, and we were to set sail the next day.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>8</sup> We boarded the next day, and I could not find His cabin to inspect His belongings. Covertly, I questioned His selected first mate where He would sleep, to which he replied that He would be sleeping on the bow of the ship.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> I was perplexed by this, but we had no time to discuss further. He had called upon us into haste; we were to depart as soon as we could, and we had to get Him to His secret destination as fast as possible.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> We worked for many hard months, but He was always working beside us. We sang as we worked, and He always sang with us. He was as kind as described, but He had a detachment from us that was unsettling. I admit I too was detached, so I did not judge Him harshly, but when he entered the below-decks, disappearing entirely from view, we had to admit it was somewhat unnerving.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> One night He went below-decks and did not return for some days. The weather, though misty, was fair, and we believed we were on the proper course.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>12</sup> I awoke uneasily to a pure and deep silence. Even the water seemed to come to a standstill.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup> I stepped from my cabin and into the cellar, exploring each corner. I didn't see a soul, but more importantly, the ship had become unfamiliar to me — areas I only vaguely recognized on the pretense they <em>should</em> be there, rather than they <em>were</em> there. It was as though the ship had been reduced to the minimal functions — simplified.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> I heard creaking from above. After some hesitant wandering, I came upon the stairs to the deck.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup> When I emerged from the cellar, He was standing alone, facing away from me. I saw in the distance a gathering mist, not a storm, but pure evaporation. I called out to Him, and he turned to face me. He spoke: "Muhammad, join me on the bow. Look at the kingdom that comes near — what do you see?"</p>
<p><sup>16</sup> I looked out on the sea and I saw nothing but mist. When I said this, He nodded and patted my back.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup> He said this: "Mist is an accumulation of water. Millions and millions of droplets rising into the sky, spreading thin across the horizon. This is the same of me."</p>
<p><sup>18</sup> I turned to him in confusion, and felt my body freeze at the sight —</p>
<p><sup>19</sup> What I saw was this — He spread His arms across the bow of the ship, stepping almost out into the air, and split in twain, then again, then again, then again, then again, and out in the distance I saw more ships emerging from the mist. They too split in twain, then again, until the sky and sea and land beneath were covered in Him and His ships, sailing to a billion shores, a billion coasts.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> His voice, from Above, told me this: "There is no where I have gone and no where I have been. My presence is derived from <a href="/its-not-real-it-never-was-you-pathetic-fools">absence</a>. Where you walked I did not walk; I leave no footprints, for I do not traverse. There is no where you can find me, for from there, I will disappear, too."</p>
<p><sup>21</sup> "I walk on water, indeed, I do, for the ocean is a place with no memory. The sea does not look up at its traversers. It looks down into the blackness, its inky emptiness, and it forgets. There are no footprints on waves. Where light does not touch, beneath the waves? There is no where, and that is where I will be."</p>
<p><sup>22</sup> He fell down — all of Him, in a heap, and the flags on the ships became matted and black and the ships became empty. With no one to steer, my ship drifted off into mist, narrowly sliding between a flurry of sister-ships, identical in their dilapidation.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup> I called for Him, "<tt>LORD</tt>, what could you possibly mean? Where could you possibly go?"</p>
<p><sup>24</sup> He repeated Himself under the guise of a rainstorm: "What do you wish to see from me?"</p>
<p><sup>25</sup> I yelled back: "Your destination!" He replied, his voice growing faint: "No where."</p>
<p><sup>26</sup> My disheartened eyes must have met his, somewhere in the sky, as, his final words to me were this: "&lt;unintelligible.&gt;"</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> I wanted to answer no, but in my heart I believe we were.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup> His voice became silent and all that was left was the rain. When I looked down, indeed, I saw the darkness in the ocean.</p>
<p><sup>29</sup> I know not where I sail to next, only that I will arrive there, and I will arrive with a corpse. This is a delivery — all these ships, deliveries, merchant ships carrying cargo.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup> I know not where He wishes to be delivered, only that I will have to follow him.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup> I will implant this in the dirt wherever I may arrive. I hope this is of use to you.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup> Muhammad al-Taqi, forever —</p>
<p><sup>33</sup> Secure, contain, protect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whereabouts of Muhammad al-Taqi are unknown, but scouting missions across the known SCP-6109 sites have been authorized.</p>

<p><strong>PoI-6109:</strong> How much longer do we have to do this? I'd like to go home.</p>
<p><strong>Katz:</strong> Just— one more question. Would you believe me if I said I was a prophet of God?</p>
<p><em>PoI-6109 smiles nervously. Katz smiles back. Both begin laughing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Katz:</strong> Thank you, Muhammad. That'll be all.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-6109:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>PoI-6109 is escorted out of the interview room. Katz stares forward for a short amount of time, then folds his arms on the table. He lays his head down, and remains there.</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closing Statement:</span></strong> PoI-6109 was recovered in a confused state at his <a href="/scp-1551">home</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Despite enhanced interrogation, followed by mnestic treatment, PoI-6109 does not recall his employment with the Foundation.</p>

<p>Governmental and internal records diverge heavily on PoI-6109's personal history — it appears he continued to live a civilian life during the years where he should have been the Director of the Department of Tactical Theology. Records recovered from "reality restructuring" resistant databases indicate that this civilian identity is the true chain of events; effectively, the only evidence of PoI-6109's Foundation employment comes from the Foundation itself.</p>
<p>PoI-6109 is under protective surveillance for the time being. The building across from his home has been purchased and renovated by Foundation agents to facilitate this.</p>
<p>Since his recovery, no further SCP-6109 instances have been found. The instances already in containment have begun to show signs of structural decay.</p>
<p>The Vatican has returned the body of the crucified SCP-6109 instance on the grounds that they do not believe it is authentic. All instances in Foundation custody have been moved to Acroamatic Abatement.</p>
