<p>SCP/8886 is currently contained in a standard containment chamber at SITE-303. Security cameras located within SCP/8886’s containment chamber are to have undergone specialised SCRAMBLE Protocol modification, in order to prevent security personnel from being subjected to the anomaly.</p>
<p>Custody of SCP/8886 is currently split between the Department of Demonology (containment) and the Department of Tactical Theology (research). At least once a day, a member of D-Class personnel is to be subjected to SCP/8886 in order to glean more information about SCP/8886/A<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>SCP/8886 during an SCP/8886/B event.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></span> SCP/8886 is an analog, CRT television, dated to 1987. SCP/8886 remains turned on and at full power even when not connected to any power source, and continuously displays a video recording now designated SCP/8886/A.</p>
<p>SCP/8886/A is a video recording that constantly emanates from SCP/8886. SCP/8886/A is a static shot of a green hill, upon which is a large, wooden cross. Upon this cross is a figure bearing resemblance to the religious figure of Jesus Christ<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. This figure is nailed to the cross by the hands and ankles, but does not visibly bleed, and regularly emits sounds of great distress. SCP/8886/A does not appear to loop, and seems to either be an extremely long, if not infinite, video, or a form of ‘live-stream’.</p>
<p>SCP/8886/A is a form of visual cognitohazard. Individuals that observe SCP/8886/A will begin feeling symptoms such as pain in the hands and ankles, the taste of blood in their mouth, the feeling of dehydration, the feeling of intense sun on their face, and heavy sensitivity of the eyes. Individuals who continue to observe SCP/8886/A will begin to experience vivid vision of being strung up on a cross and crucified. These hallucinations appear to have a continuous story, but are almost always interrupted by SCP/8886/B, before the full story can be experienced. Following an SCP/8886/B occurrence, the story resets to the beginning with the next individual.</p>
<p>SCP/8886/A shows signs of interference, and is often interrupted by bouts of static that entirely block out the video. For ease of reference, these bouts of static have been designated SCP/8886/B. SCP/8886/B instances interrupt SCP/8886/A in such a way that SCP/8886/A’s cognitohazardous effect is nullified. This makes it difficult for the hallucinations to be fully experienced and understood.</p>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>ADDENDUM 8886/1:</strong></span> On 02/06/2006, SCP/8886/A experienced the single longest recorded run without SCP/8886/B, allowing D-6786, the current test subject for SCP/8886, to experience the currently most complete record of SCP/8886/A’s hallucinations.</p>

<p><em>When the vision started, I was being dragged up the greenest of hills, by two guards. I didn’t have my clothes, only a clean, white, cloth around my waist. When we got to the top, I saw the cross, lying in the grass. They laid me down, and they started nailing my hands down. That’s when the pain began.</em></p>
<p><em>They then did my ankles. Those were a lot harder to get through with the nails they were using, but it did the job, and soon I was bound to the cross. I did not bleed.</em></p>
<p><em>They had a rope attached to the top of the cross, and they used it to pull the cross up to a standing position. That’s when I saw the crowd gathering on the hill before me. Some were weeping. Some were laughing. Some were indifferent. That’s when another man walked up to the cross, and fixed a wooden plate above my head. The plate held a single word:</em></p>

<p><span style="color: #f6c403">ε-5 deploys, and all members proceed cautiously into the structure. ε5-Alpha orders all members to have weapons drawn and ready to fire. All members comply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">They enter through the ruined archway into the interior. ε5-Victor makes a comment about the state of the structure. ε5-Alpha orders him to be quiet. ε5-Victor makes further comment about ε5-Alpha’s leadership abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">A small disturbance is heard from within the structure. All members are immediately wary, and raise their weapons. ε5-Alpha cautiously walks towards the source of the disturbance. When the coast appears to be clear, she orders all other members to continue. ε5-Bravo makes a comment about “this place freaking her the hell out”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">The team reaches the centre of the structure, which contains a stone well, which appears to stretch down indefinitely. The team hears footsteps from behind them, and immediately turn, weapons raised. They see a figure which seems to be a priest, wearing white robes. His eyes have been gruesomely cut out, and replaced with two small, wooden crosses. The figure has a euphoric smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">ε5-Alpha orders the figure to stop moving. The figure ignores her order, and slowly approaches the team. It raises its arms slowly, and begins incoherently mumbling words which appear to be latin.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #f48237">“<strong>jesu christe salvator noster qui in cruce mortuus est pro peccatis nostris in vita post- ueni gaude eum gaudere gaude gaude gaude gaude</strong>”</span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">The figure continues to approach despite ε5-Alpha’s orders. When the figure is approx. 2 meters away from the team, ε5-Bravo shoots her rifle, killing the figure instantly. Several team members protest, but ε5-Bravo remains adamant it was the right decision. ε5-Alpha appears indifferent, and orders the team to keep moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">As the teams descends further, the cathedral becomes a labyrinthine structure with several dark rooms. The teams splits up and begins searching individual rooms. ε5-Sierra reports finding several malnourished humanoid beings cowering among rubble in a collapsed section. One of the beings becomes hostile, and ε5-Sierra is forced to execute the group. Anti-Akiva readings increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f6c403">After approx. 30 minutes of searching the structure, ε5-Victor reports discovering a “weird-ass TV”. At this point, ε5-Victor’s camera feed is interrupted by heavy static, and he becomes unresponsive. When the other team members converge on ε5-Victor’s location, they find him dead, nailed to a wooden cross. SCP/8886 sits on the ground before the cross. ε5-Bravo is ordered to collect SCP/8886, and the team makes a hasty retreat.</span></p>

This was completely different to how the facility looked on the outside. I think I'm starting to understand the 'Reality Restructuring' bit a lot more now.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">The inside… god. It was awful. The room was massive, at least 30 meters long in one direction, with a considerably taller ceiling. All the personnel from SITE-303, 200 of 'em, I think, they were lined up along both walls of the room, in two neat rows, and they were… god, they were all</span></em> <span style="color: #f48237">crucified<em>! They were writhing on the crosses, but not in pain, but in… bliss? I think?</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">We didn’t do anything for a while now, because, obviously, we were pretty shook. Lexi even had to step out for a minute, y’know, get some fresh air. But we had a job to do, and we sure as hell were gonna do it.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">Even after we got our composure, it was still pretty fuckin’ creepy seeing all these people, some of them friends, strung up like this like it was some sort of religious orgy.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">I gotta give this anomaly credit; if it was trying to send a message, it sure as fuck did. Even being in there just made us want to scram. If that was an anomalous effect, or just a natural human reaction, I can’t tell. Maybe a little bit of both. And while we were already pretty fuckin’ wary of the place, I don’t think anything could’ve prepared us for what was in the centre of the room.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">Okay. I’m over-exaggerating, but it was still pretty terrible.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">There was the Site Director, the Edwin guy, I think, and he was crouching on the floor. His hands and feet were nailed down to the floor, kinda like how the people on crosses’ hands and feet were nailed like that. And he was in a complete trance. He didn’t respond to anything we threw at him. And yes, I did try punching.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">And SCP/8886, the one y’all were talking about earlier? Yeah, he was staring right at it. Completely entranced. I’ve read what it does to people. He was probably having his own spiritual awakening or something.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">But the weirdest thing wasn’t even Edwin, it was the</span></em> <span style="color: #f48237">TV<em>. If there’s one thing it’s going for it, it’s the static. The fizz, the buzz. We even heard it when we were walking in here. But the screen… it wasn’t all staticky anymore. None of that /B stuff. Clear, crisp footage of Jesus Fucking Christ on the cross.</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">…</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">I don’t think you understand what this means, doctor. The /B instances, they were the ones protecting us. They were the ones resetting the anomaly before shit got real. Now there’s none of that anymore.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f48237">And D-6786? That was just the beginning.</span></em></p>

<p><em>A while later, when I’d grown numb and cold, oblivious to my surroundings, did four men appear in front of me. They were… strange, and robed, and one held in his hand a camera, one a tape, and one a television set. They looked upon me, and talked.</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em><span style="color: #f1411c">”Is this really necessary?”</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="color: #ffffff">”Shush it. We’ve made up our minds. No further argument is necessary.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ed0000">”Well get on with it! I haven’t got all day to stand out in the sun in front of some dried up</span></em> <span style="color: #ed0000">messiah<em>,”</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #f1411c">”How dare you! This man is-“</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #ffffff">”All of you, be quiet! Now get on with it, for god’s sake!”</span></em></p>
</div>
<p><em>The man with the camera then set it up with a tripod in front of me. I could see my reflection in the lens. I looked so frail, and weak. The man with the tape, the one who had been protesting earlier, reluctantly slotted it into the camera. The one with the TV set it down at my feet, facing them.</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em><span style="color: #ed0000">”I mean, there are plenty of other ways to do something like this-“</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="color: #f1411c">”Are you sure? I could’ve sworn I heard something about smells…”</span></em></p>
</div>
<p><em>The man with the camera then looked at the others. They all wore faces of intense anticipation. He then pressed a button on the camera, and a faint</em> BEEP <em>was heard.</em></p>
<p><em>The last thing I saw, before losing consciousness again, was some text, flashing on the corner of my vision:</em></p>

<p><strong>A Little History:</strong> In the olden days of SCP, everyone was scrambling for the SCP-666 slot. Why woudln’t they? It’s the number o’ the devil! And, as the author of the current SCP-666 puts it, a particularly bad one was a tv that plays Jesus getting crucified. That immediately gave me the idea for a creepy, analog horror SCP, and I got to writing.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that uploaded, as this is my first successful SCP!</p>
