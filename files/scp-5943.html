            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5943</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to SCP-5943 anomalous traits, containment of the anomaly is theoretically impossible, any personnel under level 3+ who detect and hear SCP-5943 transmissions are to be detained and amnestizised.</p>
<p>Any non-foundation personnel are to be silenced if they attempt to report about the phenomena and administered amnestics depending on the time they discovered SCP-5943.</p>
<p>BINARY STAR is to continue the study of the SCP-5943 phenomena.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5943 is a phenomena which has been observed in the solar system and is hypothesized to occur in other advanced systems. SCP-5943 Is the transmissions of signal waves between planets which allows them to communicate between each other.</p>
<p>The conversations mainly include the planets talking about any threats that they might be faced with. and at times they might be regular conversations or conversations without known meaning.</p>
<p>Dr. Rynhart has been assigned to oversee BINARY STAR's studies of SCP-5943. Any new discoveries about SCP-5943 are to be documented.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5943 was discovered on 2020/4/20 after several unknown transmissions were detected by Dr. Tomer. Dr. Rynhart proposed that BINARY STAR would translate the signal waves which was accepted. After successfully being translated, the file of SCP-5943 was moved into the Beholder Program. All studies on SCP-5943 will be conducted only in said program.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong> After Dr. Rynhart took over the project, SCP-5943 has moved to the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-wiki.wikidot.com/into-the-void-hub:" target="_blank">Beholder Program Database.</a> The rest of this document is stored in The Beholder Program Database, access is only permitted to members of the beholder program or personnel who've gained special access.

<em>The Signals BINARY STAR is receiving are very low.</em></p>

<p><strong>P-3:</strong> Oh yeah Mercury, I am sure my atmosphere is strong enough to resist to most of the heat. I mean how do you think life even started on me? Sol would've burned me alive!</p>

<p><strong>P-1:</strong> I guess it WAS foolish of me to believe you can't survive it! I mean we don't talk a lot. Ah, I still remember when we were just a bunch of debris floating in space, the good old days… I wish I could bring them back.</p>
<p><strong>P-9:</strong> Hel- <em>It is theorized that the planet's signal was so weak that it could not travel a long distance, its messages stopped being detected.</em></p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Planets can store memories, it is unknown where. P-9 is presumed to be Pluto, its signals are weak and due to its distance BINARY STAR could not pick up its signals after it has went far enough for its signals to stop being detected. - Dr. Rynhart.</p>

<p>After careful voting, the O5 council has approved Dr. Rynhart's request of sending a Beholder-Probe to help study the SCP-5943 phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-04:</strong> Following the O5 council's approval of using a Beholder Probe construction began on a new and improved probe. The probe has BINARY_STAR.AIC files. It will upload any new information and or discoveries to BINARY STAR's database. The probe has built-in Satelite Discs to detect any signals during its study of SCP-5943. Future probes may be sent into different solar systems to investigate them.</p>

<p>Hello Authorized user, I don't know who you are but you probably are looking for the current status on SCP-5943, since I have such a workload in the Beholder Program, I plan to give my Assistant full access and responsibility into the study of SCP-5943.</p>
<p>I trust him with everything I got, he never disappoints with his work. The team working on SCP-5943 is a great one, I am sure they can get along.</p>
<p>We've sent a new Beholder Probe. Beholder Probe #16, it will be used to detect the SCP-5943 phenomena with greater ease. That's all for now, if you read the SCP-5943 file then you would get more information. We can talk in person at any time as well just message me back.</p>

<p>The SCP-5943 file will be updated in the future, I will make sure all new discoveries are sent to you if you request, but from now on all questions go to my Assistant.</p>
