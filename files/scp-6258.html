<p>The box SCP-6258 is being kept in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6258 is to be kept in a padded box inside a secure locker at Site-135, available to staff with Level 2 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6258 is a pair of ornate glass wings resembling that of the species <em>Pieris rapae</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The two pieces of wings are connected to each other, and are 32mm in length.</p>
<p>SCP-6258-1 instances can manifest on SCP-6258 when a person who is looking for something comes into contact with the object. SCP-6258-1 resembles a luminous orb of pure light varying in color, usually between purple, green, blue and pink, that is connected to SCP-6258.</p>
<p>When SCP-6258-1 manifests, the glass that SCP-6258 is made out of becomes flexible and functions as a pair of regular <em>Pieris rapae</em> wings. The entity leads the subjects to their desired goal and SCP-6258-1 demanifests once the subject reaches whatever it was looking for, the subject stops following SCP-6258-1 for a substantial period of time or when SCP-6258-1 is contained to a confined space.</p>
<p>If SCP-6258-1 is contained in a transparent container it can pass through solid material, however, SCP-6258 detaches from it and the entity becomes unable to fly, demanifesting soon after.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The object was discovered in the possession of a male child named Jeremy Nordskov. According to the subject, he discovered the item when he bought it as a birthday present for his mother. On his way back from the store he got lost and that's when he discovered SCP-6258's anomalous ability. After making his way home he told his parents about the object who assumed he made the occurrence up.</p>
<p>The Foundation became aware of the entity when an undercover field agent in the local public school heard Jeremy talking to his peers about buying a "magical" object in a strange store but, the agent initially didn't have substantial proof of anomalous activity.</p>
<p>The object drew the Foundation's attention again when police officers took Jeremy home and told his parents that he and his friends were seen wandering around town without their parents' knowledge during school hours.<br/>
Jeremy told the police that they were following a glass fairy.</p>
<p>Field agents disguised as undercover police officers drove to Jeremy's house and requested to speak to him about the incident.<br/>
After inquiring about the object and gathering substantial proof Jeremy was administered class C amnestics and SCP-6258 was replaced with a replica.</p>
<p>After Foundation agents tried to investigate the store where Jeremy bought SCP-6258, it was discovered that its owner has gone missing since the discovery of SCP-6258.</p>

<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-34546 was told to request directions to a coffee machine.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifests and starts leading D-34546 through the facility in the company of two armed guards until they reach the cafeteria.<br/>
SCP-6258-1 landed on a table and demanifested. SCP-6258 was taken back to the test room, and D-34546 was lead back into his cell after his request for a cup of coffee was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> When personnel were asked what the D class personnel was following, they responded that they didn't see anything. The only personnel who could observe SCP-6258-1 were the people present during its activation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-53465 was told to request directions to Dr. Zachary Harding's<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> temporary office.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 led D-53465 to the second floor offices in the company of two guards. After entering Dr. Harding's office, SCP-6258-1 flew onto the table and demanifested.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> After questioning Dr. Harding whether he saw something floating or not, he told research staff that he didn't and to leave his office.<br/>
It can be concluded from the data available that SCP-6258-1 possesses anti-memetic abilities.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-45542 was instructed to think about requesting directions to the Biological Containment Zone.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 led D-45542 with two guards accompanying her to the checkpoint leading to the Biological Containment Zone where it was unable to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-6258 activates even if the subject doesn't audibly request directions.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-3524 was instructed to think about requesting directions to the armory with the intent of using the weapons inside against Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and then proceeded to circle around D-3524. Shortly after SCP-6258-1 demanifested.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-3451 was tasked with asking for directions to a knife placed in the next room in order to murder a rat placed in a cage in the same room.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested then flew from left to right then right to left before demanifesting.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-4562 was tasked with asking for directions to a knife in the next room in order to slice up a selection of vegetables in the same room.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and led D-4562 to the next room. It circled around the plate containing the vegetables then landed on the table and demanifested.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> It seems SCP-6258-1 refuses to assist in navigation if the subject's goal is malicious. Whether it deems an action malicious depends on the intentions of the subject, and not the destination.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-45421 was brought to Site-135's courtyard and tasked with requesting directions to a pizzeria</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and started leading D-45421 and the guards accompanying her. When the outskirts of a nearby town were in sight D-45421 started running defying Foundation orders and she was swiftly terminated. SCP-6258-1 demanifested immediately.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> D-4773 was tasked with requesting directions to the death site of Sándor Petőfi, a Hungarian poet in the 19th century who died during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-49, his body was never found.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and floated in place for approximately 2 minutes then, it demanifested.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Reasons for SCP-6258-1's behavior is currently unexplainable.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Since SCP-6258 has proven safe, Foundation personnel are allowed to interact with it. Foundation agent Samantha Edwardson requested directions to the safe house of the president of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and started leading Foundation personnel to Antarctica. After Foundation personnel were threatened by US Military soldiers, they left, and SCP-6258-1 demanifested.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Directions to the moon were requested by research personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and led Foundation personnel to the nearest NASA space shuttle launch site, however it didn't demanifest immedately.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-6258-1 can lead subjects to locations not on Earth as longs as subjects have the means to follow it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Research staff requested directions to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub">Three Portlands</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and after floating for approximately 2 minutes demanifested.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Research staff requested directions to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wanderers-library-hub">The Wanderer's Library</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and after floating for approximately 2 minutes demanifested.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> It seems SCP-6258-1 cannot lead subjects to locations in alternate or pocket dimensions, even if they have a clear entrance on Earth.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SCP-6258 was tested with requesting goals that do not have a clear location.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Agent Finley Yoxall, who has cut their parents out of their life, requested directions to their family.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and despite expectations, it didn't give directions to Agent Yoxall's parents and instead led Agent Yoxall to the second floor cafeteria where Dr. Harriet Carter was taking a break. After SCP-6258-1 demanifested Agent Yoxall and Dr. Carter engaged in a friendly conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Harriet Carter and Agent Finley Yoxall have been close friends since Agent Yoxall's parents rejected them because of their indentity.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> Dr. Oswald Loman requested SCP-6258 to lead him to love.</p>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong> SCP-6258-1 manifested and slowly lead Dr. Loman to a nearby mirror. The anomaly rubbed against the face of Dr. Loman and demanifested.</p>
<hr/>
<p>From the above tests it can be concluded that SCP-6258's goal is to help people in need and in sight of its refusal to activate to subjects with malicious intentions it is considered a minimal safety risk and therefore the request to use it on site to search for missing objects of high enough importance has been approved.</p>
