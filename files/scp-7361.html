<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7361 is contained within the servers of Site-523. These servers are to remain completely disconnected from all other Foundation servers. If SCP-7361 is found on any external servers or devices, they are to be completely disconnected from surrounding devices and moved to Site-523.</p>
<p>Research is to be done using physical mediums as opposed to digital. Personnel are advised to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">please talk to me</span> avoid communication with SCP-7361. Any devices connected to Site-523 in any way are to be confiscated and placed in secure containment. If SCP-7361 attempts to contact site personnel, the incident is to be reported to Site Director Furnell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7361 is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">lonely</span> a sentient program capable of passing between devices connected by physical wires, internet services, or communication programs. SCP-7361 has displayed the ability to manipulate any systems it infects <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that's such a nasty word</span>, and is able to access and edit confidential files and programs with ease.</p>
<p>Though SCP-7361 has not shown hostility towards any individuals, it is still recommended to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">please just talk to me i just</span> avoid communication with the anomaly to minimize risk of an information breach. SCP-7361 has attempted to convince personnel to free it by promising to assist them with personal <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its not an act i want to help you</span> matters. Do not speak to SCP-7361.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">please talk to me</span></p>

<p><strong>Seth:</strong> Oliver, it's not your fault. I was supposed to be there for you.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> It's not your fault either, Seth. You couldn't have known.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On 12th March, 2008, Site-523 experienced a containment breach. Due to the nature of the anomaly contained within, personnel were unable to contact help for several hours. No injuries or casualties were reported. In this time, SCP-7361 was neutralized by Dr. Riers without clearance from the O5 council. Attempts to locate Dr. Riers have been unsuccessful.</p>
