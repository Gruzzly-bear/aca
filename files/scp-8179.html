<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Pending Safe Classification</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-8179 is to be classified in legal documentation as an office space that has been condemned due to health concerns. A 120m fenced perimeter has been established in order to monitor for emergent doorways and escaping SCP-8179-1 instances. Lethal force is authorized against all uncleared entities attempting to cross this barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">No personnel are allowed inside of SCP-8179 without explicit permission, only unmanned monitoring devices.</span></p>
<p>Due to recent incidents, SCP-8179 is to quarantined in a 4km radius of exclusion under the guise that the building contains hazardous levels of radioactive waste. No further manpower is to be dedicated at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8179 is an office building previously owned by GOI-078.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Spatial distortion has caused SCP-8179’s square footage to measure larger on the inside than its outside measurements would suggest; this distortion also manifests doors in unusual areas of the building such as in floors, on windows, beneath ceilings, etc. SCP-8179 also contains multiple individuals who have isolated themselves within it, who claim not only to be GOI-078 employees,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> but also the creators of the video games found on escaping SCP-8179-1 instances.</p>

<p>Part of SCP-8179’s interior.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A ritual site located within SCP-8179 is believed to be the cause of SCP-8179’s anomalous properties. This area is frequented by SCP-8179-1 instances, artificial Tartarean entities that appear to onlookers as 32-bit sprites from games developed by GOI-078. SCP-8179-1 instances display extreme aggression when prevented from exiting SCP-8179, though none have successfully lived more than 72 hours when removed from the building. It is unknown if these entities are sapient or if they have some further motivation connected to the individuals present inside SCP-8179.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8179 was discovered during GOI-078’s “shadow period”, a span of time in which the company was forced to liquidate most of their assets and downsize due to a tumultuous relationship with their primary creditor, GOI-012.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> SCP-8179 was discovered after multiple GOI-078 employees were reported missing, coinciding with the discovery of nascent TRE<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> fountains that caused the spontaneous combustion of household pets and children under the age of three in the area.</p>
<p>Efforts were made following containment to establish multiple unmanned outposts within SCP-8179 for the purpose of monitoring the building and investigating the ritual site within.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.8179.1:</strong> Seven months after the initial outposts’ construction, Tactical Theologist Dr. Dante Enfer and his team collected multiple documents believed to be instructions on the process of binding Tartarean entities to GOI-078's products. Examination of the documents found that they were in mint condition and almost wholly without fingerprints, suggesting they were only viewed by individuals deemed worthy enough within GOI-078’s corporate structure.</p>
<p>Excerpts of this documentation have been provided below.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>The most essential part of pre-ritual care is making sure to do every illegal thing you possibly can. Go on a week long bender before you perform the damned thing. Indulge in some sinful meth, some LSD deeds to bring your soul down. Kill your dog, for all we care, your baby cousin too. It’s essential not to have too light of a heart, lest the demons sense your ineptitude and devour you outright.</p>
<p>Did that scare you? Well, welcome to our workplace, sunshine. You were the one who wanted to make video games so badly. At Arcadia, we're always about that party life, about making the <em>best</em> art we possibly can, and that means you’re just going to have to get your hands dirty. No good thing comes without suffering, and no pain comes without the most dizzying of gains.</p>
<p>If you're someone who believes in a man upstairs, we have little room for you. Burn your symbols, renounce your baptism, bathe in the light of digital sin, and become a part of the family, for we are the only one who will accept you for who you really are. We are the only ones who know how hideous human nature really is—and it’s a good thing we use this knowledge to make other people happy, yeah?</p>
<p>Now, onto the real preparations. First you must create your ritual site. A ritual site must be made by your own hands, from the design laid out in your orientation. Totems are best for what you need. Bring a cleaver you've coated with your workplace rival's blood to summon a wrathful demon for your shooter. Lay out your perverse object of choice for the incubus you summon for your point-and-click. Use your head, use some common logic for the genre you’re interested in. We’ve got no restraints on experimentation here at Arcadia.</p>
<p>As tempting as it may sound because of the inevitable pain of the ritual’s undertaking, restrain yourself from doing a round of painkillers and horse tranquilizers before you join. You may go all out with those substances once you’re done. The demons like it when we squirm; failing to do so could lead to quotas not being met, and you know what happens when quotas aren’t met.</p>
<p>You'll need: a silver knife, our special chemical compound<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, a lamb, chalk, and a copy of the <em>Ars Goetia.</em></p>
<p>Don’t worry, we will provide all these materials—you just need to take them.</p>
<p>Once you've collected everything. It's time to start the plunge. Turn to the next page for instructions after making your ritual site.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">
<div class="blockquote">
<p>1. Verbally speak aloud that you are committed to your preparations. Complete them down to the letter, as best aligned with the correct demonic species you want. We prefer Princes here at Arcadia, but we won’t mind if you choose a Marquis instead.</p>
<p>2. Ensure that no outside intruder disturbs you. You could end up summoning a completely useless species like a shaitan<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> instead of someone who knows how to breathe fire.</p>
<p>3. Recite the following chant: [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]. Variations have been attached for specific high-ranking demons.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p>4. Carve sigils into your skin and the lamb provided. This is to ensure that the demon will be summoned with grace and not rip your head into shreds.</p>
<p>5. Mix our chemical compound with the blood, and pour it into two separate shot glasses. This will be our wine.</p>
<p>6. Drink from the first glass. Pour the second one into the mouth of the lamb. This will be the start of your Communion.</p>
<p>7. Repeat the whole chant six times, the first word of said chant six more times, and then the last word six times. This will ensure your target hears you.</p>
<p>8. Consume the flesh of the sheep. Don’t vomit, or you will be a failure. You will have taken your bread, and completed the process.</p>
<p>9. Repeat these words: "I ask to you in the low place. I ask that you bless me with your presence. I ask that you open the door I provided you. Let my eyes weep in mirth as I see you. I have a vessel for you. I ask you take it, and allow me the opportunity to feed you what you desire. Accept my sacrifice, my flesh and neurons to control."</p>
<p>10. Provide finished game copy. Give it to whatever remains summoned afterwards. It’s not a real demon, but it can still fuck you like one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none">
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Option 1: Slaughter your coworkers. You're the alpha, and if you failed then that means that they sabotaged you. Make a deal with your summoned creature. Ask it to let you live in exchange for you killing your coworkers. They tried to kill you. Why shouldn't you kill them?</p>
<p>Option 2: Beg for mercy. We'll all look down on you for being a failure of a bastard, but you'll live. We'll dock your pay if you take this option, but at least you get one more chance to prove your meat sack can create something worthwhile.</p>
<p>Option 3: End your career. You'll never make it in this business if you can't fit in the culture. Split your head open on the concrete outside of our building and let Hell retake you, because you don’t deserve anything better, do you?</p>
<p>Option 4: Call Darke. That snake bastard doesn’t know anything about high art, but hey, sometimes he knows how to have fun. Let everyone know when you dial his number so we can watch (you know how much everyone here loves Russian roulette)—just know whatever he offers you is out of our hands.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.8179.2:</strong> On 10/26/1991 all outpost communication within SCP-8179 ceased. Attempts to enter SCP-8179 to re-establish contact were met with unusually hostile interference by multiple SCP-8179-1 instances, causing TRE outflows that resulted in ██ casualties within nearby towns. Due to SCP-8179's proximity to civilization and its structural damage, MTF mobilization was deemed too large a risk to normalcy.</p>
<p>After a week of further communication attempts, an uncorrupted video file was finally recovered by Site-182. The exact origins of this recording are unknown, along with the identity of the individual within it.</p>

<p><em>An individual is seen pacing around a ritual site. They appear to be speaking, but at too low of a volume to be picked up by recording equipment. After two minutes, they cease pacing and begin to speak out loud to themselves as if addressing someone else.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, they turn their head to a camera. They are revealed to be POI-0768, a developer at GOI-078 responsible for multiple extremely successful products before the company’s shadow period. While he was not among the individuals deemed missing following SCP-8179's discovery, he was unable to be found following an investigation into allegations of various forms of workplace harassment conducted while working at GOI-078.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> Fucking Wolf. Wolves have no place in this business. No place, no place. He didn't understand anything. Too new, too new. I hope he's rotting in Heaven. No place for old Arcadians. No respect for the culture.</p>
<p><em>POI-0786 is seen decorating the ritual site. Placing symbolic totems to various Tartarean Princes in various positions. The entities depicted are Orobas, Vasago, and Seir.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> Just like me, just like me. This game will be just like me. Just like old <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span>. Wolf never listened. Never <em>submitted</em> like those worthless freshblood should've. Always had to be the one to make the ideas. It was <em>my</em> game. Not his, not his. My story was perfect. Better than his.</p>
<p><em>An SCP-8179-1 instance is seen dragging an unknown researcher<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> towards POI-0786.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> This <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span> is a failure. Nothing like my old <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span>. Perfect <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span>. Old blood knew what was right. Old blood knows better than new blood and the weak blood.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-8179-1 deposits Dr. Enfer in the center of the ritual site.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> I'll make a new game. A better game like old <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span>. Show Wolf that his ideas were failures. I should have been CEO. I should've been it. Not that aspiring bastard. No knowledge about what it means to create real art, the sacrifices that have to be made to make it perfect.</p>
<p><em>POI-0786 proceeds to enact the ritual detailed in Addendum.8179.1. Dr. Enfer attempts to escape but is held down by a unknown force.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> I call to you, oh Princes. I beg of thee to come, and grant my object worth. I beg of thee to to use thy pride, and envy to fuel my own. <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span> is a shell, and you are a hermit crab. Oh Princes, oh Princes. Orobas, with your handsome stallion visage, Seir with your infinite hellish beauty, Vassago with your stolen wings. Lend me thy ears. Arrive through this vessel on cloven hoofs and take refuge in our world from within this shell. I beg to you oh Dark Ones. Grant me your blessings.</p>
<p><em>POI-0786 is seen using a ritualistic dagger to carve multiple Tartarean symbols into himself and Dr. Enfer. He draws blood from Dr. Enfer's hand and mixes it into two half full shot glasses.</em></p>
<p><em>POI-0786 convulses, and vomits all over Dr. Enfer, whose head has been stomped into a bloody mush by a large pair of horse hooves manifesting from the ceiling. Feathers and hands ascend from the floor soon after, boiling his skin from his muscle with hot oil.</em></p>
<p><em>POI-0786 appears to be experiencing exhaustion due to the mental backlash induced by the ritual. He proceeds to drink from one of the shot glasses again, then proceeds to force where Dr. Enfer’s head once was to drink from the second. POI-0786 then proceeds to repeat the previous chant.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> And now, the bread. Thank you my triage, for what you have given me.</p>
<p><em>POI-0786 proceeds to ritualistically cannibalize Dr. Enfer’s remains, starting with the throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-0786:</strong> I ask to you in the low place. I ask that you bless me with your presence. I ask that you open the door I provided you. Let my eyes weep in mirth as I see you. I have a vessel for you. I ask you take it, and allow me the opportunity to feed you what you desire. Accept my communion.</p>
<p><em>POI-0786 proceeds to slump over after saying the following chant. He does not appear to react in any way as a pair of large pixelated horns are seen protruding from Dr. Enfer’s throat.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum.8179.3:</strong> Three months after the above footage was recorded, SCP-8179 experienced an internal explosion that leveled the top floor. The source of this explosion is currently unknown, and SCP-8179 was put up for decommission consideration due to the danger that uncontained SCP-8179-1 instances posed to surrounding population. 47 hours after the explosion, the following radio signal was intercepted being sent to SCP-8179.</p>

<p>The deal Darke and Carter agreed to was that your little games were not to interfere with our more pertinent business. Orobas expects <em>manners</em> when he is summoned—he’s quite allergic to the smell of blood, you know. Gets prissy and complains it ruins all of his meals for seven days. He damn near kicked our <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/doubt-on-a-cd-rom">lead accountant</a> in the head once he learned we were financing you—do you know how much money we lost from that little incident? Do you?</p>
<p>This is your last warning. Keep your head down, and stop fooling around. We’ve put up with your waning benefit to us for quite some time, but if you manage to draw any further ire from the ears listening to your cartoon antics, Darke will make sure you know <em>personally</em> how little power you nerds <em>actually</em> possess. Capiche?</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I’m taking my two month vacation in Venice now. I deserve it after the first 60 hour work week I’ve had in years, which I was forced to pull because of <em>you</em> cretins.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing—quit it with those childish chants of yours, will you? Must you always sound like you’re trying to scare Christians who think rock music is the work of Satan?</p>
</div>
<p>TRE signatures from SCP-8179 after this incident decreased by 91%. No SCP-8179-1 instances have been observed since.</p>
