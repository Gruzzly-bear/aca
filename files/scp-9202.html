<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The SCP-9202 network is to be monitored at all times for instances of SCP-9202-γ. Any detected instances of SCP-9202-γ should be downregulated to instances of SCP-9202-β. Twenty satellites equipped with xenoton-photon conversion lenses (XPC lenses<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>) should be in orbit such that all areas on the planet accessible via satellite imagery are scanned every two hours for an SCP-9202-β upregulation event. Any SCP-9202-γ instance showing hostility or cognitohazardous or infohazardous speech should be immediately terminated.</p>
<p>A telekill alloy chamber with an internal xenoton sink is to be constructed to capture and house any SCP-9202-ẟ instances that may emerge. The chamber is to have windows with xenoton-resistant glass<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> so ẟ instances can be observed but effects are still contained. A system of double doors, where both are controlled solely from outside the chamber, is to be constructed. All information leaving the chamber is to be scanned for info- or cognitohazardous effects.</p>
<p>Other than during testing, only SCP-9202-isolated robots are to be allowed inside the chamber for interaction when a subject either will not or is unable to comply with instructions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> No person with a clearance level above 1 is to be allowed inside the chamber. Any person who has entered the chamber is to be considered lost and is not to be allowed outside while still living. A persuasion harness is to be installed on all SCP-9202-δ instances in case of aggression or hostility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: State your name and station for the record, please.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I am Natasha Atacama, doctor of the Foundation and current research head of SCP-9202.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Can you describe the containment procedures for SCP-9202 for me?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Isn't it already in the file?<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: We would like your perspective.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Of course.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: The first thing I'd like to go over would be the containment procedures for SCP-9202-γ instances. Why terminate them immediately?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: We call them puppet masters, or just pups for short, because of the way they can control people. You just fall to their will. If one of them manages to figure out their powers and exert them, it can go south <em>very</em> quickly. We only barely took out Pearson and that was mid-stage. A late-stage pup would probably require a full MTF to take out, with xenoproof suits and infohazard scanning.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: What is the "downregulation" talked about in the file?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Do you know what xenos are?<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: That was something I was meaning to ask you about later, but if it's important now, go ahead.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Xenos are particles emitted by the 9202 network connections. The word itself comes from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, the word <em>xeno</em> meaning the smallest unit of human connection. The typical human emits twelve kiloxenos per second [12 kXe/s]. A typical pup emits around a half thousand megaxenos per second [520 MXe/s], which shows up as a bright spot on our cameras. Downregulation is a technique by which we decrease the capacity of a pup by about seven orders of magnitude using a thaumaturgic ritual that's classified even to me now. The downregulation triggers a reaction in the pup that converts it back down to an aver [sic].<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Sorry, a what? I would prefer if you used proper abbreviations for instances.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I— A -β instance. Aver is short for average.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I see. In your file, I remember seeing you were against the immediate termination of δ instances.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Yes. I was the one who got -δ instances removed from the kill-list. The Foundation can be a bit trigger-happy sometimes.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I would think deltas would be the most dangerous.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: They would be the most <em>useful</em> is what they would be. A created delta, by simulation, would immediately start teleporting all over the place. That's <em>why we have</em> the attraction telekill chamber, after all. To capture any deltas for research.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: So it wasn't a moral question, then?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: … No, I don't think so. Those people that turn into deltas and gammas are too far gone to qualify as human anymore. Nobody with that level of power over others can be seen as human.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any and all research into the human brain is to be delayed and erroneous papers are to be released to delay that research further. Alternative explanations for autism, other than SCP-9202, are to be proposed. A list of appropriate causes has been drafted. Research into neural coupling, colloquially known as telepathic communication, is to be dismissed as pseudoscience.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9202 is a worldwide network, thaumaturgic in nature, that allows for parsing and transmission of emotion and subconscious intent at a higher rate than would be normally possible. SCP-9202 is responsible for the level of advanced reasoning and coordination required for modern civilization. SCP-9202 originates from thaumochemical reactions inside of the human brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Remind me, your file says you went to Deer College, correct?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Yes. I got my doctorate in thaumochemistry there. It was a relatively new field at the time; I specifically published the founding paper on resonance structure glyphs.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: How has your degree specifically helped with the development of the SCP-9202 protocols and the research that is still being performed?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I made the first xenoconversion lens on accident and published it to the Foundation Journal of Chemistry, give or take a year and a half ago? It was the first thing I did at the Foundation that really got attention. I was doing thaumochemistry research for SCP-<span class="redacted">0000</span> when I actually <em>made</em> the thing. It wasn't even supposed to be that thaumoactive; it was just for enhancing the impenetrability of the glass. Apparently that triggered the conversion effect, and for a while, <em>that</em> was the anomaly. Where is the energy coming from to make these photons? And then we figured out the thaumoactive chemicals in the human brain elsewhere, and the Foundation called on <em>me</em> to figure it out since I was the expert on thaumoactive resonance structures. I took a sample of the material as a curiosity (with permission, of course) and then realized, Oh, this is the same thing! which led to the discovery of the 9202 network. Then Pearson happened, and <span class="redacted">the ΨK</span>, and now look where we are today.</p>

<p>SCP-9202-A is the designation for a class of sub-networks contained within SCP-9202. SCP-9202-A instances are characterized by geographic significance, large size, and cultural or religious identity. The creation of new SCP-9202-A instances is rare, but it is typically denoted by the creation of new national, state, or religious identities. Typically, a person can only be a part of two SCP-9202-A networks, one denoting religious ideology (SCP-9202-Aa) and one denoting national ideology or political stance (SCP-9202-Ab).</p>
<p>SCP-9202-B is the designation for a class of sub-networks contained within SCP-9202. SCP-9202-B instances are characterized by sparse occupation, smaller size, tighter connections, and less "realistically meaningful" culture (examples include art movements, online "fandoms", large-scale community projects, etc.). SCP-9202-B instances do not seem to be affected by <span class="redacted">the</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">ongoing</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">ΨK</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">class</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">Psychic</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">Reversion</span><span class="redacted">-</span><span class="redacted">scenario</span>, unlike SCP-9202-A instances.</p>
<p>SCP-9202-α to SCP-9202-δ are designations for different levels of xenoton emission observed in humans. Interestingly, apart from the α band, each band is neatly separated by several orders of magnitude, with SCP-9202-α instances within the 100 to 8000Xe/s range, SCP-9202-β in the 8 to 15kXe/s band, SCP-9202-γ in the 230 to 800MXe/s band, and SCP-9202-δ theoretically existing in the 94-530GXe/s band. SCP-9202-α and SCP-9202-β, while not as directly separated as -γ or -δ instances, have two separate peaks within their ranges, at 400 Xe/s and 12 kXe/s respectively.</p>

<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: [through radio] Exit the van by the side door and approach from both sides. If he continues to be hostile, we take him out. On my mark… three, two, one…</p>
<p><em>The sound of a van door opening is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Stevenson]</strong>: Go, go, go!</p>

<p><strong>[Voice 1]</strong>: [Infohazard removed]. [Cognitohazard vector removed], fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: These helmets are autoprocessing for indirect hazards. You won't get us—</p>
<p><strong>[Voice 1]</strong>: [Infohazard removed]. I am the [Cognitohazard removed], [Infohazard removed] fucking [Infohazard removed]. [Cognitohazard removed]! I will NOT BE SILENCED!</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Stravelli]</strong>: I don't think it would be wise to keep this one around.</p>
<p><strong>[Captain Stevenson]</strong> Copy that. Terminating.</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Samson]</strong>: Jesus. And it's like this for two city blocks?</p>
<p><em>A gunshot is heard.</em></p>
<p>Several minutes have been removed for brevity. At the 20-minute mark, video became recoverable.</p>
<p><em>The MTF team approaches the inner levels of the breach area. As they turn a corner, the obvious epicenter becomes clear. The walls of buildings have been sprayed with slogans, such as "Live, Laugh, Learn", "No Connection Without Correction", and [Infohazard removed]. A large thaumaturgic ritual circle is seen, approx. 10 meters in diameter, with a (7,2) pentagram inscribed in the center and a ring of glyphs inscribed on the outside. A series of twenty-one smaller thaumaturgic ritual circles surrounds the outer one, approx. 0.5 meters in diameter. A person stands in each circle except for three, which are positioned in an equilateral triangle surrounding the first which are noticeably larger. A network of lines connect them.</em></p>
<p><em>The woman within the center circle , identified as Pearson <span class="redacted">Atacama</span>, turns to face them.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: I expected you'd come. Here, have a seat.</p>
<p><em>Each of the agents continues to have their gun trained on Pearson.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: Or don't. It doesn't matter to me. You can't shoot me and I can't hurt you while I'm in this circle. Physically, of course. I also know you won't risk any more civilian casualties, since none of these people are active aggressors. I invite you to try to shoot me, actually.</p>

<p><strong>[Captain Stevenson]</strong>: I'll take you up on that challenge.</p>
<p><em>Captain Stevenson shoots 20 times. A faint dome suddenly appears intersecting the central magic circle, and each of the shots becomes a white dot on the dome.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Agent Stravelli]</strong>: How can we be sure that you can't hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: You aren't, but I haven't yet, so you'll just have to trust me. You got here early, by the way — we weren't expecting you to get here this fast. Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: Why aren't they attacking us? What have you done to them?</p>
<p><em>Pearson motions to the people surrounding the circle, who are milling about amicably. Some are chatting amongst each other. Many return the gesture with a wave of their own.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: If they really didn't want to be here, they would go. I planted the idea in their head and it grew into a tree. I told them there was a better way to love, that I could help them connect with each other. And I can! I need your help to do it, though. As for attacking you, well, I wanted to delay you, but I can't just be throwing bodies at the wall like the Foundation that I'm trying to move away from.</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: How do we know you're not lying?</p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: Marx. You have never been accepted for who you were, have you?</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: I got <em>here</em>. Not many people do that.</p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: Are you really <em>happy</em>, though? I doubt you are. The Foundation told you that they would accept you and pay you and give you a family, but they never let you support the one you already had. No contact form, right?</p>
<p><strong>[Agent Marx]</strong>: No contact is necessary to —</p>
<p><strong>[Pearson]</strong>: No contact isn't <em>ever</em> necessary. You could have "worked a job" in private security to them, not <em>die</em> and it would be the same effect. You were never treated right, and they never even gave you their promise. Never let you pursue that job in the occult sciences.</p>

<p><em>Stevenson begins to cry. It is unknown why such a strong emotional effect was observed, as simulations suggested this memory had been successfully suppressed through amnestic therapy.</em></p>

<p><em>The people who were previously milling about suddenly stop and turn to face Pearson. The eighteen people in the smaller circles link themselves to Stravelli, Marx, and Stevenson through the chalk lines. Each of the three begins to glow brightly with xenoton radiation, with the people throughout the town square dimming by several orders of magnitude. The people on the inside begin chanting as Samson begins to pound on the central circle, shouting incoherently. The radiation saturates the cameras before dimming significantly. Pearson is visibly glowing as Samson finally breaches the barrier, firing off several shots in Pearson's general direction. One of the shots appears to hit Pearson in the neck before she disappears entirely. All of the people in the town square fall to the ground, dead. The feed then cuts to static.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p>Stravelli, Marx, and Stevenson were found dead by sub-veil first responders. Each of their heads were carbonized as far as five centimeters into the organic tissue around their head. Samson was found alive but in critical condition, with second to third-degree burns in the facial area. Samson is currently recovering but still comatose, pending reassignment. Pearson was found dead in Sacramento, California, with the cause of death determined as a gunshot wound to the neck.</p>
<p>It is theorized that the burns seen on Stravelli, Marx, Stevenson, and Samson are due to extremely high levels of xenoton downconverson, resulting in severe radiation burns.</p>

<p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9202-Ψ is not to be contained. All documentation pertaining to SCP-9202-Ψ is to be classified to at least Level 3/9202 to prevent mass panic within the Foundation.</p>
<p>In lieu of containment of SCP-9202-Ψ, SCP-9202-B instances are to be encouraged to grow in all ways possible, including the dissemination of infohazardous anart throughout social media platforms to implant the desire to be inside of niche communities. A list has been drafted of potential SCP-9202-B instances and an agreement has been entered with GOI-2979 "Are We Cool Yet?" for assistance in the production and dissemination of anart<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> in exchange for certain allowances with the distribution of other anart. Foundation funds are to be diverted for the funding of conventions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: What was your experience during initial containment efforts of SCP-9202-Ψ?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Probably the worst part of my tenure at the Foundation.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I doubt it was the worst —<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Have <em>you</em> ever had to stay up to 3 A.M. making <em>anart</em> with an AWCY teenager because apparently your three-year-old degree in anart made you the most qualified person on the team, and <em>then</em> fall prey to your <em>own anart</em> and find yourself looking for fursuits on Etsy at four in the morning, on your fourth cup of double-shot espresso? No? I thought not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internally, Foundation group-building exercises should be practiced so that, if possible, the Foundation can become a -B instance. Until such time as that is possible, external containment efforts should also be spread internally, in the form of posters, memos, announcements, and embedded infohazards throughout the database. Resources are to be provided to employees for their hobbies for the purpose of making entry into SCP-9202-B instances easier.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9202-Ψ is the designation for the ongoing ΨK-Class Psychic Reversion Scenario. SCP-9202-Ψ currently affects 4% of people worldwide. SCP-9202-Ψ was caused by the momentary upregulation of SCP-9202-δ-1 from a -γ instance to a -δ instance, which overloaded the network.</p>
<p>Individuals affected by SCP-9202-Ψ are unable to connect with other individuals simply based on geological proximity. Instead, they must share a SCP-9202-B network with the other individual. Projections forecast that 99.99% of people will be affected by SCP-9202-B by 2049.</p>
<p>Currently, the three largest SCP-9202-B groups targeted for the use of containing knowledge of SCP-9202-Ψ are: the 'furry fandom', the LGBTQ+ community, and the cosplay community.</p>

<p><strong>Algebra I</strong>: B-<br/>
<strong>Citizenship</strong>: Excellent<br/>
Pearson is showing growth in mathematical abilities but sometimes struggles when attempting to grasp new concepts. She is not behind but I worry she will be soon. When she does understand a concept well, however, she is very good at explaining it to others. I would recommend going over these concepts at home, one-on-one, to make sure she understands what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>Biology</strong>: A<br/>
<strong>Citizenship</strong>: Excellent<br/>
Pearson shows aptitude for biology and participates well with others. She takes leadership positions during labs and is able to work with other people both in those coordinating positions and in others.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong>: B<br/>
<strong>Citizenship</strong>: Excellent<br/>
Pearson struggles with memorization. She needs more time than other students in the same grade to memorize the same events. She has shown the ability to take initiative and come to me for help, but I fear she may fall behind soon.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Education</strong>: Unsatisfactory<br/>
Pearson struggles badly with maintaining strength and endurance. I would recommend setting aside time for exercise more often as she says she spends little to none of her free time exercising.</p>
<p><strong>Theatre</strong>: A+<br/>
<strong>Citizenship</strong>: Excellent<br/>
Pearson is imaginative and easily able to grasp the traits that make up a character. Her ability to work with others and memorize lines is astounding. I enjoyed having her in our class this year and would recommend she join a theatre club to practice and develop these skills.</p>

<p>Document 2: Foundation document pertaining to the manifestation of thaumaturgic abilities seen in SCP-9202-δ-1.</p>

<p><strong>General Incident Report - Manifestation of Thaumaturgic Ability</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Document ID Code</strong>: AC9D433A-79c<br/>
<strong>Affected Persons</strong>: 8th Grade Class of Jameson Public Middle School<br/>
<strong>Manifested In</strong>: Pearson A.<br/>
<strong>Initial Actions Taken</strong>: Amnesticization of affected persons. Faux arrest of Pearson A. under officially recognized crimes (shoplifting, assault).<br/>
<strong>Authorized By</strong>: Eric H. Carter, Department of Incident Response<br/>
<strong>Recommended Further Actions</strong>: Expedition of Pearson. A to Three Portlands and enrollment in Three Portlands School of Thaumaturgy.
<hr/>
<p>On Sept. 3, 1996, Pearson A. manifested thaumaturgic abilities while utilizing chalk to draw art on one of the sidewalks situated throughout the campus. The string of glyphs was drawn entirely by chance. They have been translated to mean [Apply force] [30m] [2 m/s^2 (Normal to [Average force vector])] (All [Humanoids]), resulting in the reduction of gravity by 2 m/s^2 around the campus. Subsequent testing has shown that Pearson A. has a remarkable level of EVE energy.</p>
<p>Pearson A., due to their appropriate age and proximity to Three Portlands, should be given lodging and be initiated into sub-veil affairs as soon as possible. If they continue to show growth, they are to be recommended to Deer College as a student and given a full scholarship. It is not often we see someone this powerful and it is my personal opinion that they would be a great asset if trained correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Calculus</strong>: C<br/>
Pearson is often unable to grasp abstract concepts and requires tutoring and one-on-one sessions often. She needs to set aside more time to study; if possible, a private tutor may be required. I personally do not have enough time to spend one-on-one sessions with her but if her Benefactor is so willing I could be employed over breaks.</p>
<p><strong>AP Sociology</strong>: A+<br/>
Pearson is extraordinarily gifted for her age. She is showing advanced growth beyond her age and is often ahead of the rest of the class. It is my recommendation that she continue in personally-oriented classes. She may want to take a job as a counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist in the future; combined with her psychic abilities, she could help a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-veil History</strong>: B<br/>
Pearson shows interest in the more personal aspects of history but is often unable to memorize the required material. I would recommend that she set aside time at home to study.</p>
<p><strong>Thaumatology 3</strong>: A-<br/>
Pearson shows remarkable aptitude for spellcasting and spellweaving. She has already advanced to experimental glyphs from newer studies; however, her understanding of theory is lacking. She shows aptitude in areas relating to affecting people but I have noticed she has trouble emotionally connecting with others. Rituals have proved to be an area of difficulty; although she is able to coordinate with others of her caliber, the other students have a hard time matching her strength. I've noticed she's been trying to connect the other students, which is good, but they've been rejecting her for the most part (whether intentionally or not I don't know), which is especially concerning since she's been here almost four years now. This may be a long running difficulty but I haven't personally been at the school long enough to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Intro to Psychisism</strong>: A-<br/>
Pearson is one of the most powerful psychics I have ever met, however, she has trouble harnessing and controlling her power. It is of my opinion that she continue in psychisism classes so that she is not a danger to those around her. I have been spending time with her to help her control the power but she may soon exceed even my ability. Unfortunately, I have noticed that her classmates have been excluding her from activities, shielding against her, and even sending back their own probes, sometimes to the point of causing pain. I've tried to talk to her about it but she puts up her walls whenever I do.</p>

<p>Hello Pearson (or whatever name you want me to call you by),</p>
<p>It's been so long! I know school was a long time ago but I assume you still remember me. When I asked for a psychic I wasn't expecting you, seeing how large the Foundation is. How many years has it been now? Almost 20?</p>
<p>Either way, how are you doing? I haven't heard from you in a while and I know it sounds ridiculous but I was starting to get worried about you. Have you been here long? Personally, I took a job at Anderson before coming here but it didn't last very long.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Recipient</strong>: Dr. Atacama<br/>
<strong>Author</strong>: Dr. Pearson<br/>
<strong>Date</strong>: 07 Apr 2018</p>
<p>Hi Natasha (just Pearson is fine)!</p>
<p>I've been doing well, thank you very much. How did you land a job at Anderson? They have, what, 200 people? But yeah, I've been okay these past couple of years. Thanks for looking out for me — it means a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: <span class="redacted">[REDACTED] [REDACTED]</span><br/>
<strong>Interviewee</strong>: Dr. Natasha Atacama<br/>
<strong>Date</strong>: 27/12/2026</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: State your name and station for the record, please.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I am Natasha Atacama, doctor of the Foundation and current research head of SCP-9202.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Can you describe the containment procedures for SCP-9202 for me?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Isn't it already in the file?<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: We would like your perspective.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Of course.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: The first thing I'd like to go over would be the containment procedures for SCP-9202-γ instances. Why terminate them immediately?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: We call them puppet masters, or just pups for short, because of the way they can control people. You just fall to their will. If one of them manages to figure out their powers and exert them, it can go south <em>very</em> quickly. We only barely took out Pearson and that was mid-stage. A late-stage pup would probably require a full MTF to take out, with xenoproof suits and infohazard scanning.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: What is the "downregulation" talked about in the file?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Do you know what xenos are?<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: That was something I was meaning to ask you about later, but if it's important now, go ahead.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Xenos are particles emitted by the 9202 network connections. It comes from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, the word <em>xeno</em> meaning the smallest unit of human connection. The typical human emits twelve kiloxenos per second [12 kXe/s]. The more xenos you emit, the brighter you shine on the sky cameras. A typical pup emits around a half thousand megaxenos per second [520 MXe/s], which shows up as a bright spot on our cameras. Downregulation is a technique by which we decrease the capacity of a pup by about seven orders of magnitude using a thaumaturgic ritual that's classified even to me now. The downregulation triggers a reaction in the pup that converts it back down to an aver [sic].<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Sorry, a what? I would prefer if you used proper abbreviations for instances.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I— A -β instance. Aver is short for average.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I see. In your file, I remember seeing you were against the immediate termination of δ instances.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Yes. I was the one who got -δ instances removed from the kill-list. The Foundation can be a bit trigger-happy sometimes.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I would think deltas would be the most dangerous.<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: They would be the most <em>useful</em> is what they would be. A created delta, by simulation, would immediately start teleporting all over the place. That's <em>why we have</em> the attraction telekill chamber, after all. To capture any deltas for research.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: So it wasn't a moral question, then?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: … No, I don't think so. Those people that turn into deltas and gammas are too far gone to qualify as human anymore. Nobody with that level of power over others can be seen as human.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I find that quite interesting. Remind me, your file says you went to Deer College, correct?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Yes. I got my doctorate in thaumochemistry there. It was a relatively new field at the time; I specifically published the founding paper on resonance structure glyphs.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: How has your degree specifically helped with the development of the SCP-9202 protocols and the research that is still being performed?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I made the first xenoconversion lens on accident and published it to the Foundation Journal of Chemistry, give or take a year and a half ago? It was the first thing I did at the Foundation that really got attention. I was doing thaumochemistry research for SCP-<span class="redacted">0000</span> when I actually <em>made</em> the thing. It wasn't even supposed to be that thaumoactive; it was just for enhancing the impenetrability of the glass. Apparently that triggered the conversion effect, and for a while, <em>that</em> was the anomaly. Where is the energy coming from to make these photons? And then we figured out the thaumoactive chemicals in the human brain elsewhere, and the Foundation called on <em>me</em> to figure it out since I was the expert on thaumoactive resonance structures. I took a sample of the material as a curiosity (with permission, of course) and then realized, Oh, this is the same thing! which led to the discovery of the 9202 network. Then my <em>fucking sister</em> happened, and the ΨK, and now look where we are today.<br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Your file says you also got a second degree while you were there.</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I did get a degree in anart.</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: If I remember correctly, one of the things taught in that class is "a strong moral compass", and you did get full marks, so how do you still justify that?</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Like I said. Anyone who has that level of control over people, or who has committed grave crimes, like the D-Class, can't be considered human anymore.</span><br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I see. And what was your experience during initial containment efforts of SCP-9202-Ψ?<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Probably the worst part of my tenure at the Foundation.<br/>
<strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I doubt it was the worst —<br/>
<strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: Have <em>you</em> ever had to stay up to 3 A.M. making <em>anart</em> with an AWCY teenager because apparently your three-year-old degree in anart made you the most qualified person on the team, and <em>then</em> fall prey to your <em>own anart</em> and find yourself looking for fursuits on Etsy at four in the morning, on your fourth cup of double-shot espresso? No? I thought not.<br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I would think the worst part of your employ was when Pearson —</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: My SISTER betrayed ALL OF HUMANITY for some <em>stupid reason</em> that I CANNOT COMPREHEND. But even that wasn't enough; she had to fucking make it my mess to clean up. ALL OF THAT CLEANUP AND WORK WAS ASSOCIATED [with] HER. So yeah, you could say Pearson was the worst thing that ever happened to me. But I consider that second to the fact I HAD TO CLEAN IT ALL UP.</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: … I see. And finally, what was your experience as an affectee of SCP-9202-Ψ?</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: I… Emotional reactivity, lowered professionality, inability to focus, all of that. Is this a secret DFS visit?</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: I assure you, if I was an agent of the Department of Fire Suppression, you would know. Finally, have the SCP-9202-Ψ procedures been effective for you?</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Dr. Atacama]</strong>: … I have experienced an uptick in my previous abilities since when I was not a part of the furry community.</span><br/>
<span class="highlight"><strong>[Interviewer]</strong>: Alright, well that just about wraps it up for today. Just so you know, that specific SCP-9202-B instance has been being disseminated throughout the Foundation, so you should be able to talk without shouting at people again soon. Next set of interviews won't be until Monday.</span></p>
