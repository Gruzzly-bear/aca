<p><strong>Item #</strong>: SCP-9393</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: The property surrounding SCP-9393 has been purchased by Shivani Cultivation and Produce. The field SCP-9393 occupies has been cleared and a silo has been erected around it.</p>
<p>The entrance to the silo will be guarded at all times to prevent inadvertent entry. A secondary containment cell has been constructed around SCP-9393, which will only be unlocked on order of the director of Site 19. The temperature and climate within the cell is controlled, and pesticides will be used as required to protect against damage to the frame of SCP-9393.</p>
<p>No personnel will move within two meters of the anomaly unless required for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9393 is a doorway in a cornfield in Hooker County, Nebraska. The frame is made from black cherry wood. From the north, the doorway appears to be filled with dark gray mist. From the south, the doorway appears completely black.</p>
<p>Persons who enter SCP-9393 vanish when they enter the anomaly. This disappearance lasts at least two minutes. There is no known upper limit. If and when a subject returns, they will emerge from the opposite side of the door from which they entered. At current date, there is no observable difference in the effect for subjects <span class="hover">entering from the north or the south<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/3">Ref. SCP-9393 Peer Review E-mail</a></span></span><a name="anchor3"></a>.</p>
<p>Subjects that have returned from SCP-9393 report a variety of <span class="hover">distressing scenarios<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/1">Ref. Interview with Agent William Harmon</a></span></span><a name="anchor1"></a>, often involving isolation, threats, disorientation, and surreal elements. The subjective length of time a subject spends in this scenario does not seem to correlate with the time outside observers experience.</p>
<p>It is unknown if the anomaly is transporting subjects to real locations or merely creating facsimiles. Harm suffered by subjects is <span class="hover">retained on emergence from the anomaly<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/4">Ref. Medical Examination of Cameron Parry</a></span></span><a name="anchor4"></a>.</p>
<p>Not all subjects that return do so alive. Corpses, partial remains, personal effects, and even intangible traces have <span class="hover">exited the doorway<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/16">Ref. Partial Log of Remains</a></span></span><a name="anchor16"></a>.</p>
<p>No two subjects have reported encountering each other during these scenarios, even when entering SCP-9393 together.</p>
<p>Cameras that enter SCP-9393 show an apparently natural cavern. The walls are consistent with the bedrock of western Nebraska; however, seismic surveys have shown no such cavern in the area. No traces of human intrusion have been detected.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-9393 was brought to Foundation attention after a report on <span class="hover">NIBRS<span>The National Incident-Based Reporting System</span></span> triggered an automated search for certain <span class="hover">keywords <span>teleported, portal, skinless, natal</span></span> . A man named Cameron Parry had been found bloody and disoriented next to Nebraska highway 97 <span class="hover">by state police<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/5">See e-mail chain regarding subject acquisition.</a></span></span><a name="anchor5"></a>. Based on his testimony, the Foundation was able to quickly locate and contain the anomaly, and <span class="hover">Dr. Caroline Wren<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/6">Ref. Excerpt from the Diary of Caroline Wren</a></span></span><a name="anchor6"></a> was assigned to lead the resulting investigation.</p>
<p>Due to a superficial resemblance to <a href="/scp-1983">SCP-1983</a>, it was decided to send a team in to investigate. MTF Tau-49 (Lucky Sevens) was activated, the eighth iteration to use that name. Out of twenty-five operatives, <span class="hover">seven<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/7">Ref. Statement from Agent Bradley Harris</a></span></span><a name="anchor7"></a> <span class="hover">exited<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/8">Ref. Statement from Agent Janet Clary</a></span></span><a name="anchor8"></a> <span class="hover">SCP-9393<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/9">Ref. Statement from Agent Thomas Chi</a></span></span><a name="anchor9"></a> alive. Identifiable remains were recovered for a further thirteen over the following seven years. The remaining five have yet to be located.</p>
<p>Requests for further MTF support <span class="hover">were denied<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/2">See Request for Forces e-mail from Dr. Wren to Director Moose</a></span></span><a name="anchor2"></a>. At this time, the land was purchased and an outpost was built around the anomaly, ensuring access was restricted. Dr. Caroline Wren was put in charge of testing the anomaly, while Dietrich York was instructed to institute long-term containment procedures.</p>
<p>Records for the mobile task force were procured, but <span class="hover">no causal link<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/12">Ref. Excerpt from the Diary of Caroline Wren</a></span></span><a name="anchor12"></a> could be immediately be found for either the survivors, known decedents, or missing personnel.</p>
<p><span class="hover">Interviews with the survivors<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/13">Ref. Excerpt from the Diary of Caroline Wren</a></span></span><a name="anchor13"></a> suggested that each had experienced an entirely different location and scenario than the others. None had encountered any of the others during the events they experienced, though some saw or heard <span class="hover">other entities that appeared human<span>It is unknown if these were other persons who entered the anomaly, persons from some other source, or were created by the anomaly to cause distress.</span></span>.</p>
<p>Once the outpost was complete, the Ethics Committee approved testing using <span class="hover">Class D personnel<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/10">Ref. Statement from D-42810</a></span></span><a name="anchor10"></a>. Dr. Wren began <span class="hover">devising tests<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/11">Ref. Statement from D-39203</a></span></span><a name="anchor11"></a> to determine specific aspects of the anomaly.</p>
<p>Early hypotheses were ultimately ruled out through <span class="hover">exhaustive testing<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/14">Ref. Excerpt from the Diary of Caroline Wren</a></span></span><a name="anchor14"></a>. At this time, Director Moose began considering <span class="hover">reallocating personnel<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/17">See e-mail between Director Moose and Dr. Mann</a></span></span><a name="anchor17"></a> to better support other research projects.</p>
<p>However, after six months, <span class="hover">no solid conclusions had been reached<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/18">Ref. Audio Log Between Dr. Caroline Wren and Dietrich York</a></span></span><a name="anchor18"></a>. After consultation with the Ethics Committee and Dr. Moose, the O5 council decided to <span class="hover">suspend further human testing<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/15">Ref. Excerpt from the Diary of Caroline Wren</a></span></span><a name="anchor15"></a> and re-assign excess personnel for other projects. A skeleton crew was assigned to the outpost, and <span class="hover">testing was terminated<span><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-9393/offset/19">Ref. Incident Log 9000-23</a></span></span><a name="anchor19"></a>.</p>
