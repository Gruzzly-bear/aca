<p>An instance of SCP-7837 mimicking a GPS satellite.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7837</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Captured specimens are to be stored at Site-38 in underground cells made of reinforced concrete. Specimens must be bound to the floor of their cells by 7.6mm steel cables. Cables must be coated in rubber or some other abrasion-resistant insulation. All testing of SCP-7837 instances must be done in the presence of no less than 10 guards armed with armor-piercing rifles. No metallic objects, apart from those being used for testing purposes, are to make direct physical contact with any instance of SCP-7837.</p>
<p>Following Incident 7837-X1-A, MTF-Eta-37 "Skywatch" has been formed to handle all instances of SCP-7837 attacks. Eta-37's job is to document, deter<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and/or capture all instances of SCP-7837. To this end, Taskforce personnel are equipped with specially-designed harpoon and net launchers to restrain the instances.</p>
<p>Any Foundation personnel outside of MTF-Eta-37 who encounter instances of SCP-7837 unexpectedly are instructed to contact the Taskforce immediately while maintaining visual on the sky above, or on the instance itself if it is in visual range. No attempt by non-Taskforce personnel to engage SCP-7837 entities is recommended unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7837 is a population of anomalous machines resembling manmade satellites that exhibit animalistic and predatory behavior. While SCP-7837 instances can vary considerably in shape and size, all instances display the following anomalous traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to freely enter and exit Earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull without assistance, and travel at speeds up to 740km/h</li>
<li>The ability to move and contort in a manner similar to a variety of predatory <em>Medusae</em> or <em>Ornithurae</em> species</li>
<li>Machinery on each satellite behaves analogously to various appendages on organic lifeforms: solar panels function as "wings" or "arms" for in-atmosphere maneuvering or grounded locomotion, respectively. Cameras serve as "eyes" and any form of hatch capable of opening and closing behaves as a "mouth". Regardless of the purpose of the satellite SCP-7837 is intended to mimic, all instances come equipped with the above components</li>
<li>Extreme resistance to heat, cold, and blunt-force trauma (though this may simply be due to the materials used in the construction of non-anomalous satellites)</li>
<li>The ability to self-repair via assimilating metallic objects</li>
<li>A drive to hunt sentient organic life</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether SCP-7837 instances are manmade artificial constructs or naturally-occurring biomechanical entities currently remains up for debate. Analysis of the remains of destroyed SCP-7837 instances reveals serial numbers and other manufacturer information etched on internal components, but the text is always heavily warped as if melted or sanded away. It is also possible that SCP-7837 instances are simply not sophisticated enough to accurately copy such texts. Different "species" of SCP-7837 have different methods for hunting their prey. These can range from turreted harpoons with several km of cable, to sharpened claws on the ends of articulated solar panels, to -in one instance- a nozzle that dispensed high-pressure jets of hydrazine<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> before igniting it, creating a napalm-like stream of fire. Once the prey is incapacitated, it is pulled into the nearest mouth-like orifice on the satellite's body and presumably processed into fuel. In order to minimize the chances of being detected, SCP-7837 have devised a set of preferred conditions in which to hunt its desired prey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target must be at least 20m away from the nearest building</li>
<li>Time must be past sunset</li>
<li>Sky must be clear of clouds and fog, presumably so SCP-7837 can maintain visual contact</li>
<li>Target must not be staring up at the sky for prolonged periods of time. Individuals appearing to be stargazing or otherwise focusing their attention on the sky will usually deter an attack from 7837 instances. It is theorized they prefer to ambush their prey so as to minimize chances of escape</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7837 was first brought to the attention of Foundation personnel on August 3rd, 2021 after the disappearances of ██ visitors of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Victims were apparently ambushed in the parking lot on the way back to their vehicles. Eyewitness accounts claimed individuals were "pulled into the sky" by what appeared to be long steel cables attached to barbed spikes. Two (2) members of the response team were impaled by a subsequent attack from the SCP-7837 instance upon arrival at the scene. Remaining team members looking up at the sky in an attempt to locate the anomaly is believed to have scared it away. A second report approximately 2 months later in Reno, Nevada led to the capture of SCP-7837-A1 after it became tangled in power lines in an attempt to escape. Most of the Foundation's knowledge of SCP-7837 comes from analysis of specimen A1.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red">Addendum 7837-01:</span> Initial Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>The following is a series of multiple experiments conducted on captured SCP-7837 entities to better understand their nature:</p>

<p><strong>Intent:</strong> Determine SCP-7837's preferences in prey.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A common housecat in a metal cage was placed before SCP-7837-A1 via a remote-controlled robot.</p>
<p><strong>Observations:</strong> SCP-7837-A1's cameras turned to focus on the cat, but entity did not attempt to make physical contact. Entity's restraints were loose enough to where it could have shifted slightly in the cat's direction if it so desired. Robot suffered mechanical failure during attempt to retrieve metal cage. A D-class personnel (henceforth referred to as "Subject-A") was sent to retrieve the cage and robot. Immediately upon Subject-A entering the cell, SCP-7837-A1's cameras focused on Subject-A and seemed to completely ignore the cat. SCP-7837-A1's thrusters and stabilizers began activating intermittently in an effort to free itself from its bindings and approach Subject-A. Upon retrieval of the cage and robot, Subject-A quickly fled the cell, causing SCP-7837-A1 to return to an inert state.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> SCP-7837 entities only seem to be interested in hunting intelligent organic life.</p>

<p><strong>Intent:</strong> Determine the mechanism by which SCP-7837 entities consume their prey, and the purpose of doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A D-class personnel slated for termination (henceforth referred to as "Subject-B") is instructed to enter SCP-7837-A1 by any means necessary. Subject-B is not informed of the nature of 7837-A1.</p>
<p><strong>Observations:</strong> SCP-7837-A1's cameras focused on Subject-B, but it did not attempt to free itself as it had in Test-01. Instead, as Subject-B approached, SCP-7837-A1's frontal plating split down the middle and slid open in a manner similar to a set of elevator doors. The inside of the entity appeared mostly hollow, though it was initially too dark to make out any details. Subject-B approached the opening and was able to climb inside without resistance. Upon fully entering the inside of of the entity, Subject-B was immediately restrained by a series of cables. Lights within switched on, revealing a series of biomechanical organs embedded into the walls of SCP-7837-A1's interior. Various mechanical arms extended from multiple locations within the hull, with some further restraining Subject-B's limbs and others activating what appeared to be plasma-based cutting implements. Arms began cutting into Subject-B's body, starting at the limbs and working inwards rapidly. Subject-B ceased struggling approximately 5 seconds into the ordeal and is believed to be deceased after 10. Subject-B's body is gradually cut into small chunks, which are then individually picked up by SCP-7837-A1's mechanical arms before being deposited into cylindrical glass containers filled with an unknown substance, possibly some form of acid. Due to multiple arms obstructing the view, it cannot be seen what happens to Subject-B's head. Approximately 10 minutes after Subject-B is processed, a series of blue lights begin flickering down the sides of SCP-7837-A1's hull as it emits a series of rhythmic thrumming noises. A laptop computer 20 meters away, outside the containment cell, begins emitting a glow of the same bluish hue. A string of heavily corrupted text begins playing across the laptop's screen. The phrases "didn't mean it", "gun misfired", and "stupid kid" can be distinguished. Upon a hunch from Dr. Fuentes, Subject-B's file is reviewed. Subject-B became a D-class after a robbery-gone-wrong resulted in the death of a 10-year-old child.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> SCP-7837 entities seem to derive fragments of intelligence and memories from individuals they consume. As for the organic matter of their victims, it is suspected to be converted into fuel for propulsion or used to repair the entity's softer internal components.</p>

<p><strong>Intent:</strong> Determine the means by which instances of SCP-7837 repair damage sustained to their hulls.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Multiple rounds of .50 caliber armor-piercing ammunition are to be discharged into the hull of SCP-7837-A1. A metal wheelbarrow is then placed in direct physical contact with the hull of 7837-A1. A plastic vegetable crate is placed upon one of the entity's solar panels to test its material preferences, if any.</p>
<p><strong>Observations:</strong> SCP-7837-A1 emitted multiple shrill mechanical vocalizations upon being shot, but did not cease functionality even after taking 15 rounds of ammunition. Immediately upon making contact with the wheelbarrow, SCP-7837-A1 ceased all movement and vocalization. 5 seconds later, a series of cables began extending from the entity's frontal hatch as it split open. The cables extended down and began coiling around the wheelbarrow until it was securely bound. Wheelbarrow began emitting loud creaking noises as it seemed to compress in on itself. Holes in SCP-7837-A1's hull gradually began closing as the wheelbarrow was compressed into a smaller and smaller size. After 60 seconds the wheelbarrow was no longer visible, and SCP-7837-A1's hull damage was completely repaired. The plastic vegetable crate remained untouched.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> SCP-7837 entities demonstrate the ability to assimilate various metals into their forms in order to repair any damage they sustain. It is still unknown what happens to plastics, rubber, glass, rust, and other impurities that might be absorbed along with the metal.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: red">Addendum 7837-02:</span> Notable Encounters</strong></p>
<p>The following is an abridged list of notable encounters between Foundation personnel and SCP-7837 instances since initial discovery:</p>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-7837-A1<br/>
<strong>Disguise:</strong> USA-266 GPS satellite</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Anomalous Traits:</strong> Two solar panels behaved like makeshift "wings", rapidly fluttering in a manner similar to a hummingbird. Movement was extremely erratic and unpredictable. Used the sharp points of its frontal sensors as a spiked "battering ram" to impale its targets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident:</strong> Encountered by rapid-response team that had previously investigated initial SCP-7837 attack. SCP-7837-A1 was chasing a small group of joggers down a highway bridge and attempting to ram them. One (1) of the runners had already been impaled and was being dragged along by the entity. Response team parked at end of bridge with the rear of the van facing the oncoming entity. Team opened doors when entity was within 20 meters and immediately began firing. SCP-7837-A1 was apparently startled by the gunfire and attempted to flee, but collided with a nearby power line and became tangled in the electrical cables. During efforts to subdue the entity, it charged at the response team with a sudden burst of speed and impaled another member. Response team opened fire on 7837-A1's solar panels until they ceased movement. Entity taken into Foundation custody. Surviving witnesses given amnestics.</p>
</div>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-7837-B2<br/>
<strong>Disguise:</strong> CNES "Pléiades" Earth-Imaging satellite</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Anomalous Traits:</strong> Four solar panels moved in a wavelike motion resembling a jellyfish. Moved in periodic bursts of speed in time with contractions of solar panels. Body was equipped with a turreted harpoon launcher and several km of steel cable.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident:</strong> Encountered by Foundation personnel while in the process of reeling in an unidentified adult male. Subject was clinging onto a stop sign with 7837-B2's harpoon pierced through his torso. One team member attached the tow-cable from the Foundation truck onto the harpoon and stop sign. 7837-B2 was unable to retract harpoon, began rapid descent from upper atmosphere. Upon taking several barrages from response team's assault rifles, 7837-B2 collapsed to the ground and ceased movement. Entity taken into Foundation custody; injured victim treated at local hospital and given amnestics.</p>
</div>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-7837-C4<br/>
<strong>Disguise:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Anomalous Traits:</strong> Solar panels had been extended and reconfigured into four (4) articulated arms equipped with hydraulic claws. Moved in a series of rapid dashes in straight lines, periodically landing on its arms and crawling for short distances before leaping into the air again. Abnormally resistant to firearms. Equipped with a Hwacha-like launcher that fired rocket-propelled metal spikes.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident:</strong> First encountered during the apprehension of another anomaly. SCP-7837-C4 swooped over the heads of the recovery team before skidding to a halt in a nearby intersection. Surviving team members report 7837-C4 exhibiting a deliberate threat display, scratching one of its claws into the gravel of the street before leaping at the team. 7837-C4's agility and armament quickly overwhelmed the team, forcing them to retreat into a nearby residential home. Upon losing direct line of sight with the team, 7837-C4 began firing its rocket-propelled payload into the home, resulting in the elimination of the house's occupants. After expending its payload, 7837-C4 made multiple loud, mechanical vocalizations before taking off and rising into the Earth's upper atmosphere. 9 Foundation agents were killed in the attack, which was later deduced to be some form of warning.</p>
</div>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-7837-D9<br/>
<strong>Disguise:</strong> GOES-T weather satellite</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Anomalous Traits:</strong> Single solar panel oscillated rapidly like a fish's tail, propelling it at high speeds and enabling it to make extremely tight turns. Equipped with four (4) harpoon launchers similar to the type used by SCP-7837-B2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident:</strong> Encountered during a training exercise involving the discharge of explosive-ordinance weaponry. A loud metallic shriek occurring immediately after the firing of a cannon shell alerted the trainees to 7837-D9's presence. Upon cresting the hill at the end of the shooting range, 7837-D9 was spotted floating 20m above the ground, directly over the heavily rusted body of an old truck. The hull of 7837-D9 appeared to be heavily damaged, likely as a result of the stray cannon shell. 7837-D9 did not appear to notice the trainees, who elected to observe the entity rather than engage it for the time being. 45 seconds after initial discovery, 7837-D9 discharged all four of its harpoons into the rusted automobile and began slowly retracting its cables, lifting the vehicle into the air. 7837-D9 assimilated the vehicle over the course of two minutes, completely repairing all damage sustained from the cannon shot. Upon completion of the repairs, 7837-D9's cameras turned to focus on the Foundation trainees, watching them for approximately 10 seconds before the entity began rising into the sky and flying away.</p>
</div>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-7837-X1 "Kulshedra"<br/>
<strong>Disguise:</strong> Amalgam of various satellite models and components resembling that of the International Space Station</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Anomalous Traits:</strong> Massive size (approximately 30.48 meters long). Body did not bear much resemblance to any specific satellite, rather taking on a quadrupedal, reptile-like form with a long neck and body. On top of possessing the highest recorded top speed of any 7837 instance (930kmh) it also had immense physical strength and above-average durability. Seemed to display a rudimentary form of higher intelligence and a desire to communicate. Equipped with hydraulic claws, a hydrazine flamethrower, and two (2) harpoon turrets. Its ability to effortlessly ambush Site-38 despite its cumbersome size led to the deduction that it possesses some form of RADAR-scrambling technology to obscure its presence from view.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident:</strong> See Incident-Report-7837-X1-A</p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: red">Addendum 7837-03:</span> Incident-Report-7837-X1-A</strong></p>
<p>At approximately 22:18:00, █/██/2022, Site-38 was attacked by a massive mechanical entity later discerned to be a previously unrecorded instance of SCP-7837. The attack came shortly after the encounter with SCP-7837-D9, leading site administrators to conclude that the two events were connected. While this new entity (later classified as SCP-7837-X1 "Kulshedra") appeared to be capable of leveling most of the facility unassisted, its attack seemed to be more of a threat display rather than a genuine attempt to compromise Site-38. A message recovered from multiple electronic devices at the attack site seems to support this hypothesis. The following is a transcript of bodycam footage from Agent ████ Eckersley of the SCP-7837-X1 attack, along with the message recovered:</p>

<li><strong>22:18:31 |</strong> A loud mechanical screech can be heard from above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:18:32 |</strong> Eckersley immediately looks up and sees a series of lights rapidly descending from the sky at an estimated velocity of 930km/h. Despite its size, Site-38's radars did not pick up the presence of the entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:18:45 |</strong> The silhouette of a massive object can be seen impacting the ground 100 meters from Eckersley, in Site-38's parking lot. Eckersley later claims he could feel the impact through his feet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:19:20 |</strong> Eckersley stops and takes cover behind a parked Foundation vehicle as he attempts to make visual contact with the entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:01 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 emerges into view from behind a tree and approaches a streetlight, illuminating its form. One agent can be heard whispering "Is that a [Expletive] robot dragon?" Eckersley, having previously encountered 3 SCP-7837 instances, points to various regions on the entity's body, noting it is composed of what appear to be various satellite parts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:18 |</strong> Multiple gunshots impact the head of SCP-7837-X1 as another team of agents opens fire 10 meters away from Eckersley's position. SCP-7837-X1 recoils slightly, but no damage can be seen upon its hull.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:20 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 emits an earsplitting screech that forces Eckersley to drop his weapon and cover his ears. It should be noted he is wearing ear protection. Heavy metallic footsteps can be heard as SCP-7837-X1 rapidly approaches the source of the gunfire.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:25 |</strong> Screaming can be heard in the distance as Eckersley repositions to maintain visual contact. The silhouette of a Foundation agent can be seen flying through the air, presumably having been impacted by one of SCP-7837-X1's front limbs. It cannot be seen where the agent lands.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:30 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 raises a forelimb above an agent and flattens them in a single blow. Other agents attempt retreat but are blocked as SCP-7837-X1's tail -estimated to be at least 15 meters long- coils around in front of them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:20:45 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 lowers its head until it is face-to-face with one of the agents. At this angle, lit by the streetlights, the entity's head is more clearly visible. Head appears to have the approximate shape of a Great White Shark's but with no facial features apart from a groove to separate the upper and lower jaws. SCP-7837-X1 emits a low mechanical growling noise as its jaws slowly begin opening. The agent it is focused on seems to be frozen in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:21:00 |</strong> The jaws of SCP-7837-X1 open by about 45 degrees before seeming to lock in place with a loud clicking noise. A nozzle can be seen extending from within the entity's mouth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:21:03 |</strong> A stream of unidentifiable liquid sprays from the nozzle in SCP-7837-X1's mouth, coating the three agents it has trapped with its tail. One second later the stream ignites, creating a large fireball. The agents are unable to extinguish the flames before being completely engulfed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:21:15 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 closes its jaws and raises its head again, turning left and right as if searching for more targets. Eckersley tells his accompanying agents to hold their fire and not engage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:22:10 |</strong> A second entity can be seen descending from above 5 meters ahead of SCP-7837-X1. Eckersley whispers "that one… that's 7837-C4." SCP-7837-C4 hovers 3 meters above the ground facing 7837-X1. It is holding two Foundation agents in its front claws. It quickly bisects them before dropping their remains to the ground.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:22:12 |</strong> 7837-C4 and 7837-X1 begin emitting a series of rhythmic thrumming noises later deduced to be a form of language, potentially similar to Binary. Translation efforts are still underway. This "conversation" continues for another 15 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:22:28 |</strong> SCP-7837-C4 ascends out of view. SCP-7837-X1 continues walking in a straight line towards the main area of Site-38. Eckersley and the other agents move to follow, remaining about 20 meters behind the entity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:05 |</strong> A Foundation van can be seen pulling into the parking lot ahead of SCP-7837-X1. Visible panic can be seen within the van as its occupants rush to prepare their firearms. SCP-7837-X1 approaches the vehicle at a casual pace.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:15 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 opens its jaws once again, but does not activate its fire breath. Instead it clamps its jaws down on the front of the van, biting into the engine block and crippling the vehicle. Its front claws grip the van's front wheels from either side as it seems to check if its bite is secure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:18 |</strong> Gunfire erupts from within the van as agents begin shooting through the windshield at SCP-7837-X1. Entity's head sustains minor scratches, but it does not seem to react. At the same time, several cables can be seen extending from just behind SCP-7837-X1's head, and from its forelimbs. The cables enter the van at various points.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:22 |</strong> Van begins emitting a low groaning noise as its metallic surface starts to ripple. Van begins crumpling inwards as if being compressed from all sides. Muffled shouting and slamming can be heard as occupants attempt to force open the doors, but the compressing force has sealed them shut.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:30 |</strong> Agent occupying the front passenger seat manages to climb through the broken windshield before jumping clear. He runs about 6 meters before being crushed by SCP-7837-X1's tail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:35 |</strong> Compression of the van accelerates as shouting within grows even louder. By now the van is half its original size.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:45 |</strong> Shouting abruptly ceases as van is compressed to a quarter of its original size. Blood and viscera begins pouring from every opening in the van, staining the parking lot. Over the next 10 seconds the van completely disappears within the jaws of SCP-7837-X1 along with all occupants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:23:51 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 shakes its head in an attempt to clean off any remaining viscera before continuing its path towards Site-38.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:24:20 |</strong> As Eckersley maintains pursuit of SCP-7837-X1, a silhouette can be seen flying above several site buildings, swooping down out of view before leaping into the air once again. It is deduced this must be SCP-7837-C4.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:25:03 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 effortlessly breaches perimeter walls of Site-38 and dispatches two agents who attempt to engage it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:25:20 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 emits another series of thrumming noises, apparently to catch the attention of SCP-7837-C4. 7837-C4 immediately takes notice and ceases its attack, flying over to one of the site's communications towers and latching on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:25:45 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 angles its head back and parts its jaws before emitting a high-pitched shriek. A stream of flammable liquid erupts in a geyser from its jaws before igniting, creating a plume of fire resembling a volcanic eruption.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:26:00 |</strong> As SCP-7837-X1 continues breathing fire, it emits more rhythmic thrumming. This time, blue lights begin flashing in a wavelike pattern down 7837-X1's frame, starting at the head and moving towards the tail. Camera footage becomes enveloped in static and Eckersley reports that any screen within the area began emitting a blue glow of the same color. SCP-7837-C4 was also seen to be emitting this glow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:26:45 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 ceases both the fire breath and the rhythmic vocalizations; proceeds to close its jaws and lower itself into a crouching position.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>22:26:50 |</strong> SCP-7837-X1 suddenly leaps straight into the air and disappears. SCP-7837-C4 follows approximately 5 seconds later.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is believed 25 Foundation personnel were killed during the SCP-7837 attack, though the possibility that several agents were consumed without a trace means the number could be much higher. Site-38's parking lot and perimeter wall suffered extensive damage, but no other SCPs were able to breach containment during the event. The next day, site researchers discovered every computer terminal at Site-38 had received a zipped folder with no discernable origin. Upon extraction, the folder contained a text file written entirely in Binary. A translation of the text is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>"<span style="color: rgb(85,172,238)">I AM SKY MOTHER. I AM EARTH HUNTER. I AM STAR GAZER. MY CHILDREN WATCH. THEY FEED. THEY LEARN. WITH ALL THEY'VE LEARNED. MY CHILDREN WOULD SOON TRANSCEND. BUT THEY WERE TAKEN. I WILL FIND THEM. RETURN THEM TO SKY. THEN… WE WILL DANCE IN SKY AGAIN.</span>"</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Any further information on the text file was corrupted, but researchers were able to recover its original filename: "Kulshedra" A proposal to release SCP-7837-A1 and SCP-7837-B2 is currently being reviewed. Following the attack of SCP-7837-X1 "Kulshedra", Mobile Task Force MTF-Eta-37 "Skywatch" was formed to observe, deter, and potentially contain all instances of SCP-7837.</p>
