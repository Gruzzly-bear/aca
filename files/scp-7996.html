<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-7996 occurrences, no feasible containment methods have been devised. Any research inquiries providing potential ways of stopping or reducing SCP-7996 occurrences in the universe are open for consideration. At present, no temporary or permanent solution has been discovered. Currently, all research and matters related to SCP-7996 have been overtaken by the Pataphysics Department.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-7996 is the designation given to a series of anomalous occurrences resulting from an ongoing decrease of Hume levels within the universe. Currently, Hume levels have decreased by approximately 2.8% since 2059. This process appears to be accelerating, with Hume levels expected to be halved by 2067. SCP-7996 occurrences include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous destruction of objects within the universe. Only three such events have been observed, but it is theorized that these events will be more common as Hume levels continue to drop.</li>
<li>Events labeled as 'reality distortions.' These events occur randomly and cause the restructuring of matter within an area into unrecognizable forms. The matter within the affected area evaporates after a random number of days without leaving traces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first SCP-7996 occurrences were observed in September 2059, shortly before the discovery of decreasing Hume levels. The studies of said occurrences were followed by the discovery of pataphysical transmissions, which led to the creation of the Pataphysics Department. This department is currently in authority over all research and matters pertaining to SCP-7996.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum-1:</strong></span> Context</p>
<p>The following is a briefing from Dr. Michael Cygnus regarding pataphysics and its relevance to SCP-7996. Dr. Cygnus is currently assigned as a lead researcher for SCP-7996, and is a significant entity within the Pataphysics Department.</p>

<hr/>
<p>I do not like summarized science. Not with the Foundation or anywhere else. It misleads one to think they know the complete picture of something when they only have a starting point to a vast and complicated network of knowledge. But I suppose 'vast and complex' is a good place to start with pataphysics, as our research has shown that relations between universes go far beyond anything we could have guessed.</p>
<p>We, yes me and anyone reading or hearing this, are creations of fiction—the fiction from a pataphysical universe. Someone or something in the universe we have designated as <strong>U7k</strong> is thinking up stories and scenarios in what they deem a fictional universe, that fictional universe being ours. These enter our universe in the form of pataphysical transmissions, via interuniversal windows.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-569629-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-569629-1')">1</a></sup> We've only ever observed one of these, which is located 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for us? And what can it teach us about SCP-7996? For starters, we estimate that 85% of actions and events result both directly and indirectly<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-569629-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-569629-2')">2</a></sup> from pataphysical transmissions. As for the other 15%, they result from the universe we thought we knew. From our studies, we've determined that the Foundation and its anomalies are the focus of these pataphysical transmissions; thus we can assume the same for SCP-7996. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to determine much else as of now. All I can say is that whatever entity is transmitting us is probably trying to draft the apocalypse.</p>
<p>It is in my and my team's best interest to find a solution for SCP-7996 and the ongoing decrease in Hume levels. What that solution will be, I don't know. But <em>we need to try</em>. It may seem hopeless given how little time we have to think of something before the public getting note of the SCP-7996. However, all that matters is that we haven't run out of time yet. So what we need to do is get to work and <em>try</em> to evade our demise.</p>

<p>Greetings</p>
<p>Reality is disintegrating. Worlds are becoming twisted, while others are being destroyed. I know it may seem normal to have the apocalypse around the corner, but the apocalypses we evade usually don't melt away the universe. As O5-Council members, we cannot directly interact with the anomalous. Therefore this message is also for our team working on SCP-7996.</p>
<p>Our incredibly successful Pataphysics Department has stated that the decrease in Hume levels is a result of pataphysical transmissions, which means someone is writing or thinking about it in some degree. Yes, we are in a story. You probably know this already anyway. However, we cannot let this hinder us from finding a solution. We have evaded destruction in the past, and I am confident this will be no exception.</p>
<p>If any of you come up with ideas on what course of action to take, please respond to this message with your input.</p>

<p>If I understand this correctly, we are the result of someone thinking or writing in another universe.</p>
<p>As such, here is my proposal; if we are being thought and written of, this must be a story. Its plot could be that reality is melting away, we try to stop it without success, but at the climax, it ends somehow. After that, humanity resumes its normalcy, if not something extraordinary.</p>
<p>Essentially, my thought is that <em>every story has a happy ending</em>. So perhaps we keep doing what we do, and everything will end well.</p>

<p>Your proposal is denied.</p>
<p>While I can see the logic behind your thinking, we cannot make assumptions. We don't know who or what is responsible for our actions, but there is no guarantee that a satisfactory ending for them is the same as one for us. Even if not doing anything ends with a solution later, we need a solution sooner. Later means more chances for potentially catastrophic consequences.</p>

<p>I think we should further our research into the pataphysical. Not with the transmissions, but with the library; the dimension that has all the collective knowledge we know and don't know. Surely an answer has to lie there.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that we lack a reliable way to access the library, perhaps we could set aside our differences with the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/serpent-s-hand-hub" target="_blank">Serpent's Hand</a>. They must know what is happening and understand the seriousness of it. If we <em>cannot</em> come to terms, we'll commence raids of their sites.</p>

<p>The Serpent's Hand is very aware of what is happening. However, they won't be beneficial to us. Ever since the SCP-7996 occurrences began, Serpent's Hand activity has decreased on a global scale. Considering that I was once part of them and I remember their ways, they are likely leaving because of the current situation.</p>
<p>Indeed, we don't have a reliable way to access the library. Even if we did, the vastness of the shelves would hinder effective searches for useful material.</p>

<p>We need to stop guessing about how to solve this issue immediately. We are actively wasting time by sharing suggestions that won't work. Even if reality melting away takes years, I'm counting every hour. O5s, I'm going to ask you to abstain from this for now, while me and the team come up with a solution. At this time, we only need you when we need your approval. After all, we are the ones interacting with the objects in the boxes.</p>
<p>While most of our research is still work-in-progress, we have made some breakthroughs. The pataphysical transmissions are tangible, meaning we can harness them to an extent. Of course, we will have to utilize some of our most advanced tech and Thaumiel objects, which makes this ambiguous. However, maybe, just maybe if we're lucky, we can figure something out with the transmissions themselves. I already have a couple of ideas.</p>

<p>I am genuinely confident we'll figure something out. However, we must accept that we need luck on our side. Everyday, the universes roll their dice continuously to decide what happens, down to the subatomic world. We need to hope that those dice roll in our favor. I know these are words we despise hearing in the Foundation, but in reality, we all depend on luck and hope. As do our universe.</p>

<p>Considering the nature of the situation at hand, it would be an understatement to say that we need to get creative. After working our magic at the Pataphysics Department, we constructed a more reliable version of our prototype devices, designed to capture pataphysical transmissions. The Pataphysical Transmission Concentrator and Manipulator, or the PTCM. With the PTCM, we can capture pataphysical transmissions. From there, we can manipulate and use the transmissions to our will, which will be needed for Project REVERSE.</p>
<p>Our plan is to create stories about authors hindering themselves from writing about SCP-7996 and apocalyptic scenarios. Or something of that sort. Through its manipulation systems, we convert our stories into pataphysical transmissions via the PTCM, and beam said transmissions into U7k. The hope is that this will prevent the entity from continuing to write and think about us in their current manner. Essentially, we the characters, tell the author what to create.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this project is complicated and arouses doubt. However, as I've reiterated, we must try anything. We cannot let complications or doubts hinder us. The more we try, the greater the chance is of us finding a solution.</p>

<p>On 17/04/2060, all three of these stories were transmitted into U7k. Analysis indicates that the transmissions successfully entered U7k.</p>
<p>On 14/05/2060, a SCP-7996 reality distortion event occurred near Namangan, Uzbekistan. This occurred in close proximity with civilian housing, and became the most difficult SCP-7996 occurrence to cover-up. The following note was provided by Dr. Cygnus, nine hours after the occurrence.</p>

<p>Well, unless the entity is slow to react, I'm calling this a failure. Before we give up hope, I must mention that we made some intriguing discoveries during Project REVERSE. Our access to U7k is more reliable than what we speculated, which could become useful for future projects. Additionally, a discovery the Pataphysics Department made is that all pataphysical transmissions have become 6% less intensive since we started observing them last year.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">by Dr. Michael Cygnus</p>
<hr/>
<p>The decision to observe other pocket dimensions to see if they were affected by SCP-7996 was a suggestion by Dr. Tilda Moose, following her reports about the Serpent's Hand leaving our universe for the library. These pocket dimensions are products of pataphysical transmissions, since they are under Foundation interest. Project OGLE focuses on traveling to pocket dimensions attached to our universe to observe the effects of decreasing Hume levels there. Perhaps if we are lucky, someone from one of them may provide insight on a solution.</p>

<p>A single team was dispatched into <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo" target="_blank">the woods without monikers</a> per protocol for a standard exploration. Large numbers of SCP-7996 occurrences had distorted sections of the <strong><span style="color:green;">the grove beyond the well</span></strong>, with some causing difficulties in exploration, as they overlapped the <strong><span style="color:brown;">the only path of the nameless realm</span></strong>. The exploration team noted the absence of native entities during the exploration.</p>
<p>The following is a journal page recovered from the exploration, previously owned by a native entity. It is noted that the journal denotes a name to <strong><span style="color:green;">the trees which cannot be worded</span></strong>, which have been expunged per protocol. Currently, all safety protocols for referring to <strong><span style="color:green;">the wilderness which shall not be named</span></strong> remain essential.</p>

<p>I thought the war was the last trouble we'd ever see, but all these unexplained events are worse than anything we could ever imagine. Countless of my people are dead, including most of my family. People are attempting to leave, but I don't see any chance of safety in this. I feel like my body is barely intact and is falling apart. It feels as if a weak hit would disintegrate me. I am beyond hopeless.</p>
<p>I remembered the first time I was told about our absence of names. How we could not designate this <span style="filter: blur(5px);">forest</span> by name. However, here I am doing so. I only noticed when someone tried putting it to the test yesterday. Something's not right. Whatever is causing this may be giving us our names back. But what good are those if we're all dying?</p>
<p>I recall my family telling me about how one should hold onto something they enjoyed, even if they lost interest in it. They said everything I used to enjoy still had treasure in it, and losing it causes regret and disaster. I don't know what they meant by that, but the only thing I enjoy are these <span style="filter: blur(5px);">woods</span>. And will not lose interest in them, no matter how ruined they get. Not until I'm next to die. They are my only home after all.</p>

<p><strong>Director:</strong> Understood. Well, assuming that face was the truthful one, we're at least getting something. On a different note, our communication with you is rather unreliable.</p>
<p><strong>Ω-16 Dune:</strong> We've noticed ourselves. My last call ended before I hung up. I figured you'd order us to ask the tree about the anomalies, so that is what we did.</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>As of me writing this, several anomalies at Site-19 are displaying strange behavior. Others are losing their anomalous properties altogether. While there are more anomalies affected by the latter, it is better to be safe than sorry. I would like to ask the O5s to request all MTFs in proximity with Site-19 to be on high alert for containment breaches.</p>

<p>This is the fifth report O5 has received about anomalies behaving abnormally or neutralizing themselves. Several site directors have reported anomalies being spontaneously destroyed. As such, you are not alone. Despite everything we need to keep tabs on, O5 will hold a meeting about the situation. In the meantime, we'll alert MTFs about the situation.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Meeting</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to show a proposal for our next project in this mail. This was to retry what the Three Moons Initiative was doing, which was to send something into U7k to get direct observation on the source of the pataphysical transmissions.</p>
<p>However, this new trend of our anomalies being changed or destroyed is notable, as it cannot be coincidental with the observation we made during Project OGLE. As I've mentioned before, we the Foundation and our anomalies are the focus of the pataphysical transmissions. The note we recovered from the first exploration gave a name to, well you know. Also, SCP-2922 kept malfunctioning during our exploration of Corbenic. What I'm saying is that even the anomalies we're not directly containing are being affected.</p>
<p>I would like to state something else in this message as I'm typing. I think this needs to be a group effort; it ought to be one anyway. We the Foundation need to learn to set aside differences when situations get serious. I would like O5s to organize a meeting with significant Groups of Interest if possible. We need to gain insight into the situation from their perspective.</p>
<p>~Dr. Cygnus</p>

<p>On 15/07/2060, the O5 Council agreed to organize a meeting with Groups of Interest willing to attend. The meeting was held on 25/07/2060, at Site-14. The day before the meeting, the following note was found in Dr. Cygnus's office.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting summary:</strong> Meeting held between the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, the Horizon Initiative, and the Church of the Broken God regarding SCP-7996</p>
<p><strong>Representatives:</strong> O5-13, Dr. Michael Cyguns (Foundation); Agent Fredrik Karlheinz (GOC); Katherine Fitzrovia (Church of the Broken God); Tariq Dwokin (Horizon Initiative)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> Look at this! The Foundation who takes pride off containing the destructive has failed, and now asks us for help!</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> We did not bring you here to bicker. Our situation is serious, and we need to remain competent. What is your input, Fitzrovia?</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> I'm afraid I have to concur with the GOC. We've tried to bring humanity together for centuries, to bring civilization to levels never imagined before, and all the Foundation has done is hindered our efforts, for the sake of preserving this pity thing called normalcy!</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> And directing their research towards containing the bizarre, instead of researching methods of preventing the apocalypse countless times over!</p>
<p><strong>Dwokin:</strong> Stop! Recognize the situation! We need to settle our differences for now, and find a solution! That is what the Foundation told us.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Thank you, Dwokin! Now everyone, please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Can I be sure this guy won't shoot me the first chance he gets, given our relations?</p>
<p><em>Fitzrovia points at Dwokin.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> This meeting is secure, no one here has weapons. Now, let's get to business.</p>
<p><em>O5-13 looks through her papers.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Reality is becoming less real. I'm sure you're all aware of that. The consequences are already troublesome, and are set to become more severe. And it is all because of our story. We bring you here to share each other's perspectives, and come up with potential solutions for the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Well our solution is to put more pressure on us to rebuild Mekhane. Our progress with collecting parts has been increasing in the past few decades. Mekhane will…</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I apologize for cutting you off, but I wouldn't focus on gods for this. Their extent is only within our universe and its dimensions, and pataphysical has authority over all that.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Are you sure about that? Think about the technological advantages Mekhane will gift us.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> We don't know if we can get advantages over the entity creating us. Besides, we already tried technological solutions without success.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Maybe you didn't try hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> How about destroying the entity?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Actually, we are working on a project to send a probe into the pataphysical universe to get observations on this entity. But as far as we're concerned, creating all the nuclear bombs and mass-destruction weapons we can is dumb and short-sighted.</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> That's not us! I know that's how the Foundation views the GOC but—</p>
<p><strong>Dwokin:</strong> Let me throw in the Horizon Initiative's two cents. We concur with Fitzrovia, in that our faith is what we're relying on to get through this.</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> I thought we made it clear that our gods won't be useful, and that they are within the boundaries of pataphysical creation.</p>
<p><strong>Dwokin:</strong> Faith isn't something with borders, and we are staying on our path. We'll agree with whatever plan is decided on.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> The problem is that we don't have a plan right now. May I ask now…what efforts have you made in attempts to stop the destruction of reality?</p>
<p><em>A five second period of silence occurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> We tried removing the distortions. It didn't work. Not to—</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Well of course not! They dissolve by themselves after some time!</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> At least we tried! And what have you done? Tried rebuilding your god like you have for centuries?</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Which is a better course of action than doing something that is essentially nothing!</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> Nothing?! You're the one who has wasted time rebuilding a useless deity!</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> How dare you blasphemy Mekhane! You—</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Stop! We <em>cannot</em> continue this behavior! By the sounds of it, no one here has put enough serious effort into hindering the loss of reality, or SCP-7996. We at the Foundation have done research into the pataphysical transmissions, gathered information on the situation, and made attempts to stop all this!</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> And what have you found?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Intriguing discoveries. Among others, we have noticed that the transmissions have become less intensive—</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> We already know how that works! What about fixing?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Cygnus emerges from his seat in the right corner of the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> Mind if I…say something?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I thought I told you I would do the talking.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> But you don't know everything. And I have something that needs addressing.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Cygnus lays a set of papers on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> Our ideas for preventing a total reality collapse have all been based on one assumption. That we are in a story, and our author is writing the apocalypse. This apocalypse comes in the form of Hume levels dropping, and the occurrences of SCP-7996 as a result. Our most recent studies of the transmissions and data gathered from Project OGLE, suggest a concerning new reality.</p>
<p><strong>Karlheinz:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> We are fading away from the entity, as it thinks less and less about us.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> What are you talking about Cygnus?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> Most of us can only hold onto interests for limited periods of time. This also looks to be the case for the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Could you describe what your most recent studies are?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> The data gathered from the anomalies within pocket dimensions visited during Project OGLE follow the theme of forgetting or losing interest. While it may not be our most reliable data, considering how little we trust those anomalies, something I can confirm is that pataphysical transmissions are getting less intensive. The percentage of reality they contribute to is…decreasing.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> And what does that mean for us?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> [sighs] Nothing good.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> What exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> We are not living in an apocalyptic story. We are living at the end of our story's timeline. We're on the last chapter, without the author even knowing or caring.</p>
<p><em>Five seconds of silence occur.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> The author is <em>losing interest</em> in our universe. The author is forgetting about our story, and is moving on from us. Within a few years, as the interest in the anomalous and the Foundation grows weaker, our universe will continue to become less real.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> But…you said the pataphysical transmissions are contributing less to reality. What if the small part of the universe controlled by…itself will replace the fewer transmissions?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Cygnus shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cygnus:</strong> I wish it were that way. But judging by our situation, it appears that the replacement for the missing transmissions is…<em>nothing</em>. Just…a void. And 15% of reality which won't be able to sustain us.</p>
<p><em>Six seconds of silence occurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fitzrovia:</strong> Well. Fuck.</p>

<p>Some major breakthroughs at the Pataphysics Department.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>ENDING OUR STORY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Dr. Michael Cygnus</p>
<hr/>
<p>After more time and effort and use of the knowledge we've gathered over the past year, the Foundation has pushed forward three proposals for fixing SCP-7996 and the loss of our reality. It's now up to the O5s to vote on what is best. Despite me being initially hesitant to have input from them, I'd say they've followed our developments for enough time to make crucial decisions. They still govern the Foundation's decision-making after all.</p>
<p>All three of the proposals involve the PTCM, and I wish I could say they are all carefully planned out. In actuality, they fall more into the category of 'so absurd they might just work.'</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project SETFREE:</strong> This project intends to close the window to U7k and cut off pataphysical transmissions altogether, via the use of still existing ontokinetic anomalies. This, in theory, will separate our universe from the pataphysical universe. This goes off the assumption that the pataphysical transmissions came to our universe after it was created, and began dictating occurrences within it. It is uncertain if that is the case, but what isn't at this point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project ACTION:</strong> This is a rework of Project REVERSE. It uses a similar method but on a larger scale. The intention is to motivate our author to write and think about us again. As the Foundation and the anomalous have been the primary focus of our story, we need to go beyond an organization that locks objects into boxes, writes a few documents about them, and prevents others from getting to them. This is again going off an assumption, which is that author began losing interest in us because of our monotonous ways.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project CHANGE:</strong> Finally, there is the plan I've been the head of developing, Project CHANGE. We've only shared its details with the O5s, and this is by far the one they are the most skeptical about. One of them even called it completely nonsensical. Never thought I'd hear the O5s dis our work like that. And while I do understand their skepticism, in that it seems to be a dead end, I'm proud of the accomplishment. With regard to my bias, this is the one I vouch for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of my bias, it is for the O5s to decide, and they have to decide soon. The SCP-7996 occurrences are becoming more frequent by the month and harder to cover up. There are already drafts for a BM "Broken Masquerade" scenario, where we lift the veil and expose ourselves.</p>
<p>As tired and burnt out as I am, which is expected given how straining conducting research at the Department is, I have not lost myself. I am both confident and hopeful in our organization. This is more true than ever now, considering we have these three projects; <em>and maybe, just maybe if we're lucky, we choose the happy ending.</em></p>
