            <h1>SCP-1479</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1479</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The building that houses SCP-1479 has been successfully secured by Foundation property acquisition techniques; the accompanying complex has been retrofitted into Bio-Site 66, with structures added both above and below ground to accommodate Foundation needs. Several additional SCP objects have been moved to neighbouring buildings for study and containment.</p>
<p>SCP-1479 itself is to be kept shut and locked when not in use for testing. Researchers are advised to not introduce organisms produced by other anomalous items into SCP-1479 for cross testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1479 is contained in a basement room of a building originally intended to house auxiliary machinery at a closed coal-fired power plant. An Agent embedded in the local police force had been investigating reports of youth violence in the area, and came upon SCP-1479 while scouring the plant with an investigation team.</p>
<p>SCP-1479 appears to be an empty utility room that contains approximately 144 km<sup>2</sup> of taiga. While walls are visible through electronic devices, none are visible to the unassisted eye; no physical barriers can be detected, and objects can apparently pass through these 'walls' unhindered. From within, the entrance to SCP-1479 is set within a 3m x 5m rectangular granite megalith, which appears to be the only unnatural structure within the area. This megalith stands in the approximate centre of the area; wilderness extends approximately 6 kilometres in every direction, before one finds themselves on the opposite 'edge' of SCP-1479, facing the megalith again.</p>
<p>Geography seems to be consistent between visits, and material and personnel deposited within the area remain inside if the door is closed; time passes normally within SCP-1479, regardless of whether or not it is occupied. It has not been determined whether or not SCP-1479 has a proper ceiling; weather patterns appears to follow those expected of similar geographic areas, - complete with seasons roughly analogous to areas at latitude 60<sup>o</sup>N - though said activity does not mirror that of any similar locations on Earth.</p>
<p>On occasion, animal tracks, as well as small fauna such as birds and rodents, have been encountered within SCP-1479, with no apparent source. The original function and purpose of SCP-1479, if there even was one, is as of yet unknown.</p>
