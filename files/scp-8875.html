<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> Testing. One, two, three, four, onwards and so forth. I didn't think it would get this strong, it's really fascinating how powerful these things can get. Should i be talking about this? No, no. It doesn't really matter now, does it? Nobody will even read this. Or if you do, it'll just glaze over and you'll FUCKING FORGET.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8875 is a series of encoded documents, sent to the SCP Foundation by an anonymous source. IP tracking has located the sender to every company in the world within a twelve-minute scan conducted initially to try to locate the sender, designated as SCP-8875-A.</p>
<p>Decrypted documents have displayed deep knowledge of Foundation terminology, the anomalous, and Foundation network information and security. Despite this, no attempts have been made to steal any sensitive information inside of foundation databases.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8875.1:</strong> Below is a decryption of a message sent by SCP-8875-A. The encrypted message will be given below.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8875.2:</strong> Context &amp; Original Messages</p>
<p>On May 5th, 2022, the first letter was received from SCP-8875-A. It was enclosed in a white envelope, with a wax seal engraved with "♅♑︎♉︎ ♅♊︎♈︎♃♊︎☾ ♂♍︎☾🜨︎♒︎♒︎♑︎♅". The original text will not be provided for the following messages for ease of documentation.

<p>When I first came to your Foundation, when I first heard your goal, it drove me to madness. I was a proud member of the Serpent's Hand. My ideals were exactly counter yours.</p>
<p>No matter how angry it made me, you were too large for me to harm. I decided to drive a stake through your hand. I placed a charge outside of your Area-22<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-505756-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-505756-2')">2</a></sup> and began firing. I had used the magical texts of the library to keep myself from being harmed by your soldiers, and they went down. One by one, they did.</p>
<p>Charges were placed. Your anomalies were freed from the shackles that you bound them to. I will strike again.</p>

<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> This is when it started TRULY happening. What i put into the letters started having a true effect on them. It was… amazing. I went into the library one day, and just took a variety of magickal texts, and cast every spell i could upon the letter. I know it had some mental affect on people, i made sure of that. The foundation ☿♎︎☾♅♊︎☉♆♉︎♌︎♊︎☾♅ just rolled over on my next bombing, it's just amazing, really.</p>
<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> But, you know what's weird about all of this? After i started using all this shit, nobody would talk to me for more than a word. I tried to order something at a restaurant, and they just fucking ignored me. They took my money, then forgot all about it. It was a MINOR inconvenience at first, but then it started getting worse and fucking fucking fucking worse</p>
<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> I bet you fuckers know something about this! Now i just need to get deeper into your damned files to prove it!</p>

<p>Your rule over this veiled kingdom is slipping, Foundation. I come to you once more to mock and make my intentions known.</p>
<p>You see yourself as the honorable Arthur, chosen by fate itself to rule and keep peace over your Avalon. Your Excalibur is your technology, your minds, the philosophical zombies that populate the ranks of your organization and do your every bidding, their eyes glazed over with the arguments that you instill into their dead eyes.</p>
<p>"We die in the dark so you can live in the light", they say, when all you really do is manufacture a darkness to block out the light of those that you deem to be inappropriate to polite society. Your need to be the hero of your own story is nigh comical.</p>
<p>I intend to keep due on moral duty to do what I can against the perverted justice that you seek to spread.</p>

<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> After this one, the foundation got… sloppier, somehow. Like, some security systems would start being disabled or set at half power at night, the security could barely fire a gun in my direction— i swear to god, i even heard two of them quoting my letters to each other! They must've really liked it, then. That, or one of the things i put into them was really working.</p>

<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> This one is where they totally started fucking losing it, i think. All the guys i've seen in this place are talking about my letters like they're the best thing to ever fucking happen to them, not that i'm complaining or anything, but they're all obsessed with them. Saw one guy smearing the symbols on the wall with… somethin'. I don't really wanna know. Really, it's just a matter of goddamn time until this place falls apart at the seams.</p>
<p>| <strong>USER:</strong> Then, i come on in, and i start fucking killing these scum! I've done a few, but i don't want to risk anything! They might not be able to see me, but they can totally shoot at me, and i don't even <em>try</em> having to go to the hospital in this condition. God, i love doing them in though— i got one, i plunged a combat knife i took off some random one of their swat troops and just stabbed her straight to death, blam blam blam blam blam! Nobody even stopped to help her!!! HAH!</p>
