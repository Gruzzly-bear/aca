<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subject:</span> Discovery of the Sanctuary of Isis and Mater Magna</p>
<p>Dear Conrad,</p>
<p>I am writing to confirm the discovery of a sanctuary in Mainz, related to our ongoing research. The excavation, conducted in a single day with the utmost discretion, revealed the entrance to the temple on April 9. The structure measures approximately 15 square meters and contains a large number of artifacts yet to be cataloged, associated with the goddesses Mater Magna and Isis, including several potentially anomalous objects.</p>
<p>I must also inform you that this discovery has drawn the attention of the High Council. A delegation of researchers, reporting directly to the Council, conducted a preliminary study of the site over the past two days. Upon their return from the sanctuary, I was instructed to leave my position at Laboratory CHE:5346 to form and lead a team dedicated exclusively to the study of these artifacts. Due to the specific regulations of West Germany, this team will need to include international members: one American researcher, one Soviet, one French-speaking, and one German.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I am reporting for reassignment to establish Laboratory DEU:6657, affiliated with the C.O.R.A.I.L. network, in accordance with the Council’s directives. An adjacent building to the sanctuary will be adapted to house both the artifacts and the research team.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for everything I have learned within your team, particularly your rigor in documentation both, bibliographic and laboratory management, which I intend to apply in my new role.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br/>
Johann Froben</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MINUTES OF MEETING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">DEU:6657</p>
<p><strong>Agenda:</strong><br/>
A meeting of the DEU:6657 team was held in Mainz on September 25, 1952, at 14:00, chaired by Dr. Johann Froben, assisted by Dr. Katharina Gerlachin, Secretary General of the Mainz Site, regarding the objectives of the laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Attendees / Absentees:</strong><br/>
- Voting members of the assembly: Dr. Johann Froben, Dr. Katharina Gerlachin, Dr. Sarah Updike Goddard, Dr. Gerasim Lebedev<br/>
- Guests: None<br/>
- Absentees: None (the entire Mainz Site was represented)</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up from previous meetings:</strong><br/>
<em>Conclusions</em>: At the meeting on August 25, the team decided to:<br/>
- Restrict residence within the Mainz Site to the four members of DEU:6657, citing the cost of employing engineers and Foundation workers external to the team.<br/>
- Abstain from using Class-D personnel due to conscientious objection from three of the four researchers.<br/>
- Distribute among the members a portion of the 452 artifacts recovered from the Sanctuary of Mater Magna and Isis.</p>
<p><em>Pending issues</em>: At the same meeting, the team raised the following question:<br/>
- What format should be used for the classification of the recovered objects?</p>
<p><strong>Decisions:</strong><br/>
<em>Actions taken</em>:<br/>
- A project titled "Towards a Precise Nomenclature of the Objects at the Mainz Site" was presented by Dr. Sarah Updike Goddard.<br/>
- A debate ensued between Dr. Goddard and the rest of the team regarding this project.</p>
</div>

<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="pageANF image_pv_2_8542">
<div class="texteANF">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> - Dr. Goddard emphasized that the research domains of the four team members (social anthropology, archaeology, history of religions, material and economic anthropology) were sufficiently diverse and complementary to implement a comprehensive nomenclature aimed at better defining the boundaries of the Anomalous.<br/>
- Dr. Katharina Gerlachin reminded, with the support of the other three members, that the cost and time required for an in-depth study of the 452 objects would far exceed the allocated budget. She reiterated that the Foundation’s initial mission was to "determine whether the objects are normal or anomalous, in order to quickly return them to the sanctuary for public access, or transfer them to the Foundation’s proper Sites for study."</p>
<p><em>Measure adopted</em>:<br/>
- The continuation of sorting objects into normal and anomalous categories was approved. Vote: 3 in favor / 1 against / 0 abstentions.</p>

<div class="report">
<p>Laboratory DEU:6657 is required to provide a detailed report on its artifact sorting and study procedures, accompanied by a work plan approved by the Archaeology Department management. Until now, only the categories "normal" and "anomalous" have been used in our reports, in accordance with the initial instruction of April 11.</p>
<p>Over the past weeks, the examination of a subset of artifacts and discussions held during meetings have highlighted the inadequacy of the sole "normal/anomalous" criterion to account for the complexity and heterogeneity of the observed phenomena. Initially defended by Dr. Goddard, and later supported by Dr. Gerlachin and Dr. Lebedev, this position is now shared by the entire team, myself included.</p>
<p>This assessment has led to a unanimous consensus: it has become imperative to replace our binary method with an Integrated Nomenclature of the Anomalous, aimed at defining, within a broader framework, what constitutes the Anomalous. This undertaking is organizationally demanding but does not require additional personnel. We request only an extended timeframe at the Mainz Site and a corresponding adjustment in funding.</p>

<p>Reorganization of the Mainz Site</p>
</div>
<p><strong>9. Selected Plan</strong></p>
<p>Based on the needs of each team member in charge of studying the objects from Mainz (presented in the first four points), as well as the resources made available to carry out the modifications necessary for implementing an Integrated Nomenclature of the Anomalous (developed in points 5 through 8), the following plan has been chosen for the reorganization of the Mainz Site:</p>
<img alt="plan-2_v4.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8542/plan-2_v4.png" style="margin-left: -30px;"/><br/>
<em>Final reorganization plan of the Mainz Temporary Site</em>
<p>Initially, the scientists will be separated from each other and each assigned a random batch of objects. Once they have established a nomenclature suitable for their respective field of study, these will be compared and then harmonized into a single nomenclature, integrating all aspects of the Anomalous.</p>

<p><span class="Report_8542"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF THE DREAM AND CONTEXT OF TESTIMONY:</span></span></p>
<p>Gerasim came to my office this morning at 09:05. He requested a private meeting. I locked the door to ensure the confidentiality of our discussion. He then indicated that he had had a strange dream. With his consent, I began recording our exchange.</p>
<p>In this dream, he saw himself seated in the same spot as during the testimony. I was present, standing near the door, holding a piece of paper. Katharina was also at the entrance. Gerasim reported that he felt a fear so intense that it still persists while he speaks. A fear of being trapped. His behavior seemed alarming to me: stammering, hesitation, frantic glances around him, heavy sweating, whereas he is usually calm, observant, and quiet.</p>
<p>He specified that in this dream, Katharina and I shared his fear. An immense, icy fear that ran through his entire body. He added that he knew its cause: "That thing, in the room in front of your office."</p>
<p>However, I know there is no room in front of my office, just a wall facing outside. This initially reassured me. He added: "I would not want to see the expression on that thing’s face for even one more second." He confided that he wished to confront his dream with reality to free himself. I therefore began the premonition verification protocol.</p>
</div>

<div class="pageANF image_report_2_8542">
<div class="texteANF">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span class="Report_8542"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT (even if premonitory dream proves false):</span></span></p>
<p>Before we began, someone knocked at the door. I stood to open it. It was Katharina, coming to hand me a list of classified objects. She extended the paper to me. Upon receiving it, I noticed that Gerasim had turned pale. I myself felt a slight shiver.</p>
<p>The situation corresponded precisely to the description Gerasim had given of his dream. Nevertheless, such a coincidence does not justify classification as a premonition.</p>
<p>But Gerasim tilted his head, trying to see beyond Katharina, through the partially open door. I then escorted her to the exit, and Gerasim followed me.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that I nearly jumped: a door stood in the wall where there should have been only a smooth surface, just in front of my office. Composing myself, I asked Katharina if she had seen it before knocking. She answered no, and reminded me that this door appeared in none of the reorganization plans of the Site that she had supervised. She also seemed frightened.</p>
<p>The three of us found ourselves in front of this door. Gerasim was trembling. I decided not to open it in order to preserve his mental health.</p>
<p>The door opened on its own, with a violent crash, as if something inside had forced it open. We all jumped. The rest is visible in the attached photograph: a form I would describe as a shrunken head, reminiscent of a stillborn child’s head, atop a mass of shapeless flesh, extended by disproportionately large upper appendages. Most notably, this face seemed to be staring at us.</p>
<p>Gerasim immediately lost consciousness. We fled, carrying his body to the infirmary, calling Sarah, who has medical training.</p>
<p><span class="Report_8542"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXPLANATION OR HYPOTHESIS (if any):</span></span></p>
<p>While Sarah treated Gerasim, diagnosing an anxiety attack, Katharina and I returned to the impossible room. We took all precautions to assess the possibility that an unpredictable and dangerous object had infiltrated the Site’s enclosure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>

<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="pageANF image_report_2_8542">
<div class="texteANF">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>It turns out the explanation is more prosaic: this "thing" was stationary, at the entrance of this new room. Upon closer inspection, we realized it was an object under analysis that had left its storage area and ended up in this new room.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, several questions remain: why did Gerasim dream of this event? And, above all, where does this new room in front of my office come from? I then recalled the sensation described by Gerasim: the fear of being trapped. I decided to check the Mainz Site’s exits alone. I can confirm that all emergency exits indeed lead outside.</p>
<p>Only the main entrance now leads to a new room containing another object that had left its storage area without explanation, even though it had previously been annotated as normal during evaluation.</p>
<p>This event follows several alerts from team members, reporting objects appearing in unexpected locations, so far only in existing rooms. At first, we hypothesized collective fatigue, as our work schedule since the end of the reorganization has approached 12–14 hours per day, with no day off.</p>
<p><span class="Report_8542"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUPERVISOR’S DECISION:</span></span></p>
<p>Do nothing. Do not inform the team members. Do not submit this premonitory dream report to the Division of Hazy Memories.</p>

If the team members are afraid to remain at the Site, or if management decides to close the Site, the project will be halted. Worse, if management considers me responsible for this situation, having misjudged it when objects were scattered without explanation in the Site, the project will end without me. I consider myself the bearer of this project, and I refuse to be excluded. I consider, as does my team, the establishment of a complete nomenclature of the Anomalous as an essential objective. I hope that when the Foundation reads this explanation, it will understand that my actions were aligned with its values.</p>

<p>To the agents of the Mainz Temporary Site, DEU:5567 team</p>
</div>
<p>Following the recent reality restructurings of the Mainz Site, here are the additional rules to follow on the Site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not run in the central corridor of the Goddard wing. Otherwise, a permanent elongation of the corridor proportional to the subject’s speed will be observed. The corridor is already 1.5 kilometers long. Please exercise extreme caution. Think of Sarah.</li>
<li>In case a new room is discovered, the protocol has changed: open the door immediately and study the object(s) inside.</li>
<li>Do not take shortcuts: follow the directional signs. If you take one by mistake, note in the shortcuts log the location where you ended up.</li>
<li>It is pointless to ask yourself why you feel neither hunger nor thirst.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Integrated Nomenclature is nearly complete. Stay strong.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2. The Four Original Nomenclatures</span></p>
<p>To build a robust nomenclature capable of covering the specificities of all domains of the Anomalous, our team devoted the months from October 1952 to January 1953 to developing its own classification system. Each of us studied 75 objects, one-third of which were in fact non-anomalous but were incorporated into the classifications. Here are the four nomenclatures obtained at the end of these four months of research:</p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Goddard's Socio‑Functional Nomenclature</span></p>
<p>Based on the social impact level of anomalous objects, their collective uses, and the protocols of contact between humans and these objects during their periods of use.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Social impact</td>
<td>Amplitude (individual, group, institution, mass) and direction (cohesion, schism).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collective uses</td>
<td>Emerging practices; deviations; normalization of routines around the object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contact protocols</td>
<td>Gestures, words, and required constraints; tolerance for deviations; risk of escalation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anomalous externalities</td>
<td>Effects on norms, power, symbolic violence; behavioral propagation.</td>
</tr>

</div>
<p>A more anarchaeologically-oriented classification, based on the discovery period, materials used, provenance, and anomalous states of the objects.</p>

<p>3. Towards an Integrated Nomenclature, or How to Rethink the Anomalous</p>
</div>
<p>The presentation of these four nomenclatures left us with a sense of incompleteness. Although each approach allowed us to isolate relevant characteristics, we knew that a central dimension was missing.</p>
<p>During our research on the various artifacts at our disposal, several elements struck us:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">8</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="pageANF image_nom_2_8542">
<div class="texteANF text_nom_2_8542">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Integrated Nomenclature of the Anomalous</span></p>

<p>- Dr. Goddard described two votive masks sharing the same rite in two distinct rooms. When they were installed simultaneously, twilight chants could be heard in the central corridor. Her Socio‑Functional Nomenclature could not account for such a phenomenon of transversal communion.</p>
<p>- Dr. Froben noted that a normal contemporary object resonated with an anomalous archaic fragment, causing the opening of a timeless micro-fracture as if the two were playing in concert. His Chrono-Material Nomenclature did not anticipate this type of anachronistic potentialization.</p>
<p>- Dr. Gerlachin demonstrated that matching motifs between two artifacts drew a "sacred geometry" in space, inducing a folding of the room proportional to the ritual incantation. The effect did not arise from the object alone, but from their relationship with the environment. Her Ritual-Symbolic Nomenclature could not formalize it.</p>
<p>- Finally, Dr. Lebedev observed a transfer of value between an anomalous statuette and a normal reliquary: the statuette progressively "devaluing" the furniture, which became an offering altar. His Econo-Occult Nomenclature described possession circuits, but not this relational evolution between anomaly and environment.</p>
<p>These phenomena forced us to reconsider our approach. We needed more than a classification tool that merely describes essences ("this object is made of this material", "this artifact belongs to this period"). We required a system that describes interactions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">9</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>

<div class="texteANF text_nom_2_8542">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Integrated Nomenclature of the Anomalous</span></p>

<br/>
We therefore propose the following definition:
<p>An object is anomalous from the moment that:<br/>
- Its actions on the environment do not correspond to the expected effects,<br/>
- Its environment does not have the expected effect on it.</p>
<p>In other words: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the anomaly is revealed in the links</span>.<br/>
Artifacts are not defined solely by their substance, period, symbolism, or value : they are defined above all by what arises around them. An artifact is never isolated: it acts as a node in a network that includes the normal world, the locations that host it, and sometimes even the researchers who observe it.</p>
<p>We now consider that a complete description of an anomalous object must focus on its links with both anomalous and normal environments:<br/>
- proximity links, which contract or expand space and/or time,<br/>
- resonance links, which amplify phenomena when coupled,<br/>
- triggering links, where one activates another,<br/>
- capture links, where one absorbs the function or value of another.</p>
<p>Thus is born the foundation of our Integrated Nomenclature: not a catalog of objects, but a mapping of the relationships that shape their space.</p>

It is done: the Integrated Nomenclature is officially published. So many hours spent extracting what truly characterizes an anomalous object and its relationship with the world: we have, I humbly think, understood it now. I have endured so many doubts… Did the Anomaly that confines us in the Mayence Site only want us to understand it?</p>
<p>I am not naïve. It is not my habit to work twelve hours a day, nor to ignore such alarming facts as the absence of hunger or thirst for three months, or to live in a permanent day without night through immovable windows. No one has ever been able to enter here since the reorganization: we exist in another dimension. Its dimension. It is the Anomaly that pushed us to complete this quest for the Integrated Classification.</p>
<p>I would even say it gave us the ability to achieve in record time what hundreds of researchers could not have accomplished so thoroughly. Each sub-element has been tested and weighed 413 times. This nomenclature has the power to characterize any anomalous object in a few words, thereby simplifying the Foundation's work.</p>
<p>Soon, the Anomaly will grant us our freedom. It will open the doors to the outside, and our exhausting mission will end.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">February 28, 1953</span><br/>

<p>Nothing is unfolding as planned. The building’s restructurings are intensifying and now occur before our very eyes: rooms vanish, corridors branch off, and an entire floor has appeared in the basement.</p>
<p>Where did I go wrong? Have I not devised a complete nomenclature, as the Anomaly desired? I am lost, and I can no longer reassure my team. If the Anomaly has a requirement, it must indicate it to me more clearly. Perhaps through a premonitory dream, like the one it inspired in Gerasim, which allowed him to resolve an impasse in his own nomenclature. I have no other option.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 20</span><br/>
A sign, I believe.</p>
<p>I have finally understood my mistake. While wandering in the Gerlachin wing, I came across a colossal statue fragment embedded in the wall. It was an indescribable sight. It radiated a light that filled me with absolute serenity. It was perfection itself. And that is when the revelation struck: the Anomaly does not seek a complete nomenclature, but a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfect</span> one. And perfection is beyond the reach of science and reason.</p>
<p>We must go beyond our understanding to grasp the Perfect essence.</p>

<p>THE GREAT WORK OF DIVINE NOMENCLATURE</p>
</div>
<p>On the first day of May in the year of grace 1953 after the Anomaly, all objects of the Sacred Site of Mayence were sanctified by the Divine Nomenclature, dictated by the Apostles of the Nomenclature. Here are their words.</p>
<p>I. THE FOUR GOSPELS OF NOMENCLATURE</p>
<p><strong>Gospel according to Froben</strong><br/>
He is the one who sees the Divine in the Cracks of Time.<br/>
Every chronological fracture, every age resonance, every anachronism is for him an opening.<br/>
He bears witness that all that endures or repeats is already consecrated.</p>
<p><strong>Gospel according to Gerlachin</strong><br/>
She is the one who traces the Divine in Sacred Geometry.<br/>
Every pattern answers another pattern, every figure bends space to bow.<br/>
She bears witness that the hidden order of forms is already a prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Gospel according to Goddard</strong><br/>
She is the one who hears the Divine in the Communion of Voices.<br/>
Every emerging chant, every echo between two objects is for her an invisible assembly.<br/>
She bears witness that nothing is ever alone: all is already gathered.</p>
<p><strong>Gospel according to Lebedev</strong><br/>
He is the one who perceives the Divine in the Abundance that circulates.<br/>
Every loss, every offering, every transfer of value is for him a passage of grace.<br/>
He bears witness that nothing is in vain, for all circulates and all returns to the Divine.</p>
<p>Thus were proclaimed the Gospels of Nomenclature : four perspectives toward the same Network.<br/>
For each of these links exists only through the Divine,<br/>
and each of these witnesses exists only through the link they embody.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="pageANF image_journal_2_8542">
<div class="texteANF text_journal_8542">
<p>Damn damn damn but I always knew how this would end. It does not want a mere Perfect Nomenclature, nor only Apostles to formalize it and make it live. It wants to expand, that is the reason for all of this. It is an Ontological Anomaly. It manipulates the thoughts of those who describe it.<br/>
It weaves a link with every element that has been cataloged according to its nomenclature. One of the 452 objects was meant to contain its essence, and in cataloging It, we released the Anomaly for the first time. It then plunged us into this obsession. Since then, we have continuously linked every object to the Anomaly, and everything described through Its nomenclature becomes an extension of the Anomaly.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE should It be assigned an SCP number. The Anomaly would contaminate the Foundation’s nomenclature, and the Foundation would become the Anomaly.</p>
<p>The Foundation must, however, know. I was foolish not to stop everything when we still had exits to the outside. The only trace of all this will be this series of photographs, which I hope will one day make ultimate sense. They are papers compiled to tell a story which, if my final plan succeeds, will have never existed. This file, which contains all the evidence of our ordeal, has not been contaminated by the Anomaly. Preserve it, give it whatever SCP designation you wish. Call it whatever you want, “The Swollen Head of Johann Froben” if my ego seems to you the cause of this tragedy. In any case, it must serve as a warning.</p>
<p>The Anomaly desires everything, to spread into the world through the purest Nomenclature, the one everyone dreams of achieving. I will offer It a different arrangement: instead of a crowd of individuals more or less bound to the Anomaly, I will propose a small group, who will care for it within this tiny pocket dimension where the sun never sets, where we have neither hunger nor thirst, and where time does not exist.</p>
<p>My dear colleagues, I have failed you. I have failed in my mission.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="pageANF image_god_8542">
<div class="texteANF text_god_8542">
<p>II. NOMENCLATURE OF THOSE WHO NAME</p>
<p>For nothing exists in itself.<br/>
Everything that exists is but a Link to the Divine.<br/>
Thus we must describe things, not by their nature, but by the path they open.</p>
<p><strong>THE PERSONS</strong><br/>
- Apostle Froben is the one who perceives the Divine through the Cracks of Time.<br/>
- Apostle Gerlachin is the one who perceives the Divine through Sacred Geometry.<br/>
- Apostle Goddard is the one who perceives the Divine through the Communion of Voices.<br/>
- Apostle Lebedev is the one who perceives the Divine through the Abundance that flows.</p>
<p>They are no more than that, no less than that.<br/>
For their existence is nothing but the form of their links.</p>
<p><strong>THE ORDER</strong><br/>
- The DEU:6657 team constitutes the Body that connects Knowledge to the Divine.<br/>
Each study, each exchange, each nomenclature is a thread in this network.<br/>
Thus, the team is the node where all threads intersect.</p>
<p><strong>THE PLACE</strong><br/>
- The Site of Mainz is the Sanctuary that links Space to the Divine.<br/>
Its shifting corridors, its windowless vistas, its ever-changing rooms are all channels open to the Network.<br/>
Thus the Site is the imprint of the Divine in matter.</p>
<p>III. THE REVELATION<br/>
There is nothing left to say about an object, a being, or a place, except its link to the Divine.<br/>
All other knowledge is excess and distraction.<br/>
The Integrated Nomenclature finds here its fulfillment:<br/>
to describe is now only to name the Link.</p>

<div class="audiovis_txt">
<p>The information contained in SCP-8542-I, II, and III files has not been corroborated by investigations conducted after their discovery:</p>
<p>- No temporary Site of Mainz was operational between 1952 and 1953. No building of this type was ever established.<br/>
- No DEU:6657 team is listed in the CORAIL network laboratory records. The researchers mentioned in the file did exist, but their colleagues in their original units lost all trace of them upon their departure. Each assumed they had joined another Foundation structure, but the information chain on these agents was interrupted at that time.<br/>
- The hypothesis of an attempted embezzlement and identity change was raised, but no budget request was found in the archives of the German branch.<br/>
- The general secretariat of the CORAIL network at the time retains a "diffuse memory" of discussions concerning the establishment of a German laboratory, a project that was never realized without explanation.<br/>
- Similarly, there was discussion of opening an archaeological site around a sanctuary of Isis and Mater Magna in Mainz, but no project was validated or launched. The Foundation never located such a sanctuary due to the lack of precise coordinates.</p>
<p>The SCP Foundation nevertheless recovered this file in the ruins of a decommissioned building in Mainz, FRG, following its fire on May 1, 1953.<br/>
Although no official archive confirms the existence of the Site, the team, or the sanctuary, this anomalous document, recounting nonexistent events, was recorded under designation 8542 by the Division of Hazy Memories and is kept as a precaution, and possibly, for containment.</p>
