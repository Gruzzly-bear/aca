            <h1>SCP-5839</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5839</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Thaumiel</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All documents sent between SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 are archived in Archival Site-33. Individual documents may be viewed upon official request.</p>
<p>SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 are to be kept under observation of senior staff on site.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5839 refers to a phenomenon that the Foundation utilized between 1970 and 1975. It was an anomaly that allowed paperwork between SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 to shift temporally.</p>
<p>SCP-5839-1 was a researcher assigned to Site-65, age 24, named Neil Schofield. It possessed the ability to send handwritten notes addressed to SCP-5839-2 five years into the future.</p>
<p>SCP-5839-2 was an archivist on Archival Site-33, age 25, named Ella Hauser. It possessed the ability to send handwritten notes addressed to SCP-5839-1 five years back into the past.</p>
<p>SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 did not possess their abilities simultaneously. Instead, the ability to send notes to a different time period was transferred from SCP-5839-1 to SCP-5839-2 during the events of Addendum-2.</p>
<p>SCP-5839 has been used by the Foundation for the following purposes;</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovering damaged or lost documents.</li>
<li>Tracking and containment of undiscovered anomalies.</li>
<li>Preventing containment breaches and incidents.</li>
<li>Arresting agents of GoI's and finding other Persons of Interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The notes of SCP-5839-1 on <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5978">SCP-5978</a> kept disappearing after being written. It was discovered that this was not a side effect of the studied anomaly. Before an internal audit and disciplinary action were carried out, a note appeared before senior staff where the notes of SCP-5839-1 were supposed to be.</p>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="font-size:120%;">08/05/1975<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
To researcher Neil Schofield and his superiors,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I finally have obtained your notes regarding SCP-5978 that disappeared 5 years ago. I assume they were a request for me to provide some outdated documents from its prior researchers.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
However, your note seems to end abruptly and for an old note, it is in remarkable condition. Would you like me to still follow up on this request?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>

Archivist on Site-33<br/></span></p>

<br/>
The note was found to be dated 5 years into the future. Senior staff hypothesized that this note experienced an opposite effect of the note that disappeared.
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Addendum-1: Correspondence</span></h1>
<p>After several experiments with SCP-5839-1, another note was successfully sent into the future to request the assistance of SCP-5839-2 and the future Foundation.</p>
<p>After two weeks of experimenting, the following conditions were identified;</p>
<ul>
<li>Each note is to be handwritten by either SCP-5839-1 or SCP-5839-2.</li>
<li>Each note is to be addressed to the other party by name.</li>
<li>Notes need to be sent on a physical sheet of paper, they could not be sent in other formats<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, SCP-5839-1 showed high levels of stress when writing these notes. Upon questioning, SCP-5839-2 stated that it was not familiar with this effect.</p>
<p>On 04/06/1970, SCP-5839-1 was transferred to Site-33. After several days it became acquainted with the present version of SCP-5839-2 who did not yet possess any anomalous features. Over time the stress of SCP-5839-1 got better the more it seemed to trust SCP-5839-2.</p>
<p>SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 were encouraged to write each other to reduce the stress of SCP-5839-1. SCP-5839-1 also showed more interest in the present version of SCP-5839-2 because of this. Several examples are included below.<br/></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Nothing out of the ordinary happened as of late. I am really glad you told me to go on a walk today. The weather was indeed incredible. I can't do something similar for you but perhaps I can make that up to your past self.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/>

To Neil Schofield,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I know we can't talk too much about other anomalies except when we are asked to share notes, but today I archived a rather big file. It makes me wonder what the final size of our file will be.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
As for your suggestion, I'd like to take you up on that if the offer still stands. My birthday is two weeks from now, but I recall not having a lot of chances to celebrate it in the past.<br/>
You'll find a recipe for cheesecake in the second note. Please, give me a slice during a break, that should cheer me up quite a bit. I'm sure you can handle it.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Good luck,<br/>

To Ella,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Firstly, I wish you a happy birthday. And yes, I gave you a slice of cheesecake. Even though she knew it was your suggestion, she appreciated the gesture. It was not as set as I would like, so now I owe her a visit to the local cafe. I don't know if this was your intention or you knew about this, I surely am not complaining.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
P.S. A researcher wanted me to ask about some lottery numbers. He was promptly demoted, but they are now deliberating this option of gaining funds.<br/>

<h1 id="toc1"><span>Addendum-2: In The Nick Of Time</span></h1>
<p>After successfully preventing the breaches of <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3589">SCP-3589</a> and <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1297">SCP-1297</a>, SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 gained level 3 clearance and housing on Site-33. Occasionally they were granted access to level 4 documents for similar purposes.</p>
<p>After working together non-stop for almost 5 years, SCP-5839-1 became more worried about the approaching five-year timestamp. Below are some of the last exchanged entries between them.<br/></p>

Ella,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
So, I have been thinking a lot recently. We have been doing this for about 5 years but the Ella beside me still can't send things back into the past. Something is about to change, isn't it?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Regardless of what happens I have become quite attached to her. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I mean you. I mean</span> I think you know what I mean. I know I am not supposed to ask this, but is there a way that I can stay here in the archive? We've enjoyed each other's company quite a lot for the past years but as a researcher, I am honestly hoping I won't be transferred back. I like it here and it would be a shame to part with everything.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Neil<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
P.S. I don't know how many messages we have left, so thank you for working with me.<br/></span></p>

Neil,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
You'll see. It has been a pleasure working with you for these 5 years (again).<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
And if you are that worried about it, just ask me to stay beside you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Your partner in time,<br/>

After this message, SCP-5839-1 walked to the present version of SCP-5839-2. Although the footage is blurry, SCP-5839-1 can be seen kneeling down and presenting some sort of box. After three days, it was discovered that they both had changed their marital status. SCP-5839-1 lost its anomalous characteristics whilst SCP-5839-2 gained them. It is hypothesized that the acceptance of the proposal is associated with the acceptance of the phenomenon SCP-5839-1 possessed. Shortly after this, several notes on SCP-5978 appeared on Site-65, and Site-33 was informed to open a new file in the archive.
<p>On 29/04/1980, SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 celebrated their fifth anniversary and upon renewing their vows, lost all anomalous abilities. After this, both individuals agreed to be administered with Class C amnestics to remove classified information from their memory.</p>
<p>SCP-5839 was subsequently reclassified as Neutralized.</p>
