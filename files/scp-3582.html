            <h1>SCP-3582</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3582</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Area-3582 has been established around a perimeter encompassing the area currently affected by SCP-3582. Civilian presence is prohibited within 3 kilometres of Area-3582 under the cover story of a military testing base. A total of 250 Scranton Reality Anchors are placed at 30 meter intervals along the perimeter surrounding SCP-3582. Under no circumstances are non-D-Class personnel to enter SCP-3582. Any Foundation equipment or personnel affected by SCP-3582 are to be considered lost.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3582 is a spacial phenomenon encompassing a roughly circular area of approximately 36 square kilometres in Mitchell County, Georgia. The affected area, and all buildings, objects, and animals within it, are subject to random and sporadic reality alterations.</p>
<p>Observed alterations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>transformation of terrain to erratic, unnatural, and often non-Euclidean geometry.</li>
<li>spontaneous manifestation of individual non-anomalous objects and animals. It is of note that the point of manifestation is not affected by pre-existing geometry; this can result in the intersection and displacement of solid matter.</li>
<li>spontaneous replacement of individual objects and animals with non-anomalous analogs of the same variety.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hume readings of SCP-3582’s area of effect are wildly inconsistent; Hume levels range from the baseline of 1 to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">7</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">13</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">34</span> 72. At the current rate of exponentiation, it is estimated that Scranton Reality Anchors will become ineffective in mitigating the effects of SCP-3582 by 6/22/2024. Keter reclassification is under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3582.1:</strong> Timeline of notable events</p>
<p>The following is a list of several notable anomalous events within SCP-3582 taking place between its discovery and 3/15/2023.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Event Date</th>
<th>Event Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1/27/2021</td>
<td>Initial discovery of SCP-3582, following reports of unusual activity in the area. Initial containment procedures enacted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2/10/2021</td>
<td>Anomalous shifting of approximately 3 square kilometres within SCP-3582 to erratic and jagged terrain; mild damage to equipment within the area sustained. First major effects of SCP-3582 observed by Foundation personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11/23/2021</td>
<td>Spontaneous manifestation of 12 large ash trees during routine scouting, causing the deaths of 2 D-class personnel who were encased within a tree on its manifestation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4/10/2022</td>
<td>Manifestation of 3 female cows; one appeared almost completely underground and subsequently died of blood loss due to its body being displaced by surrounding dirt, one died after falling from approximately 15 meters above ground, and one was unharmed. All specimens were tested and found to be completely non-anomalous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/19/2022</td>
<td>One D-class personnel inspecting the manifestation of a Ford brand pickup truck was spontaneously replaced by a man in his mid-forties wearing dirty farm clothes. The subject panicked and became violent upon coming into contact with Area-3582 staff and was subsequently terminated. This is the first observed occurrence of SCP-3582 directly affecting a human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1/12/2023</td>
<td>Following a momentary loss of power to on-site SRAs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, approximately 200 tons of clay and dirt manifested within a section of Area-3582, resulting in the deaths of 18 Foundation personnel. SCP-3582 exclusion zone was expanded and containment procedures were revised.</td>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3582</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All new instances of SCP-3582-1 are to be documented and the affected areas to be, if possible, evacuated and quarantined. Both Foundations and cooperative Groups of Interest are to put forth collaborative efforts to stop, and potentially reverse, SCP-3582.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3582 is a spacial phenomenon encompassing an exponentially increasing percentage of earth's surface area. The affected area, and all buildings, objects, and animals within it, are subject to random and sporadic reality alterations.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Observed alterations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>transformation of terrain to cohesive, smooth, non anomalous geometry.</li>
<li>spontaneous manifestation of individual non-anomalous objects and animals. It is of note that the point of manifestation is affected by pre-existing geometry; this prevents the intersection of manifesting objects and pre-existing terrain.</li>
<li>spontaneous replacement of individual objects and animals with non-anomalous analogs of the same variety.</li>
<li>transformation of affected humans into SCP-3582-Σ instances (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-3582-Σ denotes humans affected by SCP-3582. Rather than being completely replaced by similar analogs, they are mentally and physically altered to what is seemingly a fusion of their previous identities and an unknown alternate identity. In 40 percent of cases, this results in minor brain damage, with 7 percent of cases resulting in severe brain damage or death.</p>
<p>SCP-3582 is currently theorized to be an ongoing intersection between this universe and a near identical iteration of it, henceforth referred to as “Öẞ-Class Multi-Universal Amalgamation Scenario”. The exact nature and origin of SCP-3582 are as of yet unknown. Measurements taken of interstellar phenomena assumed to be caused by SCP-3582 reveal that the initial collision occurred roughly 4 billion years ago.</p>
<p>SCP-3582-1 is the collective designation for all areas affected by SCP-3582. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">See supplementary document 3582-1.L for an unabridged listing of all known locations.</span> As of 6/4/2024, 26 percent of the earth has been covered by SCP-3582 and has been converted to SCP-3582-1.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Note 6/23/2024:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate of manifestation and expansion of SCP-3582-1 zones keeps increasing. We've lost contact with the containment staff of most of the other 3582-1 containment areas. I'd like to keep up clinical tone, but I don't think anyone who cares is ever going to see this. I can't even get through to O5 command, and Site Director Walters locked himself in his office a couple days ago.<br/>
Most populated areas started to collapse a couple months ago. Before we all locked up in the site, I could see the flames of rioters and crumbling buildings in the distance.<br/>
I don't think we have much time left before 3582 gets here too. Our backup power isn't enough to support the SRAs, so I can't be certain, but I can feel reality starting to fall apart around me. The few SCPs we had here have been decommissioned. Most researchers still here have resigned themselves to death, and I'm close to that as well. I don't see anything else there is to do at this point.</p>
