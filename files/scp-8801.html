<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8801 is to monitor its subject until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8801 is an abstract monitor object<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Harvey, Thomas, et al. "Utilization of Abstract Objects in Anomalous Information Gathering." <em>Metaphysics</em>, vol. 84, Sept. 1995, pp. 11–18.</span> created by the Department of Applied Metaphysics for use in data collection and espionage. SCP-8801 is capable of capturing experiential snapshots of a subject and their environment. Snapshots captured by SCP-8801 are brief and objective, and are stored digitally. The monitor object is currently undergoing preliminary testing prior to deployment. The test subject, a civilian human male designated SCP-8801-1, has been implanted with SCP-8801 since embryonic development.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8801.1:</strong> Project Update</p>
<p>On 2017/10/19, SCP-8801 reported that SCP-8801-1 suddenly ceased to exist, and initiated emergency shutdown. The original schematics of SCP-8801, as well as all snapshots captured by the monitor object, have subsequently undergone mild data corruption. A preliminary investigation found that SCP-8801-1 is currently alive and in ordinary condition. The cause of the breakdown is under analysis and data recovery operations are underway.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8801.2:</strong> Recovered Snapshots</p>
<p>The following snapshots have been recovered and translated into English by Juno.aic. Corrupted data is intentionally left blank.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:   99/  /  </strong><br/>
A transducer is applied over the belly. It is above SCP-8801-1. The transducer has three important outputs:</p>

<li>Chromosomes (  rd pair)</li>
</ol>
