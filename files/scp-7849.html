            <h1>SCP-7849</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7849</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The town of Marshlake, Washington, has been placed under surveillance until further information about SCP-7849 is uncovered. Two agents are to be stationed in an observation post <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">within the town</span> outside the town boundaries. Any unusual activity outside of SCP-7849 is to be noted.</p>
<p>If SCP-7849 occurs, affected subjects and witnesses are to be isolated and questioned before being administered Class-A amnestics. All attempts to investigate SCP-7849 outside Foundation jurisdiction are to be discouraged, and all recordings are to be deleted and/or blocked. In the event activities resembling Incident 7849-07 are noted, on-site personnel are to alert the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7849 is a recurring anomaly which first started on August 13th, 2019. As of recording, a total of eight cases of SCP-7849 have occurred. Currently, SCP-7849 has occurred exclusively around the town of Marshlake, Washington, and occurs on an irregular basis. The mechanism by which SCP-7849 occurs is unclear and under investigation.</p>
<p>Until Incident 7849-07, all SCP-7849 events followed the same format. In the event, a citizen/s, known as the subject, will faint. A few seconds later, they'll regain consciousness and stand back up, facing directly in front of them and gesturing in an orante posture<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. In this state, the subject becomes immovable, remaining fixed within the local environment, with all their bodily functions pausing. Approximately 30 seconds into SCP-7849, a female voice, around 100 dB, will emanate from the subject's mouth, announcing the words <em>"This is a test. It is only a test"</em>, followed by an accelerated dial tone. Approximately 20 seconds after this, SCP-7849 will end, and the subject will regain their consciousness and locomotion.</p>
<p>According to follow-up interviews and analysis, the subjects recall nothing happening to them during SCP-7849, nor will they exhibit any anomalous alterations.</p>
<p>What follows is an abridged list of SCP-7849 instances.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7849.1: Incident 7849-07</strong></p>
<p>On October 7th, 2019, all individuals within Marshlake, including all visiting individuals and on-site Foundation staff, were subject to SCP-7849. However, during this instance, no female voice was emitted. Instead, 10 seconds into entering stasis, a dial tone, followed by a series of repeating beeps, sounded, before a male voice announced, <em>"Brace. Brace. Activation imminent. Target is located."</em> 15 seconds after, all subjects' mouths opened and began emitting a sound, similar to those produced by civil defence sirens, at 140 dB. This continued for approximately 58 seconds before all subjects ceased, after which, the male voice announced, <em>"Deactivate. Target is disconnected. Deactivate. Threat neutralized. Deactivate."</em> A dial tone sounded, and the event ended. The event caused a total of 3 fatalities due to environmental factors, and several pieces of property received minor to moderate damage due to the force produced by the sound.</p>
<p>Following the incident, the subjects, including the Foundation personnel, were quarantined within the town, and all nearby sites were placed on high alert. However, after 72 hours, no new anomalous activities were detected, and no conditional changes in any registered SCPs or known GoI anomalies were identified. During interviews, subjects were not able to recall their experience during the incident, although all those who'd previously been subjected to SCP-7849 were able to recall a brief sensation of warmth and luminosity after being released from its effects. 37 of the subjects also possessed minor to moderate sunburn on their bodies which had not existed prior to the incident, with 25 of these burns being located in area that were clothed.</p>
<p>Since the incident, no further cases of SCP-7849 have been recorded within Marshlake.</p>
