            <h1>SCP-8506</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8506</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8506 is to be kept within a standard airtight anomalous artifact containment chamber. If at any point an entity exits SCP-8506, the chamber is to be opened and the entity inside detained for interrogation immediately.</p>
<p>Following incident 8506-A, any testing or application of SCP-8506 has been been paused indefinitely. If for any reason personnel are to enter SCP-8506-1, they may remain inside for no longer than 30 minutes at a time, followed by an immediate and comprehensive medical examination. Should any personnel become instances of SCP-8506-A, no attempts at recovery are to be made.</p>
<p>The remains of SCP-8506-B have been transferred to site-31’s non-anomalous artifact storage, testing may be performed on request.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8506 is a helix-shaped stairway built out of an anomalous, seemingly indestructible crystalline material. The structure is 5 metres tall and has a diameter of 10 metres. Despite its size, SCP-8506 weighs only 424.5 tons, making it extremely lightweight for its size and physical properties.</p>
<p>SCP-8506's primary anomalous property is triggered when any sapient entity ascends the helix, upon reaching a point four metres above the base of the item (Referred to as threshold υ), the entity ascending will be transported to SCP-8506-1.</p>
<p>SCP-8506-1 is an alternate reality, primarily consisting of an infinitely repeating helix of identical properties and appearance to SCP-8506. The atmosphere within SCP-8506-1 is consistent with air found on Earth and appears to cover infinite volume while remaining anomalously stable and resistant to gravity. Objects within SCP-8506 are affected by a downwards force identical to earth's gravity at sea level.</p>
<p>Aside from SCP-8506, the only object native to SCP-8506-1 is a luminescent body superficially resembling the sun. This body has never been observed to move from its location, implying it and SCP-8506 to be both fixed in one place. The physical properties of this object have not been directly observed, however radiation levels within SCP-8506-1 indicate that it is not a star, but rather a facsimile of earth's sun, producing light by unknown means.</p>
<p>While inside SCP-8506-1, living matter is immune to all known forms of damage and destruction, rendering death, dismemberment, organ damage or any other form of physical harm completely impossible.</p>
<p>Subjects inside SCP-8506-1 can return to baseline reality by passing through the point on SCP-8506 that those arriving in SCP-8506-1 initially manifest on (Believed to be superposed with and hence connected directly to threshold υ). Upon returning to baseline reality, all direct harm that was done to the subject while inside SCP-8506-1 will immediately occur on the subject’s body. If this occurrence would be immediately fatal to the subject, they will be unable to exit SCP-8506-1. At this point, the subject is now designated as an instance of SCP-8506-A.</p>
<p>As of 08/07/​█​​█, there are 33 instances of SCP-8506-A.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8506-1 - Discovery:</strong> SCP-8506 was discovered during a raid on the ​█​​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█ compound of GOI-789, a group of anomalous artists believed to be responsible for various anomalous phenomena around the ​█​​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█ region.</p>
<p>The compound was located following a series of interrogations conducted on SCP-​█​█​█​█, a former member of GOI-789. Through intel obtained from SCP-​█​█​█​█, along with testimonies from the surviving victims of SCP- ​█​█​█​█, SCP-​█​█​█​█, and SCP-​█​█​█​█, it was discovered that GOI-789 were inhabiting an area beneath █​​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█​█ forest. This intel also alerted the foundation to a ‘final piece’ currently being worked on by the ‘leader’ of GOI-789.</p>
<p>When alerted to foundation presence during the raid on the compound, members of the group began to proceed towards the same, previously unidentified subterranean chamber within the building. Upon foundation forces successfully entering the chamber, SCP-8506 was discovered, with all Persons of Interest who had entered the chamber absent.</p>
<p>During the raid on the compound, materials were found referring to a ‘Final experiment’, urging members of GOI-789 to ‘Devote their lives to the highest understanding in the world’. Several of these materials contained images depicting various members of GOI-789, as well as SCP-8506 and SCP-8506-1, referred to by these materials as the ‘ultimate experiment’.</p>
<p>22 of the group’s 50 members were able to be captured by foundation forces before ascending SCP-8506, however all those captured would quickly succumb to severe shock and rapid death upon exposure to the Scranton Reality Anchors possessed by foundation forces. Autopsies showed the members of the group to all have undergone extensive anomalous body modifications incompatible with non anomalously assisted life, primarily consisting of tissue being converted into transparent material and the addition of new or improved forms of sensory input.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8506-2 - Experiment logs:</strong> On account of the highly dangerous and uncontained persons within SCP-8506-1, testing was limited to a maximum of 24 hours and performed at site of discovery on account of high costs of transporting SCP-8506.</p>
<p>Prior to D-class experimentation, a series of observations were performed on SCP-8506</p>
<p>-The item was observed to be entirely indestructible, rendering sampling impossible.</p>
<p>-A Kant counter reading was performed on the item, damage to Hume levels immediately surrounding SCP-8506 indicated that the object was partially or wholly composed of matter not native to baseline reality</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-593087 was ordered to ascend SCP-8506, equipped with a live transmission equipped camera</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Upon crossing threshold υ, D-593087 disappeared, reappearing after 15 seconds. While the camera was unable to transmit video while outside baseline reality, upon return it was found to have successfully captured footage of the space, confirming its existence and leading to its classification as SCP-8506-1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-593087 was sent back into SCP-8506-1 and ordered to proceed up SCP-8506 for 30 minutes before returning. A junior researcher was sent into SCP-8506-1 in order to maintain contact with D-593087 through live audio-visual transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Shortly after setting off, D-593087’s line of communication began being subject to abnormal visual distortions and errors, believed to be the result of a physical property of SCP-8506. These distortions made contact between D-593087 and base command impossible, aborting the experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-593087 was equipped with a body camera and ordered to proceed up SCP-8506 for 30 minutes, ordered to return in case of any threat to life.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-593087 Proceeded up SCP-8506 for 16 minutes, before encountering POI-789-28, who proceeded to draw a modified firearm and shoot him in the right leg. Despite reporting pain and shock similar to those of a normal shooting, D-593087 was then able to stand up, finding no damage upon inspecting the point of impact as well as the bullet, crumpled on the ground infront of him. D-593087 was subsequently ordered to abort the experiment and proceeded back down SCP-8506.</p>
<p>Upon exiting SCP-8506-1, D-593087 reported a sudden burning sensation, before suddenly collapsing onto SCP-8506. Medical examination showed a bullet wound on D-593087’s right leg, noticeably lacking an embedded bullet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-459184 was ordered to enter SCP-8506-1, where a guard then injected her with a standard issue foundation formulated lethal serum. Subject then was instructed to return from SCP-8506-1</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Upon reaching threshold υ, D-459184 failed to return to baseline reality. Following repeated attempts to cross threshold υ, it became apparent that subject was unable to leave SCP-8506-1. Upon realisation of this fact, D-459184 became inconsolable and jumped down the centre of SCP-8506. It is currently believed that the subject is still alive within SCP-8506-1, and the subject has since been designated as SCP-8506-A-1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-583731 was sent into SCP-8506-1 and ordered to remain there for the remainder of the experimentation time (18 hours).</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-583731 successfully exited SCP-8506-1 at the end of the experiment, subject notably showed no signs of starvation or dehydration expected of such time spent without sustenance. It appears that the effects of SCP-8506-1 fully prevent harm from lack of sustenance.</p>

<p>Following the conclusion of testing, MTF-Π-29 (“Side steppers”) arrived at the site. On account of the distance that the targeted people of interest may have been able to cover within 24 hours, the task force were given 4 total weeks of time allowed inside SCP-8506-1 at maximum.</p>
<p>The task force were provided with long-distance hiking equipment and a video recording camera accompanied with a set of USB flash drives with parachutes attached, designed in order to send information down to the camp around threshold υ. In addition, each member of the task force was provided with a Scranton reality anchor, Kant counter, and taser in order to safely locate and detain reality benders.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration log</strong></p>
<p>Initial recording, taken after 30 minutes spent inside SCP-8506-1</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All four members of Π-29 are walking up SCP-8506. Nothing of note is visible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> Alright, team, it’s time for a routine check-up. This is pi-one, reporting no abnormal symptoms nor observations.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> This is pi-two, reporting same.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Reporting same</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Yeah, same.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> Four, did you want to say something?</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> It’s just that… doing all this and not getting tired, it feels… just, really odd, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> Yeah, I get it, your body is expecting a lack of energy, only for this place to feed you it. It’s like being on a massive IV drip, like something doesn’t want us to die, not even to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> I’d like to remind you not to speculate on there being any kind of ‘higher presence’ in this reality.</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> I’ll terminate the recording if no-one else has any sort of input on the events of our walk so far.</p>
<p><em>Silence for 13 seconds.</em></p>
<p>&lt;End recording&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recording taken after 2 hours and 15 minutes inside SCP-8506-1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The recording begins showing an instance of SCP-8506-A falling past the view of the camera, eventually falling out the view of the camera. The instance was unable to be identified.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> This is Operative Pi-one of task force Pi-twenty-nine, we have identified an individual we believe to be an instance of SCP-8506-A. Hopefully we got them on video.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><em>Silence for 4 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> This means we need to be looking out, there’s going to be more of them up here and we do not know how dangerous they could be. Remember, these are powerful reality benders here.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> I suppose then that we best be looking out for whatever caused them to fall like that.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Yeah, especially if they jumped off by themself.</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> Regardless, the recording should be arriving soon, though doubtless the instance will pass by first. We will keep ground control updated in any future instances, this is mobile task force Pi Twenty-nine, end communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recording taken after 24 hours inside SCP-8506-1</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> This is Pi one of Side steppers here, reporting that 24 hours have passed since we crossed the threshold. Side steppers, report your statuses</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Currently doing fine, no adverse reactions or undocumented phenomena to report.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> At 16 hours since entry I observed a faint scraping noise coming from the higher regions of SCP-8506. Other than that I haven’t noticed any more major effects.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> I think I might be hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> Please clarify</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> I’ve been hearing a loud noise, it sounds like wind howling, but when I focus on it… there’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> There shouldn’t be any wind here, your mind must be putting wind where it expects it to be. Standard reaction to extradimensional space.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> There’s also a feeling of dread.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Explain.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Sometimes, usually following the howling, I feel this kind of… intense, irrational sense of scopophobia. I become hyper aware that there’s no way to hide here, anything in the sky could see you at any point on this thing and track you, track you all the way to… well, God knows…</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> Alright then, end recording.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recording after 56 hours inside SCP-8506-1</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> This is Side steppers, we believe that there is a potentially hostile reality bender shortly above us.</p>
<p><em>The task force briefly ascends SCP-8506 before encountering a humanoid entity. Entity resembles a human of indiscernible ethnicity and age on account of extensive anomalous modification. The entirety of subject’s skin and various layers of other tissues are transparent seemingly attempting to display the insides of various organs and organ systems, aligning with modifications common among deceased members of GOI-789. Similarly, subject wears casual clothing bearing multiple symbols and icons found within the ██████████ compound. Subject has since been found to match descriptions of █​​█​█​█​█ █​​█​█​█​█​█, a known member of GOI-789.</em></p>
<p><em>Π-3 produces a Scranton reality anchor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Do not resist, this is the foundation. If you attempt to employ type green capabilities this device will activate, it will kill you.</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> Put that down. It won’t kill any of us.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> Twenty-two of your men are dead, most of them were killed by these. If this is activated, you will be trapped in here, possibly forever.</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> Well, no reason not to then.</p>
<p><em>Π-1, and Π-2 can both be heard producing SRAs. Π-1 possesses Π-4’s SRA, who is notably absent from the footage. The three present members form a pattern around █​​█​█​█​█​█, each member poised to activate their SRA.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> The foundation thanks you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><em>Π-1 places standard non-thaumaturgic hand restraints on the entity.</em></p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> You haven’t tested this place enough.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Explain yourself.</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> I’m done, just another wanderer on here. I’m not a monster that makes my flesh transparent anymore, I’m not a researcher, not an artist, not even a person of interest to anything still alive in the real world. I’m just a static part of this, and I’m as lost as all of you.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> I mean that I am a former reality bender, all of us are.</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> You’ve all got your Kant counters, haven’t you? Run them all over me, I’m an open book.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Why are you worth believing?</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> This claim is worth investigating at the very least.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> We must not allow less than four SRAs to be trained on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> Hold mine.</p>
<p><em>Π-2 Produces a Kant counter and performs a reading</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> There’s… nothing. Completely typical human readings.</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> I’ve not felt like this since I was young. I’m finite now, so you get me out of here so that I don’t have to live forever. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> Standard protocol must still be engaged; there is a non-zero chance that our Kant counters could be compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> Agreed.</p>
<p><em>Task force begin to descend SCP-8506 with █​​█​█​█​█​█ in tow, quickly encountering Π-4.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Is everyone alive?</p>
<p><em>Π-1 gives a thumbs up</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> We’ve safely detained one of them.</p>
<p><em>Π-4 begins to descend with the task force, starring at █​​█​█​█​█​█.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Why would you do that, let your organs be seen by people?</p>
<p>█​​█​█​█​█​█<strong>:</strong> I always wanted to be seen, understood.</p>
<p><em>Video continues in silence as the group descend SCP-8506, eventually being cut out by Π-1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recording following MTF-Π-29 reaching threshold υ</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Π-1:</strong> This is mobile task force Pi twenty-nine, we are arriving at threshold upsilon.</p>
<p><strong>Π-3:</strong> We’ve captured one reality bender, although they claim to have been normalised by this area, more research is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Π-2:</strong> The captured subject is stable, and has not given any of us reason to believe that they have become an instance of dash A.</p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Proceeding to threshold upsilon.</p>
<p><em>Task force proceeds downwards with █​​█​█​█​█​█ in tow, the red line that has been painted to mark threshold upsilon is visible, Π-4 steps over the red line.</em></p>
<p><strong>Π-4:</strong> Shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the discovery of the task force’s condition, the former members of GOI-789 were classified as SCP-8506-A-2 through 28, while MTF-Π-29 were classified as SCP-8506-A-29 through 32. The instance of SCP-8506-A accompanying them was discovered to have fled upon arrival of the regular check-up team, however has since been classified as SCP-8506-A-15.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8506-3 - Examination:</strong> Full body physical examination of items showed no evidence of notable physical abnormalities. Following such, a series of invasive tests were performed on each subject. While these tests appeared to enhance likely partially anomalous negative psychological effects of prolonged stay inside SCP-8506-1, a sample of loose cellular matter was eventually recovered during an examination of the inside of SCP-8506-A-31’s stomach.</p>
<p>Upon microscopy, various substructures of the cells were found to have been rearranged in manners incompatible with life. Damage heavily resembled results typical of long-term exposure to hostile reality bending, indicative of targeted attempts by a Hume emitting sentient entity.</p>
<p>Disassembly of the Kant counters used inside SCP-8506 to confirm team safety indicated that [DATA EXPUNGED], effectively compromising the use of Kant counters for environmental reading.</p>
<p>Given the amount and nature of the damage, supervising staff elected to discontinue any attempt to return SCP-8506-A-28-31 to baseline reality, however, despite being extra-universal entities, the items were offered positions as collaborative anomalies, citing their long-term foundation experience and potential research value.</p>
<p>However, in spite of previously cooperative behaviour, subjects rejected collaboration offers and chose to abandon their foundation roles. Due to the lack of foundation personnel and evident neutralisation of reality bending abilities within, it was decided that further reconnaissance or retrieval missions within SCP-8506-1 were not worth risk of further desertion.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8506-4 - Recovered Material:</strong> 33 days after the loss of team Π-29, guards monitoring SCP-8506's containment chamber discovered a USB flash drive had appeared on SCP-8506, bearing the markings of the drives carried by MTF-Π-29, along with the words ‘SEND HOMe (sic)’ crudely written onto the casing. Upon checking the contents of the drive, a video file was recovered, depicting SCP-8506-A-31 (Formerly known as MTF-Π-29-3) in a recording taken inside SCP-8506-1.</p>

<p><em>The camera is pointed downwards, where subject attempts to zoom in on an indiscernible shape, around 100 metres below subject’s position.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> They… wow… pulling another one apart huh.</p>
<p><em>A sound similar to a strong metal scraping against bone can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> There’s some very dangerous… people down there… Not anymore though. Dangerous, that is. They’re not very scary here… Not any-</p>
<p><em>Subject freezes and pulls up the camera, facing the sky, before rapidly sprinting up SCP-8506, eventually encountering and an instance of SCP-8506-A.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Control, we’ve got a quasi-human type green here, probable affiliation with Group seven eight nine, need permission to- need permission to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A:</strong> Put the camera down.</p>
<p><em>Subject raises camera to display the instance of SCP-8506-A, who is now recognisable as SCP-8506-A-15.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Control, please be advised, entities within dash one are hostile and uncooperative, further-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-15:</strong> They aren’t listening, they don’t care.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-8506-A instance appears to be approaching subject, however the footage becomes increasingly hard to discern on account of subject’s worsening grip on the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Group members appear to be employing bartering or treachery related-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-15:</strong> Listen, to them, you’re one of us now-</p>
<p><em>Subject lunges at the entity, the camera is dropped and hangs from a strap around the subject, sounds of the subject repeatedly assaulting the entity can be heard. The entity does not appear to react.</em></p>
<p><em>After 30 seconds of sustained assault, subject ceases attacking and begins to hyperventilate. The instance of SCP-8506-A pushes the subject off of itself and can be heard walking away.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Please… God…</p>
<p><em>Subject rises to its feet and turns the camera towards its face, attempting to speak before suddenly turning the camera to face the entity, which has begun to ascend SCP-8506.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Entity has fled. I will pursue following the completion of this recording.</p>
<p><em>Subject turns the camera to face itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> So as I’ve been trying to say, I have completed four weeks inside of SCP-8506-1. I do not know if the same amount of time has passed over on earth, but it’s been four weeks since entry and about five days since I began contact.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> I’ve seen around 10 of the other people trapped inside here. The reality benders have not shown any sign of latent or returning ability, although my Kant counter has been destroyed, so I don’t know if there’s anything going on involving humes in here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> But I think that there are more properties to this- this thing, this place. The most notable I’ve seen is the pains.</p>
<p><em>Subject pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> It’s happened to me… three times so far…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Its weird, because it only hurts for about half a second, then you pass out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> But when you wake up, it feels like you’ve been tortured.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> I’ve seen it happen to other people, too. Its creepy, turns out after you pass out, you don’t fall down. There’s usually a scream, you stagger, but then you just kind of… stand there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> It’s uncomfortable to watch, they just stand and twitch a bunch, and there’s this horrible…</p>
<p><em>There is a long pause before subject resumes speaking.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> I’m starting to think- well, let me rephrase, I’ve been thinking it the whole time, but… when I dream, I see you, but there’s something else in the room too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> It’s like, all the monsters here, all of the reality benders and anart freaks here, all of them come together somehow, they make something that goes against us.</p>
<p><em>Subject appears to be distracted and looks over the side of SCP-8506.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> Even here, I’m still one of you… I’m still a part of order, and the chaos and anarchy here… it can’t do anything to order… our order…</p>
<p><em>Subject smiles briefly before showing visible concern and beginning to ascend SCP-8506.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> They’re onto me. I need to… [Indecipherable mumbling]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-A-31:</strong> So, needless to say, I have been receiving the messages. I am greatly thankful to and hope to see this recording delivered to the amazing people over at the oneiric remote contact division.</p>

<p>There has been no attempts made by any foundation body to contact instances of SCP-8506-A through anomalous methods.</p>
<p>Following exploration of SCP-8506-1, it has been determined that the instances of SCP-8506-A formerly comprising GOI-789 no longer pose any reasonable threat to the foundation or normalcy at large, as such all efforts to retrieve instances of SCP-8506-A have been paused indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Incident report-8506-1:</strong><br/>
On 11/09/██, during a routine check-up, SCP-8506 underwent a sudden normalisation of Hume levels. Due to this previously undocumented aberration in behaviour, it was decided to send 2 field agents (agents Crowther and Lewis) into SCP-8506-1 in order to investigate potential sources of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in SCP-8506-1, the two agents performed a radar scan for aberrations in SCP-8506-1. Through this scan, an airborne object estimated to be about 3m*50cm*50cm was discovered to be rapidly approaching Threshold υ, later designated SCP-8506-B.</p>
<p>As SCP-8506-B approached, agent Crowther would later describe feeling a sudden increase in air pressure. Shortly after SCP-8506-B moved past threshold υ, the air within SCP-8506-1 suddenly rushed downwards, creating a sudden and strong pulling force. Agent Lewis was pulled off of SCP-8506 by the force, where he then collided with SCP-8506 repeatedly with substantial force, losing contact with foundation forces and becoming an instance of SCP-8506-A.</p>
<p>Agent Crowther fled SCP-8506-1 in response to the incident, suffering only minor injuries as a result. Later, agent Crowther returned to SCP-8506-1, where she encountered SCP-8506-B.</p>
<p>On Discovery, SCP-8506-B resembled POI-789-001, formerly Howard ██████████, a member of GOI-789, credited by documents found in GOI-789’s compound to be the creator of SCP-8506. SCP-8506-B’s body was suffering from extreme emaciation, apparently incompatible with non-anomalously assisted life. In addition, SCP-8506-B had also been encased in a crystalline substance, identical in density and appearance to the substance composing SCP-8506. SCP-8506 was noticeably taller than medical records for POI-789-001 indicated, measuring at 2.718 metres, 90cm taller than prior records.</p>
<p>The substance covering SCP-8506-B’s body was notably absent from the subject’s face and jaw, allowing for the entity to speak. Shortly after discovering this, Agent Crowther resolved to conduct an interview with the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Crowther<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-8506-B<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> State your name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> Howard ██████████, first former human being to have ever been completely understood.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> What do you mean by ‘Completely understood’?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> I’ve been experimented on, and now there’s nothing left to learn about me.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> Who has performed these experiments?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> My artwork, the one all around you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> You refer to this space?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> The space itself is nothing, just an empty, hollow reality. I implanted the art, and taught it how to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> How did you end up looking like this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> It’s not easy to read someone. It didn’t always know how to keep people together, so when it pulled me apart for the first time, it wasn’t quite so good at putting me back together again.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> You say it took you, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> When I lead all of them here, it needed guidance, it needed someone to teach it everything they know. Moments after I stepped in here, small army of other curious in tow, a gust of wind carried me across the sterile skies, took me behind the sun and made me give it all the time I had left in me.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> What exactly was done to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> It pried into me, drilled under my skin and flesh with its little shards, they let it feel the world, it felt my mind, felt my thoughts, I stopped seeing time moving and everything stopped moving for all of time, now an eternity later its put me back together, there’s nothing more to understand, I am used up; I am complete.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> Alright then, what can you tell me about your organization?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> The university? We just wanted to understand. All of had lost people, we were weak and lonely so we came together, and when we came together we felt like we could understand why these things had happen. We just wanted to know what the monsters were. All we ever wanted was to know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> Maybe we weren't artists, the other anomalous artist communes shunned us, they rejected our definitions of art, they didn't know anything, and they thought they liked that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> You people don’t know anything, you burn books and melt minds while scribbling and babbling, I knew you’d arrive, so I did your job for you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> All of them, they’re contained here. They’ll live forever, in perfect containment, the research conducts itself, your ultimate chamber, and I’m your best architect.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8506 suddenly trembles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Crowther:</strong> Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8506-B:</strong> Carry me out of here, it wants to let go of me. Any longer, and you’ll learn the joy of being understood yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following SCP-8506-B’s request, agent Crowther carried SCP-8506-B over threshold υ. Upon passing over threshold υ, both agent Crowther and SCP-8506-B successfully exited SCP-8506-1. Following entry into baseline reality, SCP-8506-B fell unconscious, following which the crystalline substance shattered and disintegrated into a fine powder footnote. The body of SCP-8506-B proceeded to rapidly undergo decay, as well as various forms of physical trauma (Primarily the slicing of tissue), reducing the subject to several fragments of bone and an organic slurry, later found to be non-anomalous in composition.</p>
<p>The substance that covered SCP-8506-B was collected, however further testing revealed the powder to be composed of a seemingly random mixture of various biological compounds, none of which’s physical properties are believed to align with the substance observed.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8506-5:</strong> Following 4 years and 54 days of no abnormal activity occurring from SCP-8506, the decision has been made to reclassify the object as safe.</p>
