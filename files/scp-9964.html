<p><strong>Security Clearance:</strong> Level 5/Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> In a joint effort with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Government of Brazil, the Department of Continuity has established a program of surveillance throughout all Brazilian broadcast services, in order to intercept any instances of SCP-9964. All intercepted broadcasts are to be infused with the Antimemetic Agent <em>God, Nation, and Family</em> to mitigate the aftereffects of a possible exposure.</p>
<p>In combination with this, the Brazilian Branch of the SCP Foundation is to investigate and confront anti-Veil organizations operating within the country to disrupt the chain of events following exposure to SCP-9964, with particular attention given to the activities of <em>Insurgência do Caos – Sol Vermelho</em>,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> which declared war on Normalcy in 1983.</p>
<p>Should an anti-Veil movement seize political power in Brazil, the country’s Armed Forces shall immediately operate under the direction of the Department of Continuity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9964 is the collective designation for anomalous television broadcasts of Brazilian clubs and National Team football matches from 1967 to 1982. These transmissions manifest spontaneously in national television signals after the conclusion of sports or cultural programming. 7,323 instances of SCP-9964 have been detected as of writing, becoming more prominent after each year.</p>
<p>Although SCP-9964 broadcasts closely resemble their non-anomalous counterparts and often lead to the same outcomes, notable deviations have been identified throughout time. Documented examples may diverge from one another and include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• The absence of a crowd;</p>
<p>• If present, the crowd consists of military leaders, landowners, and businessmen from the 1964–85 administration,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> or numerous faceless humanoid figures;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>• There are no referees, although fouls are still given automatically;</p>
<p>• A player may spontaneously distance themselves from the field and stare at the stands, whether or not a crowd is present, thus remaining absent for the rest of the match;</p>
<p>• A player may deliberately fail to score when presented with a clear opportunity;</p>
<p>• A player may deliberately begin to walk off the field aimlessly while the match is still ongoing;</p>
<p>• The transmission lacks sound.</p>
<p>Upon exposure, 91% of subjects reported severe distress regarding the conditions of Brazilian workers under the business-military regime and subsequently engaged in deeper study of Brazilian history from a far-left perspective. Of these, 80% would later join an organization aligned to that political spectrum.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the circumstances described above render SCP-9964 a high-risk political instrument for anti-Normalcy groups.</p>

<p><strong>00:03:</strong> After a draw in regular time, both teams gather to prepare for the penalty shootout. All players appear exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>01:45:</strong> The stands are shown. The only spectators are Ernesto Geisel,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and Sérgio Paranhos Fleury.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>02:27:</strong> A faceless spectator appears, casually descending from the stands. They walk across the field and head to the locker room. No one seems to notice.</p>

<p><strong>10:03:</strong> Toninho Cerezo scores. He does not celebrate. Footsteps echo loudly from the locker room. Only Alves seems to notice.</p>
<p><strong>10:51:</strong> Getúlio misses.</p>
<p><strong>11:42:</strong> Ziza does not take the shot. Instead, he celebrates as if he had scored and returns to his teammates, who applaud.</p>
<p><strong>13:08:</strong> A police officer is now seen outside of the locker room as the noises grow louder.</p>
<p><strong>28:21:</strong> Chicão takes the ball in his hands while another police officer appears outside the locker room. The sound of a non-existent crowd mumbling overtakes the broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>29:02:</strong> While Chicão scores, the referee rules the shot invalid and instructs him to retake it. This process is repeated until he ultimately misses. Despite this, Chicão celebrates.</p>
<p><strong>40:10:</strong> An entire row of police officers surrounds the entrance to the locker room. The spectators stand up.</p>
<p><strong>41:22:</strong> Alves approaches the goal area, positioning the ball while taking a deep breath. He seems to hesitate, then stops moving.</p>
<p><strong>42:47:</strong> The referee is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>43:08:</strong> Alves remains unmoving.</p>
<p><strong>51:30:</strong> The other players await anxiously, although the penalty is never taken.</p>

<p>Following the ending of the business-military cycle, rumors of SCP-9964 began to circulate among the civilian population. Foundation personnel would not succeed in observing the anomaly until December 5, 1999, when it was documented through two main courses of action:</p>
<p>• The capture and execution of two <em>Sol Vermelho</em> operatives, resulting in the confiscation of recorded tapes of the broadcasts</p>
<p>• Investigation via Brazil’s emerging internet to locate the anomaly on paranormal-focused forums such as Parawatch</p>
<p>Excerpts of the latter are provided below.</p>

<p><span style="color: green"><strong>matheus68</strong></span> 12/05/99 03:55:12</p>
<hr/>
<p>since we're sharing our experiences, i'd like to go into detail about something that happened to me last week.</p>
<p>final is approaching, and i wanted to watch some of the past corinthians games to get in the mood for it.</p>
<p>so while searching on my tv, i noticed sportv was transmitting the semifinals against são paulo again. no better way to enjoy myself than rewatching the games where we beat one of our rivals, right?</p>
<p>not really.</p>
<p>i fell asleep at the end of the second match, and there was something weird going on with the tv when i woke up. keep in mind it was 2 am at the time and i was in complete darkness.</p>
<p>it seemed like a 70s grenal<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> match but <em>everything</em> was out of place.</p>
<p>there was no crowd. no sound but a slight static. the players had no eyes and the coaches wouldn't stop clapping (i think i could hear it sometimes but i'm not sure). but you know what freaked me out the most?</p>
<p>the cops. i <em>despise</em> the cops.</p>
<p>where the goalkeepers should've been, there they were: marching the whole time, but without actually moving. every time a player got close to the goal, they'd just back off.</p>
<p>that’s it. that was the entire game. when i switched to another channel then back to sportv, it was gone. it had never existed at all.</p>
<p>those fuckers ruined my life, so i couldn't get back to sleep. my father had connections to the resistance,. i was 5 when they got him at home.</p>
<p>i never saw him again after he entered that car, but he was smiling. i don't think he could convince himself it would be alright, but he tried to convince me.</p>
<p>my mother tried everything she could to get him back, but the same thing happened. except they let me see her again. broken, incapable of speaking, but my mother nonetheless.</p>
<p>she could barely walk at the time. once i got older and realized why that was, i felt sick to my stomach. she was certainly not the only one, and i never got to look at my brother the same way.</p>
<p>sometimes i question myself if there was an actual dictatorship, because it all feels too "normal" now. and they shouldn't. fuck no, things aren't normal in the slightest. they never were.</p>
<p>i've been voting for brizola<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> for president since 89, but i doubt someone like him could ever get there. if he did, we'd probably just relive the past.</p>

<p>I had a similar experience 4 months ago, though I wouldn't say it was as bad as yours.</p>
<p>In my case, it was the 1982 São Paulo Championship final, Corinthians against São Paulo. Looking back, it feels pretty ironic. Corinthians was “the team of democracy” then, openly opposing the regime and everything.</p>
<p>In the middle of the field was their star player, Sócrates. He had the ball, but policemen surrounded him so tightly he couldn’t move. The others were moving just like in the original match, but since they didn’t have the ball, the score never changed.</p>
<p>By the end of the second half, everyone had stopped but the crowd of army officers weeping quietly. I’d kept watching out of curiosity, but that felt <em>too</em> wrong, I guess, so I got up and turned off the TV.</p>
<p>I vividly remember the players looking at me through the screen just before it went dark.</p>
<p>Overall, football’s felt… gloomier since then. Going to <em>Maraca</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> ain’t the same.</p>

<p>I’m happy for her <span style="color: green"><strong>@viva_SP@</strong></span>, but what the dictatorship did to everyone is what has been done to Black people since the first slave ship arrived here.</p>
<p>I agree we can’t forget it. I agree we can’t let it happen again. But why did it happen in the first place? Why didn’t "redemocratization" stop the violence in our communities?</p>
<p>Just look at Vigário Geral. A death squad of hooded policemen stormed the favela and executed 21 people. The killers are still out there. They'll do it again. And this is just <em>one</em> case.</p>

<p>My turn to get personal.</p>
<p>I agree with <span style="color: green"><strong>@Carlão_jazz</strong></span> here. The dictatorship was the <em>culmination</em> of the tragedy called Brazil, but that's because they were open about who was going to die the next day.</p>
<p>You see, my mom spent most of her life as a rural laborer. Her closest friend was killed when the police and local farmers attacked a group of fellow landless workers.</p>
<p>That was six months ago. All they did was occupying unproductive land, and those bastards even got a child, for Christ's sake.</p>
<p>Since then, mom's thrown herself into countless organizations fighting for land rights. Even though her life could be taken at any moment, she’s never felt more alive. She's now daily training <em>capoeira</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> for self-defense.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any other option to us at this point. Existence is resistance, even when you don't want it to be.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.02:</strong> Timeline of Events</p>
<p>The following timeline details key events in which the Department of Continuity intervened directly in Brazil’s political sphere to safeguard the Veil and advance the Foundation’s strategic interests.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px; overflow: auto;">

<p>President Getúlio Vargas and Mobile Task Force "Brazil Happy Again" after the Foundation arrived in the country for the first time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish the first Foundation bases on Brazilian territory under the leadership of the Department of Continuity. Ensure that the industrialization policies of President Getúlio Vargas’ government remain dependent on the United States. Investigate and study Brazil’s paranormal phenomena to gain a deeper understanding of thaumaturgy.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Success.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>February 13, 1945</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Fund opposition to President Getúlio Vargas as he signals greater independence. Establish the first Brazilian operational facility for D-Class personnel in response to the growth of the local Chaos Insurgency and similar movements.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Success.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>March 4, 1947</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Support President Eurico Gaspar Dutra in enforcing the re-illegalization of the Brazilian Communist Party. Conduct amnestical studies on unregistered subjects in the rural areas of Brazil. Initiate the integration of favelas into the D-Class network.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Success.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>September 2, 1961</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Prevent João Goulart from assuming the presidency. Transfer federal control to the Armed Forces. Immediately eliminate the local Chaos Insurgency.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Failure. Leonel Brizola allied with local police forces and leveraged his political power as a governor to organize widespread opposition against the Foundation’s interests. He also threatened the Department of Continuity through the use of thaumaturgical capabilities. The Chaos Insurgency is believed to have been responsible for Brizola acquiring thaumaturgical knowledge in the first place.</p>

Establish the <a href="https://scp-int.wikidot.com/grupos-de-interesse">Brazilian Superintendence for the Paranormal</a>. Immediately eliminate all local anti-Veil organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Undetermined. Although the junta has seized power, threats to Normalcy have persisted, and anti-Foundation elements successfully expelled MTF "Brazil Happy Again" from the favela complex, ultimately ending the integration project.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> Good evening, Mr. President. I have to say this wonderful place has not changed in the slightest.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Good evening, sir. It's a pleasure to have people like you here. I hope you enjoy the view as it is now, it took hours to clear the <em>petistas</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup> from the streets.</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><em>Ashmoon chuckles. Bolsonaro looks around before following Ashmoon to a meeting room.</em></p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> First of all, how are you feeling? Tonight is a historic occasion. Sixteen years of opposition — and now they are the ones opposing you.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> I'm relieved. From now on, I can't picture my beloved country as anything other than what God intended it to be: a free land, in the same fashion as the United States, far from school indoctrination and harmful ideologies. I'd say we've never been this close to greatness since 1964.</p>
<p><em>Ashmoon coughs, then takes a sip of water from his glass while keeping his eyes on Bolsonaro.</em></p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> Those were the times, were they not? Now you get to shape an equally decisive turning point for this country. Your vision of a superior nation is the attitude we expect from those who will work with the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Yes, your Foundation. I suppose I could finally know who exactly you are?</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> Of course, Mr. President. But I would like to hear from you first. I believe you have known of the Foundation for a while now?</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> I became aware of it back at military academy. From what I got, you had strong ties to the government at the time, got rid of the problems, and had this thing of containing “dangerous magic” to keep humanity safe, since we can't understand it.</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> You have been misinformed, Mr. President. But for you to assume such a thing is ultimately our fault.</p>
<p><em>Bolsonaro remains silent for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> I see. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> There is no need for apologies. It is important that a few groups hold that image of us, after all.</p>
<p><em>Bolsonaro scratches his eyebrows.</em></p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Sorry, sir, but you’re confusing me a bit here. Didn't you promise to help me protect Brazil and drive away the Devil's power?</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> We are a force of <em>order</em>, Mr. President. We make sure that whatever people aren't meant to see stays in the dark with us.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> That's good to hear in a sense. But what about that "magic" part?</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> It is a fact that we are aware of what you label “supernatural”. But to say we do not comprehend it is untrue.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> You can use magic then.</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> Everything in this world is meant to be broken down into base elements and made ordinary. That is not a problem for us.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> But if you understand it, why would you bother? That seems a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> I ask you to think abroad, Mr. President. That will be crucial for the following years of our Brazilian democracy. What if people similar to the <em>petistas</em> follow this path of discovery, or feel motivated by this "magic"?</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Is that happening in Brazil right now? Is Lula<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> involved?</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> He is not. We believe this case is far more concerning than Lula's, Mr. President.</p>
<p><em>Ashmoon begins tapping his fingers against the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> A <em>certain group</em> of… people, have been using this power inadvertently to spread the idea that Brazil could be something it is not.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Since when?</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> 1976, when the political openness began under General Ernesto Geisel.</p>
<p><em>Ashmoon stops.</em></p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> This is why your presence matters, Mr. President. You embody the memory of times of Normalcy, fundamental for peace.</p>

<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> Yes, you, Frederick. You don't see me as the worthy ally I am.</p>
<p><strong>ASHMOON:</strong> You could have waited for our evaluation, as discussed. Then retreated briefly in order to reconstruct your political career and possibly win the next elections. You should not have relied on your supporters to keep you in a position you had already lost.</p>
<p><strong>BOLSONARO:</strong> I would never sit idly by and watch while my people cry out for help. Don't judge me when there is a real chance for communism — for SCP-9964 — to take over my nation and lead our children down a path of depravity!</p>

<p>Following this conversation, at 11:23 PM, Frederick Ashmoon proceeded to the Brasília International Airport. While awaiting departure, he was ambushed by a unit of the <em>Sol Vermelho</em> faction acting under the orders of Commander Clarissa Falcão. Communication was lost shortly thereafter.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>January 18, 2023</strong></p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Eliminate the <em>Sol Vermelho</em> faction and SCP-9964 by all means necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Pending.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum.03:</strong> The Chaos Insurgency in Brazil</p>
<p>The first Chaos Insurgency units in Brazil were founded in 1939 through an alliance of anarchists, nationalists and communists connected to esoteric practices, in opposition to the persecution by President Getúlio Vargas’s dictatorial government, as well as in response to the arrival of the first Foundation cells.</p>
<p>In the early years of the business-military junta cycle, the organization gained its contemporary notoriety by directing an insurgent process that seized three Foundation operational bases located in Northern Brazil, freeing dissidents who had been detained by the government.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Mirella Cruz and Hugo Lisboa, it is believed that 3,100 personnel were mobilized for armed combat against Foundation officers. In 1976, following the split that gave rise to <em>Sol Vermelho</em>, two of these bases were retained, and 91% of the former D-Class personnel decided to join the faction. The technological innovations currently employed by <em>Sol Vermelho</em> are likely the result of all the material and research stolen during this conflict, including paratechnology likely used to facilitate the manifestation of SCP-9964.</p>

</div>
<p>Following their declaration of war, <em>Sol Vermelho</em> would advance to seize 17 additional Foundation bases and intervene in all attempts to investigate local supernatural phenomena. Recent studies indicate that the total number of organized members is 19,500.</p>
<p>The <em>Sol Vermelho</em>'s main propaganda vehicles are the newspaper <em>The People's Front</em> and clandestine radio channels concealed by paranormal codification. One example of each is available below.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE PEOPLE'S FRONT</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> November 26, 2023</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The interview below has been recovered from an international issue of <em>The People's Front</em> newspaper. It was conducted by Communist militant Luzia Tchissola, from the Red Faction of Angola's Chaos Insurgency. The interviewed is Commander Mirella Cruz, who had employed advanced thaumaturgy to halt aging, similar to her companions.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> What are the main differences between the <em>Sol Vermelho</em> and other Chaos Insurgency groups when it comes to opposition to the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Our organization stems from a fundamental divergence regarding the existence of the Foundation itself. To us, the destruction of the Foundation should equate to the destruction of United States' imperialism in its entirety, as the greatest enemy of the Brazilian people for decades now.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Could you explain how that came to be?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Once the first alliances were forged in 1939, the consensus was that the Foundation itself embodied the main contradiction we faced. However, when it thoroughly aided the military in their rise to power — with the backing of our landowners, bankers and industrialists — it became clear that we couldn't oppose their rule while treating them as a separate force from the system.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> And how was the <em>Sol Vermelho</em> faction born in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Following our heroic victories against the reactionaries, a right-wing opposition within our organization argued that we should retreat so as not to “advance recklessly.” Although every subsequent encounter with the Foundation proved successful, the Red Massacre would be invoked as a pretext to undermine our achievements. When a vote was ultimately held to decide whether our current tactics should be abandoned or not, the split materialized. We don't regret it in the slightest.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> When the Chaos Insurgency is now described as an “instrument to liberate the people,” does this necessarily imply a violent movement?</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-left" style="width:55%;"><img alt="ci" class="image" src="https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/comunista-lesbica-local/ci"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The three main symbols incorporated by the <em>Sol Vermelho</em> faction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> We do make history, but not of our own choosing. We make history according to the conditions imposed by the world around us. Make no mistake: we desire the end of all wars. Yet how does one fight an army without an army of their own? Any accusation that the people are violent is itself a confession. Simply put, you cannot vote the O5 Council out.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> But when the Chaos Insurgency assists the people in their liberation, is this carried out from an aristocratic perspective?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Never. Transformation simply demands that those who are prepared in advance equally prepare those who aren't. We want to help. Think of the Chaos Insurgency as a seed, while the people constitute the fertile soil that will allow this new world to flourish.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Do you think this revolutionary movement will be successful?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> What I think doesn't matter. What matters is that those who fight alongside me continue the struggle, even if the enemies' bullets make me physically disappear. You see, the masses can never be destroyed in their entirety. And no tsunami will be turned back once the earthquake has struck.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> If the Brazilian revolutionary movement succeeds, what becomes of the Chaos Insurgency? What can guarantee its victory will last?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> History has shown us that movements like ours do not succeed merely by seizing political power. The transformation must be <em>cultural</em>, too. The fundamental mission of our vanguard, once the tools to reshape society are placed in the hands of the masses — the only ones capable of wielding them — is to demonstrate a new way of thinking it.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Could that mean a free Brazil would try to force its neighbors to follow the same path because of cultural tensions?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> I'm sorry, but that's laughable.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Could you elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Of course we want our neighbors to go the same route, but that's not up to us. Brazil <em>will</em> assist the masses against the many imperialist threats — the United States, China, Russia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and so on — but only when a proper mass movement exists to begin with. If the people don't call for a revolution now, if there's no vanguard to guide them, what's the point? We're not adventurers.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> What if power is retaken by the old world? Is there any hope for the revolution?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> The ideological transformation is intended to prepare the masses for counterattack. Every oppressed individual is a revolutionary, and every revolutionary must know how to wield their weapon.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> What are your weapons, Ms. Cruz?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> We’ve been training our warriors in thaumaturgy for decades, and we’ve also learned to harness the power of the memories imposed on us by the reactionaries. That, without a doubt, is our greatest achievement so far.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> How come?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> The rage carried from generation to generation has now taken a life of its own — and it will haunt them. <em>Forever</em>. This is what they’ve named <em>SCP-9964</em>.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Considering everything you've just said, what will happen if the masses are rendered powerless following the revolution?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> The new society will be crushed. Simple as that. Terror will rise again, masquerading as a mass movement while crushing the people under its boot. And still, I know hope won’t be lost, because it will find a way to be reborn.</p>
<p><strong>TCHISSOLA:</strong> Before we conclude, I'd like to thank you for your time, Ms. Cruz. You're a very kind woman. Do you have any final thoughts you would like to share with our readers?</p>
<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> The pleasure is all mine! Modern times are reminding the people that change is inevitable. We believe the red sun will shine, again and again, as many times as necessary, across the globe. Either we're all free, or no one is.</p>
