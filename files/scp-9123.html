<p>In the event that SCP-9123 activity is discovered, agents from MTF Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”) are to be mobilized to minimize damage, with appropriate cover stories disseminated in the case of death or serious social disruption. All methods of non-lethal intervention are authorized, short of targeting SCP-9123 itself. Included in these methods is the revealing of Foundation action to SCP-9123 only for the purposes of intimidation, as it possesses knowledge of the Foundation’s existence and various classified databases due to the nature of its employer.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9123 refers to a humanoid entity previously described by the Foundation as PoI-99123, a.k.a “Dorian Cillian Sloan”. Its primary anomalous ability is producing verbal commands capable of compelling sapient subjects to perform actions against their own wills. The precise mechanisms of this effect are unknown, except that it exhibits an unusually potent strength against individuals with high CRVs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Because of this, it is theorized that the determinant of SCP-9123’s compulsive strength instead relies on an inverse function of the listener’s long-term EVE<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> exposure; this property is the best explanation as to how its employers continue to remain unaffected by it and exert power over its decision-making, as individuals directly associated with GoI-012 typically handle dozens of EVE-producing constructs on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-9123 first came to the attention of the Foundation on 02/01/2020, when the Telecommunications Monitoring Office flagged SCP-9123 using its anomaly to sell stock options to clients while employed by Mack Advisors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> Two days later, a small Pursuit and Suppression force was sent to intercept and apprehend SCP-9123. This effort failed due to the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-wolf-at-the-door" target="_blank" target="_blank">intervention</a> of GoI-012.</p>
<p>Since then, SCP-9123 has been integrated into GoI-012's arsenal of resources. SCP-9123 has been recorded most often acting in a social role, attending events where its anomalous persuasion and natural charisma will be an asset, usually as an in-house auctioneer.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p>However, this is not believed to be the primary reason for GoI-012's interest in SCP-9123, as the Foundation has discovered several instances of SCP-9123 being utilized for the purpose of coercion and assassination. See below.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.9123.02: The Future of SCP-9123 Containment</strong> — The Argus classification exists where the Foundation expects abnormal phenomena to be suppressed by active third-parties. These anomalies are usually not contained by the Foundation directly due to the potential for retaliation, political backlash, breach of normalcy, etc., where these losses are considered unacceptable to the goal of societal stability.</p>
<p>While SCP-9123 never threatened the Veil, it became clear over its nascence that it was willing to cause substantial amounts of suffering under GoI-012. Due to this, discussions emerged of how to dissuade its most prominent behaviors, alongside the development of better corporate espionage tactics to more accurately intercept it. An excerpt of the most relevant discussion has been provided below.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Regarding SCP-9123</p>
</div>
<p>Overseer One,</p>
<p>As you can see from the attached file, SCP-9123 represents a unique link in the chain of Marshall, Carter, and Dark’s activities. Rather than serving a standard financial or structural purpose like the rest of their employees (who possess titles like accountant, acquisitions manager, thaumic technician, etc.), SCP-9123's official title is peripheral to its actual function. Given how elusive mind-control is both within magic and modern technology, it’s the key to a door MC&amp;D probably thought locked to them forever, and one we all wish had remained bolted shut.</p>
<p>I understand that the conversations about the anomaly have been, in your words, per your last meeting with the other Overseers, “circular.” It must be immensely frustrating to deal with an undecided council, even if you are the tiebreaker. I especially understand that O5-07 has been an unusually loud voice during these discussions? How strange it is to see her take such an isolationist stance.</p>
<p>Consider this then an alternative suggestion to break through their concerns. My suggestion is simple: We hold SCP-9123 for ransom. This would be temporary enough to satisfy your reasonable trepidation of MC&amp;D, and provide us with enough benefit to be worth the effort.</p>
<p>How much? $35 billion exactly.</p>
<p>My analysts predict this money would be enough to fund Mu-3’s operations for at least fifteen years, including our intent to expand. We would be willing to share this pot with other departments, especially with those who need it most, like Tactical Theology and Parazoology.</p>
<p>Ever since MC&amp;D’s CEO<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup> had her heir, their capitalistic march has been relentless. This is not even mentioning the fact there is a fresh Marshall and Carter within the company actively scouting talent just like SCP-9123 for employment. Their efforts have tripled over the last six months alone.</p>
<p>Will it be enough? What will MC&amp;D do to us as a result? How will we find the kid? You must have so many questions. I implore you to schedule a meeting with me this week so we can discuss this matter further; my MTF is ready for anything.</p>
<p>Rest assured that this proposal takes into account our position against MC&amp;D. It is about high time we show them that we are more than a temporary stopgap for their “products” or their clean-up crew in times of world-ending disasters. Someone needs to show these selfish, money-laundering pigs what true morality looks like, what the rest of us actually live like beneath their thumb and shoes. Someone needs to show their dogs what it means to bark up the wrong tree, especially those of them with special little voices.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> 10/19/2023</p>

<p>You will find collected in this file all the pertinent reports from Mu-3's mission to capture SCP-9123. Finding an opening proved to be difficult, even with the extent of our covert data collection and my team's dedication to learning and anticipating SCP-9123's schedule. Our patience and diligence paid off when we learned SCP-9123 would be attending <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6616" target="_blank">AnomalyCon</a>—an annual convention classified as SCP-6616, which gathers individuals and groups involved with the anomalous—on October 19th.</p>
<p>Although SCP-9123 arrived with a delegation of five other GoI-012 employees, the open nature of the conference gave us the window of opportunity we needed. We trailed SCP-9123 until it wandered far enough away from its group for one of my men to put a needle in its neck. We took thaumaturgic measures to block it from leylining<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> and immediately moved to evacuate the premises with it in our custody.</p>
<p>Luckily, we did not face resistance. SCP-9123 had wandered too far away from its more dangerous colleagues for them to notice what happened initially; we were only spotted as we loaded it up into the truck and sped off into civilian traffic.</p>
<p>The rest of the operation went smoothly. SCP-9123 was kept unconscious for the duration of its transit to Site-90 and placed in a standard humanoid containment cell. As soon as it wakes up, I will personally see to its interrogation—ransom is our primary goal, so I understand this is not necessary, but we cannot and will not neglect the opportunity to mine invaluable insider information regarding GoI-012 and their operations.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.9123.03 — Transcripts</strong></p>
<p>Following SCP-9123's apprehension, the Foundation took possession of SCP-9123's cellphone. However, due to the presence of extensive authentication measures and thaumaturgical encryption, there was no way to access the device in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, SCP-9123 received a number of text messages over its five hour transportation to Site-90, which were able to be previewed and recorded.</p>

<h3 id="toc2"><span>Interview 9123.01</span></h3>
</div>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/19/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Begin log. Dunn enters a featureless gray room and takes a seat across from SCP-9123, whose hands are cuffed on the steel table in front of it. SCP-9123 sits up straight and smiles cordially.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Can you let me out of here, please?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn does not respond. He places down a full manila folder in front of SCP-9123.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Don’t try your nonsense here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’d ask for a lawyer, but you guys don’t really do that, do you? Shame. I shoulda been afforded fancy representation for putting up with you bastards. Best sleep I’ve gotten from that car ride in weeks, I’ll give you all that much.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> …So you do know about our operations. I take it your employers have been liberal with dispensing that information?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for four seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I plead the Fifth.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> That doesn’t apply here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I want your cooperation. The more you answer, the more lenient we’ll be with your accommodations here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> But you can’t keep me forever.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> We can, and we will.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Ha! I would <em>love</em> to see you fuckers try!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Full of spunk today, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What can I say? I know I’m getting out of here soon—you pick a boy up off-duty and don’t expect the big leagues to not notice? To not wanna lob rockets at you for it?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Tell me about your role at the company. We have a copy of your written job offer here.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn holds up a piece of paper to SCP-9123.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> It’s not very descriptive. Lots of legalese, but little on what is expected from you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Did you even read what you sold your soul for?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’m not answering that.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Unbelievable. He doesn’t—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn grumbles and sighs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> SCP-9123, do you understand that you’re being contained under my authority? That a refusal to answer my questions will result in docked privileges, such as access to requested amenities, foodstuffs, etc?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Why the hell do you sound like you’re reading me my rights?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You don’t need to know that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> It’s protocol, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> …Suppose it is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> And protocol means I’m going to be put into an orange suit and thrown into some—some site? D-Don’t you guys have a site where you keep people like me?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You consider yourself a person, still?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Of course I do! God … Oh, you’re so gonna abuse the fuck out of me.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> We won’t. We treat our anomalies fairly here at the Foundation. I especially make sure the ones under my watch receive the highest standards of care possible.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Bullshit if I’ve ever heard it!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Really? You think so?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I-I do! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You’ll be provided with the highest quality beds here. Food too. Maybe not the magic types you’ve come to expect from your new standard of living, but I will do my best for you. I promise.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for seven seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> SCP-9123?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> When do you stop calling me that?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> What do you think? You know Site-17?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—Site-17…?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Sure. Where we keep most of the humanoid anomalies. You’ll stay with us, of course, but I had to ask.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn places a carton of cigarettes on the table. SCP-9123 tries to reach for one, but Dunn firmly moves his hand away. SCP-9123 looks indignant in response.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …It’s a big place.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Correct. Is it our biggest facility?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn pulls out a lighter. SCP-9123’s pupils dilate.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> These are your favorites. Marlboro brand. You smoke a lot, don’t you? You didn’t before your employment.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for six seconds. SCP-9123 bites the inside of its cheek and drums its hands on the table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Some of the boys are impressed by how much you can put down. You buy a pack every other day—you’re lucky your employers have ways of circumventing the deterioration of your throat.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123’s face pales. It tugs on its restraints.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Tell me more about what you know about Site-17, and I’ll give you one.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Your cooperation hinges on—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I don’t care what it hinges on. I’m not a rat. I won’t sell out the people who care about me, cunt.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn responds to this by pulling out a lighter and a cigarette from the pack and smoking in front of SCP-9123, who visibly tenses at this and turns his head away.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for five seconds. Dunn asks a plethora of more questions, but SCP-9123 responds to all of them with silence. These questions have been removed from this transcript as they contain information about anomalies above this document’s clearance level.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End log.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>After two more interviews, it was concluded that SCP-9123 knew about Foundation documents with an average clearance level of 2, restricted but not of the highest priority. This was significantly lower than 4, the hypothesized average clearance level knowledge of the standard GoI-012 employee. Because of its lack of cooperation, SCP-9123 was denied smoking and outside privileges.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-18" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-18')">18</a></sup></p>
<p>On the third day of SCP-9123’s containment, a fourth interview was performed. SCP-9123 was muzzled and stripped of its civilian clothing at the request of Maj. Dunn, which it had been allowed to wear and wash up until that point. It was required to don standard D-Class attire instead, consisting of an orange jumpsuit and black boots.</p>
<p>This interview was not performed for the purposes of information extraction, but rather to test the limits of SCP-9123’s psychological profile, given the work GoI-012 has asked it to perform. Maj. Dunn considered this pertinent information for planned double-agent programs in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="toc3"><span>Interview 9123.02</span></h3>
</div>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/22/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Begin log. Dunn walks into SCP-9123’s cell, which is minimally furnished, holding a small takeout box. SCP-9123 is sitting on its bed, and turns away from him.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Relax. I’m not here to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> You put me in a muzzle. And the most humiliating clothes ever. You said you were in charge of me. That you would take care of me.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I did say those things. But some requests come from people higher than me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I don’t know. The muzzle is rather ineffective, isn’t it? It still allows you to talk, so I personally don’t see much point in it myself.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn pulls out a metal tray from the corner of SCP-9123’s room. Unwrapping the takeout box, he puts a small lidded bowl onto it and pushes the whole thing towards SCP-9123. He then sits down.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I don’t hate the food here as much as you must think. I’m not a whiner. I’ve had worse in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I know. I’m impressed by your acuity and instincts, honestly. Here, an olive branch from me.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn points to the bowl. SCP-9123 picks it up and takes the top off. When it does, it stiffens, steam fogging over the plastic of his muzzle.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/memory-7469-30" target="_blank">Lobster bisque?</a></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> From the restaurant Dorsia. You worked there when you were younger, right? Oh, here—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn clicks something in his pocket, and the muzzle pops off. SCP-9123 pauses. It looks around, as if for utensils or something else to eat with, before taking a sip from the bowl. Instantly, it relaxes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …I did. I worked there, uh, since I was fourteen. Would have started sooner, but that wasn’t allowed…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for eight seconds. SCP-9123 takes a drink from its bowl.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> You won’t hurt anyone from what I say?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Not at all. I worked from a young age myself. It’s rough, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …It is. I was the second oldest of five, and mom worked horrible hours at a shitty pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You love your mother?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> She’s put up with so much…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Does she know about what you can do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Truthfully, I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not, maybe she thought I was just some lucky kid with more charm than he knew what to do with… Maybe she thought it was a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Ah, you Irish Catholics and your miracles.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 sips from its bowl again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …We needed one. She didn’t deserve the life she got—nobody deserves a bad husband who saddles you with debt before killing himself, making you take on more just to keep a roof over your kids’ heads…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> It seems like she’s proud of the ones she raised.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> And how would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You speak so highly of her. I know many people with more whose parents didn’t give them half the love your mom did.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 goes silent. It puts an empty bowl down on the floor and frowns.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’m done here.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Just a few more questions. If you answer honestly, I’ll get some more for you tomorrow and have your muzzle taken off permanently.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I thought you said you weren’t the one who—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Give my superiors what they want, and they’ll relent. We have an Ethics Committee for a reason, as I’m sure you know. They’ve been watching this case like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Okay. What do you want to know? No company secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> How many of those do you know?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for six seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Do you even know any? Your background doesn’t indicate you have any higher education. Besides, looking at your role, I doubt they find it practical to tell you any more than what you need to know.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 squirms a little bit.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Ask me something else.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Okay. How did you feel killing Tristian Mvondo?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn produces a manila folder from his coat and opens it up. In it, there are a plethora of pictures of a one Tristian Mvondo, previous SCP-9123 victim.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Tristian Mvondo, personal driver of Rep. June Thorton. You told him to “floor it” because your bosses had allies in the anomalous energy sector which would have been hurt by the hardline regulations she was voting for. How did you feel telling him to kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …He didn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Not yet. He killed himself two months after the accident. In front of his husband when the medical debt he incurred was too much for him, might I add.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> He didn’t have insurance?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> It wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for ten seconds. SCP-9123 fiddles with its hands.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’m not to blame for the American healthcare system—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> But you benefit a lot from circumventing it, don’t you? Besides, your boss Iris Darke makes a lot of money from pharmaceutical companies here in the States—from the pain of people like Mvondo.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What’s that got to do with me?! Is this supposed to make me regret choosing a job with good coverage?!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> These are the kind of people you work for, SCP-9123. Are you starting to get the big picture now?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for fifteen seconds as Dunn takes out another folder and shows SCP-9123 more pictures.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …The ends justify the means.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Is that what you really think, SCP-9123?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’m going back to being silent again.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You want that muzzle to stay on?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I don’t care anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You don’t care if your bosses want you to kill innocent children?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What the fuck are you on about now?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn points to one of the pictures on the floor. SCP-9123 scans them tepidly, shaking with a grit frown on its face.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/best-rest-villa-myk7x-br05f-v9902" target="_blank">Esme Feldman.</a> She had three kids named Tiffany, Lucy, and Riley. When they slept in an anomalous house you compelled her to buy from an auction, they became unable to sleep and died painfully three days later, spasming in Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You did that, SCP-9123. Nobody else.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—That was an accident. I—I didn’t know she was bringing the kids.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Do you think that really matters? Anything to salve a bleeding heart, I guess. Your bosses had no qualms about this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Not my fault!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You work for them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I don’t care! I’m just someone they tell what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Just following orders, eh? That got far at the Nuremberg trials.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Oh, <em>fuck</em> you!</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 pulls its legs onto the bed and holds them.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I was doing it for my family…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Yes, I can imagine. They’re more important to you than the lives of other breathing souls?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Of course they are. You expect me to care about random nobodies who never gave a damn about us?!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Whatever your reasons, you've disregarded the social contract we all abide by. Typically, if someone breaks that, they go to jail after a jury trial.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> This isn’t a jury trial—you’re holding me in a cell with a muzzle on!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> How else is fate going to righteously punish you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Who do you think you are talking to me like that—God?!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> We have God contained at Site-19; it’s not him who is watching over this conversation right now.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 tears up. Dunn pulls out more manila folders and opens them.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I have more examples here. I want you to tell me about how you felt making millions off the pain of other people for your bosses who couldn’t give less of a damn about the ants of this world.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> No!</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 covers its head.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Do it. Now. Are any of these people familiar to you?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Five seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Esther Hammond. You told her to kill herself by walking into a live power line. Did you know she drove with a baby boy in her car who starved to death four days later when they found her body?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 does not respond.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Or what about Pedro Rodriguez? Walked into a wood chipper for Iris’s amusement while his wife watched. Do you like enabling your boss’s bloody sadism? Her cannibalism? She ate both afterwards.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 does not respond.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> This isn’t mentioning that group of students at Harvard you convinced to become sacrifices for demons because Robert hated the headmaster. Did you have fun being a serial killer for a day, SCP-9123?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 does not respond.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> What am I saying? You already are.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 begins crying. Dunn stands up.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> …You know you can stop this cycle, right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for seven seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You don’t have to be paid to kill people, Dorian. You can change, you can switch sides, you can still get out.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for three seconds. Dunn walks over to the bed and sits on it next to SCP-9123, who is shaking and sobbing quietly, muttering a haphazard prayer. SCP-9123 flinches away.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> …Do you want to work for us?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 stops moving.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I know you…haven’t been given the best impression of the Foundation from your time here, but rest assured that you would become one of us if you decide to work for the good guys.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for four seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You’d be working for people who want to make the world a better place, as opposed to people who want nothing but more power and money that they know what to do with. Do your bosses even believe in anything?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for three seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Do they even care about you as much as we could? As your mother and sisters do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …I’d rather be a bad son who pays the bills than a good one who can’t pay anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> But you can have <em>both,</em> Dorian. We’ll take care of them just like your current employers do—especially in the wake of an offer like this. We’ll make sure they aren’t retaliated against.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for five seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You live in the dark so they can flourish in the light. Protecting them from a world of monsters like the ones your employers sell so wantonly— That’s my offer. Think about it. I know it’s one which would make your mother proud.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 uncovers its head and looks to Dunn as he picks up everything up off the floor and leaves.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End log.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Maj. Dunn’s request to SCP-9123 was initially considered inappropriate, as Mu-3 had not yet put in a formal notice to utilize it in field settings. He was privately reprimanded for his hasty behavior, but ultimately was not docked of any important privileges. Despite this, the O5 Council formally fast-tracked the request, preparing for the possibility of SCP-9123 changing alliances. Though the potential for extended containment was initially considered too dangerous, the Council deliberated among themselves that SCP-9123 could be used against GoI-012 to safeguard the Foundation from retaliation, thus making it worth the risk.</p>
<p>After twenty-four hours of deciding, SCP-9123 refused the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.9123.04 — Escalation</strong></p>
<p>Forty minutes after SCP-9123 made its decision, an unknown caller rang Maj. Dunn’s private office line. Maj. Dunn did not pick up until tracing protocols were engaged, although this did not help in triangulating the call to any particular person or location.</p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 10/23/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Begin call.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><em>&lt;The unknown caller coughs. A snake is heard hissing in the background. Both are difficult to hear over the voice modifier being used.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> Hello Major Dunn. Lovely rain you’re getting at Site-90, hm?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> Who I am isn’t important to you. I’m far too pertinent for someone like you to know about.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> If you’re with Marshall, Carter, and Dark, we have extensive profiles on all of your employees.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> Of course you think that. Adorable. Release the boy or there will be more where that accountant came from.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Excuse me? What accountant?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> I won’t repeat myself. You seem to have underestimated how valuable Dorian is to our operations; I don’t fault you. None of you lot are particularly sales-minded.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Pay the ransom and we’ll drop him off at an agreed location.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> And embarrass ourselves in front of dozens of clients? Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> You little—</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Caller:</strong> You have three hours to release him into Central Park or else you will find yourself without some crucial tools <em>very</em> soon.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Phone call ends.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Three hours after the call finished, an accountant at Site-90 went missing in a sudden thaumaturgical accident. Assuming a connection to GoI-012, the Ethics Committee and O5 Council granted SCP-9123 one phone call to an outside contact in the hopes of appeasement. SCP-9123 immediately requested to speak with PoI-012-01.</p>

<p><em>&lt;Begin call.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> <em>Telum, tekerio, tedioluna.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Can I ask what that did?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> That was just to ensure your captors can’t trace my phone number. It’s bloody good to hear your voice again, Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I-I appreciate it, Madam. Do you really mean that?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Why would I not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I don't know. I just…</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 sighs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> So much has been going on in here. I'm tired. I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> I understand. We’re working on something to get you back as fast as we can.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What happens if you pay the ransom?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> We’re not paying the ransom.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What if they try to hurt me?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> They better not, if they know what’s good for them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Sure—Sure, but that doesn’t give me any guarantees, you know? …Besides, don’t they have like—a whole department where they make people normal again?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> The Decommissioning Department?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Yeah, that’s it. What if they decommission me? Mute me? What’s gonna happen then?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> They won’t. I assure you, we’ll have you out before that comes into the picture.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> How do you know that they won’t do it right after I’m done with this call?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> How do you know they will?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Precisely. I need you to trust me, Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Madam, I mean no offense, but I am far more scared of the possibility of not speaking again than I think I am capable of trusting you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for two seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> It’s fine. Containment must be proper terrifying to make you say something like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> If I become useless to you, will you at least give me a severance package?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for four seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> You’d receive that, plus a generous compensation for your injury. Why are you so concerned about that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I just want assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Dorian, you know how deeply we care for our employees here at Marshall, Carter, and Dark—we love you. And want you around.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> But is that because of who I am, or because of what I can do?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Who you are is directly tied to what you can do; great men are inseparable from their talents as well as their resources. We simply got you up to speed with where you deserve to be in society.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> But I only got lucky with my voice.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Perhaps so, but this is a world of magic and para-technology—if someone else wanted to get lucky like you, they’d have done it already.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 whines.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> They tried to make me work for them, you know. Obviously, I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> You better not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> You know I wouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> I know, dear boy, I know…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I… Ha—you know, I like my caviar and good suits and three months paid vacation. My sisters like this lifestyle, as does my mother. Even if she won't admit it—</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Ahahaha!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Darke laughs for three seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> I was hoping you’d say that… I’m proud of you, Dorian.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Proud of me?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Yes. Profoundly proud. It’s about high time you abandoned your “good boy” attitude; such things only hold you back.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I…I don’t follow…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> You’re selfish at heart, Dorian. That’s good. Normal, even. Denying your selfishness is to deny your “self” as you define that. Selfishness is part of the “self”, it’s why the two words are kindled together. They’re kin in every sense of the word, part of what machinates humans like you forward.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Even you? You’re…You’re not a human as far as I’m aware.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Ahaha, correct! I play by their rules, but have lived long enough that I have divined them through capital. I want the same for you in the short lifespan you’ll end up living.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Is that even possible?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Probably not. But it’s good to try, for the self.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Mm…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Not convinced? Forget the philosophical approach, then, and simply look at the difference in your quality of life between now and four years ago—that, above all else, should be enough to prove to you the value of selfishness, of expressing your values through who you choose to surround yourself with.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for three seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …I want to be a good person, Percival. Every time I think I've made my peace, that I've accepted that I'm a heartless, selfish bastard, I—</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Does being a good person pay the bills, Dorian?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …No, Madam.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for two seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> It's important that you realize that all those people, all the things you had them do—that is merely the cost of doing business.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Okay…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> The cost of business itself is not selfish. These mechanisms are utterly neutral. The markets which necessitate cost were invented by humans, but occasionally, humans come together to create something greater than themselves. The markets have no feelings; they simply ask of you. Whether you pay is up to your own value judgement.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for three seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> So… You want me to tell Dunn the invisible hand of the free market pushed all those people off buildings and into woodchippers?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Darke laughs again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Listen to me, and listen well, boy. If money has deemed those people as worthy of dying, who are we to argue?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for ten seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I'm sorry, Percival.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Whatever for?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Causing all this trouble for you, being unable to get myself out, crying to you on the phone about things I ought to have gotten over. I'm sorry I've caused a headache for everyone at the office…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Everyone at the office wants nothing more than your safe return. You’re a blessing to have around.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—My mom and sisters are okay, right?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> They're perfectly safe, I've made sure.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I…I hope my mom never finds out about everything, but I…I hope she'd be okay with what I've done. What I do.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> I’m sure she’d be proud of how far you’ve come professionally. I know I am.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 begins sniffling. Its voice cracks.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Th-Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Don’t mention it, Dorian. Hang in there a while longer … No matter what happens, there will always be a seat for you at our table.</p>

<p>On 10/24/2023, 77 liters of blood were delivered to Site-90. Testing confirmed it to belong to Mu-3 field agent Salome Ito. A note floating in the blood read "She still lives. We can bleed her forever."</p>
<p>The Foundation increased security measures in place for Site-90 personnel, but held fast in their demands. Several GoI-012 warehouses were raided in response, and several of their contractors were taken into Site-90 custody.</p>
<p>On 10/25/2023, the following video (labelled consequences.mkv) was delivered to Maj. Roger Dunn's professional email address from an encrypted sender.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/25/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Begin video.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A lush indoor garden framed by a stained glass roof. Nearly all of the plants growing do so towards the light.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A snake is heard hissing in the background, as well as the shuffling of metal tools. Both are difficult to hear over the voice modifier being used, although it is different from the one used in the previous call.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I want to state that, from the start, in case there's any confusion on your end: Darke had a lesser punishment in mind for you. But I do not take pleasure in letting you graycoats<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-19" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-19')">19</a></sup> flaunt your capacity for harm.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The camera pans and focuses on a young man<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-20" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-20')">20</a></sup> strung from a ceiling joist, cords of thorny branches suspending him by his own weight. Thorned sprouts appear to be forcing their way up through his mouth and eyes. He is sobbing quietly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> What beautiful roses. That poor accountant, and him… All of this is because of you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown brushes a thumb across O'Connor's cheek in a mockery of comfort. Every time he moves, blood spills from his eyeballs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Shhh…</p>
<p><em>&lt;He pulls out a root from the collarbone. O'Connor screams in pain.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I also chose basil to grow from his wounds. Smells nice, and tastes nice. As for meaning, it tends to relate to hatred.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown inspects a growth emerging from O'Connor's chest, and hums in satisfaction.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> If he keeps behaving well, he might even get some painkillers. If <em>you</em> behave well.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The camera pans to focus on another captive,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-21" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-21')">21</a></sup> this one crudely fastened to a chair by black, gnarled vines. Her eyes are wide with terror and rimmed with bloody pus, large needles stuck through both pupils. Her cries are muffled as her lips have been stitched shut.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Perhaps I’ll return these to you once Dorian comes back. Perhaps I’ll return them in one piece. It would be so dreadful to have to pick all these leaves out, no?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Another figure is seen at the edge of the frame. All distinguishing features of Unknown 2 are obscured by their black clothes, a hood, and the direction of the camera. They are heard shuffling tools.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> It's a rare enough thing for you to get a double agent past us… The last one I remember was back in the 90s, and we still have him growing belladonna somewhere around here. What a delightful little plant he turned out to be, all double entendres considered. As for this one, we know she fed you Dorian's incident reports, not to mention his contract… Plenty of other financial documents, but really, the details don't matter. What matters is she's a filthy stinking goddamn rat.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown 2:</strong> A rat, rather than a snitch. Important distinction, I'd say, no?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Ah, agreed. A rat's a traitor to their core, never even the slightest bit loyal—</p>
<p><em>&lt;The squeaking of rodents is heard off camera. Jacobs screams into her stitched mouth.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> And rats are <em>hungry</em> bastards…</p>
<p><em>&lt;A rat is picked up by tongs and displayed in front of the camera.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown 2:</strong> Hold this, please? Thank you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown 2 hands the rat to Unknown. They hold both the rat and the camera, continuing to focus on Jacobs as Unknown 2 approaches her, kneeling beside her chair and running their fingertips over her exposed arm. They hum lightly to themselves as they gently trace lines over the skin. After eleven seconds, they pull back the skin from Jacobs' wrist to her elbow in one piece, the blood and muscle tissue shimmering softly in the light. Jacobs shrieks.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown 2:</strong> Oh, bitch, please. We've just gotten started.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown places the rat carefully upon the raw flesh of Jacobs' forearm. Unknown 2 swiftly reattaches the skin, trapping the rat inside. They smooth out the seams with their thumb before methodically stitching it back into place for added security. Unknown continues to speak over this scene.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Your rat still has three more limbs. Not to mention that the rodents can eat through her belly, chest, and face. We can keep her alive for all of it, and we will. It's not pointless cruelty on our point, Dunn, despite what you think. It's a matter of principle. That's what you keep telling yourself, isn't it?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Squeaks and screams can still be heard, albeit distorted through the audio modifier, as the camera pans to a woman's body, impaled through the stomach by a floor-to-ceiling trunk.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> For the <em>principles</em> of it all. That must be why you need an Ethics Committee in the first place. Because your lot is so goddamn full of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8980" target="_blank">principles.</a> Every doctor you have is just basking in it.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown 2:</strong> This one. Her wound's been healing very nicely; we've made sure of it.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown 2 brandishes a branding iron and sears its end with the palm of their hand. It glows hot red as they press it to the unknown victim’s feet, causing her to scream.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> It's an easy enough thing, manipulating her organs into the intrusion. The tree keeps her alive, and she feeds it in turn.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown circles the body, focusing the camera onto her face.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-22" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-22')">22</a></sup>&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> One of your Task Force Commanders, if I'm not mistaken. Of course, she was off-duty when we got her—heading to LaGuardia to hop a flight to Philadelphia. She'd just gotten news that her mother was dying, and like any good child, she wanted to pay a visit before she turned in… Poor thing never even reached the airport. And that is no one's fault but yours, Dunn.</p>
<p><em>&lt;A snake hisses in agitation.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I hope you understand that for every drop of blood you even think about spilling from Dorian Sloan, we will retaliate tenfold. And I don't merely mean on your agents, on you "Highest Bidders"—I mean your peers, your colleagues, your commanders. Your friends, your allies, your lovers.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Unknown 2 steps back into frame and pulls themselves up onto one of the sapling's branches. They begin removing Foster's fingernails one by one, stripping the skin all the way to her knuckles. Unknown does not react to this, nor to Foster's screams and pleas for mercy.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> You think we're selfish bastards for putting money above human life. Maybe you're right. But no matter what, you now have the same choice to make… Exactly how much is human life worth to you, Major Dunn? Because I promise, it's a mere matter of accounting for us, and we have some rather deep pockets.</p>
<p><em>&lt;End video.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>At 9:00 on 10/27/2023, the commanders of several MTFs in the Northeastern Region of the US attended a regularly scheduled video call to provide operational updates and exchange relevant information for the purpose of regional coordination.</p>
<p>During this meeting, two MTFCs were killed by snipers via thaumo-point rounds. Two other MTFCs, who had been notably absent from the call, were discovered to have been killed earlier that morning via car bombs. Three sites in the region soon after, (although notably not Site-90) received timed-released packages of anthrax.</p>
<p>After the call, Maj. Dunn received a dead dove in his office mailbox with an olive branch impaled through its skull. This was just as he finished informing the O5 Council of his future intentions with SCP-9123.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Regarding SCP-9123</p>
</div>
<p>Major Dunn,</p>
<p>I understand that you have no plans of budging on your position regarding SCP-9123. The Council understands the cost of doing business and the value of this asset, but this is quickly becoming unacceptable. Two more weeks of this and the damages risk outweighing the ransom. We cannot afford to train so many people for the positions we’re likely to lose in such a prompt amount of time.</p>
<p>This is an official order: however you see fit, get rid of SCP-9123. Within the next 24 hours, I want it out of our hands and gone. Release it into Manhattan, Dubai, London, the Mariana Trench; however you do it, just make it fast, and make it painless.</p>
<p>I will not tolerate any more of this. This operation is over.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/28/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn and Site-90 Decommissioner Laney Yusuf enter the room with two guards. SCP-9123 jerks up from its sudden sleep.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Up. Now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Where are you taking me?!</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Dunn, we don’t have to do this—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> It’s okay, Laney. I’ve gotten all my affairs in order. I accept anything they might wish to do to me as a result.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> What—?!</p>
<p><em>&lt;The guards grab SCP-9123 and tranquilize it in the neck. It falls limp in their arms, eyes still open as it twitches. They hold it up and begin dragging it towards the door.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Does he have to be conscious as we’re doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> It makes it easier to keep his mouth open.</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Are you sure we…won’t get into trouble doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> They told me to get rid of SCP-9123. That’s exactly what we’re doing.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 tries to squirm as it is taken out of the room. Dunn and Yusuf exit together behind it, Yusuf refusing to make eye contact with anyone.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Switch cameras. Site-90’s decommissioning room has been completely sterilized and modified to accommodate a humanoid subject. As soon as Yusuf enters the room, she dons anti-reflective eyewear and welder’s gloves.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> I will need fifteen seconds to prep the blowtorch. Put…SCP-9123 on the table, and I’ll open his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Affirmative. …Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Are you okay, Major Dunn?</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I—I’m fine. Continue your work.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Yusuf complies with the order. She spreads SCP-9123’s paralyzed body on the table with its arms and legs out, holding its mouth open with several metal screws and braces.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> …This isn’t going to kill you, D—SCP-9123. We’re just decommissioning you on orders from—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> He—He doesn’t need to know what’s going on—</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> It’s good to be kind.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> He’s a murderer. You can’t play nice with—</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Major Dunn!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn looks up. Blood beads at the edges of his eyes, dripping down his cheeks slowly. Small blades of grass begin to emerge from the corners of his eyes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Don’t worry about me!</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> We have to stop this! I—I can’t lose you, I’ll lose my j—</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I have—I have everything ready for my succession, Laney. You don’t— Don’t worry about me. Just make sure he can’t hurt anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> I’m scared…</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Still? After all this time?</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> You never told me I’d have to decommission a person!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Ha, I guess I never did.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn puts his hands over his eyes as Yusuf flicks on a blowtorch. As blood pours from Dunn’s fingers, SCP-9123’s eyes tear up profusely.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> …I’m sorry. But you’ll still be able to live, SCP-9123! We’re not killing you, just cauterizing your vocal cords.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> If she does it correctly, it won’t—it won't—hurt—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn vomits blood as Yusuf flicks the flame on. She whimpers, holding it close to SCP-9123’s mouth. The curving flame is bright green.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Ready?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 cries more. Dunn stabilizes himself into a more graceful position on the floor as he bleeds out from his eyes, as basil sprouts from his back and fresh cuts in his hands.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I told you—Darke—I’m willing to give up—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Yusuf intensifies the flame and lowers it into SCP-9123’s mouth. More blood pours from Dunn, who is approaching unconsciousness now.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Just as she prepares to push it towards SCP-9123’s throat, an alarm sounds out.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Wh-What?!</p>
<p><em>&lt;The blowtorch jerks and burns two of SCP-9123’s molars. Yusuf looks up with tears in her eyes to Dunn, and then quickly towards the door with a shadow fast approaching it.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> I don’t wanna die! Please, please!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Someone throws open the door. Yusuf has collapsed over the table, shaking.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A guard moves into the frame, holding a laptop open.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> They paid the ransom!</p>
<p><em>&lt;The room quiets. Yusuf stops crying gradually. Several guards file in, picking up Dunn and administering first aid to him.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> What…?</p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> Marshall, Carter, and Dark paid the ransom. All thirty-five billion of it. We can let the kid go now.</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Huh—really?!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn smiles weakly and laughs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I knew it…</p>
<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Major Dunn! Don’t talk—you need immediate medical attention!</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Let me savor my victory! Though…</p>
<p><em>&lt;He looks up at SCP-9123, who is now crying more than ever. It barely has the energy to tug against the restraints.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> …No. I suppose I must c-count…what we managed to beat out of them…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dunn finally falls unconscious. SCP-9123 faints as well, but is shocked by two EMTs that quickly arrive upon the scene.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End log.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9123.05 — Returning SCP-9123:</strong> Once agreement was reached with regards to the ransom, SCP-9123 was rendered unconscious and transported to a warehouse in █████, New Jersey. Photo evidence of SCP-9123's safety and relocation was sent to points of contact within GoI-012.</p>
<p>No Foundation personnel were present when GoI-012 employees arrived at SCP-9123's location. However, the following footage was captured from recording devices in and around the warehouse. Further audio footage was transmitted by a recording device sewn into SCP-9123's jumpsuit.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/28/2023</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;At 07:02PM, SCP-9123 is deposited inside the warehouse by Mu-3 operatives, who depart shortly after.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;52 minutes of extraneous footage before SCP-9123 wakes up. It appears distressed upon noticing that its hands and feet have been zip-tied.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> H-Hello?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Twenty seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Fuck… Can anyone hear me?</p>
<p><em>&lt;A black armored limousine pulls up outside of the warehouse. Chrysophilius Marshall, Robert Carter, and Iris Darke emerge flanked by dozens of mage-guards. These guards are all heavily armed with thaumic incendiary equipment.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Where is he?!</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> He should be in—</p>
<p><em>&lt;The trio approaches the warehouse and kicks down the door. Upon seeing SCP-9123, the audio is overwhelmed by squeals of glee.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Dorian!</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Dorian!!!</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Dorian. We’re so glad you’re okay.</p>
<p><em>&lt;All three rush him and begin undoing his restraints. Half of the guards file into the warehouse slowly, circling the four.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Darke begins to cry. She picks up SCP-9123 and bear-hugs him, sobbing profusely. Marshall and Carter snicker to themselves at this display.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Oh my goodness Dorian, we were so afraid!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Carter jabs Marshall with his elbow.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Y-Yeah, we were…we were really scared they were going to hurt you for real.</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Damn that stupid Dunn.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> What a pain in the ass! Do you think he’ll recover, Dorian? We’ve not heard anything from him since the incident.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> He better not, if he knows what’s good for his rotten little heart! You belong to <em>us</em>, Dorian, only we get to scare you with magic and cool technology!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Everyone laughs. SCP-9123 squirms.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Ahaha, Iris, please put me down— I’ve had enough fear for one lifetime—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Darke complies. When she does, Dorian looks to Marshall and Carter, the former of whom hugs him, followed warmly by the latter.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> I—Guys, I—</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Don’t say anything else! Let’s get you back to the office. Everyone’s waiting for you with caviar and champagne!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong>…A little extravagant for me, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Nonsense! Do we look like we don’t care about you?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for four seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> I wonder if they got to him.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> To his head? About what?</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Probably some of their morality nonsense. Dorian, they didn’t brainwash you without our knowledge, did they?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 shakes its head.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> N-No…I just…</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> …Look, if you don’t want the fancy pants welcome party, we don’t have to have one.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Chrysophilius! How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> What?! I’m only reading the room—who knows what they made him feel guilty over?!</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> That’s why you party until you can’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> He’s never been a party person.</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> Dorian, what do you want to do?</p>
<p><em>&lt;All three look to SCP-9123. Silence for six seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Anyone got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> …I have a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Haha, no Iris, a <em>cigarette.</em> Cheap stuff. Cheap to you, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Hey, you’re one of us now.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Whether you like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> The boys are correct, Dorian. Let yourself have some of the finer things in life without worry!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for five seconds. SCP-9123 heads to the door, smiling and looking back at the trio.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> …Money lets you have everything you want, no? Then I want some Marlboros, please. Give me your tired office party, your huddled masses of wealth yearning to be spent… But I just <em>really</em> need a cigarette after all of this.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> …Wait, they didn’t let you smoke in containment, did they?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Darke:</strong> You poor thing!</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> There are worse things than being addicted to nicotine, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Yeah, we have magic to manage that, if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> If?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Marshall shrugs his shoulders.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Marshall:</strong> Better to work for the company needing one than to not and be without. What’s the phrase they call people who don’t do drugs?</p>
<p><strong>Carter:</strong> Clean.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9123 laughs, leaning against the doorframe. Several guards stiffen but ultimately do nothing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9123:</strong> You guys couldn’t pay me to be clean and leave this company. I wanna be doing this till the day I die.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Marshall, Carter, and Darke all smile as they leave the warehouse with SCP-9123.&gt;</em></p>
