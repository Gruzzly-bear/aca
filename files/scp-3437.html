<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedure:</strong> Due to its nature it is currently impossible by current technology and function to properly contain SCP-3437. Usage of Class-Z mnestics may be distributed to researchers experimenting with SCP-3437.</p>
<p>Any personnel with a probable cause to access instances of SCP-3437-2 may do so, but only with permission from the three Class-4 personnel, and at least one Class-4 person overseeing the handling and usage of SCP-3437-2.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-3437-1 must be kept in standard humanoid containment or reclassified as a Class-D and admitted into the Class-D database.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-3437-2, labeled as SCP-3437-2-aaa through SCP-3437-2-zzz, are to be kept in a storage warehouse at Site-205. If usage of any instance of SCP-3437-2 is required by the Foundation, permission from at least two Level-4 personnel is required. Guards are to patrol the perimeter of the storage containing all instances of SCP-3437-2.</p>
<p>Protocol-Null-00 is to be activated by vote of the O5 Council. During Protocol-Null-00, only personnel approved by the O5 Council may leave Sites, otherwise all Sites are to go into immediate lock down.</p>
<p>All Class-D personnel are to be kept within their respective cells and may not be permitted to leave unless administered Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p>Procedures for Protocol-Null-00 is restricted on a need-to-know basis; only O5 members and Class-A and Class-B personnel are allowed to view the procedures. Any non-approved personnel attempting to view Protocol-Null-00 should be detained by guards and administered Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3437 is a metaphysical entity that expunges and censors information. It mainly censors information about itself, but it has also been noted to expunge information other than about itself.</p>
<p>Such incidents range from deleted Foundation spreadsheets, official government records, to the whereabouts of Dr. █████'s car keys.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that SCP-3437 may have originated around the same period as the emergence of sapience and complex thought, expunging information that SCP-3437 itself deems anomalous or 'dangerous' in nature. Information is not limited to human thought, as it has also been noted to expunge entire physical entities (as described in Report-3437-5ta77p2 (Archive File-5ta77p2 Elemental Extermination)).</p>

<p>An instance of SCP-3437-2 (Mb7), documented at Site-205</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-3437-1 instances are humans. They typically lack official records or are identified as missing persons. SCP-3437-1 entities appear to be agents of SCP-3437, equipped with unknown technology (hereby classified as SCP-3437-2) and are capable of apparently anomalous behaviour and function. During Incident-3437-Alpha, it was found that there were a total of 6,872 instances of SCP-3437-1 found across all Foundation Sites.</p>
<p>SCP-3437-2 instances equip SCP-3437-1 with a powerful antimemetic property, rendering them completely undetectable except to other instances of SCP-3437-1 equipped with similar mnestic-based technology. It has been hypothesized that instances of SCP-3437-2 are anomalous in nature, or is so technologically advanced it is capable of producing an antimemetic field around SCP-3437-1 or other operators of SCP-3437-2.</p>
<p>Currently Foundation researchers are investigating and attempting to reverse engineer instances of SCP-3437-2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Incident-3437-Alpha Report</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preview</span></p>
<p>Foundation algorithms, particularly the recently developed AIID ("Uni Stud"), have been detecting odd amounts of anomalous behavior regarding information. It appears, through deep neural analysis, that information on the internet was being summarily deleted rapidly.</p>
<p>Algorithms could not find any history of any user deleting or altering the text. Deeper investigation yielded inconclusive results. Interviews showed that no subject seems to recall said information, despite some being on commonly visited websites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protocol-Null-00</span></p>
<p>The O5 Council, upon hearing of this incident, conducted a vote to on whether to activate Protocol-Null-00 with votes ██ and ██, results in favor of activating Protocol-Null-00.</p>
<p>On 0█/██/20██, 3 days before after Incident-3437-Alpha, Protocol-Null-00 initiated. Procedures to Protocol-Null-00 can be found [DATA EXPUNGED]. After 5 days, Protocol-Null-00 was completed, and SCP-3437 was discovered.</p>
<p>During Protocol-Null-00, a total of ███ casualties from Foundation agents, ███ from governmental entities and organizations and a ██ total civilian casualties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</span></p>
<p>On 1█/██/20██, approximately 12.5 terabytes of information was distributed among countless nations' and organizations' databases. A total of 3,148 entities (including corporations, governments and the memories of people scattered across 100 countries) received a percentage of the 12.5 terabytes of information. In total the Foundation received around 550 gigabytes worth of information among databases across all Sites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-3437-1</span></p>
<p>On 1█/██/20██, the initial incident, a total of ██,███ SCP-3437-1 were discovered (throughout the world, only 6,872 were found in Foundation Sites). It appeared that when the information leakage during 1█/██/20██ occured, it also revealed/disabled the technology that allowed instances of SCP-3437-1 to remain antimemetic, therefore revealing them in their entirety.</p>
<p>In total, around 7,000 instances of SCP-3437-1 were terminated upon the interruption of their antimemetic cloaks. During Protocol-Null-00, any who were not executed were captured and sent to Foundation Sites.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The following reports are information extracted during Protocol-Null-00, including ones extracted from hard drives. Some came in raw text format, others came as pictures of some kind. A large quantity of cognitohazardous and infohazardous files were also collected during Protocol-Null-00, such information can only be viewed under approval by the O5 Council.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The information and reports noted here are in English as it appears to be the predominant language used in the files, though other articles from different languages have also been found. Some are in modern languages, some written in Latin and other files written in unidentifiable languages.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Operational Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">By order of the Grand Censorman, Operation Imposed Will should commence. If you are involved with Operation Imposed Will and you have any complaints, questions or suggestions, visit the Archive Resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The Grand Censorman has been recently notified by Eyes, Ears and Soul that anomalous thoughts have been appearing sporadically and increasingly in the past few months. The Grand Censorman has already conducted a meeting with the High Cabinet to decide the proper course of action.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">It was later decided that free will and free information and thought can no longer be trusted as a non-destructive force. Operation Imposed Will aims to use Level-Black memetics designed to be rapidly transferred throughout a mass population to achieve a mass influence of thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Imposed Will Memetic Containment and Distribution</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The memetic agent (code name Palace) will be inoculated into patient zero; from there, patient zero will transmit Palace via cognitive-based spreading. Anything that senses patient zero in any way will also possess Palace. There will be multiple instances of Palace, each planted in a different continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">For those areas of human isolation, Archive agents will track down and inoculate such cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Palace, once within a host, will expunge any information that it finds anomalous. This will not work with anomalous texts, only with thought (for information on censoring anomalous text, search for Operation Dark Age). Expunged information will then be stored into the Archive and…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Part 1 of 5</span></p>
</div>
<p>The memetic agent known as Palace still continues to expunge information, though instead of 'storing' it into the 'Archive' (the Archive believed to be SCP-3437), the information now simply disappears.</p>
<p>Whereas the 12.5 terabytes contain what appears to be every expunged thought/piece of information, no new information has been detected by Foundation algorithms to appear since Incident-3437-Alpha.</p>
<p>Research into the "Grand Censorman" and "Eyes, Ears and Soul" is currently underway.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Eyes, Ears and Soul has recently made a discovery regarding a certain type of information. It appears that Item-2099, currently quarantined by Archive agents on the Archive sanctuary in the Pacific Ocean, displays anomalous properties no matter what form it takes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">It has been causing trouble, such that international scientists and governments are beginning to notice the Archive sanctuary. Currently, nobody has attempted to reach the sanctuary, but the Archive cannot use this time to do nothing. The Grand Censorman has called for research on totally expunging Item-2099.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">Information Update</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Elemental Extermination has been completed. All research may be redirected back towards other operations. Item-2099 is no longer an issue. If any other type of physical information were to behave in such a manner again, contact Archive Resources and submit an urgent request.</span></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong><br/>
1█/0█/20██</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Greetings D-425531.</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> So D-42553—</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> Yeah, yeah, get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> &lt;<em>Pauses for a moment</em>&gt; Can you, tell me about what you do?</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> Me? I was a High Censorman. Put capitals on High and Censorman. I know you're recording this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> Oh don't give me that bullshit. I've censored enough of your interviews to know what you're trying to do here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> How do you "censor" these interviews? All the interviews we have seem to be in order; they don't appear to be "censored".</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> No, you wouldn't know because I've censored them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Care to elaborate?</p>
<p>D-425531 remains silent.</p>
<p><strong>D-425531:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Ok, thank you D-425531.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D-425531 was largely cooperative in other interviews, only holding back information about the "Grand Censorman", though the fact that D-425531 was a "High Censorman" likely means that D-425531 may wish to not confide any 'important' details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Hello D-437218.</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> WHAT HAPPENED TO RENEGADE?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Renegade?</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> THIS CAN'T HAPPEN! RENEGADE WAS A SUCCESS!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> Can you please explain what Renegade is?</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> THE GODDAMN LIBRARY BURNED THE ARCHIVE DOWN DIDN'T THEY?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> The Library?</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> IF IT WASN'T THE LIBRARY IT WAS YOU [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] WASN'T IT?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> We do not know who did what, perhaps you can explain?</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> DO NONE OF YOU KNOW ANYTHING?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> &lt;<em>Dr. L███ sighs</em>&gt; Guards?</p>
<p>D-437218 begins screaming incoherently.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███:</strong> GUARDS?</p>
<p><strong>D-437218:</strong> HOW DID YOU EXPUNGE THE INFO? YOU CAN'T EXPUNGE ARCHIVE FILES!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D-437218's mention of 'Renegade' has not been found in any reports from SCP-3437. It may be possible that not all information may have been leaked during Incident-3437-Alpha. Foundation operatives are currently, as of writing, still searching for mentions of 'Renegade' and its connection with SCP-3437.</p>
<p>When D-425531 was asked about 'Renegade' in an interview, he simply noted that "it was leaked with the rest of the information" and noting before the interview ended "I have no idea what happened though, Renegade was a success". <em>Note: The file on 'Renegade' was located and is now attached below.</em></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Situation Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Eyes, Ears and Soul has recently discovered that large quantities of Archive Files are having their information expunged. It is Archive policy to never censor the Archive's own information, only restrict to certain members.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Files ranging from g000001 through g999999 have had either the entirety or key parts of information completely expunged. The Archive storage do not appear to retain any information regarding these expunged files. Archive researchers have hypothesized a Class-Penta Antimemetic entity (the Archive is classified as a Class-Quadra Antimemetic entity) to be responsible. Class-Penta was a theoretical classification, but due to current events is being used.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">It appears that the Class-Penta entity (from now on referred to as Item-Null) acts as a complete information void. Unlike the Archive, which expunges and stores it, Item-Null completely obliterates the information. It is impossible to replicate the information in any way, though it appears as though Item-Null does not affect the past , as we are capable of remembering the existence of such information, just that we cannot pinpoint any details at all besides from its existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Eyes, Ears and Soul has also discovered information being expunged not only from the archive, but the entirety of reality. Item-Null has been hypothesized to be responsible for these actions. Archive researchers predict that if Item-Null continues to expunge information, it may create a total void and destroy the universe by completely destroying all physical information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ffffff">10/25/201█- Renegade</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Note:</strong> Researcher David Johnson has explained that Renegade may not be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely</span> destroy or counteract Item-Null, and so therefore Procedure Renegade-25 is being formally established here, to access specific details, please read File-z92gAt9.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Antimemetic researcher David John█on has developed a new technology capable of counteracting Item-Nu█l.
