<p>At present, SCP-7973 remains uncontainable, and it is unlikely that containment will ever be feasible. Until a comprehensive understanding of SCP-7973 is achieved, ongoing efforts to normalize anomalous phenomena should continue until further notice.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc1"><span><tt><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></tt></span></h3>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-7973 is characterized by a systematic reduction in the manifestation of anomalous phenomena. This phenomenon is observed following the complete dissolution of the Veil, a metaphysical barrier that conceals and separates the anomalous from the mundane.</p>
<p>The decline of anomalous phenomena is not limited to the Foundation's jurisdiction but extends globally, potentially further. Reports from other organizations and independent researchers in the anomalous community corroborate this trend. Verified data suggests that SCP-7973 is affecting all known anomalies, regardless of their origin or nature.</p>
<p>Initial theories suggest that the destruction of the Veil disrupted the underlying metaphysical mechanisms responsible for the sustained existence of anomalous entities. It is hypothesized that the Veil acted as a stabilizing force, maintaining the balance between the anomalous and the non-anomalous. With its removal, anomalous phenomena appear to be returning to a state of equilibrium, aligning with the natural laws governing the universe.</p>
<p>SCP-7973 only affects anomalies discovered or occurring after the Veil is dissipated, as anomalies documented before SCP-7973 remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this is currently unknown. Current models predict the prevalence of new anomalous phenomena will cease entirely by the year 2071.</p>
<p>In order to better understand SCP-7973, and the anomalous at large, Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews with several anomalous researchers/related personnel. These interviews aimed to acquire additional insights into the nature of anomalies. The following logs contain the transcriptions of said interviews, accompanied by relevant contextual details.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Gears<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Rosanne<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> The following interview was conducted a few weeks after the Veil was dissolved, with SCP-7973 being only theoretical at the time. Due to Dr. Gears being the current lead researcher for new anomalous phenomena, he specifically was chosen.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em><strong>Dr. Rosanne walks into the room. She waves over at Dr. Gears, before sitting in front of him.</strong></em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Afternoon, Gears! Don't look a day over thirty!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Who are you?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em><strong>Dr. Rosanne stands silently, before resuming.</strong></em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Tiana Mark Rosanne? Doctor, interviewer…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Apologies, you look different than I heard.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> No worries! So, anyhow, you're wondering why I dragged you out here—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> No, in fact, I think I know exactly why. Heard something about statistics being off.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> The statistics, yeah? Just need to say a few things for the file, hope you don't mind.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Go ahead.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well—The guys at the statistics department were having… not the best time, if you can believe it. They were studying the number of anomalies that happened every week, as usual, and you'd expect it to just… Massively jump, right? 'Cause the Veil is gone now.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Did it not?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Not at all! It started to decrease. Not by much, mind you, but the top minds all agreed that its a roughly 0.005% decrease than normal. Granted, four weeks is often not enough data, but they've been going through that stuff for years and never has it went down consistently!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Hm, I see.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, I just have an important question. What do you consider "anomalous"?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Well, to put it simply, I define an anomaly as anything that deviates from our current understanding of the natural world and defies the laws of physics or known scientific principles. Granted, the natural world is surely changing, but I think it still makes sense.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Alright, got that jotted down. Do you think anomalies are inherently dangerous?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> No. Anomalies can certainly pose risks and threats, especially if they are uncontained or poorly understood. However, anomalies themselves are not inherently good or evil, they're simply anomalous. I have seen anomalies both capable of helping and harming the Foundation.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Makes sense to me. If this "SCP-7973" does exist, do you think it means anything big?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> It's impossible to say without more data. But in my opinion, it could signify a more troubling issue, such as a fundamental shift in the fabric of reality, although that is just a theory.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I see—Once we got more information, I'll try to remind you! Although you're leagues above me, so you might know.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Gears nods.</em></strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Gears:</strong> Understood.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the subsequent weeks following the interview, SCP-7973's influence has exhibited a noticeable escalation. Over a period of seven months, only the subsequent categories of anomalies have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 instances of humanoid anomalies</li>
<li>24 occurrences of anomalous wildlife</li>
<li>38 instances of anomalous items</li>
<li>41 recorded anomalous events</li>
<li>12 designated anomalous locations</li>
<li>2 occurrences of anomalies capable of causing a K-Class "End Of the World" Scenario</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the dramatic decrease in anomalies, several groups of interest were interviewed in order to understand SCP-7973 further. Certain groups such as Gamers Against Weed and the Church of the Broken God were observed to continue their operations in an unchanged manner. Although most interviews yielded no notable information, the Global Occult Coalition have reported a similar number in decreased anomalies. Below is an interview with Undersecretary General D. C. Al Fine.</p>

<strong><em>Dr. Rosanne opens the door and walks into the room. D. C. Al Fine scoffs.</em></strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> You know, for something so important, the Foundation should've sent more than one person. I was expecting a meeting with the O5's, that's what Seven told me.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Sorry, they're busy right now, miss. I'm Dr. Rosanne, it's nice to meet you. I've just got a few questions to ask, it won't take long.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> If this is anything that isn't about another North Korea happening, then I couldn't care less.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, it's about anomalies. In short; they're starting to just… stop appearing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> Yeah, we realized that. Initially we thought you were just getting a hand of them first, but seeing your worry, I'm guessing there's more to this?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> We… Don't know.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> Son of a bitch…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> But! But we have some leads, which is why I'm here. Before anything, I need to ask. What do you consider anomalous?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> Typically? Threats. We've seen dozens of them that can end up ending the world, tons that have sent tens of people to their graves. We've seen the library end the world before, so we absolutely know how dangerous they can be!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Yes, while that is true, they're not <em>all</em> dangerous. Like, random example… there's this big ball of slime, makes people happy! So they're not all—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> I'm going to have to cut you off right there. Granted, there are a few anomalies that help. Hell, we got plenty of them. But the truth is, the majority of them are dangerous and deadly. It's astounding that the number has decreased, but maybe it's for the better.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> For the better? I wouldn't say that, like… for every deadly anomaly that no longer exists, there has to be another that could help us, right?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> First, you never use the good ones for the sake of the people, so that shouldn't be your worry. And second, less anomalies means the Foundation doesn't have to employ as many people. For every murder monster, that's at least fifty people that work for something else.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. Rosanne is silent.</em></strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> See? Whatever is causing this… anomapocalypse, it doesn't matter. It's better in the end.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I'll be ending this interview.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Al Fine:</strong> It's the truth, sorry to burst your bubble.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Rosanne was disciplined for her unprofessional behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further statistic reports imply a significant downward trend for new anomalies. Contrary to the earlier projection of anomalies persisting until the year 2071, Foundation analysts now anticipate this occurrence to transpire within a considerably shorter time frame, potentially within the next decade. Over the past year, only 3 instances of anomalous humanoids have been documented. In an effort to further understand SCP-7973, Dr. Rosanne has submitted a formal request for an interview with a humanoid anomaly currently under Foundation custody.</p>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Rosanne<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-049 was situated behind a wall of glass in order to avoid accidental or intentional contact. Dr. Rosanne communicated to SCP-049 through a microphone.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Good morning, sir.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Sir?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> No need for the formalities, please.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Okie dokie. So, I'm guessing you heard the news about the Veil being broke?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> The veil?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Oh yeah, in captivity, sorry! Basically, everybody knows about the anomalous, and people like you! Unfortunately we still need to keep you contained, touch of death and all that… but that's some more interaction, maybe.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Interesting, I knew something felt… off. There was a lot of indistinct chatter about Korea, maybe some time I could visit? Bless them with my cure?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Yeah, sure—Anyways! I do have a few things to say, but the main one is your opinion on the anomalous. What do you consider "anomalous"?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Ah, an intriguing question indeed. Don't think anyone has bothered to ask. Well, my fellow doctor, I consider the anomalous to be that which eludes your feeble comprehension. It is the essence of fear, the embodiment of the unknown. And I must say, I relish in it.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Well, yes, but like… The dark <em>is</em> the unknown, but we don't try and contain darkness.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Ah, but darkness holds its own secrets, doesn't it? You fear the unknown lurking within the shadows. It is not the mere absence of light that sends shivers down your spine; it is the possibility that something watches you, that something sinister stirs in the depths.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I guess you're right. If that's the case, what we do understand can all be explained, there's reasoning behind all of it. But for you, no offense, your death-touch isn't anything we can put together with science.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Believe me, Dr. Rosanne, I am well aware of the limitations of your scientific endeavors. But let me ask you this: Would a caveman try to contain fire? Would a peasant attempt to harness electricity, keeping it hidden from the prying eyes of the masses? You may not grasp my true nature yet, but there is far more to me than meets the eye.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> So, there's aspects of things that transcend our perspective of science? Since we see things we don't know and we're all too quick to think its a threat?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Precisely, doctor. There are forces and phenomena in this world that exist beyond the feeble boundaries of conventional knowledge. Just because we cannot fathom or control them with our limited understanding does not render them purposeless or devoid of meaning.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Makes enough sense. Maybe some day, you can finally walk again… I do feel sorry for you sometimes.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-049:</strong> Don't be burdened by sympathy, doctor. I am a patient being, and solitude holds its own peculiar charm, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Okay, sorry! Thirteen, is that fine?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em><strong>O5-13 nods. He reaches into his pockets and pulls out a packet of cigarettes. He puts one in his mouth, then lights it with a lighter. He offers one to Dr. Rosanne.</strong></em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> No thank you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><em>He nods.</em></strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> Say, Rosanne? What do you consider anomalous?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Me? I'm typically the one asking! But—I'm not sure. There's several times where I thought something was much more than it really was, I was terrified when I was younger on what I didn't understand. So… that's why I'm here. Not sure. What about you?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> Nothing. I don't really consider anything anomalous at this point. I've been a council member for fifty years, and I've surely changed. Being forced to work with a talking computer ever since I was in my early 20s might've been responsible for that.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Really?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> Mhm. Do you know how many SCPs were formerly some great big anomaly, before we got out heads out of out asses and realized otherwise?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Fifteen? Twenty-two?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ex" target="_blank">More than forty.</a> Some are ridiculous, looking back on it. Ever heard of <a href="scp-2011-ex.html">Temporary Secretary?</a>?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Yeah, pretty weird, although I kind of like it. Is it anomalous?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> No. Not at all. Four thought it was, though. He convinced quite a few of us. I've heard hours of anomalous music, thought it was something more. Turns out it just sucks.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Alright, but that's just one example, there can't be—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> <a href="scp-2600-ex.html">Furred Trout</a>, <a href="scp-7000-ex.html">Awesome Points</a>, <a href="scp-7525.html">Slot Goblins</a>, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7166" target="_blank">Lightning targeting people</a>—do I need to continue?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> What exactly are you trying to say?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> SCP-7973 does not exist.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> It doesn't? But—That's not true, all the evidence—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> I can name at least twenty new anomalous humanoids that directly contradict your evidence. The foundation hasn't done anything to contain them, since the Veil broke. We didn't catalogue them, because we simply didn't need to. Say, do you know what SCP-001 is?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I can't say I have, no.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wjs-proposal" target="_blank">It was simply a sheet of paper that described what normalcy is.</a> Changed it a lot, removed and added things, but recently, I shredded it.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> You did what? But—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> Don't get your panties in a twist! I got everyone's consent before doing that. We decided it wasn't needed, since there really aren't any anomalies, is there?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> I guess you're right—but one thing is bugging me. Now what?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> We do what we must. I'll tell the team to update the file, take a break. That's an order.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Rosanne:</strong> Alright, sir-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>O5-13:</strong> Just call me thirteen, please.</p>
