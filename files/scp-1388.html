            <h1>SCP-1388</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1388</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Specimens of SCP-1388 are to be stored in opaque 20cm small item containers. When being studied, D-Class personnel should be the only personnel to directly observe and interact with the garments. Class C amnesiacs appear sufficient to overcome any compulsive effects of the item if limited to 12 hours of exposure, Class B from 12 to 16 hours of exposure, and Class A over 16 continuous hours of exposure.</p>
<p>All known specimens of SCP-1388 are currently in Small Item storage at Sector-25.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1388 are a collection of brief-style underwear with designs related to various unlicensed superheroes, done in a comic-book style. The words "SUPER POWERS" are stitched into the waistband. The label on the inside rear of the garment reads "One Size Fits All Superoos®." Currently two identical specimens are in Foundation custody.</p>
<p>SCP-1388 specimens exhibit three key phenomena. The first is a space-altering effect whereby the waistband can stretch to accommodate any person who attempts to wear them. There is no apparent stress or damage done to the garment.</p>
<p>The second is a mind-altering effect whereby any person wearing the underwear believes themselves to truly be a superhero, capable of superhuman strength, heightened senses and unassisted flight. The effect manifests itself fully over a period of roughly 12 hours, after which all test subjects have grown increasingly agitated and distraught. Beyond 16 hours, the wearer is at high risk of self-mutilation and accidental death, and Class C amnesiacs are no longer effective; the wearer should be first sedated, the garment removed, and a Class A amnesiac administered.</p>
<p>No physical changes or new abilities have been observed despite the subject's insistence as to their new powers; blood and urine samples indicate significantly increased amounts of dopamine and serotonin, seeming to increase with a rate proportional to what the subject calls "superpowers".</p>
<p>The third is a compulsive effect whereby any person who views the garment will wish to wear it. All subjects, when questioned, have given responses related to nostalgia and/or the thrill of being a child again.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The first specimen of SCP-1388 was remanded to Foundation custody June 08, 199█ by London authorities following what appeared to be a rash of suicides by county morgue workers. ████ (█) people in total had jumped to their death before a forensic scientist noticed a morgue technician removing the underwear from a corpse and putting it on themselves. Suspecting sexual crimes, the scientist contacted the police, who, after the apparent suicide of the technician (who tried to stop a train by standing in front of it), contacted Foundation agents at Sector-25.</p>
<p>Efforts to trace the line of suicides and workers back to incident zero were successful, but no living kin could be contacted.</p>
<p>The second specimen was remanded to Foundation custody September 27, 200█ in Manhattan, New York after a failed suicide attempt by a John Doe jumping off the 76th floor of ████████ Tower. Site-28 in SoHo picked up anomalous police chatter as authorities attempted to "talk down" a victim. Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers") was deployed, the victim was disabled by means of a fast-acting tranquilizer and the specimen secured. However, the victim never recovered from sedation and was taken off life support October 5, 200█.</p>
<p>It is presently unknown how many other SCP-1388 specimens exist. Reports of above-average suicide rates in a locale, especially in the forensics field, may indicate a new SCP-1388 specimen.</p>
<p>2/1388 access may be granted by Level 3 staff at Sector-25.</p>
