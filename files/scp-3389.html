<p>Three instances of SCP-3389-S near the shoreline of SCP-3389 prior to the construction of the Shield Structure</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All land both public and private, as well as any facilities contained therein, in a 10 km radius around SCP-3389 have been purchased by the Foundation's Department of Procurement and Liquidation and designated Provisional Site-3389. All roads and pedestrian pathways leading to SCP-3389 are to be cordoned off and maintain a patrol of armed guards. A specialized electric chain-link fence capable of producing electromagnetic waves harmful to instances of SCP-3389-G has been erected around the outer perimeter of SCP-3389.</p>
<p>As of 07/07/2024, a large steel and concrete mega-structure shielded against ionizing electromagnetic radiation, hereby referred to as the <em>Shield Structure</em>, has been erected around SCP-3389.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">See Incident Report 3389/2022 for more details.</span> The Shield Structure consists of an inner structure, the "sarcophagus", and an additional outer structure, the "shell", which serve to contain any emerging instances of SCP-3389-G, as well as to house a patrol of sixteen armed personnel equipped with electromagnetic pulse rifles. The Foundation <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/disinformation-bureau-orientation">Disinformation Bureau</a> is to maintain the public cover story that this structure is a particle accelerator constructed by the nearby NASA-owned Assembly and Manufacturing Complex, and operated as a joint public-private venture between NASA and the interSolar Convergence Program Corporation.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">iSCPC: Foundation front corporation which assists in maintaining the veil, particularly in regards to space-based or multi-dimensional anomalies.</span></p>
<p>If any instances of SCP-3389-S collapse, personnel stationed within the Shield Structure's shell are to terminate any emerging instances of SCP-3389-G. No entities emerging from the lake are to reach beyond the Shield Structure. If any personnel are apprehended by an instance of SCP-3389-G, every attempt is to be made to terminate the entity before they can pull Foundation personnel into the water. Any Foundation personnel who come into contact with SCP-3389, or an instance of SCP-3389-G, are to be administered Class-C Targeted Retrograde amnestics to remove any memory of the event, and then be reassigned. If an instance of SCP-3389-G manages to escape the Shield Structure, or move beyond the outer boundaries of Provisional Site-3389, Mobile Task Force Mu-3 ("Ghostbusters") is to be deployed to track down and neutralize them.</p>
<p>In the case that SCP-3389-M breaches the dimensional barrier, MTF Mu-3 is to be deployed to attempt re-containment of the entity before it can breach the perimeter of Provisional Site-3389. If containment is deemed impossible, all attempts are to be made to neutralize the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3389 is a man-made lake located in the northeastern United States, near the town of ████████, Pennsylvania. Any human being entering SCP-3389 will, after a variable amount of time not exceeding ten minutes, be pulled beneath the surface of the water regardless of the depth at which they were standing. A few minutes after being submerged, a statue (hereafter referred to as SCP-3389-S) of the subject's exact likeness will rise from the water in their place. These statues are unremarkable beyond their anomalous origin, consisting of a synthetic resin and concrete mixture, and given color by standard household latex paint.</p>
<p>Upon discovery by the Foundation, there were forty-eight instances of SCP-3389-S scattered around the lake, all in various states of decay. Seven remain as of 07/07/2024. It is currently unknown how many instances were present prior to containment.</p>
<p>Subjects pulled beneath SCP-3389’s surface will eventually re-emerge as incorporeal entities, manifesting primarily as anomalous electromagnetic signals (hereafter referred to as SCP-3389-G). Instances of SCP-3389-G surface from the water through an instance of SCP-3389-S, which will collapse moments prior. These entities emit varying amounts of ionizing electromagnetic radiation out to a radius of five meters at a rate anywhere from five rad per hour to one krad per hour. When observed through Electro-Magnetic Sight (EMS) equipment, SCP-3389-G entities bear a passing physical resemblance to the instance of SCP-3389-S through which they surfaced, though are known to be able to take on less humanoid forms for the purposes of moving through tighter spaces.</p>
<p>Once they have surfaced, the entities will begin moving towards the shoreline, actively attempting to seek out and capture any humanoid subject they encounter and bring them back into SCP-3389, in order to facilitate the creation of more instances of SCP-3389-G.</p>
<p>SCP 3389-M is the █████████ █████ ███ █████ ██ ███ ███ ██████████.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Redacted by order of Director Henshaw of Dimensional Research Site-98. See GM Report for more details.</span> Exposure to SCP-3389-M presents significant risk of becoming afflicted with Acute Radiation Syndrome (via direct physical exposure), as well as with an informational cognitohazard (via either direct or indirect exposure) whereby SCP-3389-M gains access to the victim's knowledge and memories. Via these memories, SCP-3389-M seemingly gains the ability to manifest severe electromagnetic radiation, typically in the form of an instance of SCP-3389-G, around the subjects of said memories.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">See GM Report for more details.</span></p>
<div class="floatbox right">
<p><strong>Addendum 3389-A1:</strong> Due to the emission of severe ionizing radiation from most instances of SCP-3389-G, they are to be seen as hostile and treated as such.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3389-A2:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Upon request from Doctor Albright, an expeditionary force has been granted authorization to attempt further testing. Provisional Site-3389 has been fitted with an expeditionary command center and communications to facilitate expeditions.</span><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Expeditions into SCP-3389 are prohibited indefinitely. See SCP-3389 Expedition Logs for details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3389-A3:</strong> Following discoveries made through testing and Incident 3389/2022, further testing with SCP-3389 is prohibited. Security Clearance Level for SCP-3389 has been upgraded from Level 2 (Restricted) to Level 4 (Secret).</p>

<p><strong>Test Log 3389-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Test Lead:</strong> Doctor Corina Albright</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-81732</p>
<p><strong>Testing Procedure:</strong> D-81732 was instructed to enter SCP-3389. Approximately four minutes and eleven seconds after entering the water, subject was pulled beneath the surface. A new instance of SCP-3389-S (SCP-3389-S10) rose from the water a moment later. Research Team ordered to monitor SCP-3389-S10 in case it collapsed.<br/>
Approximately three months later, SCP-3389-S10 collapsed, and a new instance of SCP-3389-G (SCP-3389-G3) emerged near the shoreline. Log begins after initial contact, once Doctor Albright and her research team (Senior Researchers Madeleine Hart and Victor Morales) have passed through the chain-link fence equipped with EMS equipment and accompanied by security personnel armed with electromagnetic pulse rifles. Research Team prepare recording equipment as Doctor Albright attempts communication.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>SCP-3389-G3 is the third instance of SCP-3389-G to have emerged from SCP-3389 since containment began. SCP-3389-G1 and SCP-3389-G2 were both neutralized by on-site personnel after initial attempts at communication proved ineffective.</em></p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Video footage displays several artifacts and distortions consistent with electromagnetic interference. One such artifact is visibly larger, roughly equivalent to the average human, and seems to be physically present in the space. This artifact is believed to be SCP-3389-G3.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> D-81732? Is that you? Do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G3:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> What was that? I can't quite understand you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G3 begins approaching Doctor Albright slowly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Careful Corina, picking up low levels of rads coming off this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> How much?</p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Nothing dangerous, looks like… about three rad per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> We're fine, then. Warn me if it starts to increase. D-81732, can you hear me? I want to help you, but we need to be able to communicate.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G3 stops suddenly. Two appendages superficially resembling arms reach forward toward Doctor Albright. A distorted voice is registered on audio recording equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G3:</strong> Do you remember what you've done?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> What I've done? Can you clarify?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G3 appears to gesture to a member of the Research Team, Madeleine Hart.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G3:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G3 suddenly begins moving, now at much greater speed, straight for the Research Team. Doctor Albright orders neutralization, which is carried out swiftly by armed personnel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Alright, we've got our next puzzle to crack. Guess me and you need to talk this through, eh Madeleine?</p>

<p><strong>Test Log 3389-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Test Lead:</strong> Doctor Corina Albright</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-91465</p>
<p><strong>Testing Procedure:</strong> D-91465 was instructed to enter SCP-3389. As with prior test, subject was pulled beneath the water and an instance of SCP-3389-S emerged in their place. Monitoring the instance, it collapsed two weeks later, producing a new instance of SCP-3389-G (SCP-3389-G5).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>SCP-3389-G5 is the fifth instance of SCP-3389-G to have emerged from SCP-3389 since containment began, including those produced by direct testing. Following the last test with SCP-3389-G3, another instance of SCP-3389-S collapsed. The instance of SCP-3389-G that emerged from this was entirely unresponsive, only attempting to breach the site perimeter until it was neutralized.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G5 approaches the fence in the usual manner, but rather than attempt to cross it, the entity halts and gestures to the Research Team. Senior Researcher Morales notes radiation emission from SCP-3389-G5 at a level of approximately 12 rad per hour. It continues to gesture vaguely at the team until Doctor Albright approaches.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G5:</strong> You are better than this.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Better than what, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G5:</strong> All of this. Sending us to die. Doing it for them.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Them? This is my research.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-G5:</strong> Then you are a killer. Nothing you do is your own. They will take it from you and [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G5's form appears to break apart briefly before coming back together, with radiation readings spiking to 43 rad per hour for three seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> And what? This is always so difficult. Is there a better way we can understand you?</p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Big rad spike. It's over now, but I'd suggest pulling back Corina.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3389-G5 turns and gestures towards the lake. It then turns back and attempts to pass through the fence, and is promptly neutralized.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> This is the most progress we've made since we got here. I want copies of this log, I'm submitting a request to send an expedition inside.</p>

<p><strong>Expedition Log 3389-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/07/2022</p>
<p><strong>Expedition Lead:</strong> Doctor Corina Albright</p>
<p><strong>Expeditionary Procedure:</strong> Two armed Security Personnel [Richards, Downes] assigned to accompany two Senior Research Personnel [Hart, Morales] into SCP-3389. All personnel were equipped with the same standard recovery harness, comms equipment, and radiation-shielded diving suit as in preliminary test. Security Personnel were also armed with amphibious assault rifles capable of producing a targeted electromagnetic pulse (EMP), and all personnel were equipped with video umbilicals and audio recording equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>A set of preliminary tests were performed to determine if it was possible to safely enter SCP-3389. Results indicated specialized equipment was necessary, but were otherwise positive, prompting approval for the following expeditions.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Expedition Team were instructed to enter SCP-3389, wading as far into the water as possible. As with prior tests, team members were pulled suddenly beneath the water. Video feeds show each member being pulled beneath the sand, at which point footage becomes too severely distorted to parse.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Team we've lost visual, what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Looks like the same as with the prelim tests, Corina. Felt like I was falling until we got through the sand, now we're on the seafloor. Lakebed? Whatever it is. Don't see anything in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>Hart:</strong> Wait hold on- there's something over that way.</p>
<p><em>Hart instructs the rest of the Expedition Team to move forward from their arrival point.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Looks like… the shoreline.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Keep moving. Do you see anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Hart:</strong> I've got eyes on the research station. On everything we've set up, really.</p>
<p><em>Expedition Team approach the shoreline, describing an exact replica of the totality of Provisional Site-3389's research, communications, and expedition stations. They also establish visual on parts of the chain-link fencing, watchtowers, and what seem to be instances of SCP-3389-G serving a similar function to Provisional Site-3389's security.</em></p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Eyes on entity. Reads like a -G. Say the word and we'll engage.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Only do so if they threaten you or the team. Otherwise, stay back and observe. This is a scientific mission, not a hit and run.</p>
<p><em>Hart and Morales both note no erratic behavior from any instance of SCP-3389-G.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Alright, take a look at the facilities.</p>
<p><em>Approaching the research station, Expedition Team enters to find partially functional equipment. Every instrument that could picked up intense electromagnetic radiation in the surrounding area, and suffered from minor to major malfunctions across the board as a result. Hart and Morales make attempts to interact with the equipment, but none provide anything useful.</em></p>
<p><em>Audio equipment picks up sudden spikes in "whistler" radio signals outside the facilities, and the Expedition Team subsequently note audible sounds similar to the distorted human voices emitted by any communicative SCP-3389-G entities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Are we all hearing this?</p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Loud and clear.</p>
<p><em>Audio picks up the sound of many voices overlapping, gradually increasing in volume. Hart steps outside, wherein the dozens of SCP-3389-G entities patrolling the facility were all facing the direction of the Expedition Team, speaking in unison.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of what is being said by the entities is unintelligible, but later review of the video footage was able to identify partial phrases and sentences.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-Gs:</strong> [OVERLAPPING] <em>We see you - know what you've done - Do you remember? - They remember when - will never be forgotten - remember your transgressions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Alright, we're done here. Get out of there immediately, we need to make sure the radiation readings are accurate, and I don't like the look or the sound of all this. We're not leaving here with nothing, at least.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Albright orders recovery of the Expedition Team. Downes and Richards lead Hart and Morales to their initial insertion point, and successful recovery is performed.</em></p>

<p><strong>Expedition Log 3389-2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/07/2022</p>
<p><strong>Expedition Lead:</strong> Doctor Corina Albright</p>
<p><strong>Expeditionary Procedure:</strong> After health screenings determined the original expedition team to be in good health, a second expedition was approved. One armed security personnel [Downes] assigned to accompany Doctor Albright and two research personnel (Hart, Morales) into SCP-3389. All personnel were equipped with the same standard recovery harness, comms equipment, and diving suit as in prior expedition. Security personnel once again equipped with amphibious assault rifles capable of producing an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), and all personnel were equipped with video umbilicals and audio recording equipment.</p>

<p><em>Expedition Team sent into SCP-3389 in similar manner to first expedition. The process was identical until the team was submerged, as video feed persisted intact.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon emerging from the sand, video feed shows that rather than a plain seabed as in Expedition 3389-1, Expedition Team had arrived in what appeared to be the main entry hall of Dimensional Research Site-98, albeit entirely submerged underwater with its floor coated in a thin layer of sand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> This is different from before. Doctor Albright, please report- are you seeing what we're seeing?.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> I'm seeing it alright. What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Command, can we confirm with Site-98 that there's nothing out of the ordinary going on over there?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> We're on that right now. You all take a look around, see what stands out.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> It's like, identical. Everything here is exactly where it should be.</p>
<p><em>Video feed shows Expedition Team proceed forwards, exploring their surroundings. They make their way through to the next area, the ████████ ██████████.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Redacted by order of Director Henshaw of Dimensional Research Site-98.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Expedition Team, we've got word that all is good at Site-98. No anomalous activity or electromagnetic readings of any kind.</p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Things are just getting weirder down here, Command.</p>
<p><em>Video footage shows a mass of SCP-3389-G entities moving haphazardly through this section of Site-98.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hart:</strong> What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Permission to engage, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Not yet. We need answers before we do anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Heads up, Expedition Team. Unknown entity detected on electromagnetic readouts. Looks about a hundred meters ahead of you, other side of the South wall. This one is a good deal bigger than the others.</p>
<p><em>Video artifacts and distortion grow more severe, rendering most images indiscernible. Electromagnetic readings show the large entity moving into the ████████ ██████████<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Redacted by order of Director Henshaw of Dimensional Research Site-98.</span> and absorbing the numerous instances of SCP-3389-G. This entity is henceforth referred to as SCP-3389-M.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> We've got crazy readings here now.</p>
<p><strong>Morales:</strong> Woah, hey, my life support systems are all out of whack. Anyone else getting this?</p>
<p><em>A sharp sound is heard on the audio feed of Doctor Albright, as well as that of Downes and Hart. All life-signs from Morales cease.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Team we just lost Morales, what's happening?</p>
<p><strong>Hart:</strong> Jesus Christ, what the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>Downes:</strong> Command, Morales' suit just impacted. Half a second, compressed to the size of a golf ball.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> We need to leave. Now!</p>
<p><em>Command initiates emergency recall procedure. Harness' begin retraction, lifting the team up until they collide with the ceiling (Review of expedition footage later noted the harness tethers seemed to phase through the ceiling of the building, despite the Expedition Team noting physical impact with it during recovery). Various independent SCP-3389-G entities begin approaching, and Downes engages, successfully neutralizing before they can make contact.</em></p>
<p><em>A voice is heard over audio feeds, heavily distorted. It drowns out all other sound.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3389-M:</strong> This is not your grave, but you are welcome in it.</p>
<p><em>Expedition Team breaks through the blockage, now rapidly approaching what appears to be the waters surface. A mass of electromagnetic energy shoots out from SCP-3389-M towards the team, and all life signs from Downes are lost shortly after.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Albright:</strong> Fucking hell, Command we've lost Downes!</p>
<p><em>Upon breaking the surface of the water, Doctor Albright and Hart are found to be floating on the surface of SCP 3389. Recovery of equipment and personnel is successful.</em></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Incident 3389/2022 occurred at Dimensional Research Site-98 on 07/07/2022. After initial tests on SCP-3389, it was determined to be an undue mortality risk to research personnel, and further planned expeditions were cancelled. Over the coming months, Doctor Corina Albright, as well as her research partner Madeleine Hart, reported strange dreams in which they bore witness to the events of their last expedition as though they were outside spectators.</p>
<p>In these dreams, both of them saw a clear visual of the various SCP-3389-G entities, as well as SCP-3389-M. They reported that it spoke cryptic phrases, often directed at them, but just as often not. Of note among these messages was a consistent theme of admonishment for past deeds, never with any specificity.</p>
<p>On 07/07/2022, the Director of Dimensional Research Site-98, Harvey Henshaw, experienced a similar dream wherein SCP-3389-M appeared to attempt to communicate with him directly. Upon waking, he prepared a report<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">See GM Report: Access Password GM3389M</span> and submitted it to the Foundation North American Oversight Committee with intent to permanently bar access to SCP-3389, and to increase security around Provisional Site-3389.</p>
<p>After review, increased security measures were approved. Measures consist of increased anti-radiation shielding for Site-98, completed after a six month construction period, and a large steel and concrete Shield Structure built around SCP-3389, completed after a two year construction period.</p>
<p>During construction of the Shield Structure, anomalous activity from SCP-3389 increased significantly. Over thirty instances of SCP-3389-S collapsed and gave rise to SCP-3389 entities which proceeded to harass and attack Foundation personnel on-site. This came in the form of direct attacks, where the entities would attempt to drag personnel back into SCP-3389, as well as indirect attacks in the form of hostile messages delivered either in person by the SCP-3389-G entities, or via dreams from SCP-3389-M.</p>
<p>As a result, construction was routinely delayed as personnel were regularly administered Class-C Targeted Retrograde amnestics, reassigned, and replaced by new personnel until the Shield Structure was completed.</p>
<p>Since construction of the Shield Structure was completed on 07/07/2024, anomalous activity from SCP-3389 has all but ceased entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the night of 07/07/2022, I believe I was contacted by an extradimensional entity.</p>
<p>This entity spoke in riddles and rhymes, with poetic prose and little in the way of sense. It would often accuse me of sins in my past of which it claimed to know, but never elaborated on. What was clear, however, was that it possessed intimate knowledge of day-to-day operations within Site-98.</p>
<p>Above is an image produced from the electromagnetic wave data we collected during the second expedition, in which we made contact with the entity identified as SCP-3389-M. This entity appeared capable of splitting itself into multiple parts, as can be seen in the above image, as well as increasing its size (and, subsequently, its radiation output) by absorbing nearby instances of SCP-3389-G.</p>
<p>The concerning part of these readouts is that they seem to register biological life-signs as well as the expected electromagnetic waves. After thorough investigation, it has been identified that these biological signatures match perfectly to brain-wave patterns from every person we sent into SCP-3389, as well as many of their immediate acquaintances, such as myself. These waves emit from the structure at the center of the entity. Also of note, this structure seems to duplicate in full when the entity splits, rather than being divided. The significance of this is unknown at this time.</p>
<p>During our time spent analyzing these readings and attempting to ascertain the potential threat posed by SCP-3389-M, it continued to communicate with me, as well as with many of the staff at Site-98. It knew my schedule, the schedules of top research staff, and the identities of MTF Mu-3 agents assigned to oversee SCP-3389. Much more concerning, it seemed to be learning about other anomalous objects we have contained on-site.</p>
<p>This came to a head when communication was established with Doctor Alice Phoenix, our Assistant Director of Containment. In her time at Site-98, Doctor Phoenix oversaw testing of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4192">SCP-4192</a>. Approximately two days following SCP-3389-M's making contact with her, Foundation satellites picked up massive electromagnetic waves impacting the Earth's magnetosphere. We determined the cause of this to be anomalous electromagnetic waves affecting SCP-4192, originating from SCP-3389.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior testing with and expeditions into SCP-3389 have compromised Site-98. Class-C Targeted Retrograde amnestics have been administered to all personnel affected by the cognitohazardous properties of SCP-3389, and Class-B Regressive Retrograde amnestics have been administered to Doctor Corina Albright, Senior Researcher Madeleine Hart, and all personnel originally assigned to Provisional Site-3389, sufficient to remove any memory of ever having known of SCP-3389's existence. Multi-U has transferred full responsibility of the site to us, and we have since replaced the staff at Provisional Site-3389, with Albright, Hart, and the rest having been reassigned to a different facility.</p>
<p>The administration of amnestics, along with cessation of further testing of SCP-3389, appears to have resolved the issue, and no further containment contamination has been reported. A request has been submitted to retrofit Site-98 with increased electromagnetic shielding, and all personnel are now required to undertake a monthly health screening to search for signs of SCP-3389 Cognitohazard infection.</p>
<p>Additional requests have been made to consider the construction of a "sarcophagus" structure around SCP-3389, similar to that of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, in order to provide an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>Signed Director Harvey Henshaw, Dimensional Research Site-98.</p>
