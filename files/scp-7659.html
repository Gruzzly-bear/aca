            <h1>SCP-7659</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7659</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7659-1 is to be repurposed as an urban MTF staging area. The sinkhole formed within SCP-7659-1 is to be paved over, and sensors are to be installed within the pit for monitoring purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7659 refers to an event occurring on the 31st of March, 2026, involving the partial destruction of ██████ ████'s headquarters in London, England.</p>
<p>SCP-7659-1 is the outer shell of the ██████ ████ corporation's skyscraper. Despite lacking any interior structural reinforcement, SCP-7659-1 is entirely stable with no obvious damage detectable from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On the 31st of March at 1 pm, a Foundation monitoring station in Canary Wharf, London, detected significant seismic activity centred around the headquarters of ██████ ████. Following the evacuation of nearby buildings, Foundation agents disguised as various rapid response units were able to obtain preliminary containment of the site.</p>
<p>Upon entry to the building, a large sinkhole occupying the entire ground floor area was discovered, as well as the hollow nature of the rest of the structure. Further notable findings have been documented below:</p>

<tr>
<th>Item of Interest</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hanging Banner</td>
<td>A large plastic banner hangs across the entrance displaying the phrase "Promotion Season is Upon Us!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bronze Statue</td>
<td>Believed to have been a statue of the ██████ ████ corporation's CEO, the statue has been significantly melted by nearby electrical fires and is currently on its side inside the sinkhole. "Warping, melting and discolouration have left it looking weirdly crab-like"[sic].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sinkhole Walls</td>
<td>The bare rock walls have been coated with a mixture of melted plastic, metal, glass, and various other materials, leaving the surface extremely smooth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mass of Corpses</td>
<td>Pressed against the nearside wall of the sinkhole are approximately 367 corpses in a short, roughly conical shape. The corpses bear small lacerations, cylindrical bruises, blunt force trauma, and slight burn damage. Many of the corpses are either holding onto or standing atop each other, some even appearing to intentionally reach for particular nearby corpses. 27 bodies exist in a heap at the bottom of the mass. These bodies exhibit severe damage typical of a high-velocity impact. Despite the volume of bodies compared to the height of the pit, the highest corpse is significantly below the lip of the sinkhole.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> After no further anomalous phenomena was detected onsite for two weeks, a proposal to cremate the bodies was accepted.</p>
<p>Following the cremation, a small metal pin was noticed on the floor by the chamber. Despite significant burn damage on the badge, the words "HR Assistant Director" could be made out. The powdered remains recovered from within the chamber after its deactivation showed no anomalous properties.</p>
<p>A review of camera footage showed one dessicated entity attempting to leave the chamber during incineration. Before it could escape, several hands were seen pulling it back into the oven.</p>
