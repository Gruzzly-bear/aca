            <h1>SCP-2506</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2506</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2506 is to be housed in an <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/reach-s-blueprint-folder" target="_blank" target="_blank">L-Type Humanoid Anomaly Containment Cell (HACC)</a> fitted with Sporzewski-grade Construct Stability Seals (CSS). A full audit of all CSSes attached to an SCP-2506 specimen's HACC is required before testing and/or interviewing can be authorized. All testing and/or interviewing is to be conducted remotely, with SCP-2506 remaining in its HACC at all times. One or more CSS may be disabled for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Though not anomalous in and of itself, the current SCP-2506-1 is to be considered a part of this project, and is to remain with SCP-2506 at all times. The original SCP-2506-1 is to remain in a secure storage locker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2506 is a female Korean American child named Sarah Myo, born 2006-08-05. SCP-2506 presents with a Type-D(I) Reality Manipulation Ability<sup><a class="bibcite" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="bibcite-1-70528a" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-1')">1</a></sup> enabling it to displace and transport objects to its current location using vocal commands. SCP-2506 is not able to affect non-existent materials, nor is it able to affect organic material, living or deceased.</p>
<p>Although SCP-2506 shows an aptitude for mechanical and electrical engineering uncharacteristically advanced for its age, it is not believed to be anomalous in nature.</p>
<p>The current SCP-2506-1 is a non-anomalous stuffed crocodile SCP-2506 refers to as 'Niles'. SCP-2506 utilizes SCP-2506-1 as a focus object, believing SCP-2506-1 is instrumental to the correct functioning of its abilities. Tests have ruled this out. To activate its anomalous properties, SCP-2506 requests one or more objects from SCP-2506-1. These then materialize within 10-30 ms at a random location within 1.5 m of SCP-2506. In rare cases, objects requested have materialized inside other objects or elements of the environment such as walls or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2506-01:</strong> <em>Preliminary Containment and Recovery Notes</em></p>
<p>SCP-2506 was recovered from Spring Grove, MN on 2015-09-07 after local authorities received reports of unknown parties drag racing on an isolated stretch of road. Responding units then found SCP-2506 travelling at speeds in excess of 150 km/h in a scratch-built vehicle powered by a TJ 100 Turbojet Engine and containing parts from a motorized lawn mower, a go-cart, a bicycle, and several severely burnt playing cards. Subsequent to detainment, SCP-2506 showed evidence of anomalous properties when several items spontaneously materialized in the offices of the Spring Grove Police Department, including several beverages, a comic book, and an recent issue of Power Engineering Magazine. A Foundation Containment Team was dispatched when communication about these events was intercepted by a listening post and preliminary containment was effected with minimal impact on witnesses.</p>
<p>The sudden disappearance of one TJ 100 Turboject Engine was later determined to have caused the crash of an experimental ultralight aircraft in Gilze-Rijen, The Netherlands, several days prior to initial containment. Counter-information protocols were implemented according to standard procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2506-Inc-01:</strong> <em>Management Summary of incident report 2506/IncRep/01:v3.22-AES</em></p>
<p>On 2015-09-08, during a first attempt at SCP-2506's intake, it expressed a desire to see its mother. Subject did not appear. Intake was then rescheduled for later that day.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2506-Int-01:</strong> <em>SCP-2506 intake d.d. 2015-09-08</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Langston-Keys (<strong>LK</strong>)<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Sarah Myo (<strong>SCP-2506</strong>)<br/>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> Wed, 09 Sep 2015 02:24:30 GMT</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> Hi Sarah. I'm Sophie. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> I'm okay, miss, I guess…but I don't know where I am. I was with officer Mackle, and then I don't remember a bit, and then I was here.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> You can call me Sophie, we're friends here. You're in a sort of hospital. We take care of children with really great talents. You have one of those, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> (<em>shrugs</em>) I don't know. I'm good with building stuff? Dad says I'm going to work for NASA building rockets some day. I like racing better though.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> (<em>laughs</em>) We noticed that, yes. But I wasn't talking about building stuff, really. That engine that you used for your…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> …you mean what I was racing with when officer Mackle yelled at me to stop?</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> Yes. The engine you used for that…where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> Niles got it for me. (<em>holds up stuffed toy</em>) Niles is really good at getting me stuff.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> That's a cool crocodile toy you have there. How long have you had him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> Niles isn't a toy. Niles is my friend. And I've had him since I was born, I think? My mom says I got it from uncle Ben when I was born.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> Of course, of course. And you talk to Niles, and he brings you things you ask for?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> Yes. But he can't bring me pets that went away for good, and he can't bring my mom or dad either. I tried, but it didn't work. I don't understand why Niles won't bring my parents.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> You'll see your mom and dad soon, I promise. We just need to make sure that we understand what Niles does.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> Niles is special.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> Yes. Yes, he is, isn't he? Say, can I borrow Niles for a little while, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2506:</strong> Why? He's <em>my</em> Niles.</p>
<p><strong>LK:</strong> Never mind, Sarah, it's not important. Well, I'll make sure we get some stuff to play with. All you have to do is wait and play.</p>

<p><em>Following the intake, SCP-2506-1 was removed from SCP-2506's HACC during her first night in containment. Tests revealed no anomalous properties, but SCP-2506-1 was replaced with an identical copy to rule out that the suspected anomalous properties were tied to SCP-2506-1.</em></p>
