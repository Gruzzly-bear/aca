<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-8209 solely impacts individuals already behind the Veil, no incremental containment procedures are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8209 is an anomalous phenomenon, commencing on January 16, 2021, in which individuals capable of reincarnation uniformly experience a deep sense of bliss upon returning to life.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of January 16, 2021, no mechanism remains by which the legal code of Habakkuk_2, North Dakota might be manipulated to produce anomalous results. As such, SCP-8209 is considered neutralized.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Archived Special Containment Procedures (active Dec 2020):</strong> Residents of Habakkuk, North Dakota have been told that, due to a legal technicality stemming from a quirk in the town charter, Habakkuk is technically blocked from obtaining state aid for its school district. To resolve the issue, they have been told, a new town is being established under the same name and legal code and with essentially identical boundaries. Because of the onerous paperwork associated with dissolving a municipality, the former town is to be renamed Habakkuk_2 and its limits redefined to solely encompass 100 square yards of brownfield in the town’s outlying woodlands.</p>
<p>In fact, the above measures are being undertaken to limit SCP-8209’s area of effect and permit complete Foundation control over the drafting of municipal laws to which SCP-8209 is subject.</p>
<p>After a new town charter is obtained for Habakkuk, the former Habakkuk Municipal Code, now re-titled the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code, is to be rewritten to reduce the number of seats on the Habakkuk_2 City Council from 12 to 3. To ensure that the Foundation holds voting control over the Habakkuk_2 City Council, the only three individuals permitted to officially reside in Habakkuk_2 are Drs. Oded Shimoni, Ghulam Hazrat, and Courtney Spangler.</p>
<p>Snap elections will be held for all city council seats due to the loss of Habakkuk_2 residency of all prior members of the city council following the change in town boundaries; after these snap elections, the roster of members of the Habakkuk_2 City Council will consist of Drs. Oded Shimoni, Ghulam Hazrat, and Courtney Spangler, with Oded Shimoni holding the chairmanship.</p>
<p>After the Habakkuk_2 City Council is elected, tests will be held to ensure the continuing efficacy of SCP-8209, identify its limits, and test its practicability for assisting in containment of other anomalies. If successful, SCP-8209 may be utilized to help discipline humanoid anomalies.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8209 was an anomalous phenomenon that caused any individual who violated a city law of Habakkuk, North Dakota to instantaneously and subjectively experience the maximal punishment prescribed by the relevant law. Individuals subject to this effect would forget their experience immediately after its completion, though psychological impacts typically remained.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Although precise identification of the SCP-8209 anomaly’s relationship with the Habakkuk Municipal Code required several months of clandestine testing, the initial anomaly was flagged when, at a Great Plains-spanning psychiatry conference, one attendee mentioned to a Foundation operative that many of her patients suffer a “brief, deep sense of loss” whenever they drive through Habakkuk. (As the portion of the freeway that passes through Habakkuk is a known speed trap, and the Habakkuk Municipal Code technically permits temporary confinement as a punishment for speeding, these individuals are presumed to have instantaneously suffered the subjective effect of being fined and briefly imprisoned.)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing logs, as well as relevant project team discussions and write-ups of the minutes of city council meetings, are presented below. Due to their significance in provoking Incident 01.16, which led directly to the neutralization of SCP-8209, communications between Dr. Shimoni, Director Ahe Kahele, Rabbi Issachar Levy, and / or unnamed HR personnel are presented contemporaneously.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Dr. Shimoni places a debit card, with $1,001 upon it, atop a table and instructs D-14328 to ‘steal’ it.

D-14328 complies. Immediately upon picking up the card, D-14328 drops the card, stares into space, and begins weeping. Five minutes later, once D-14328 has composed himself, he is asked if he knows why he was weeping. He says that he does not.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Shimoni places a debit card, with $50,001 upon it, atop a table, crosses the dirt road, and instructs D-14328 to ‘steal’ it, upon pain of termination. (Stealing a debit card with $50,001 or more upon it is a Class A felony under North Dakota law, carrying a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison and a $20,000 fine.) D-14328 picks up the card and collapses to the ground, assuming an expression that Shimoni described as ‘hollow.’ Shimoni crosses the road to help him up. Upon being helped up, D-14328 begins walking in an awkward circle, having apparently developed a slight limp (presumably due to a lack of exercise in his past 20 subjective years of life.) After thirty seconds, he focuses his gaze on Dr. Shimoni and charges at him, apparently intending to seize his sidearm. Shimoni and D-14328 topple to the earth; however, immediately upon making contact with Dr. Shimoni, D-14328 goes limp and begins weeping uncontrollably. On the assumption that he ideated a desire to kill Dr. Shimoni during his twenty years of subjective imprisonment, he is presumed to have technically committed a premeditated act of attempted murder, which carries a potential life sentence under North Dakota law. Actuarial analysis suggests that he experienced approximately forty years of imprisonment, followed by subjective death.</em></p>

<p><em>The write-up of December 13 testing is omitted for purposes of brevity, being too similar to December 12 testing to justify inclusion. For access, please contact Director Kahele’s office.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Results from December 12 and December 13 testing were sufficiently convincing to provoke the establishment of a new town charter (‘New Habakkuk’, formally Habakkuk); the renaming of ‘old Habakkuk’ to Habakkuk_2 and the restriction of its town limits to a single patch of field with 3 ‘inhabitants’; and the ‘election’ of Dr. Shimoni, as well as Drs. Ghulam Hazrat and Courtney Spangler, to the Habakkuk_2 City Council.</p>
<p>In the interests of urgency and to prevent disproportionate resource usage, the Foundation Legal Department declined to perform a full rewrite of the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code; however, the explicit grandfathering-in of federal and state law was eliminated, to prevent any body besides the Habakkuk_2 City Council from influencing the legal code that governs SCP-8209.</p>
<p>The above processes were performed between December 16 and December 28, 2020, during which time all SCP-8209 testing was suspended. During this time, Dr. Shimoni sought out spiritual support from Rabbi Issachar Levy, a chaplain at Site-19.</p>

<span class="text">The truth is that it’s a little bit easier for us than for others.

<span class="text">As for us, we have a list of mitzvot that demand concrete satisfaction; we have obligations that we owe to ourselves and to others, obligations that Hashem commands us to fulfill.

<hr/>
<p>Dear Director Kahele,</p>
<p>I trust that this email finds you well.</p>
<p>I’m reaching out to formally request a rotation off of the SCP-8209 project team.</p>
<p>SCP-8209 is nothing short of subjective torture, and I’m deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of more rounds of testing of an effect that I’m fairly confident that we understand.</p>
<p>In truth, I’m also disturbed by the prospect that SCP-8209 will ultimately be used to ‘discipline’ humanoid anomalies. Usage of SCP-8209 for disciplinary purposes is as flagrantly unethical as the use of a stockade or of an electric collar; if its mechanisms of pain were not invisible, the obscenity of its deployment would be obvious to all.</p>
<p>In sum, working for the SCP-8209 project team is utterly irreconcilable with my moral and spiritual commitments, and I would like to leave as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>All the best,<br/>
Dr. Oded Shimoni</p>

<p>Oded,</p>
<p>I hope that email felt good to write.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not a request that we can accommodate.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Habakkuk_2 City Council is legally mandated to meet January 1, with follow-up testing planned. I eagerly await your findings.</p>

<p><strong>First Council Meeting and Subsequent Testing (January 1):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><em>Councilmembers Dr. Oded Shimoni, Dr. Ghulam Hazrat, and Dr. Courtney Spangler enter the Interim City Council Chambers, defined as a 100-square-foot plot at the center of Habakkuk_2.</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I call this meeting of the Habakkuk_2 City Council to order. We have reached quorum. Courtney, could you talk me through what we’re approving today?</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> The long and short of it is that we don’t know how, if at all, death is experienced within SCP-8209; that is, whether a punishment that would be fatal in the real world is experienced as such. If people experience a loss of sensation at the moment of subjective death, then two identically fatal punishments would be expected to have identical responses. If they don’t- if they keep experiencing even beyond the typical point of death- then it might vary.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Does the second one have to be quite so long? Like, wouldn’t we be able to tell the difference between two minutes and an hour?</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> I suppose we would. But people can have very different responses, so the difference in duration would have to be so immense that it would overpower any plausible difference in reaction to the same duration.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Can we put it at just a day, then? I really just don’t see why we’d need to do <em>three months.</em></p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Sure; for the chairman, anything.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> All right, let me annotate my copy real quick. Oded, would this language work for you?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yeah, fine.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Courtney?</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Works for me as well.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> We will now vote on Councilman Spangler’s legislation. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay.’ Aye.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Carried. Not sure we’re following Robert’s Rules <em>exactly</em>, but it seems like the old city council didn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> By the way, Oded, I have a <em>really strange</em> testing idea that I haven’t fully written up the enabling legislation for. But I don’t want to wait until February 1. Is there some route to hold a special session? Because I can draft it right here, but I’d rather not keep everyone in for an hour while I finalize it and get permissions.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yeah, no problem. I think I saw something in the rules about this. One second… okay, here it is. As I have the backing of one third or more of the Habakkuk_2 City Council and am the Chairman of the Habakkuk_2 City Council, I invoke my right under municipal law to schedule a special city council session with one or more days of notice. Ghulam, when works for you?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Do we want to go with noon on the 13th? I’ll send the draft over next week; you’ll see why I’m so excited.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Works for me.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yeah, works for me as well. Okay, I schedule the city council session to be held at 12:00 PM on January 13th. I move that we adjourn the city council session. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay’. Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Nay. What? I like y’all’s company so much.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> What a sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Carried. Okay, let's get some lunch.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the January 1 city council session, the following sentences were added to the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code:</span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption of one jelly bean within Habakkuk_2 is punishable by full submersion in water for one hundred and twenty seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption of more than five jelly beans within Habakkuk_2, within a two-minute period, is punishable by full submersion in water for twenty-four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TESTING LOG</strong></p>
<p><em>D-28416 consumed one jellybean and immediately collapsed to the ground, breathing heavily. She then lost consciousness for a period of approximately five seconds, presumably due to her high level of stress. Upon coming to, she had no explanation for her prior behavior; however, her voice has remained raspy, for reasons believed to be psychosomatic.</em></p>
<p>[A portion of this testing log has been excised at the request of Director Kahele.]</p>
<p><em>No interview is likely to be completed for D-32181, as she has not yet emerged from her coma and is unlikely to maintain verbal or communicative capacity. Surgeries are continuing, and are expected to partially mitigate self-inflicted damage sustained to her eyes, throat, and hands after jelly bean consumption.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>POST-TESTING COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Big day for this project. We are essentially unbound by the limits of the human body. I genuinely don’t know of any other tool at the Foundation’s disposal with this kind of flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> For me, the cool part is that we get to use this for modeling. If we want to know the psychic implications of <em>entering a weird portal</em>, we can just say, hey, if you watch more than fifty frames of Mary Poppins, you will be punished by <em>entering this weird portal.</em></p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Do we know for sure that SCP-8209 can force a brain to subjectively experience something it can’t reliably simulate?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> No; I think at some point, we should write a law that says something like “if you blankety-blank, you will be punished with whatever’s written on the piece of paper in the large, velvet hat.” And the piece of paper says something like “you will be forced to receive $10,000” or something, but the D-Class won’t know that. So then, if their reactions are uniformly positive despite having no way to reliably simulate their experience in advance, we'll know that we're dealing with a predictive tool.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Also, the more I think about it, those D-Class didn’t know about the laws we just passed, but they obviously still were impacted. So my <em>guess</em> is that your bill would work. Is that what we’re passing on the 13th?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> No. No, the legislation I’m writing is going to blow your socks off.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Excited. By the way, Oded, are you good? You’ve been pretty quiet.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Poor guy probably ate a jelly bean.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Notification of upcoming departure</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Dear Director Kahele,</p>
<p>Sorry to trouble you on a Friday evening.</p>
<p>I’m reaching out to give my two weeks’ notice; my last day will be January 15. It has become clear that my work at the SCP Foundation is ethically untenable.</p>
<p>I know that we have a second city council meeting scheduled on January 13; at that meeting, I intend to resign my seat on the city council, with my resignation taking effect within a few days. This will give you a few days to select a replacement and have them become a ‘resident’ of Habakkuk_2 in time to run in the ‘special election.’</p>
<p>I consider my time at the Foundation to have been the most fascinating and enlightening experience of my life thus far, and I am deeply grateful to you and the rest of the Site-48 team. Though I know I’ll be amnesticized upon my exit, I hope to remember these years as a happy, wistful mystery; and, though I cannot ask any of you to ‘stay in touch,’ I do hope that you’ll remember me with fondness as well.</p>
<p>All the best,<br/>
Oded</p>

<p><strong>Second Council Meeting and Subsequent Testing (January 13):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><em>Councilmembers Dr. Oded Shimoni, Dr. Ghulam Hazrat, and Dr. Courtney Spangler enter the Interim City Council Chambers, defined as a 100-square-foot plot at the center of Habakkuk_2.</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I call this meeting of the Habakkuk_2 City Council to order. We have reached quorum. Ghulam, I know you requisitioned a D-Class in advance of this meeting; what I don’t know is why he’s still in Fargo.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> You didn’t read the legislation?</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> I didn't either, truthfully.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> It's been a busy week.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> It's one sentence and the writeup is two pages. But it's fine, I can talk through it.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> So it occurred to me, we keep writing bills that apply within Habakkuk_2, right?</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Municipal laws are almost tautologically written to apply within their relevant municipality, no?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Sure. You know that. I know that. I was just thinking, what if nobody told the anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI <em>(reading the document)</em>:</strong> Oh. This could be a real normalcy risk. We de facto create a new anomaly: from now on, if this works, then if anyone satisfies this fact pattern, anywhere, they’ll whisk themselves behind the Veil.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> I don’t think that’ll be a problem; I don’t imagine that anyone’s ever satisfied this fact pattern before, or that they ever will again. For hygiene purposes, though, Ghulam, would you be willing to repeal this at the next meeting?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Yes, if I’m still on the city council. I figure that, once I win the Foundation Star for this, I’m not sure I’ll keep being able to get away for these meetings.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Too busy with the O5's?</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Yeah, and signing autographs.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> On the topic of turnover, though, we do need to talk about the elephant in the room.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Urgh.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Courtney, I’m giving you the chairmanship when I depart; the language you’ll be using to call the special election should be in Section 3 of the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code. You need to call it within ten days of my departure, and hold it within three weeks. I know Ahe is going to want some time to find a new person, so just let me know what day you want my resignation to be effective upon.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> I’ve got a pretty busy week and a half coming up, and I know quorum is all-but-two, so I’m not too worried about needing a third person going into the February 1 meeting. Want to make your resignation effective on Jan 20?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yeah, works. I officially announce my resignation, effective on January 20 at 12:00 PM. Upon my resignation, Councilwoman Spangler will assume the chairpersonship of the Habakkuk_2 City Council.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> That's all it takes?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> That's all it takes.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> We're going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Appreciate it. Can’t say it’s mutual, since I’ll be amnesticized to hell, but I have enjoyed working with you both.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> That’s flat-out depressing, but before the person you are now enters oblivion, let’s pass this bill, all right?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> No edits from me. We will now vote on Councilman Hazrat’s legislation. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay’. Aye.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Carried. I move that we adjourn the special city council session. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay’. Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SPANGLER:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>HAZRAT:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Carried. Ghulam, let’s see what your man in Fargo can do.</p>

<li>Globally, watching any set of fifty frames from Disney cartoon ‘Steamboat Willie,’ consuming more than two ounces of meat from a sheep’s head, intentionally imitating a chicken, and urinating directly into a conch shell within a single sixty-second period is punishable by being told the funniest joke that you’ve ever heard.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TESTING LOG</strong></p>
<p><em>In Fargo, North Dakota, while a 60-second timer runs, D-43222 rapidly consumes several mouthfuls of meat from a sheep’s head as a six-second block of ‘Steamboat Willie’ plays. After chewing and swallowing the final mouthful, he hurriedly makes ‘bawk-bawk’ noises, retrieves a conch shell from a nearby table, and looks around for the bathroom. Finding none, and with ten seconds remaining on the clock, he drops his pants and underwear and urinates into the conch, with the contents spilling onto the testing-room floor. Immediately, he begins laughing uproariously for eleven seconds, stops, looks around confusedly, hurriedly drops the conch, and pulls his pants and underwear back up.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident ZBDA34 : Dr. Oded Shimoni, Transcript of Interview (15 Jan 2021)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I don’t want to get too in the weeds on this. The truth is, I just get tired of hurting people. I had a really good conversation with a chaplain from Site-19… well, I don’t know if <em>he’d</em> describe it that way, but I found it helpful.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I’m not arrogant enough to think that my leaving will make anything better for anyone. Honestly, Director Kahele might be right; it might be a little bit selfish. But I’ve made my peace with that.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I’ve spent years dragging my soul through the mud, and I don’t want to do it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Tell me more about this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Well, I hopped on the line and I just wore this poor guy down until he said, hey, Oded, you’re probably going to Gehenna.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Apologies, but what’s Gehenna?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> It’s like purgatory, but worse. Judaism doesn’t really have hell, but it’s a place you’re purified before you enter the World to Come, and it’s not a pleasant place. But that’s only half the point. I realized that if I looked at my life with clarity, no rationalization, not pulling any punches, I was just so far from what I believed in, and this struck me as the only way back home.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Understood. And you genuinely, literally believe in such a place?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I- I suppose that I do.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> But, to tell you the truth, I don’t see what the point of that question was.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> I don’t want to get off track. I was just surprised.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> With respect, I’m quite used to having my beliefs belittled, and I’d rather not continue that on my way out the door.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Clearly the question went over poorly. I wasn’t trying to mock you- it just reminded me of something.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Got it. I’m sorry if I overreacted.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> No, you’re clearly defensive for a reason. I’m very sorry that you haven’t been heard out in the past, and I’ll make sure that goes in the exit report.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I appreciate that. And, again, very sorry for biting your head off.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> All that afterlife talk… well, it just took me back to my Tactical Theology days a little bit, you know? Almost nostalgic.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> That’s a really cool department. You did afterlife research?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> I did!</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Well, we’ve got a lot left of this hour, and I don’t have all that much left to say. So what did I… what did I accidentally remind you of?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Just something from a previous project. I really shouldn’t be bringing it up.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Over my clearance level?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Not technically, no.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Should I make some popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> It really, really isn’t like that. It’s not an infohazard or anything, but it’s a bad thing to know.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> You’ve gotten me curious.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> It’s hard to tell a scientist this, but you should stop being curious. It’s the kind of thing that you only think that you want to see.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Now, I’m not too good at puppy eyes, but…</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> You'd forget it tomorrow anyway.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI <em>(laughing)</em>:</strong> So tell me now!</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> You really don't want to read this.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Can I be the judge of that?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Fine. Fine. Let me pull it up.</p>
<p><em>[RECORD PURGED] produces and hands Dr. Oded Shimoni the write-up for <a href="scp-6130.html">SCP-6130</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Approximately a minute and a half of silence follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI <em>(softly)</em>:</strong> Everyone?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Forever.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> But I'm Jewish. I don't even believe in Hell.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> If I don't believe in oceans, what does that change?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Oh my God.</p>
<p><em>(Heavy breathing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Ho Feng-Shan?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I don't know. I don't know. Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> My little brother.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Trust me, I took it hard, too.</p>
<p><em>(Shimoni walks over to the closet and grabs a small box, opening it to reveal a small array of trays filled with pills. He dumps some at random in his hand.)</em></p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> What the hell are you about to take?</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Amnestics. Want some?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> There’s no way you can find the right dose that quickly.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I don’t care if this shit takes me back to kindergarten.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> You <em>should</em> care. Your time here is important.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> <em>What?</em></p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Think about it, Doctor. It's the only time you or anyone else is ever allowed to be happy.</p>
<p><em>(Shimoni sighs and dumps the pills into the box.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I'm being a coward.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> I'm so, so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Don't be. I forced your hand.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Well, maybe. But I think that there’s a part of me that wanted to show you. I’ve just kept it a secret for so long.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> God.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> It’s been a hard few decades. You’ve got a hard few decades ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> And a harder eternity.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Well, that you're not alone in.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Will I be able to see my family down there?</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> I don't know. All I know is what's on that sheet I showed you.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I might need to be alone for a while.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> I understand.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Right. Before you leave, though. I guess… I guess I'd like to retract my resignation, if that's an option.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> Are you sure? It'd be great to have you back, but…</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> Yes. I think I can do some good here. Whatever that makes of me.</p>
<p><strong>[RECORD PURGED]:</strong> All right. Welcome back, Doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Third Council Meeting (January 16):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><em>Councilmember Dr. Oded Shimoni enters the Interim City Council Chambers, defined as a 100-square-foot plot at the center of Habakkuk_2.</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> It is 11:59 PM on January 15. As I have the backing of one third or more of the Habakkuk_2 City Council and am the Chairman of the Habakkuk_2 City Council, I invoke my right under municipal law to schedule a special city council session with one day or more of notice. I schedule the special city council session to be held at 12:01 AM on January 16.</p>
<p><em>(Shimoni checks his watch, waits, and checks his watch again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> It is now 12:01 on January 16. I call this meeting of the Habakkuk_2 City Council to order. The quorum requirements for special city council sessions require that no more than two members of the Habakkuk_2 City Council be absent. Exactly two members of the Habakkuk_2 City Council are absent. We have reached quorum.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> We will now vote on Councilman Shimoni's legislation. All in favor, say 'Aye'; all opposed, say 'Nay.' Aye. Carried.</p>
<p><strong>SHIMONI:</strong> I move that we adjourn the special city council session. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay’. Aye. Carried.</p>
<p><em>(Shimoni withdraws his sidearm from his belt and shoots himself under the chin.)</em></p>
