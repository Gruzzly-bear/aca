</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9841</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment of SCP-9841 is not to be enacted, as it has already been integrated into the Foundation's Veil-preservation policies. Foundation researchers are to enact further research of SCP-9841's limitations. See <strong>Addendum 5</strong> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9841 is an anti-memetic anomaly that causes increasing levels of apathy towards any given Foundation employee's career at the Foundation from their acquaintances, friends, and family members. SCP-9841 almost universally affects all acquaintances, family members, and relatives of all SCP Foundation personnel, and appears to intensify over a prolonged period of time, as long as the relevant Foundation personnel continues to be employed at the Foundation.</p>
<p>In a case of SCP-9841 affliction, the Foundation employee (henceforth referred to as SCP-9841-A) does not appear to be affected by SCP-9841. Only their acquaintances, family members, and relatives (henceforth referred to as SCP-9841-B) will be.</p>
<p>Monitoring has shown that SCP-9841-A instances often do not appear to notice the effects that SCP-9841 has on SCP-9841-B. It is unknown if this is a product of SCP-9841 itself, or just the result of the Foundation's work ethic training, general employee outlook, general memetic enhancement programs, and/or employment-induced nihilism.</p>
<p>SCP-9814 has been divided into four stages of progression, referred to as the Longing Stage, The Transient Stage, the Acceptance Stage, and the Terminal Stage.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>SCP-9841 Progression</th>
<th>SCP-9841-A Status</th>
<th>SCP-9841-B Status</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Longing Stage</td>
<td>Employed at the Foundation for over a month.</td>
<td>SCP-9841-B becomes less skeptical towards Foundation narratives, asking less questions about SCP-9841-A's place of employment, or the nature of their work. SCP-9841-B expresses distress when SCP-9841-A leave for prolonged period of times, or leave unannounced, but can be easily placated by Foundation narrative. SCP-9841-B reacts with distress when confronted with evidence of SCP-9841-A's actual work.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Transient Stage</td>
<td>Employed at the Foundation for over 6 months.</td>
<td>SCP-9841-B stops asking about SCP-9841's place of employment, or the nature of their work. SCP-9841-B still express distress when SCP-9841-A leave for prolonged periods of time, or leave unannounced, but raises no objection. SCP-9841-B reacts with mild confusion when confronted with evidence of SCP-9841-A's actual work.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Acceptance Stage</td>
<td>Employed at the Foundation for over a year.</td>
<td>SCP-9841-B reacts with acceptance when SCP-9841-A leave for prolonged periods of time, or leave unannounced. SCP-9841-B does not visibly react when confronted with evidence of SCP-9841-A's actual work. SCP-9841-B starts interacting less with SCP-9841-A overall. SCP-9841-B becomes more withdrawn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Terminal Stage</td>
<td>Deceased in Foundation employment.</td>
<td>SCP-9841-B instances self-fabricates a narrative in which SCP-9841 died on their cover job. SCP-9841-B does not bring up SCP-9841-A unless prompted. SCP-9841-B does not visibly react when confronted with evidence of SCP-9841-A's actual work, or when confronted with evidence of SCP-9841-A's actual circumstances of death.</td>

<p>Due to its extensive and omnipresent nature, it is believed that SCP-9841's effects also extends to other aspects of SCP-9841-A and SCP-9841-B's social lives, mental states, worldviews, beliefs, and personal relationships. Research into this factor has not been deemed of priority.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1 - SCP-9841-A Accounts:</strong> As most SCP Foundation personnel have regular meetings with their narrative counselors<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, especially early on in their career at the Foundation, excerpts from these meetings relevant to SCP-9841's effects has been placed below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SCP-9841-A:</strong> Oswald Salt, MTF Agent, employed for 2 months.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative Counselor:</strong> Dr. Mark Kressler</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> And how has your wife been adjusting to these changes?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Salt:</strong> You know, uh, there was some <em>difficulties</em>, at first. I uh, there was one bad night where she demanded to call my boss, and I kinda fought with her over it for a while, but then I realize you guys had a <em>protocol</em> for that. So, I figure that looked a bit <em>suspicious</em>. But…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> But?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Salt:</strong> I don't know, I <em>think</em> I'm making some good progress. She doesn't get <em>too</em> upset when I have to go anymore. She used to yell at me over it for <em>ages</em>, what with the new house and all. Now, I just tell her that I got to do a job, and she's <em>okay</em> with it. I really think it's gonna work out.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> And what about your kids?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Breyers:</strong> What <em>about</em> 'em?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> I mean, your new post. At Site-20. Your new assignment would have you away from home for a year. I imagine the <em>suddenness</em> of the news…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Breyers:</strong> Ah, oh, kids. You know how they are. They <em>get</em> it, y'know? I tell them their old man's on a top secret mission, and they're okay with it. Perks of having a cover-story that sounds <em>cool</em> enough.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> But you'd only just returned home after six solid months of work.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Breyers:</strong> <span style="color: grey"><em>[Shrugs.]</em></span> Absence makes the heart grow fonder, son. As long as the money keep coming in, I'm doin' a <em>good enough</em> job.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2 - SCP-9841-B Interviews:</strong> The following interactions were designed to test the limitations of SCP-9841. Only excerpts deemed relevant have been presented below. For a full list of interactions, see Document-9841-B-Complete.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SCP-9841-B:</strong> Lisa Redford, daughter of Dr. Oswald Redford.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewers:</strong> Dr. Mark Kressler</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> This was one of Dr. Kressler's final assignments related to SCP-9841. In this interview, Dr. Kressler is posing as a teacher in the subject's school. By this point, Lisa Redford is estimated to be in the Transient Stage of SCP-9841.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> …and we'll just put you down as a "<em>maybe</em>" for the Spelling Bee. Now, your parent's information. What's your dad's name?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Redford:</strong> Uh, Os… wald. Oswald Redford.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa Redford:</strong> …no. I don't think so. I'm sorry…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kressler:</strong> Um, well, when was the last time you asked?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Redford:</strong> <span style="color: grey"><em>[Silence.]</em></span> …I don't remember.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SCP-9841-B:</strong> Marissa Fernandez, mother of Dr. Clarence Fernandez.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewers:</strong> Dr. Alan Cross</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Cross carried with him amnestics, as well as pictures and footage of Dr. Fernandez at his usual Foundation post. At this point, Mrs. Fernandez is estimated to be in the Acceptance Stage of SCP-9841. Dr. Cross had introduced himself as "someone from the government."</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And what did you say your son worked at?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> Oh, he works at the CIA! My boy, he's helping <em>protect</em> people. He's helping protect the nation!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Alright, and when was the last time he contacted you?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> I can't remember something like that. He's usually really very busy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> When was he last home?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> It was just quite a while ago. I think… I think it was over 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And can you remember a single time that he's contacted you since?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> I told you, I can't remember something…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Not even a single letter, a text message? Any word from him at all? And you don't find this strange?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> He's <em>busy</em>. He's <em>busy</em> at his <em>job</em>, at the <em>CIA</em>…</p>
<p><span style="color: grey"><em>[Dr. Cross retrieves a tablet from his briefcase, and hands it to Mrs. Fernandez. He turns it on.]</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> I… I don't… I don't… what is this? I don't- What are you showing me? I don't like this. I don't <em>like</em> this. <em>Please</em>-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And could you tell me what he's doing?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Fernandez:</strong> Oh, oh, can't you <em>see</em>? He's doing his job. He's working at the CIA. He's helping keep the country <em>safe</em>. He's helping <em>protect</em> people.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SCP-9841-B:</strong> Gabriel, Jane, and Priscilla Sawyer - son, daughter, and wife of Agent William Sawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewers:</strong> Dr. Alan Cross</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Agent Sawyer had passed away on a mission prior to this interview, placing the family at the Terminal Stage of SCP-9841 after several years at the Acceptance Stage. Dr. Cross introduced himself as "a friend from work" to the family. Priscilla Sawyer did not inquire further.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And you say he was a contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Yes. Something for the military. He didn't tell me much, but I understand it was something he couldn't talk about anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Right, and he never said anything to you two, either?</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Sawyer:</strong> Dad shot guns, shoot, <em>shoot!</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane Sawyer:</strong> Yeah! <em>Yeah!</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And what were you told about his passing?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Well, he-</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Sawyer:</strong> The <em>bad guys</em> killed 'im. He died like a hero.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Sawyer:</strong> A <em>hero!</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Alright, kids, could you…</p>
<p><span style="color: grey"><em>[Mrs. Sawyer points to the other room. The younger Sawyers walk out and close the door.]</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> I see the kids are taking it well.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Yes. The mind of children, it's really <em>somethin'</em>, ain't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Yes, but… Mrs. Sawyer, when did you all find out that he died?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Oh, they called me right after it happened, so, three days ago.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Well, my condolences. I'm sure it's still fresh in your mind. It's remarkable that you all have been coping so well.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Mmm.</p>
<p><span style="color: grey"><em>[Silence.]</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Before that, when was the last time that Will came home?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Well, let's see. It was right after Gabe's sixth birthday, so… about three years ago. Around November. He came home for vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Did anything happen at that time? Did he say anything off-putting, or…</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> Oh, uh, I can't remember something like that… I think we got into an argument. Small one, I think. But, y'know. Frightened the children a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> What was the argument about?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> …Did he tell you about this? You're asking a lot of questions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Oh, you don't have to continue if you-</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> No, it's alright. I think it was something over his job. He said that I wasn't talking to him much, and I told him I didn't know what he was talking about. I don't… I don't really remember what else we talked about. That was the last time I heard of him, aside from the occasional birthday card.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> So he walked out on the family three years ago. How… how did your family and friends react to this?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> I didn't tell anyone about it. Sometimes, men need space. I understand that. He was doing important work. He was irreplaceable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Right, but over <em>three years</em>. You're saying that your husband, the father of those children, one day, over an argument you can't remember the details of, stood up and walked away, and aside from one or two cards a year, and in that time you've never reached out to anyone? Never thought to ask anyone on his side of the family, called any emergency numbers?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> I think that's what happened, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> And you don't question it?</p>
<p><span style="color: grey"><em>[Silence.]</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sawyer:</strong> I <em>accept</em> it.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Ernest Kressler was discovered with an envelope full of notes and images, documenting Dr. Kressler's time at the Foundation, SCP-9841, as well as other sensitive information. Dr. Alan Cross was sent over to assess the situation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Can you tell me what the notes in the envelope say, Ernie?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Kressler:</strong> I don't think so.

<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Kressler:</strong> Mark. I assume that being at the CIA's gonna take up most of his time. I figure he's not gonna make it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cross:</strong> Oh, probably <em>not</em>, I'm afraid. I hope this won't be an issue for you?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Kressler:</strong> No, it's no problem. It's just a shame, you know. That he won't be here for Christmas. I mean, there's always next year.</p>

<p><strong>-4:12:</strong> SCP-9841-A strikes a guard, and is struck by three more in response. SCP-9841-B slowly lifts his gaze. Tears are streaming down his face.</p>
<p><strong>-4:11:</strong> SCP-9841-A screams, and reaches for one of the guard's holster. SCP-9841-B's gaze comes to a rest on a spot above the window. It appears that he's directly staring at the stealth Foundation camera, despite the fact that there is no way for him to have noticed or see it.</p>
<p><strong>-4:10:</strong> SCP-9841-A grabs onto one of the guard's gun. SCP-9841-B whispers. Stealth Foundation microphones were able to pick up the noise:</p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p style="text-align: center;">"Are you coming home?"</p>
</div>
<p><strong>-4:09:</strong> SCP-9841-A is prematurely terminated by a single gunshot to the cranium. SCP-9841-B falls to his knees, still staring at the stealth camera.</p>
<p><strong>00:00:</strong> SCP-9841-A's scheduled termination time. At this point, Foundation staff were already in the process of clean-up. SCP-9841-B remains kneeling at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>15:42:</strong> Clean-up of SCP-9841-A's termination concludes. SCP-9841-B remains kneeling at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>9:43:12:</strong> SCP-9841-B slowly stands up, and descends the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>9:46:31:</strong> SCP-9841-B walks past a calendar. He pauses, and removes yesterday's page. It is December 25th.</p>
<p><strong>9:46:51:</strong> SCP-9841-B resumes daily morning routine and prepares for Christmas celebration alone.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4 - Progress Review:</strong> The following is a note from Dr. Alan Cross to the O5 Council regarding SCP-9841.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I've looked over all of the numbers again, and everything here has genuinely exceeded all of our wildest dreams. We're looking at an almost 230% increase in work efficiency and productivity overall, ever since the integration of SCP-9841 into our Veil-preservation structure. Our employee family policies, our work-life balancing methodologies, they've all been rendered redundant, and so have the costs.</p>
<p>For the first time, the amount of employees requesting additional Foundation work has surpassed the amount requesting day-offs. And all of this during the holiday seasons. I think that speaks for itself.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, I hereby request O5 approval to move forward with Phase 3 of the SCP-9841 project.</p>
