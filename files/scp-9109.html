<p>SCP-9109</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>All containment protocols are archived aboard Exodus-9, currently en route to a habitable universe.</p>
<p>Containment efforts were to prevent the spread of SCP-9109 instances via the deployment of Reality Anchors across the Earth. These efforts proved insufficient. Surviving members of the human species, Foundation personnel, flora, fauna, and cultural artifacts have been relocated aboard the inter-universe vessel Exodus-9.</p>
<p>As of 21/09/██26, SCP-9109 is considered neutralised following the total collapse of the known Universe.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9109 refers to a phenomenon wherein physical objects, living organisms, and eventually entire celestial bodies undergo transmutation into ‘holes’ in the fabric of reality. Instances of SCP-9109 have no tactile influence of any forces around it (such as gravity or air). Though, instances may be entered leading to the participating entity exiting the Universe, resulting in its destruction.</p>
<p>The phenomenon was first observed on 03/06/██25, when Dr. Hart failed to report for a scheduled ethics review. Security personnel dispatched to his quarters discovered a statue-like form, matte-black and inert mid-action. Initial theories posited a spectral anomaly. During initial analysis by Dr. Fatima Cel Tradat, resident of the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-the-department-of-colour">Department of Colour</a>, confirmed the object’s colouration was not an alteration of the light spectrum but an “aperture into a matter-less void.”</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p>I’ve grown accustomed to alterations in the chromatin spectrum, and have seen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aesthetically</span> similar phenomena such as this. SCP-████, for instance. An ailment that mutates the skin into the colours of the rainbow, and paralyses vital organs. However, in this instance, I can only conclude that this object is a hole in reality.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I find it ridiculously that I was even brought in. Anyone of us can toss an object at it and watch it suddenly drift into the darkness. With respect, why waste time and resources? I believe what we’re seeing beyond this anomaly is not a dark void. There’s not even any colour within this void, from what I can analyse. The event horizon of this object, and whatever lies beyond, is the inversion of any material structure.</p>
<p>If I might be so bold, and I suggest confirming it with any local physicist, that we are observing the exterior of our Universe. This is beyond my departments capacities.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">

<hr/>
<p>Hume field analysis revealed focal distortions centred on Dr. Hart. Initially he remained the sole instance of SCP-9109, however over the next two weeks, 15 additional SCP-9109 instances were recorded across Site-109. Affected items included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office Supplies</li>
<li>Architectural Structures</li>
<li>Food Items</li>
<li>Six Foundation Personnel</li>
</ul>
<p>A further 37 instances of SCP-9109 emerged within during the following three days.</p>
<p>Security footage witnessed various formations of SCP-9109. Objects, if in motion, suddenly froze and rapidly transitioned into a red hue, then ultimately darkened until the object became a standard instance of SCP-9109.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Organic instances showed no awareness once the process began, simply ceasing in place. Any transition into an SCP-9109 instance takes less than 60 seconds.</p>
<p>As instances of SCP-9109 increased, personnel began reporting vivid dreams involving corners that stretched infinitely, or ones that opened 'outwards' and 'twisted into themselves like a Möbius strip.'<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Shortly before the total loss of the Universe, all reported dreams were of this nature. These dreams persist post-universe, though infrequently.</p>
<p>After this time, reality anchors were distributed throughout vital Foundation sites. Despite these efforts, new instances of SCP-9109 continued to appear. Entire wings of Site-109 were eventually lost. Site-109 was reconfigured to the full study and containment of SCP-9109. Movable SCP objects and non-vital personnel were transferred to applicable locations. New instances of SCP-9109 began manifesting outside the immediate confines of Site-109 shortly thereafter. This included surrounding forests, and other nearby buildings and fauna.</p>
<p>Due to a substantial portion of Site-109 being rendered an instance of SCP-9109, a mobile satellite was able to be sent into SCP-9109. The short clip transmitted back revealed little of note; there was no light, nor matter or any mass beyond SCP-9109. Despite configurations made to the remote satellite, the lack of physics beyond SCP-9109 rapidly caused it to cease functioning and degrade. It was considered lost.</p>

<p>However, Researcher Yaga, a class-3 psychic, reported a large face within the void. Whilst no visual evidence is apparent, as seen above,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> R. Yaga insisted to submit a report:</p>

<hr/>
<p>There was something in there, I swear by it. I can see a pale face within the darkness just before the feed shorts out. It's right there, I swear on it. The fact that no one else could see it was surreal. I'll freely place my reputation on the line that this isn't pareidolia or some other similar phenomenon. This situation is stressful, but not to such a degree that I hallucinate a grinning face in the darkness.</p>
<p>Call Dr. ████ ███ ██████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, or some other class-3 psychic. If no one else sees it, then perhaps we're simply dealing with some paranoid researcher.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Further examination by psychics of a similar class as Researcher Yaga confirmed that those of a similar disposition observed a face within the void. As of writing, it is unknown what was witnessed, nor its connection to SCP-9109.</p>
<p>Eventually instances of SCP-9109 appeared across civilian spaces, starting widespread panic. Initial appearances were focused in Melbourne, Victoria, The Republic of Australia &amp; New Zealand, the first one affecting a tram, with all onboard becoming an instance of SCP-9109. Further manifestations appeared across the city, as well as in Tokyo, Berlin and São Paulo. The Foundation declared a XK-Class scenario. With the dispersion of the veil due to SCP-9109, the Foundation addressed the Unified Nations.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Esteemed delegates,</p>
<p>I speak to you under dire terms speaking on behalf of our leaders, the O5 Council.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Since its inception, the SCP Foundation has operated in secrecy. Our mandate has been simple: to secure, contain, and protect. We were the guardians of the normal world, where up remained up and down remained down.</p>
<p>We have catalogued, studied, and prevailed that which defied modern science, biology and morality. The catalogue you’ve been provided offers only a glimpse.</p>
<p>My appearance may be a shock to many of you. It is one of many small sacrifices my compatriots and I have made in your name. We have all bled and died out of our love for all of you.</p>
<p>Today, we face something different. A threat that will end humanity of we let it. It has already begun to subsume our planet. So we come to you, the people we have served since our organisation was founded almost two centuries ago, and ask you to join us in solidarity.</p>
<p>The Foundation is deploying reality anchors across key global sites, the science of which will be shared. We will coordinate our defences. We will protect what remains.</p>
<p>And if we cannot stop SCP-9109, we will ensure that humanity endures beyond it. We are seeking alternative locations for humanity to survive, and preparing for a global evacuation, the details of which will be revealed.</p>
<p>I am now opening the floor to questions.</p>

<p>Public outcry was a common issue, with various conspiracies blaming the Foundation for both SCP-9109 and other common subjects of conspiratorial speculation. Civil unrest, war and collapsed continued as SCP-9109 continued to grow. Public representatives of the Foundation were frequent targets of attack. Dr. Cel Tradat was amongst those killed in action, having been forced to enter an instance of SCP-9109 by a public terrorist.</p>
<p>Landmarks, mountains and states rapidly transmuted. Further, the situation was increased to a potential ZK-Class once astronomers and reported colonies reported the absence of local stars and other celestial bodies. 24 hours after this report, Mars was reported as an instance of SCP-9109.</p>

<p>Evacuation plans continued to be prepared, however it became apparent after surveying adjacent dimensions that the span of SCP-9109 reached into all known and accessible dimensions to the Foundation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p>It was concluded the total span of the Universe would eventually become an instance of SCP-9109. As of writing, the pattern of manifestation remains indeterminable beyond the increasing speed in which they appeared as new instances continued to overtake standard matter.</p>
<p><strong>POI-Undine:</strong></p>
<p>POI-Undine (hence Undine or <em>the</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> Undine) is an extra-temporal entity three meters tall. It possesses an elongated neck and lacks an observable mouth. Undine's skin consists of a blue, gelatinous substance with a consistency similar to rubber. It lacked legs and instead features a fish-like appendage. It was capable of levitating no greater than 20 cm above ground.</p>
<p>The Undine lacks any skeletal structure and instead is structured by dense muscular formations high in <em>haemocyanin</em> likely contributing to the object's blue complexion.</p>
<p>On 03/09/██25, hume levels dramatically spiked within Director Dalton’s office, the head of the Department of Interdimensional Relations, within the leftmost corner of the room. A spatial rift manifested and immediately Undine emerged from it before the rift visibly evaporated behind it.</p>
<p>Upon arrival Undine collapsed to the floor, visibly weakened. It was secured via a standard containment cell. It requested 'water,' and refused to communicate otherwise, which was provided via the chamber’s food port.</p>

<p><strong>Dir. Dalton:</strong> That name refers to a mythological water spirit in our culture. Is that relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Undine:</strong> It is an approximation. Though… the social osmosis is pertinent given my affinity for water. I-I did meet Paracelsus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>, a primitive if you'd pardon my bluntness.

<p><strong>Undine:</strong> I have designed an inter-universal life craft to salvage your Universe and to allow transportation to another habitable Universe. I am optimistic you species can comprehend this design.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Dalton:</strong> I see… [Off to his assistant] Get the team down in engineering to see this right now. [Back to the Undine] You’ll understand my suspicions. This reeks of martyrdom.</p>
<p><strong>Undine:</strong> Your suspicions are valid.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Dalton:</strong> This all seems too good to be true, on paper. I don’t even know how we can construct such a device. What motivation would you even have to save us?</p>
<p><strong>Undine:</strong> I live too long. Besides, my <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-climb">child</a> shares blood with your kind. But truly, what would you do if you saw a moth tapping at a window looking for an escape?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Dalton:</strong> I’d <em>ignore</em> it.</p>
<p><strong>Undine:</strong> I would open the window.</p>
</div>
<p>After validating the designs of what became Exodus-9, it was ruled that no apparent alternatives were available, thus construction of the craft commenced. Emergent technologies not understood by the Foundation were elaborated on via Undine’s guidance after dimensional-biosecurity and the confirmation of the O5 Council allowed it.</p>
<p>Such technologies included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter-Fold Stabilisers</li>
<li>Corner-Fold Stabilisers</li>
<li>Impulse-Based propulsion system based upon inverted hume particles</li>
<li>An advanced navigational system and array capable of visualising geometric and non-existent spatial environments for human comprehension.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exodus-9 During Construction</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the Undine professed that it did have the capacity to enter <em>'corner spaces,'</em> as observed by its manifestation, hence saving itself from the destruction of the Universe, it elaborated that the Foundation would not survive the environment beyond, nor would it be welcomed by its peers; furthermore, rouge attempts by members of the Foundation and the Serpents Hand to enter resulted in their loss. We are unable to verify what has happened to these insurgents, although the Undine stated that they no longer exist.</p>
<p>The resources needed to construct Exodus-9 exhausted or cannibalised near all remaining resources on Earth. A full report of Exodus-9 design and construction is available upon request.</p>
<p>During construction, a protocol to preserve human culture was implemented; the foundation database, a recording of the internet and the total archive of Human Arts &amp; Film were preserved, as well as various flora and fauna genetically stored and raised within in-house botanical decks.</p>
<p>SCP objects worthwhile for transportation, partially those of productive use to the Foundation and survival of humanity, were considered for storage. Exodus-9 would be capable of preserving and studying new phenomena for its journey and ultimate arrival in a new Universe.</p>
<p>The total capacity of Exodus-9 included 2000 humans, with space to allow almost 3000 individuals during the expected procreation to take place over the journey. Whilst 75% of that capacity was devoted to Foundation personnel, a declaration was set across the globe under the authority of the Ethics Committee to save as many civilians as feasible.</p>

<p>To the People of Earth, we open a heavy hand and summon all available survivors to reach the geographical points listed below.

<p>The SCP Foundation</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>At this stage, 88% of the Earth had become an instance of SCP-9109. Projections estimated that the known universe had been reduced by 97%. A total ZK-Class scenario was confirmed. By 25/12/██25, all attempts to rescue the surviving population of Earth ceased with a total complement of 2168 onboard Exodus-9. Under the direction of Undine, Exodus-9 began its evacuation as the remains of the Universe became an instance of SCP-9109.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Universe was declared non-existent. On 26/12/██25 a vigil was held for the Universe and those lost.</p>
<p>Psychologists reported widespread tension across the ship, particularly amongst the civilian population. Reports of ‘invisible’ or ‘black’ eyes watching ‘from the void’ via viewports generally persisted amongst all crew. As previously written, nightmares of darkness and illogical geometry persisted. Undine gave notice to the crew in regards to this:</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<div class="email">
<div class="tofrom">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Paranoia &amp; Dreams</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Beyond the obvious tension of your being here, I think it probable that your minds reject the possibility of the total absence of anything. It is instinctual and I theorise that you will adapt to the circumstances. There is no alternative, unless you desire to spend your journey panicking at every corner. You may be animals, but do not let that limitation defeat you.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>The Undine</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>In private, the Undine advised seniors, Dir. Dalton included, that its people tell stories of a 'non-consciousness' in the non-spaces between universes. Indeed, the Department of Colour held speculation of such 'non-light lifeforms', although before this was a simple theoretical bogeyman. The Undine confided that the Foundation have little to worry, claiming 'you are too small to be worth the trouble.' When shown initial explorative footage of the void from Site-109, the Undine indeed confirmed it saw a face within it.</p>
<p>The Foundation itself underwent temporary reconfiguration in order to maintain structure, and to allow departmental skills to be directed to the Exodus-9 mission for a habitable parallel Universe.</p>
<p>In the interim, non-essential personnel are able to go into stasis, if they so desire. All Foundation members are expected to continue essential work for the preservation of Humanity, Exodus-9 and the mission: Secure, Contain &amp; Project our future.</p>
<p>On 01/06/██26, Undine requested a meeting with Director Dalton. The entity had not been seen for approximately three days and appeared visibly altered; its torso pulsed strangely, and the entity appeared reluctant to move. During this meeting the Undine announced that it was pregnant. Undine detailed that its species is capable of asexual reproduction, and that it was surprised by the unexpected pregnancy due its age.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The revelation was met with initial speculation, however neurological scans confirm the presence of a secondary neurological formation developing within the Undine. It was then that Undine announced that it would be leaving Exodus-9 and leave the mission within the hands of humanity. Further, it declared that it would specially engineer its unborn infant, although it remains unknown what it meant as it refused to elaborate.</p>
<p>A formal celebration was held aboard Exodus-9 to honour Undine’s service. The event took place in the vessel’s central atrium. A specially curated catalogue of Earth’s culture was projected across the walls, including a reading of Hans Christian Anderson’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, a professed favourite of the Undine.</p>
<p>Director Dalton delivered a closing address:</p>
<hr/>
<div class="email">
<div class="tofrom">
<p><strong>Transcription:</strong></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Undine gave us escape. But more than that, they gave us continuity. With the end of one way of life, they offered another. We do not know what comes next. But we know it begins here. The journey home will be long, but we would not have made it without their assistance.</p>
<p>Alright, alright. Enough talking. The next round is on me.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Whilst giving thanks in private to Dir. Dalton, Undine suddenly collapsed and began to convulse. Light began to emit from various wounds forming on its left side. Moments later, birth had occurred: another infantile selkie split from Undine’s flesh in a process similar to that of cellular mitosis. Undine was non-responsive as their offspring, hence Undine-2, greeted those present around it via telepathic communication. Undine-2 assured personnel that the original Undine was 'operational,' and required time to recover. The infant Undine-2 tended to Undine for the following week, upon which Undine emerged and organised its farewell.</p>
<p>12 days later, Undine gathered those it counted amongst its friends and informed them that Undine-2 shall remain in its stead. After some closing remarks, Undine approached the nearest corner and opened another rift with the same Prism it held before and entered it. Undine-2, romantically recorded as the first child born on Exodus-9, continues its parents work without issue, seemingly possessing the collective knowledge of its predecessor, though is frequently described as more jovial in demeanour.</p>
<p>The mission of Exodus-9 continues, with no clear estimate as to when a viable Universe will be discovered. Whilst many universes have been discovered, none are viable for prolonged human life.</p>
<p>As of writing, it has been four years since the journey began. Undine-2 furthers our progress by instructing Foundation engineers on how to improve systems and gain an even greater understanding of its fundamental sciences.</p>
<p>We continue to observe and hope for the best.</p>
