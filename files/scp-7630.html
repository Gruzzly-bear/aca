</div>
<hr/>
<p>All live instances of SCP-7630 are to be held in Biological Containment Chamber 25-C in Wing-G of Site-39. Personnel interacting with instances of SCP-7630 or infected patients must follow Class-B (BSL-3) HAZMAT/biosafety procedures.</p>
<p>Currently, no known instances of SCP-7630 exist outside of Foundation containment. However, in the event of a widespread breach, Emergency Response Command Team Theta-5 is to immediately attempt to contain the breach and decontaminate all affected areas.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc1"><span><tt><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></tt></span></h3>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-7630 is a small parasitic organism, resembling a box jellyfish. The organism primarily targets human hosts, entering the body through the nose or mouth. SCP-7630 resides within the brain of its host, placing its "arms" around the temporal and parietal lobes. The parasite consumes the host's cerebrospinal fluid and gray matter, causing amnesia and confusion, and eventually brain death. Once infected, SCP-7630 cannot be removed by surgical means, as doing so would fatally damage the host's brain. After approximately 1-2 days post-infection, SCP-7630 will lay its eggs within the spinal cord and neck. SCP-7630 eggs can be spread via bodily fluids and airborne particles. The host will enter a comatose state after 2-4 days, and typically dies after 3-5 days.</p>
<p>SCP-7630 is able to generate electrical charges in the brain using its "arms", allowing it to communicate with its human host. Subjects infected by SCP-7630 describe a voice speaking to them inside their own heads. See <strong>ADDENDA</strong> for more information.</p>

<p>On 2026/02/04, Dr. Emily Rossella was infected with an instance of SCP-7630 during a laboratory accident. She immediately fell unconscious and was moved to Site-39's hospital wing. The following transcript of a medical examination conducted by Dr. Alexander Lambert was recorded the next day.</p>

<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> Can you understand what it's saying?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Not really. It's getting clearer, but… I'll tell you when I start hearing it. I've got some… stuff I want to test.</p>
<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> Are you sure? You don't have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> I— no, no, yeah, I'm sure. There's, well… no better opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> I appreciate your dedication, Emily.</p>

<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> I can't. I'm sorry. <em>[Pauses.]</em> I— I told you last time.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Did you? Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> No. <em>[Pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LAMBERT:</strong> <em>[Smiles.]</em> I'll be here if you need me. <em>[Pauses.]</em> I'll be here.</p>

<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Sorry for— for getting mad last time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> No. Don't be.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> You know, Isabella and I used to lay in bed and talk like this together. Before, well…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Was it nice?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> It was the best. She used to talk about her friends at school, and her books, and… some other stuff, I guess, and I used to bore her with biology lessons. <em>[Laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I’m sorry you… have to deal with me instead.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> It’s fine.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Do you think Alex will let me see Isabella before… before I go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I… only know as much as you. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> I think that sometimes I think he's a bit of a dick, you know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> I thought you knew as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> You don't think he's trying hard enough? You think he owes that to you?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> I'm not selfish, but… you'd think he could at least <em>try</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> He doesn't know what he's doing, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I mean that he's never done this before. He's seen people die before, sure, but not… you know, a <em>friend</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> You think he's a friend?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Hey, I only know as much as you.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> I suppose you're right.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Well, given my analysis of all your thoughts and memories…</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I think you did one hell of a good job as a mother, given your… <em>situation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> You really think that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I only know as much as you. You're a mother. You judge yourself too harshly.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Since when did you become a psychologist?</p>
<p><em>[Silence. Quiet sobbing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Do you think she'll still love me? I don't want her to hate me, I don't…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> I think she's going to resent you.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> But I know she'll still love you. When she grows up she'll understand.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> <em>[In between gasps.]</em> How? She— she doesn't know— know any of this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Truth finds a way.</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> You know that's not true.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7630:</strong> Hopeful optimism?</p>
<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Hope— hopeful optimism.</p>

<p><em>[Visible via the GANOP is an inky black void, in which ROSSELLA floats. She is wearing a blue dress. A blue jellyfish hovers beside her, periodically expanding and contracting its bell. At ROSSELLA's feet, a <a href="/nothing">white cloud</a> begins to form, small at first but rapidly expanding.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Slowly, the cloud begins to transform into a small room, similar in appearance to a child's bedroom. A pink bed lies in one corner while the other is decorated with pictures and drawings of various animals, mostly elephants. In the center of the room stands a small girl, no older than ten, wearing a similar blue dress as ROSSELLA's.]</em></p>

<p><strong>ROSSELLA:</strong> Mommy was working, sweetie. She was working. But mommy's back now.</p>
