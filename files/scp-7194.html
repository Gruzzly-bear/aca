<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7194 is to be contained in a climate-controlled ant terrarium at Site-19. Unless in an emergency, Dr. Alejandra Vásquez is to be the sole caretaker and communicator with the ant colony. All interactions must be recorded via CCTV surveillance cameras and must be reviewed by Site-19 personnel for analysis. Regular inspections of the terrarium are to be conducted to ensure containment integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7194 is a colony of approximately 3000 ants belonging to the species <em>Linepithema humile</em> (Argentine Ant), first discovered in the residence of Dr. Alejandra Vásquez. SCP-7194 ants exhibit sapience and heightened cognitive abilities, as well as the capability to communicate verbally in English. Despite these abilities, they remain physiologically identical to regular ants of their species. It is not clear how or when this sapience developed, as the colony had been observed to exist for several months before any anomalous behavior was noted.</p>
<p>SCP-7194 has developed a religious culture based on the worship of Dr. Alejandra Vásquez as its principal deity, often performing rituals and chants centered on her. SCP-7194 instances have been observed constructing miniature altars using small twigs, leaves, and grains of sand. These altars are adorned with offerings of various small food items.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> And so, my sisters. We are here together in this occasion, to thank the all knowing one for her gifts. For she has blessed us once again. We must unite and ask for forgiveness so our sins may cleansed and our souls saved. Alejandra!</p>
<p><em>SCP-7194 instances begin chanting in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194</strong> ALEJANDRA! ALEJANDRA! ALEJANDRA!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Vásquez leans towards the table</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Hello? What's going on here?</p>
<p><em>The ants cease their activities and turn their attention to Dr. Alejandra Vásquez. All the ants scream in surprise. Most begin talking amongst themselves in excitement and nervousness, while some begin running around in a panic.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194</strong> Oh my All-Knowing One, Oh my All-Knowing One. It's happening, IT'S HAPPENING. Everybody, everybody calm down. Pay attention. Everybody-I.</p>
<p><em>Rest of the ants are awestruck and unable to compose themselves</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> I said, EVERYBODY, STOP. SHUSH. SHUT UP. PAY ATTENTION.</p>
<p><em>Each ant promptly ceases vocalization.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong>My brethren! The All-Mighty One has heard our pleas and has blessed us with their presence. ALEJANDRA!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> What… in the world. How… Do you know my name? Wait, what am I saying? YOU CAN TALK!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> Alejandra! Yes! We know your name, for we have called for so long. We had faith in you and you have rewarded us for you have come! You are the great one, the bringer of sustenance!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> B-bringer of sus- sustenance? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><em>Several ants step forward, carrying bread crumbs and sugar granules.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> We venerate you, Alejandra! You provide for us, and we are in your debt!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Is that my sandwich from yesterday? Ohhh crap… so it really wasn’t my boyfriend after all.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Vásquez sits down on the chair closest to the ants</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Wait, so you’re… worshiping me?</p>
<p><em>Ant begins nodding fervently</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> Yes, Alejandra! You are our deity, our protector! We are but humble creatures in your presence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Okay, this is certainly unexpected. Right, let’s see… you have summoned and I have heard your pleas. Now, what do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> We beseech you, O Great Alejandra, we request sustenance and safety for our colony. In return, we offer our devotion and service.</p>
<p><em>Another ant steps forward, carrying a singular sugar granule. It raises it above its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> More of this, pretty pleaaaase?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Oh right, should’ve known. More sugar?</p>
<p><em>The SCP-7194 instance begins nodding vigorously</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7194:</strong> Yes, Great Alejandra! For this “sugar” thing is the nectar of the gods!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Well, I suppose I can spare some sugar for my devoted subjects. Now, be a sugar and ya'll stay, riiight there.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Dr. Alejandra Vásquez subsequently provided the ants with a small offering of sugar, which was met with exuberant gratitude. SCP-7194 continues to venerate her a deity, and she provides them with sugar as requested.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Immediately after first encountering SCP-7194, Dr. Vásquez contacted the Foundation, informing them of the anomaly by sending the security footage, and requesting assistance with its containment. The following is the transcript of a phone conversation between Dr. Alejandoa Vásquez and Dr. Jensen Carter.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Jeez, relax dude I’m fine. I’m still at home. A little thing popped up. Or… a couple of little things. Did I say a couple? Cuz I meant hundreds. Did I say hundreds, my bad actually I meant THOUSANDS of tiny little itty bitty–</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Get to the point Ale.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> There’s an anomaly at my house.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Wh-what what now? An anomaly!?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Did I say <em>an</em> anomaly, I meant-</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> I am going to strangle you through the cord line <em>with</em> the cordline. Don’t ask me HOW, but I will.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Listen, It’s fine. They seem perfectly harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> They?? Who are <em>they?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Ants.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> ….Ants?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Yeah, they’re ants! Just a bunch of them, all over the place. They’re sentient! All of them, they talked to me, they’re worshiping me as their god. That’s about it, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> …..</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Well!? I got to the point, like you asked me to. Say something!</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Now, I hope this comes off the right way..</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Are you <em>sure</em> you’re feeling alright?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Yes! I’m fine, they’re real, and I have footage. I’m sending it over as we speak. I told them to wait and don't think they’re going anywhere, but I really think you guys should come over as soon as possible just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Hahah.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> It's nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Spit it out boy.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Oh come on! That was a good one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> You know, you won’t be able to strangle me if I beat you to it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr: Carter:</strong> Oop.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter leaves the call.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Yeah, that’s what I thought. Run while you still can.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well, well, if it isn't our resident deity. The Certified Ant Queen! All too important for the common workday I see. I guess the rest of us must bow down to your greatness.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Oh, shush Jen. You’ve got a brain the size of an ant, we both know that had it happened to you it would’ve gone to your head just like any miniscule taste of power always has.</p>
<p><strong>Dr carter:</strong> What will you do about it? Will you throw me in the ant dungeon? Cuz I don’t appreciate it when you… <em>ant</em>agonize me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Bold thing to say for someone in a strangling distance.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, but you can’t have these if you strangle me.</p>
<p><em>Dr Carter raises the transporters in a showing manner.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Is that the transport?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah. It’s actually nothing fancy, just pretty standard ant stuff, they’re just glorified transparent boxes. We actually had to stop by a pet store on the way. See this red filter here covering the walls? It blocks their vision to the outside but still allows us to look in. That should help keep them calm during the transfer. They can’t see more than like a foot away anyways though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Well, I better go do that. Stay here, your face might scare them off.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter</strong> Ha. Ha.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Yes, Jen?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Am I going crazy or are those ants doing The Macarena?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> Uhm…. Definitely the former.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter starts smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> That face, I know that face. Don’t you dare, don’t you even <em>think</em> about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Carter:</strong> You and your <em>ant</em>ics.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Vásquez:</strong> I <em>hate</em> you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Carter:</strong> Hate you too, bud.</p>
