<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8715 is a 1.23-litre, black ceramic vase of indeterminate origin. When any liquid is introduced into the object, it is anomalously diminished at a rate inconsistent with any known form of natural evaporation or absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its perceived harmlessness and negligible anomalous properties, SCP-8715 is currently permitted to remain in the common area as directed by Site-94's administrative authority.</p>
<p>For experimental data regarding SCP-8715's behaviour with various fluids, refer to Test Log 8715.</p>

<p><strong>Item Number: SCP-8715</strong></p>
<p><strong>Object Class: Keter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>A mundane vase is to be placed upon a stand in the centre of SCP-8715's containment chamber in Site-94. The object is to receive 500 mL of water three times per day at evenly spaced intervals.</p>
<p>Only personnel with Level-2 clearance and below, and Level-5 personnel and above are allowed to perform this action. Individuals with Level 3 or Level 4 clearance are not permitted to access the containment chamber.</p>
<p>Upon comprehension of this information, one is forbidden from being in the vicinity of SCP-8715's containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8715 is an invisible, selectively corporeal humanoid entity currently residing inside Site-94's lower mess hall. Attempts at communication with the entity have been not only unsuccessful, but detrimental to its containment.</p>
<p>Preliminary assessments by the Department of Spectral Affairs suggest SCP-8715 shares attributes with a Dybbuk<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SCP-8715 exhibits a strong cognitohazardous effect. When perceived, acknowledged, or conceptualised within its immediate spatial radius (estimated minimum: ██sqm), the entity manifests, targets the observer, and initiates a persistent predatory fixation. No subjects targeted by SCP-8715 have survived to date.</p>
<p>To mitigate this hazard, all internal records and awareness of SCP-8715’s true nature are to be replaced with benign object data (i.e., the description of a mundane vase) to prevent possession. The decoy object was selected for its innocuous appearance and its ability to contain water, which appears to satiate SCP-8715.</p>

<p><strong>Object Class: Thaumiel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>A mundane vase is to be placed upon a stand in the centre of Site-94's mess hall for Level 2 staff and below. The object is to receive 500 mL of water three times per day at evenly spaced intervals.</p>
<p>Only personnel with Level-2 clearance and below, and Level-5 personnel and above are allowed to perform this action. Individuals with Level 3 or Level 4 clearance are not permitted to access the vase in order to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>Only the acting Site Director of Site-94 and its leadership staff are allowed to comprehend the following information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8715 is an invisible, selectively corporeal humanoid entity currently residing within the confines of Site-94. The entity appears to be unable, or unwilling to leave the facility on its own. Attempts at communication with the entity have been not only unsuccessful, but detrimental to its containment.</p>
<p>Based on observations, it is suspected that SCP-8715 is a kind of genius loci<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, specifically an Ifrit<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Analysis by forensic technicians of the Department of Spectral Affairs supports this theory.</p>
<p>The entity exhibits a strong cognitohazardous effect. When perceived, acknowledged, or conceptualised, the entity manifests, targets the observer, and initiates a persistent predatory fixation.</p>
<p>SCP-8715's presence has been observed to significantly mitigate the effects of other spectral entities within Site-94. Given its effectiveness and the reduced operational cost compared to standard Foundation countermeasures, SCP-8715 has been authorised for use as a passive containment and defensive measure at the site.</p>
<p>It has been advised, however, due to SCP-8715’s cognitohazardous properties, all documentation and references to SCP-8715 are to be replaced with analogous information pertaining to a non-anomalous object. This protocol is intended to obscure the entity’s true nature and prevent unintended exposure.</p>
<p>SCP-8715 requires periodic offerings and the presence of servitors to maintain a passive state. The current containment ritual includes the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>A life-associated liquid must be provided at regular intervals to satisfy SCP-8715’s apparent need for vital essence. A ceramic vase, selected for its inconspicuous appearance and capacity to retain fluid, has been designated for this purpose. Water was determined to be the most logistically and economically viable substitute.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who comprehend the preceding information will have been noticed by SCP-8715, resulting in indentured servitude to the entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We warmly welcome you to Site-94.</p>

<p>WARNING: The following document is cognitohazardous and infohazardous. Unauthorised comprehension may result in unnecessary harm to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Item Number: SCP-8715</strong></p>
<p><strong>Object Class: Thaumiel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>Avoidance of this documentation is integral to SCP-8715’s containment. If engagement with the contents of this file is unavoidable, immediate administration of amnestics upon completion is mandatory. In cases where amnesticisation is not feasible, voluntary or Foundation-assisted euthanasia is considered the most viable containment alternative. Personnel without specific clearance or purpose should discontinue access to this file.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8715 is a cognitohazardous, infohazardous, selectively corporeal, and invisible anomalous entity currently localized within Site-94. The entity is non-transient and displays no capability or intent to exit the site perimeter. Attempts at communication with the entity have been not only unsuccessful, but detrimental to its containment.</p>
<p>SCP-8715 is theorised to be a thoughtform, whose manifested characteristics are shaped directly by the perceptions and mental constructs of observers. The potential danger posed by the entity correlates positively with the number of individuals possessing accurate knowledge of its nature or form. Subjects exposed to such comprehension become targeted by SCP-8715; the exact mechanism and consequences of this predation remain under investigation.</p>
<p>However, it is to be noted that SCP-8715 functions as a deterrent to spectral entities within Site-94, exerting a dominant territorial influence akin to a major genius loci. In comparison to conventional Foundation methods for managing spectral threats, SCP-8715 has proven markedly more efficient in both efficacy and cost. As such, controlled utilisation of SCP-8715 as a defensive and containment asset has been authorized under strict procedural constraints.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Maya Protocol:</span></strong></p>
<p>To harness SCP-8715’s capabilities while mitigating associated risks, the following structured cognitive and ritual containment system has been instituted:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Conceptual Anchoring:</strong> SCP-8715 is to be consistently conceptualized as an entity consistent with Abrahamic occult frameworks. The selected cognitive anchor will be that of an Ifrit, based on behavioral patterns suggestive of territoriality and elemental hostility.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Binding Measures:</strong> Once SCP-8715 is anchored to the aforementioned conceptual framework, it is subjected to containment conditions modeled after traditional occult practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>A symbolic offering of “life-force” is to be made at regular intervals. For cost and logistic efficiency, water has been designated a viable proxy for life-sustaining fluid, to be presented in an appropriate vessel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The entity is to be granted servitors to tend to its whims as this is the most cost-effective method to appease it and diminish harm to personnel. To reduce the amount of individuals comprehending the entity in this form whilst having containment efforts kept in order, only senior administrative personnel (e.g., Site-94 leadership) are to assume these roles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In exchange, SCP-8715 is to exert control over all spectral anomalies within Site-94 and act as a localised defensive force against internal and external threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) <strong>Cognitive Obfuscation:</strong> To reduce risk of hazardous conceptualisation among broader Site-94 personnel, a false narrative has been distributed referencing a mundane object. The majority of staff are to remain unaware of SCP-8715's nature. Level 3 personnel, however, are to be provided information to visualise the entity as a lesser form to limit the risk of intensified manifestation as we as to maintain order in the site.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance Notice:</strong><br/>
In accordance with the cognitohazard mitigation directive, amnesticisation is mandatory upon full comprehension of this document. Failure to comply constitutes a breach of containment protocols.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
