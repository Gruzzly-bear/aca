<p>SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5378</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B were kept in a small enclosure with soil, rocks and various flora. They were fed four raisins per day, and had their container cleaned every week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5378 is the designation for two sapient ladybird beetles,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> which are referred to as SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B. Both instances constructed miniaturized versions of manmade structures and objects using natural materials, such as leaves, rocks, and dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Below is a list of every recorded structure built by SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B, as well as the context of their creation.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Structure Created</th>
<th>Context</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A small tent comprised of two propped-up Rose leaves.</td>
<td>SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B had just been contained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A sleeping bag made of leaf petioles sown together.</td>
<td>SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B appear to "sleep" together within the sleeping bag for eight hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A separate sleeping bag.</td>
<td>After climbing around the enclosure in what is assumed to be an escape attempt, SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B meet outside the tent. They start making harsh buzzing noises at each other. After the altercation, SCP-5378-A makes its own sleeping bag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two two-story cabins.</td>
<td>Probably a result of the former incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A letter etched onto a woodchip.</td>
<td>After nine months since the cabins were created, SCP-5378-A gives the letter to SCP-5378-B at its doorstep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A bench made of twigs held together by twine.</td>
<td>SCP-5378-B slowly walks out of its cabin towards SCP-5378-A's cabin. It taps on the door. When SCP-5378-A comes out, they build the bench and sit next to each other. After an altercation consisting of quiet buzzes, they touch their forelimbs together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A heart.</td>
<td>SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B combine two leaves into the shape of a heart on the enclosure floor. They both lay in the middle of the heart sideways, holding each other's limbs.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>After SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B were observed to be unmoving for several hours, they were removed from their enclosure. It was confirmed that SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B had expired, most likely due to old age.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Below is the letter mentioned in Addendum 1. It was put under a microscope for comprehensiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello my sweet Rose,</p>
<p>My limbs are aching, and the world around me spins uncontrollably. I think this is the end.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about the altercation we had long ago. Our jailing here wasn't your fault, and I should have been less harsh.</p>
<p>Without you, I have been mournful. I miss your touch, and the fluttering of your wings ringing through my ears. I miss traversing through the blue skies with you at my side. Wherever we were, you made it all the better.</p>
<p>I figured since we are taking our last breaths, we might as well take them together. We shouldn't have to die in isolation.</p>
<p>Please. Let's talk.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Harold</p>
