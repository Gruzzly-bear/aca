            <h1>SCP-4718</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Information suppression and alteration procedures are of particular importance to containment due to the fact that SCP-4718 has only been partially hidden from the general public. To this end, information establishing SCP-4718 as non-anomalous is to be disseminated, and the hypothesis that natural calving and melting resulted in its destruction at a point prior to the 21st century is to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>The Foundation submarine <em>SCPF Ymir</em> is to patrol the area of the North Atlantic Ocean which contains SCP-4718 and enforce a 2km exclusion zone under the cover of a drilling rig operation rendering the area restricted and potentially hazardous to approach. Testing on SCP-4718-A is to be performed by voluntarily participating Level 2 <em>Ymir</em> crew members equipped with SCUBA suits which leave at least one extremity uncovered. Outside of testing, unprotected skin contact with SCP-4718-A is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4718 is an artificial device of unknown origin, located in the North Atlantic Ocean and at rest on the seabed at a depth of 3.5 km. Externally, SCP-4718 has the appearance of a pinnacle iceberg; however, chemical testing has determined SCP-4718 to be composed primarily of a translucent silicate substance with high tensile strength and heat-absorbent properties. Six layers of this material, each with an average thickness of ~5cm, compose the exterior section of SCP-4718.</p>
<p>An area near the base of SCP-4718 is heavily damaged by a severe planar fracture, allowing access to the interior of SCP-4718. The object is partially hollow; the majority of its inner cavity is occupied by a complex lattice of refined iron, silicon and niobium, which is engraved with indecipherable symbols. This structure is designated SCP-4718-A.</p>
<p>SCP-4718-A is conjectured to function as a combination of an internal support system for SCP-4718, preventing the object from imploding due to the pressure of the surrounding water, and a <strong>[<tt>REDACTED</tt>]</strong>.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>In addition to serving as an internal support system, SCP-4718-A functions as an anomalous data bank capable of storing information in an unknown medium. It presently contains data from a similarly unknown source.</p>
<p>Although it is evidently impossible to insert information for storage, any sapient organism is capable of accessing the data already stored in SCP-4718-A through unobstructed skin contact. This data is directly implanted in the brain, manifesting as a series of disjointed but consistent concepts, stimuli and mental images. On account of its mentally invasive nature, the experience of interfacing with SCP-4718-A often causes distress to test subjects.</p>
<p>An interview with a subject exposed to SCP-4718-A, referred to as S-4718-7, may be found below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> S-4718-7</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Wilson</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> S-4718-7 displayed the highest level of comprehension of the concepts imparted by SCP-4718-A among his testing group, and was deemed the most suitable candidate for further research.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Please describe what you experienced when you touched the object.</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Right, uh… I saw… no, it wasn’t so much “seeing” as it was… <em>(pauses)</em> feeling. Or thinking, but not really thinking. Like thinking the thoughts and feeling the feelings of something that wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Yes, that’s consistent with the accounts of the other test subjects. What exactly do you remember feeling?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> There was… there were a lot of feelings. But I noticed this, I don’t know, common thread. This common thread through the whole thing of… distance, and separation, but willing separation. Almost felt like I was on vacation, or a journey. Something like that. I’m not really doing it justice, the feeling of distance. I was ridiculously far from home, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> I assume you refer to yourself experiencing these feelings so you can relate them more easily?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that’s it. Felt like something else’s brain had gone into mine… it’s weird to remember, like I’m going through it all over again. But anyway, the next thing I remember feeling was like I was having fun. Like I was enjoying the vacation. I keep calling it that, but I don’t think that’s what it really was, it’s just… closest. There was this… vastness, everywhere. Maybe the Pacific Ocean around the thing. I don’t think there was a word for it, like it was filtered through the things I was feeling. There might not be oceans where the skip came from, or maybe they’re different. I remember feeling like I was seeing the ocean for the first time, and liking it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> So you experienced a cohesive timeline of events, then?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> I did, yeah. Kinda like watching a movie, except I was in… no, more like the movie was in me, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> I understand. What did you experience next?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> There was a while where it was just the distance, and the ocean, and not much else. It was pretty peaceful, but then I saw… man, I keep saying I saw things, but I don’t think they see like we do. It’s all feeling with them. I felt something big coming.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Something big?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Yeah. That’s the best way I can think to describe it. I feel like it was another human thing, but filtered through the skip’s way of seeing stuff, like the ocean. It was coming closer pretty fast, and…</p>
<p><em>(Subject struggles to speak.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Uh… yeah. I’m fine. The next bit was just kind of complicated and I’m not sure I got all of it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> It’s quite alright. Please continue to the best of your ability.</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Okay. So, there was this huge… thing, bearing down on me. But I wasn’t scared at all. I had… I’m not sure. Faith, or… like, total confidence. Or both. I felt like I was unstoppable and I didn’t even need to get out of the way. I feel like there’s a word for it… it’ll come to me eventually, probably.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Go on.</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Uh huh. So what happened after that was… probably the clearest part, and…</p>
<p><em>(Subject ceases to speak, rubbing his forehead with one knuckle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> What is the-</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> I’m fine. I’m okay, it just… it hit me right after that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> The large object?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that. It hit me and… something cracked, everything cracked. My… my mind cracked. My feelings cracked. The cold was coming in everywhere and I just… I couldn’t believe it, I <em>couldn’t,</em> I was unstoppable. How did it happen? I don’t get it. The vastness, the… ocean… it started hurting, because I knew I was going under it and I wouldn’t ever come up, everything started hurting. <em>(speaking quickly)</em> Even the distance started hurting me because I couldn’t ever go back now. It was all so… so awful. I was dying, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> I understand that the experience was overwhelming, but please try to stay calm. What did you experience after that?</p>
<p><strong>S-4718-7:</strong> The cold… it was everywhere. Everything. It became me, and… I just remember being confused as everything went away. It was supposed to be… it was supposed to be unsinkable… <em>(sobs)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Please, try to maintain your composure. Did the experience end after that?</p>
<p><em>(S-4718-7 does not respond, and continues to weep. Further inquiries are ineffectual.)</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> It is assumed that the received information ceased after this point, as the subject did not speak further after regaining his composure and was escorted out of the interview room without incident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available evidence strongly suggests that a collision with an oceanic object or sea vessel caused the present amount of damage to SCP-4718 and resulted in its sinking. Additionally, unusual Hume readings adjacent to and directly surrounding SCP-4718 strongly suggest that it is of extrauniversal or extradimensional origin.</p>
