            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5827</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5827 is to be contained within a humanoid containment cell at Site-39. The cell is to be lined with 20 cm of concrete with the density enhanced by the inclusion of minimum 33% lead pellets by volume. Present research does not predict the type or rate of SCP-5827's radiation emission; therefore, personnel must follow Class 3-Omicron radioactive source safety procedures when in the vicinity of the cell. Solid or liquid material removed from the cell is to be treated with precautions appropriate to medium-level radioactive waste.</p>
<p>SCP-5827 is to be provided with reading material from the Site-39 library on request, with the mass not to exceed 10 kg or more than 4 books per month. Higher masses may be authorized by the supervising researcher in consultation with Site Psychiatry. SCP-5827 is not to be provided with any additional electronic devices.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A Self Portrait of SCP-5827</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5827 is a solid, condensed nebula with the physical appearance of a 12-year-old human female; it is 138 cm tall and weighs 29.4 kg. SCP-5827's body is composed of a translucent gray matter which illuminates its immediate surroundings. Despite being visible to the human eye, SCP-5827 is unable to appear in photography.</p>
<p>SCP-5827’s secondary property is the ability to move and create stars outside of Earth's solar system. This causes SCP-5827 to produce outbursts of up to 3⋅10<sup>22</sup> neutrons within one second. During an outburst, radiation constantly discharges out of SCP-5827's body at a rate of 3⋅10<sup>19</sup> neutrons per second on average. SCP-5827’s neutron bursts often spike if SCP-5827 reads more than its allotted amount due to the creative nature of SCP-5827.</p>
<p>The earliest documents related to SCP-5827 date back to the 4th century BC. In these documents, SCP-5827 is depicted as a young child possessing the same properties it does currently. Historical records indicate SCP-5827 was known as "Nebula.”</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5827-1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following is not a formal Interview with SCP-5827. <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5097">Junior Researcher Kassidy Kara</a> started a conversation with SCP-5827 on January 27th after complaints from SCP-5827 about recurring pain.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Do you want to see the books I got?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Sure! What type of books have you been reading recently?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> I read a few journals… They’re nice because they talk about the world and the writer's life.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Yeah, journals are very fun to read. Did you know that I keep a journal?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Really? Is it fun to write? <em>(It sits up, cocking its head to its right.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> <em>(They giggle.)</em> You could say that. What other types of books do you like to read?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> I read some of the science ones, but a few of the words are too hard.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Yeah, I had that issue too when I was first starting out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> How did you get past it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> I had some people to help me, and I practiced a lot.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> <em>(It gasps.)</em> Could you help me soon?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> <em>(Nods.)</em> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Um… Can I talk to you about something, Dr. Kara? <em>(It pauses, taking a second to see a reaction.)</em> Sometimes, my head starts to hurt and I feel like… I need to move the stars.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> My head feels like it's gonna explode when I do. It never used to do this when I was free.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Oh… What did you do when you were free?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> I would create things. Stars, they are always very pretty. I loved looking at them. So I created more. Those stars create planets and other really pretty things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> So you would make things that were pretty?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Yeah! It's like, uh, creating things. Like writing or drawing, it's fun. But, sometimes they beg me to see them again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> That’s cool, I enjoy looking at the stars too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> I just need to help them… My body hurts when I try.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> I know. I’ll try to work something out for you, is that alright Nebula?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> <em>(It nods, smiling at Dr. Kara.)</em> Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-5827 continues to express pain when its radiation is present. Currently there is no plan to research the effects of SCP-5827 on the outside world despite previous proposals.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear Journal,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Doctor Kara is a kind person. Although, they can’t stop feeling like they're talking to a ten-year-old. They’ve read my file and know that I’m over 800,000, but it still feels weird. It’s very understandable, since I’m very very young even for a star. They’re always super kind when they hang out with me. They even got me this journal! Unfortunately, they go somewhere else after April, some sort of Junior Researcher rotation or something. I dislike it because they’ve been so nice.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
But I worry about them… Doctor Kara is stressing out about a lot. They have a girlfriend who's going through a rough time with the Foundation. I hope they work it out. It would suck to have that type of thing happen.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I recently asked them about it, and they acted surprised and asked me how I knew. We were both surprised, since I didn't know how I knew that. I just did?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Anyway, it's kind of lonely in containment. I miss the stars, I don’t even get to see them anymore. They pull me to them, but every time I try to play with them or give them more friends my room gets all hot and my body feels like it's being torn apart. It's not fun.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Lights out! Night night journal, sleep good.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Follow-up on SCP-5827's complaints that pain has gotten worse in the last month from.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Nebula, can I ask you a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Hi Dr. Kara!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> <em>(They pull out a laminated pain chart.)</em> What number would you say is the pain you feel right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> <em>(It puts its left hand to its cheek.)</em> Uhh, a three.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Alright, that's bearable. <em>(They frown and look at their notes.)</em> So when you try to move the stars and can’t, what number is it then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> 10. It hurts. <em>(It shakes its head looking down, tears welling in its eyes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Hmm, where does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Everywhere, but my head hurts the worst.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Alright, how often does this happen?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> A lot. The stars need me… <em>(Its nose starts dripping glowing blood. It notices and starts wailing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kara:</strong> Oh! Ok, ok. Let's get you cleaned up. It's going to be ok. <em>(They stand up to help SCP-5827.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5827:</strong> Ok… <em>(It stands up as it starts crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-5827 continues to express extreme pain while experiencing its properties. SCP-5827 has not been observed to bleed before; this bleeding has continued from its nose, mouth, ears, eyes, and palms. Site psychiatry and medical staff have been investigating possible solutions.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear Journal,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I’m so tired… It's really hot in my room, but I haven’t been trying to make stars. I haven't seen many people around recently. The stars need me. They need something…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I started bleeding again… I have to go clean up.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Ok. I’m back. Things have been stupid. I don’t like reading anymore… I can’t focus on anything but my body breaking. The stars want me back. I’m not doing my job.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I always thought I was going to go to the beach or Japan or some pretty place. I think they want me back. I miss them so much, but I can’t get to them. Time feels like it's stopped, this isn’t fun anymore. I really want out. They still don’t know how to help me, but they think this is something that just happens. I can’t read anymore.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I’m sorry Journal, I can’t stay up much longer. I’m very sorry.</span></p>

Dear Journal,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
They started to allow me nightly visits to the courtyard. I’m very tired still, but I can see the stars again! They missed me so much they came down to me!!! I played with them, and started working on some new friends for them!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Anyway, that granted me a sketch book and a mirror so I’ve been working on!!! THIS:<br/>
<img alt="5827-2.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5827/5827-2.png" width="300px"/><br/>
I draw things now. It also turns out that I’m turning red now! I didn’t think this was going to happen for at least 20,000 years! I’m turning red early! This is super cool! I’m also a bit taller than how I remembered myself. My eyes are still grey, but that's gonna change soon. I’ve stopped bleeding so that's good, I also don’t hurt as bad. Gaaaaaaaahhhh! I’m super excited that I’m turning red! It means that I’m turning into an adult!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dr. Kara’s been promoted and stopped being a junior researcher for me. That's sad, but they’re much happier now! I loved them, I hope they don’t forget me! ♡ I miss them.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Anyway, I’m gonna go to sleep. Night Journal!!</span></div>
