<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8618 has been purchased by the Foundation and sealed off from the public. The doors and windows of the property have been reinforced as a security measure against outside intrusion. Motion sensors have been installed both for this reason, and to monitor the anomaly itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8618 is a one-bedroom apartment unit in Kamloops, British Columbia. The suite displays signs of chronic disuse — extensive dust and webbing accumulations are visible on the furniture. Housing records indicate that the unit belonged to Ana Leclercq, a photographer previously employed by a Vancouver paparazzi agency. Prior to SCP-8618's discovery, Leclercq had already been missing for several months but had not been reported as such until the expiration of their lease.</p>
<p>The contents of SCP-8618 — while in gross disarray — are generally unremarkable. However, unusual alterations have been made to the kitchen oven. The porcelain paneling of the oven's interior, as well as its steel racks, have been disassembled and removed from their frame. The hinges of the oven door have been jammed, preventing it from closing. A streak of dried blood runs vertically inside the door, trailing towards a crawlspace in the back of the oven.</p>
<p>The crawlspace serves as an entry-point to SCP-8618's spatial anomaly: a vast, unlit area that surrounds the apartment. From within this space, the walls of the apartment are completely transparent, allowing observers to view the interior. This effect only occurs on one side — the walls are opaque when viewed from certain angles, or when viewed from inside the apartment. Wall-mounted objects, furniture pieces, and other obstructive features also exhibit the same effect.</p>
<p>A massive network of webbing hangs above SCP-8618. These webs extend outward for an indeterminate distance, spanning kilometers without terminating. Suspended within the webbing are numerous photographs, each dated with a handwritten label. These photographs vary widely in content, but typically focus on SCP-8618's previous occupant, Ana Leclercq, as the subject of depiction.</p>
<p>A majority of the photographs are high-angle shots of Leclercq in their apartment, taken from vantage points outside SCP-8618's walls. These images generally depict Leclercq in their day to day activities, seemingly unaware of the photographer's presence. Notably, certain shots offer a closer view of the subject, showing close-ups of their face or being taken directly behind them. A catalogue of recovered photographs can be found in Addendum 01.</p>
<p>The exact number of photographs inside SCP-8618 is currently unknown. However, trend analysis of the photographs' marked dates indicate that at least several years' worth of pictures are contained within the anomaly. An average of 50 to 100 photos were taken every day, spanning the entirety of Leclercq's stay up until their disappearance. No photos have been dated beyond this point, suggesting that the photographs have ceased to manifest.</p>
<p>An inquiry into the disappearance of Ana Leclercq is currently ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 02 - Subsequent Investigations:</strong></p>
<p>An investigation was conducted at Ana Leclercq's place of previous employment, a paparazzi agency based in Vancouver. The company's records indicated that most of Leclercq's photographs were regularly met with dissatisfaction and rejected from publication. Despite multiple outbound e-mails threatening the termination of Leclercq's employment, internal memos strongly recommended for her to be retained, citing her value as a company asset.</p>
<p>A full inspection and inventory of the agency's office led to the discovery of a hidden compartment behind a wall. Contained within the compartment were several leather binders covered in thick webbing. Each binder held hundreds of photographs, similar to the ones found in SCP-8618 in terms of both content and subject matter. Most notably, each binder contained a collection of photographs depicting a different person.</p>
<p>A re-evaluation of SCP-8618's effects is currently pending approval, following a comprehensive survey of missing persons' cases in British Columbia.</p>
