<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Hidden cameras monitor Foundation-owned and high-traffic public restrooms. Individuals suspected to have ingested SCP-8788 are transferred to the nearest Foundation site, where they undergo Operation Dehydration.</p>
<p>Specialty-class UR-1-NE centrifuges are installed in both public-sector and Foundation-owned water treatment facilities, where SCP-8788 is filtered out and delivered to the nearest Foundation site. SCP-8788 is provided as drinking water for select D-Class personnel, and supervising wardens assume the full-time responsibility for the continuous enactment of Operation Dehydration.</p>
<p>The following containment procedures are conditionally executed, until SCP-8788's global manifestation frequency has been limited below certain thresholds:<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-8788 is publicly advertised and sold as healthy bottled formula for infants.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Operation Siccitas is performed on Exspes-Class population centres.</span></li>
<li>Automated tasers are installed in Foundation restrooms.</li>

<p>Personnel assigned to SCP-8788 may request a project transfer after twelve weeks of service.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8788 is a variant of water, with a density of 985kg/m<sup>3</sup> at room temperature<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Its anomalous effects manifest when any human in a populated restroom has a bladder containing at least 72ml of SCP-8788.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>A successful manifestation compels all present individuals to use adjacent toilets and engage in pleasant conversation, with a strong tendency to expose personal information. Throughout the conversation, SCP-8788 would self-replicate in each individual's urinary system to sustain the discharge of urine. In most recorded cases, the total discharge far exceeds the capacity of any human bladder.</p>
<p>Urinary excretion wanes as the conversation naturally concludes, signalling the end of the manifestation. Interviews with affected subjects afterward suggest that their interpersonal relationships have improved, and that they aren't troubled by their anomalous urinary performance.</p>
<p>In the event where SCP-8788 attempts to manifest, but there exists a language barrier between the individuals involved, the volume of SCP-8788 in their bladders is neutralised into non-anomalous water upon urination.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>OPERATION DEHYDRATION - Foreword</span></h3>
</div>
<p>I know most of you complained once you were assigned to SCP-8788. Look, I get it, studying urine isn't anyone's cup of tea. Suck it up. You're given the option to rotate out after 3 months anyway. There are far worse things you could be doing in the Foundation.</p>
<p>Worse things such as Operation Dehydration. Unfortunately, it's the most reliable method we've got to keep manifestation numbers down. For whatever reason, the skip turns to regular water if the people can't speak with each other. So we've arranged for some special D-Class to act as water purifiers, and you'll be making sure they're peeing right, 10 hours a day. Same applies if a civilian wanders to a toilet and starts announcing their life story. We snatch them and flush SCP-8788 from their system.</p>
<p>Some of you might ask, what's the point? Why go to such lengths to stop a bit of gossiping? Well just like gossip, this piss spreads. And spreads fast. Worst case: LK-Class scenario. Elimination of privacy, and our precious veil becomes as flimsy as soggy toilet paper. On top of that, each manifestation effectively grows the volume of water on Earth, a net increase in global sea levels. So unless you want to drown the planet in humanity's piss, do your job.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Xray:</strong> CAN'T BLAME HER. SITE-19 IS A MAZE.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Charlie:</strong> YO! XRAY! WELCOME TO THE PARTY.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Lima:</strong> IT'S A MAZE FOR A REASON. MAKES IT HARDER FOR GUYS LIKE SULLIVAN TO FIND THEIR WAY AROUND.</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> SECURITY BY OBSCURITY. THAT'S HARDLY RELIABLE.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Bravo:</strong> THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 24/7 SECURITY DETAIL, BIOMETRIC SCANS, AND SURVEILLANCE, EVEN IN THE TOILETS.</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> HEY, WE'VE GOT THAT TOO, BACK AT FIREBASE-8. WELL, SORTA. CONTROL ROOM STAFF ROTATE AT 2AM SHARP, SO SOMEONE COULD SNEAK IN THEN.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Whiskey:</strong> I'VE HEARD OUR CONTROL ROOM SYSTEMS GET SHUT OFF AT 2AM AS WELL. FOR SOFTWARE UPDATES OR SOME SUCH.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The agents file out of the room with Sullivan. Agents Yankee and Zulu attempt to stop them, but they assert, "they're giving their friend a tour of the site." The affected subjects are stopped by security before reaching Evac Route F6, and amnesticised.</p>
<p>680 litres of SCP-8788 is produced by this incident. Sullivan's entry route into Site-19 remains unclear. 18 members of MTF Sigma-3 are treated for minor dysphonia and hearing loss. SCP-8788 is prohibited from future experimentation.</p>

<p><strong>Const. Murray</strong>: You pulling me leg Johno?</p>
<p><strong>Green</strong>: At first I thought it was the kids gettin' into another fight. Animals, the lot of 'em. But now I reckon it gotta be some voodoo black magic goin' on.</p>

<p><strong>Green</strong>: Me neither mate. Well give it a crack, and I'll catch you at the pub t'night yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Const. Murray</strong>: Yeah brah.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Incident.64466 - Preliminary research notes</p>
<p>Alright, I admit I might have objected a little too strongly against moving 15,000km across the globe into the middle of bumfuck nowhere. However, even ignoring the fact that the toilets here flush backwards, this place is pretty interesting. Because it's so remote, most of the drinking water comes from recycled sewerage. Yes, the people here are drinking their own piss, and because of SCP-8788, they piss a whole lot more than they drink.</p>
<p>Undoing this funky feedback loop could help my case for a promotion. I'll apologise to Director Moose when this is over.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>- Dr. Y. Nations</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>20/11/2023</strong>: The UR-1-NE centrifuge at Site-84 is relocated to a civilian water treatment plant. Foundation staff are advised against entering any restroom when someone else is present. A replacement centrifuge is ordered.</p>
<p><strong>22/11/2023</strong>: Concentration of SCP-8788 in sewerage exceeds the filtration capacity of a single UR-1-NE centrifuge. 4 more centrifuges are ordered.</p>
<p><strong>28/11/2023</strong>: Department Director Walker and her daughter share fairy tales in Site-84's living quarters. They refer to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo" target="_blank">[REDACTED]</a> by its numerical designation, causing Building C-23 to arborise into a 120-metre tree-like structure, and transfiguring indoor personnel into [REDACTED]. The structure is incinerated and the UR-1-NE centrifuge is moved back to Site-84. Following this incident, the surveillance of domestic bathrooms belonging to Foundation staff is no longer voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>01/12/2023</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects reaches 55.67%. Alice Springs is placed under quarantine. A cover story is provided, justifying the quarantine due to a COVID-19 outbreak in the town.</p>
<p><strong>07/12/2023</strong>: Field agents note an increasing trend of civilians seeking out public restrooms, unwilling to urinate by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>14/12/2023</strong>: Volume of SCP-8788 exceeds storage capacity of Site-84. Excess SCP-8788 is dumped into the surrounding desert.</p>
<p><strong>01/01/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects reaches 63.44%. Subjects exceeding 70% constituent SCP-8788 express reluctance to use a toilet without a capable conversation partner.</p>

<p><strong>15/01/2024</strong>: 5 UR-1-NE centrifuges arrive and are installed in local water treatment facilities. Filtration is capable of diverting 83% of SCP-8788 from the town's main water supply.</p>
<p><strong>19/01/2024</strong>: Excess dumping of SCP-8788 in the surrounding desert has led to desert blooms outside of standard seasonal patterns, attracting non-native species.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Makeshift infant nurseries are built near water treatment plants. The "Sensible Children's Predevelopment Foundation" is cognitohazardously advertised to parents. Field agents masquerading as caregivers assume the full-time responsibility for the continuous enactment of Operation Dehydration.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Accepted - <em>Site 84 Ethics Commitee Liaison</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>25/01/2024</strong>: 25 civilians collapse from heat stroke in a government hospital. Interruption of the manifestation was delayed due to staff shortages.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Request for 1,000 more personnel to enable neutralisation of SCP-8788.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Rejected - <em>O5-█</em></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>: Insufficient non-English-speaking D-Class. Proposal would compromise containment in other sites.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>01/02/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects reaches 67.22%. Subjects exceeding 85% constituent SCP-8788 express reluctance to use a toilet without a capable conversation partner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Request for 1,000 more personnel to enable neutralisation of SCP-8788. English-speaking D-Class may be procured, provided they are administered Class DX amnestics targeting the frontal lobe, disabling speech production.</p>

<p><strong>24/02/2024</strong>: 120 field agents and 720 D-Class personnel are transferred to Site-84.</p>
<p><strong>01/03/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects drops to 65.69%.</p>
<p><strong>12/03/2024</strong>: Excess dumping of SCP-8788 in the surrounding desert has led to the formation of quicksand deposits and algal blooms.</p>
<p><strong>21/03/2024</strong>: Multiple civilians protest against poor treatment. Firearm use is authorised to quell potential riots.</p>
<p><strong>01/04/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects drops to 64.21%.</p>
<p><strong>23/04/2024</strong>: A manifestation occurs between Agent Chalmers and 23 civilians in a public restroom. Afterward, Chalmers attempts to help civilians abscond from containment protocol. A firefight ensues, resulting in ███ casualties among civilians and Foundation staff.</p>
<p><strong>28/04/2024</strong>: A civilian with 99.34% constituent SCP-8788 refuses Operation Dehydration. He is unable to relax his bladder muscles without a capable conversation partner. He expires after [REDACTED] from the water pressure.</p>
<p><strong>01/05/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects drops to 63.01%. Cost of maintaining containment in Alice Springs exceeds $15,000,000 per month. O5-█ requests the research team to seek alternative methods to neutralise SCP-8788.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Disperse residents of Alice Springs to available Foundation facilities, and enact Operation Dehydration. This would be conducted piecemeal since the global on-site capacity for Operation Dehydration is 9,400 individuals. Cost for long-distance transport and Operation Dehydration of 36,000 people is estimated to be $70,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Pending</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Blood transfusion of all residents to artificially reduce constituent SCP-8788 to 0.00%. 180,000L of blood is required. Process to procure this volume of blood is under development.</p>

</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Withdraw containment operations in Alice Springs and quarantine indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Denied - <em>Dr. Y. Nations</em></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>: Left unchecked, an estimated 5,184,000L of SCP-8788 would be produced per day.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>01/06/2024</strong>: Average constituent SCP-8788 in affected subjects drops to 61.96%.</p>
<p><strong>07/06/2024</strong>: Excess dumping of SCP-8788 has led to higher than average rainfall in the Northern Territory. Manifestations of SCP-8788 are reported in other towns in the region.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Terminate all residents. Alice Springs provides little economic value.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Pending</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Clone all residents with SCP-████. Repurpose the originals to D-Class personnel, and globally distribute them to Foundation facilities. Excess personnel are culled. This would help recoup the prior expenditure used for containment.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Pending</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>: Administer Class DX amnestics to disable speech production for 22.55% (8,100 individuals) of the population. According to stochastic models, this will naturally reduce average constituent SCP-8788 below 1.00% within 4 weeks, without further Foundation intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Pending</p>
</div>
<p><strong>25/06/2024</strong>: Proposal to [REDACTED] is accepted. Operation Siccitas is drafted to implement the proposal, and Alice Springs is cleared of SCP-8788 after three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>19/07/2024</strong>: The SCP-8788 research team is tasked with identifying population centres with a similar hydrological profile to Alice Springs. Those with prevalence of SCP-8788 are designated as Exspes-Class, and Operation Siccitas is to be likewise implemented to ensure containment.</p>
