            <h1>SCP-1441</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1441</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-1441 and SCP-1441-01 are stored separately in combination-locked lead-lined cases, and are to be kept in a Secure Containment facility when not in use. As of Addendum-02, access is restricted to personnel involved in the -EX testing program.</span></p>
<p>SCP-1441 is currently stored in Storage Locker #523 at Sector-17, along with one spare specimen of SCP-1441-01 and two spare rolls of perforated paper towels of any brand. Staff are reminded to replace rolls after full use for the convenience of others.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1441 is an automatic paper towel dispenser. It is physically similar to dispensers of the brand "Towel-Matic", with two exceptions: i) it instead has the brand name CONVENITOWEL; ii) where other Towel-Matics have a compartment suited for 4 D-size batteries, SCP-1441 instead contains a non-standard power cell, designated SCP-1441-01.</p>
<p>SCP-1441-01 is a 50x50x50mm (125cm<sup>3</sup>) rounded cube, with a mass of 500 grams. It largely consists of an alloy of iron and palladium. One face bears metal contacts, and has been designated as the bottom side. A small lid on the top opens up to reveal a chamber full of water.</p>
<p>The sides show branding, referring to the object as "PHAETON POWER CELL", and to the makers as Ingenitech. Investigation revealed Ingenitech to be a software development company based in Cincinnati, OH; staff there showed no recognition of SCP-1441-01, and no files relating to Phaeton or power cells were discovered, suggesting that the name is a coincidence. Similarly, CONVENITOWEL has never been registered as a trademark.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis of SCP-1441-01 suggests that the power cell operates on anomalous technology; further details will be listed below when results emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong> Further analysis of SCP-1441-01 show that its power generation operates by small-scale cold fusion, requiring only the addition of water. While advanced, none of the processes involved are inherently anomalous. Suggesting attempt at replication of technology.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-02:</strong> A replica of SCP-1441-01 was constructed and tested in SCP-1441; SCP-1441 operated as normal. SCP-1441 has been nominated to the -EX testing program for confirmation of the process and eventual dissemination of the technology.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-03:</strong> As the team has now suffered 17 successive failures to replicate the battery interface outside of SCP-1441, -EX testing has been suspended, and further analysis and experimentation has been opened to discover any possible anomalous reason behind these events.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-04:</strong> A non-anomalous Towel-Matic paper towel dispenser has successfully been fitted with a replica of the battery interface in SCP-1441, and operated normally with both the original SCP-1441-01 and a replica.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-05:</strong> Replicas of SCP-1441-01 have been tested as power sources for various appliances and devices, with the results shown below:</p>

<p><em>At this point it is very difficult to avoid the following conclusion: that SCP-1441-01 will only operate in devices with the sole or primary function of dispensing paper towels. As such, I recommend SCP-1441 be withdrawn from the -EX program, and that its secure containment procedures be revised in accordance with the new information on its threat. I am ceasing experimentation on SCP-1441.</em> - Dr. Jung</p>
