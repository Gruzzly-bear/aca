<p>Eckhart House</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: Due to extreme difficulty relocating SCP-4612-A, a perimeter maintained by a barbed wire fence has been established around Provisional Site-91. The Site is a converted 18th Century manor in Yorkshire, England, commonly referred to as Eckhart House. Any unauthorized individuals found at Provisional Site-91 are to be interrogated for any possible connection to <a href="/serpent-s-hand-hub">Group of Interest ALPHA-019</a> ("Serpent's Hand"). Members of the Serpent's Hand are to be processed by the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>SCP-4612-B is uncontained at this time, as its whereabouts are unknown. Foundation webcrawler I/O METATRON is to scrub all social media and internet postings for mentions of a figure fitting description of SCP-4612-B. Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) are to be notified of sightings of SCP-4612-B.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-4612 refers to two related anomalies. SCP-4612-A is the body of a large limaciform invertebrate, consisting of white translucent flesh with elastic texture. The body shows no sign of decay despite centuries having passed since estimated time of death. The cadaver is ten meters in length, one meter in width, and lying atop a stone altar. The cadaver’s anatomy includes six human arm shaped structures measuring 3 meters in length. Each arm terminates at a hand with ten digits and a crystal structure in the palm. A flexible fin travels down the length of SCP-4612-A.</p>
<p>There is a lengthwise, posthumously executed incision along the underside of the cadaver. The cadaver’s blood is bright blue and uncoagulated. SCP-4612-A emits considerable amounts of <a href="/spikebrennan-s-proposal">Akiva radiation</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The cadaver has emitted a steady increase in its radiation for unknown reasons since its discovery.</p>
<p>SCP-4612-A is housed in an underground structure beneath Provisional Site-91. The door to the vault is located on the exterior of Eckhart House and leads to an underground structure beneath the wine cellar. The door is inscribed with thaumaturgical glyphs which, at one time, induced a mild cognitohazard causing the viewer to ignore the entryway.</p>
<p>The underground structure is constructed of stone blocks, many of which are charred and warped from heat. Cuneiform glyphs of unknown thaumaturgical purpose are etched onto the surface of many of the stone blocks.</p>
<p>SCP-4612-B is a humanoid entity 1.75 meters tall of average build, with eyes that glow a bright blue. SCP-4612-B has demonstrated the ability to manipulate thermal energy and exhibited anomalous strength far beyond what is expected given its height and build. SCP-4612-B has referred to SCP-4612-A as its father, despite being two distinct species. See <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incident 4612-1</span>.</p>

<p><strong>RE</strong>: Concerning the origins and significance of SCP-4612-A</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through broad historical survey, numerous events categorized as a backsliding of technological capabilities have been identified. Many of these instances have grounded explanations by historians, but some do not.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery</strong>:<br/>
SCP-4612-A was discovered on December 19, 1986 when Foundation agents surveilling a known member of the Serpent’s Hand (designated as POI-39978K) followed POI-39978K onto the grounds of Eckhart House. Agents observed POI-39978K perform an unknown thaumaturgical ritual and enter the door to the underground structure housing SCP-4612-A. The agents then pursued and witnessed POI-39978K kneeling before the remains, weeping. Upon seeing SCP-4612-A, Foundation agents detained POI-39978K and called for reinforcements.</p>
<p>MTF-Beta-777 mobilized from Site-06-03, arriving roughly 8 hours after Foundation personnel reported the anomaly. MTF-Beta-777 are specially trained in thaumaturgical countermeasures and always staffed with at least two Class-A thaumatologists. MTF personnel were accompanied by Agent Rebekah Douglas, Level-3 psychometrist.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Survey of the site revealed no obvious anomalies other than the cadaver of SCP-4612-A. The corpses of 23 human males of various ages were found surrounding SCP-4612-A. Most of the corpses were significantly desiccated, charred and had skeletal structures partially incinerated. Several of the corpses were dismembered due to blunt force trauma. Agent Douglas noted substantial psychic trauma present in all human remains on site.<br/>

<p><strong><em>Interviewer</em></strong> – Dr. Iona Varga – Director of Provisional Site-91</p>
<p><strong><em>Interview Subject</em></strong> – POI-39978K</p>
<p><em>Background: Interview was performed at Provisional Site-91 several months after apprehension of POI-39978K. Interview subject was detained at the site since apprehension undergoing standard interrogation escalation protocols, and appears disheveled and pale.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: What do you know about Eckhart House?</p>
<p><em>POI-39978K does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Listen, we can do this for weeks if you want. You belong to what’s little more than a terrorist group, and we don’t have the Geneva Protocols in play here.</p>
<p><em>POI-39978K does not respond but looks down at her hands, breaking eye contact with Dr. Varga.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Have it your way. If you want to see why you call us Jailers first hand, it doesn’t bother me. I have tests to run.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Varga gets up to leave but halts when POI-39978K speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: Ok, Jesus. I don’t know much anyway.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Varga continues standing, looking down at POI-39978K. She gestures for POI-39978K to continue.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: Alright, I know that the original master of the house was an occultist. The house was named after him, I think. I ran across reference to his reaching out to the Library and wanted to investigate. I didn’t know what I would find.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Varga sits across from POI-39978K and resumes taking notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: There’s no record of a subbasement under this structure, how did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: I surveyed the building and viewed the door by using a thaumaturgical working.</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Do you know what species that cadaver is?</p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: …What species is a god?</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Do you really believe that invertebrate is a god?</p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: I don’t know… it’s an alien entity that was ritually butchered. What would you call it?</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: An anomaly.</p>
<p><em>POI-39978K shakes her head, puts her head on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: What aren’t you telling us? Aren’t you Librarians big supporters of the dissemination of knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: <em>[Still with her head down.]</em> I know the timing was important.</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>POI-39978K</strong>: What happened here in the late 1770’s?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Varga looks down at her notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: I’m a geneticist and xenobiologist, but I remember reading that the Industrial Revolution started in England around that time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> But what does that have to do with a non-terrestrial cadaver?</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Context</span></strong></p>
<p>The individual referenced by POI-39978K is believed to be William Henry Eckhart, initial owner and resident master of Eckhart House. Eckhart was an active member in several occult societies and held regular meetings of such societies at his home.</p>
<p>Eckhart made his fortune mining iron and copper. Local historians have theorized that he was investing in the burgeoning movement towards industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Records from the Yorkshire Historical Society mention a “meteor strike” occurring on the evening of September 17, 1779, causing significant damage to the House. The structure does not currently exhibit damage commensurate with such an event. Mr. Eckhart was last seen by his servants entering his library on the morning of the meteor strike and was considered dead after the incident. No mention of the underground structure or SCP-4612-A are made in the historical record. Local legends note that a man made of fire was seen walking out of the ruined house after the impact.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup><br/>

I hope this letter finds you well, my friend.<br/>

I grow concerned with the others of our Society. Our Brethren must understand the grand scale of our Endeavour. Any cost that comes forthwith will be well earned, whether in pecuniary losses or in our very Blood.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
There is an inhuman Entity that holds our lives in its grip. We have no choice but soil our hands if we wish our great Empire to thrive. If we turn from this Task, what will happen to future Generations?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The Library has allowed our supervised review of many tomes, and I have recently found a ritual<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> that was once used to Bind a god, and should suffice for our noble Purpose.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Please, my dear Friend and Collaborator, speak with the others. Remind them of our sacrifices, and what we stand to gain. The consequences of our actions against our Adversary will pale when compared to the great advances we can achieve for the human race.<br/>

<p><strong>Examination of SCP-4612-A</strong><br/>
<em>Attempts to move SCP-4612-A have been unsuccessful. The corpse exhibits density far beyond what is to be expected by cursory examination, estimated to weigh over 26,000 kg. The altar where the body lies is assessed as anomalous given its ability to hold the body without losing structural integrity. Dr. Varga has decided that attempting to move the corpse would not nearly be as cost effective as testing on site. It is for this reason that Provisional Site-91 was established.</em></p>

<p><em>Small samples were surgically removed from SCP-4612-A for ease of testing.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organic Structural Assessment</span></strong>: SCP-4612-A has a cellular structure not matching any entries throughout the Foundation’s biological databases. The anomaly's form of life seems to be based on a blending of carbon and silicon, as the molecules that form the basis of its cells contain both elements.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exposure to various elements</span></strong>: The sample was exposed to electrical current of various charges, alpha, gamma and ultraviolet radiations. The sample showed no change in its state, absorbing electrical current and radiations noted without sign of degradation or decay. Visible wavelengths of light (in addition to infrared) are not absorbed, but produce rippling motion in the structure of the fin running along SCP-4612-A’s length.</p>
<p>Residual energies exposed to the sample of SCP-4612-A's flesh have been observed emitting from the crystalline structures present in its hands. Transmittal of energies from sample to cadaver occur instantaneously. It is theorized the crystalline structures were used to conduct energies in an unknown process.</p>
<p>The lengthwise incision along SCP-4612-A’s body emits significantly higher Akiva radiation than the rest of the body. The ritual or surgical procedure was apparently interrupted, as indicated by the bloodied palm prints along the length of the body. It's theorized that the corpse was to be used in a thaumaturgical ritual of unknown purpose.</p>
<p>X-ray imaging of SCP-4612-A is impossible, as the remains absorb radiation. Ultrasound examination and portable MRI scans have shown a complete lack of internal organs. SCP-4612-A is made of fibrous muscle structures and a vast nervous system with nodules of unknown utility.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account of Agent Douglas RE: Psychometric Analysis of SCP-4612-A – 1987-06-09</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Audio and video recording made on June 9, 1987 at 0717 hours.</em></p>
<p><strong>Foundation Staff present</strong>: Agent Rebekah Douglas and Dr. Iona Varga</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Rebekah, are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Yes, let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><em>Douglas closes the distance between her and the remains of SCP-4612-A. She holds her hands inches above the surface of SCP-4612-A. Douglas takes a deep breath and lowers her palms to make contact with the remains.</em></p>
<p><em>2 minutes of silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Are you getting anything?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Yes, but it’s faint. I can feel something just under the surface, but something’s blocking me.</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Maybe the event was too long ago for much to be left.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: No, that can’t be it. There’s enough psychic trauma in the stones of that hallway to give me a headache, so this giant slug should be ten times as much… hold on, I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: You squeamish?</p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Oh please, who do we work for?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Ok, gonna try something…</p>
<p><em>Douglas takes several breaths, removes her hands from the epidermis of SCP-4612-A and plunges both hands into the incision. Douglas’ hands are not visible, up to the elbows in the cadaver. Dr. Varga takes a sharp breath, but says nothing.</em></p>
<p><em>Douglas screams. A psychic shockwave emits from SCP-4612-A shattering the bulbs in temporary lighting set up around the chamber. Dr. Varga activates two chemical light sticks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><em>Agent Douglas sinks to her knees, hands still inserted into the incision along SCP-4612-A’s body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Varga</strong>: Douglas, please respond. Can you contin…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Varga is interrupted by a shimmering blue light emitting from SCP-4612-A. Figures appear throughout the room, including a hooded individual identified as William Henry Eckhart standing over the corpse of SCP-4612-A. Eckhart is holding a knife in the air, chanting loudly in garbled Aramaic, audio quality is poor and the chanting is indecipherable. Eckhart sinks the blade into a SCP-4612-A, slicing along its length. Eckhart continues chanting as he slips one hand into the incision, overlaying himself onto Douglas’ position.</em></p>
<p><em>Twenty or more other voices rise up from the other figures in the room, matching Eckhart’s chanting. Eckhart holds the knife up, covered in the blue blood of SCP-4612-A, and the knife begins to glow a dull red. A bright light engulfs the room, and the structure shakes significantly. The ceiling crumbles inwards and a beam of bright light illuminates the room momentarily. When the light fades, a new individual (designated as SCP-4612-B) stands a few feet from SCP-4612-A and Eckhart. SCP-4612-B is dressed in in a long cloak, and wears a tricorn hat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p><em>Eckhart steps away from SCP-4612-A, dropping the knife. He stumbles, catches himself staring at SCP-4612-B.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eckhart</strong>: Good God, what are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: Step away from the body of my father.</p>
<p><em>Eckhart moves further away from SCP-4612-A.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: Murder wasn’t enough for you? Must you desecrate my father’s corpse?</p>
<p><em>Eckhart is sweating, he turns to look at some of the other figures. None step forward to support him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eckhart</strong>: I had no idea… I didn’t even know it was a “He”.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: Answer me, fool. Why do you dissect his body?</p>
<p><strong>Eckhart</strong>: I… that is to say, we, wanted to use it for a ritual working. For the productions of miracles.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: Child, is this your miracle? <em>[SCP-4612-B points to the cadaver]</em> You killed the only living thing that truly knew me.</p>
<p><strong>Eckhart</strong>: Please, it was not our intention to</p>
<p><em>Eckhart is interrupted as SCP-4612-B lashes out, its hand passing through Eckhart’s torso and exploding out his back. A shower of blood and viscera splash onto the floor. SCP-4612-B grasps the body of Eckhart and tears it in two. The two halves begin to smolder and then burn as they fall to the stone floor of the chamber.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4612-B looks down at the burning corpse of Eckhart for approximately 30 seconds. The other figures in the room start to scream and some flee towards the exit. SCP-4612-B looks up, its eyes shining. One of the other hooded figures steps forward, holding out his palms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unidentified figure</strong>: Sir, please. William was the architect of this drama. We had scarce knowledge of your father’s existence. We only hoped to improve the lot of all mankind. In our wildest dreams, this result would have still seemed outlandish. I beg you, have mercy.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4612-B pauses and looks toward the unidentified speaker. SCP-4612-B steps forward and places its hand on the speaker’s shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: You wanted to achieve a goal, and so you have. But did you ever consider the consequences?</p>
<p><em>The unidentified man’s hair and skin ignite, his screams only cut off by a strike of SCP-4612-B’s hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4612-B</strong>: Come, you apes, show me your miracles.</p>
<p><em>For the next 12 minutes SCP-4612-B kills each of the 21 other figures, using fire and blunt force trauma. After it has finished with the gathered occultists, SCP-4612-B stands before the corpse of SCP-4612-A, then sinks to its knees, in the same space occupied by Agent Douglas. The blue light from SCP-4612-A dims, image of SCP-4612-B fades, leaving the underground structure as it appeared at the beginning of recording. Agent Douglas collapses.</em></p>

Agent Douglas spent 5 weeks in recuperation. In that time, she was rarely conscious. A figure resembling SCP-4612-B was seen entering Douglas’ room on video surveillance 36 days after her collapse. Security staff was mobilized and sent to Douglas’ recuperation quarters, but there was no sign of SCP-4612-B. When security staff approached Agent Douglas, she was alert but had a thumbprint on her forehead just above the bridge of her nose. Medical personnel were unable to clean the mark from her skin.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
During debriefing, Douglas was asked to recount any discussion with SCP-4612-B prior to arrival of security staff. Douglas reported that SCP-4612-B claimed she was only alive because she was merely investigating. Additionally, Agent Douglas claimed significant interference of her psychometry, as all she could sense were the following words being repeated: “Eckhart died for a reason.”<br/>
