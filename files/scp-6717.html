<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A square area of 1000 meters by 1000 meters is to be established with SCP-6717 at the center, where no non-Foundation personnel are allowed to enter. A 2 meter high fence is to be erected around the perimeter of the area, with only one entrance. Non-Foundation personnel are to be told Standard Cover Story 11, "military testing grounds". SCP-6717 is to be electrically powered constantly, and electrical power input must not be less than 18 megawatts daily. Electrical power leading into SCP-6717 must be connected to Observation post 249-C, and in extension, the Site-249 power grid. All images of SCP-6717 must be concealed from the public. Satellite photography, as well as maps are to be altered to not include SCP-6717. No civilian construction is allowed within one kilometer of the SCP-6717 containment area.</p>
<p>Entrance into SCP-6717 must be approved by lead researcher Dr. Hafeez, or by any personnel with level 4 or greater clearance.</p>
<p>Observation post 249-C personnel are to be alerted if any SCP-6717-1 deviate from their routines (see addendum 6717.2.1).</p>
<p>SCP-6717-2 is to be monitored using optical and thermal security cameras, thermometers, and Kant counters. If any abnormalities in any of these measurements occur, Site-241 and Observation post 241-C are to be alerted. No further containment of SCP-6717-2 is presently deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Map of the location of SCP-6717 within the U.S state of Arizona.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6717 is an area measuring 609,6 by 609,6 meters resembling that of a 1950s era small suburban American neighborhood, located in Mohave County, Arizona, U.S. Within SCP are 507 individual buildings, of which 500 resemble suburban residential housing. All suburban residential housing is devoid of any furniture. All foliage within SCP-6717 is constructed of plastic, and all street furniture, with the exception of lampposts, are constructed of styrofoam, and are non-functional. At various spots in SCP-6717 are life-sized plastic models of pigeons.</p>
<p>At the center of SCP-6717 is an open square, resembling a town center. In, or near the center is are buildings resembling a post office, grocery store, office, diner restaurant, and a church. At the center of SCP-6717 is a building resembling an office building, measuring 15 meters in height. The building is coated in grey paint, on all surfaces, including windows. For more information, see addendum 1 and 3.</p>
<p>SCP-6717 is populated by an estimated 100-500 humanoid entities designated SCP-6717-1. SCP-6717-1 instances are externally similar to humans, but have been observed to have notable behavioral differences. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Due to insufficient research, little else is known regarding the attributes of SCP-6717-1.</span> View addendum 2 for further details.</p>
<p>SCP-6717 was first discovered by the Foundation on 1997-10-13, when Foundation aircraft that were performing training exercises in the area spotted SCP-6717-1. The pilots noted the abnormal density of buildings given the remoteness. It is currently unknown for how long SCP-6717 has existed, given no public records mention any construction on the coordinates where SCP-6717 is located. It is also unknown how SCP-6717 has avoided detection by the relevant authorities.</p>

<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Video check.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> All clear, we see you.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Weapons check.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Clear. Locked and loaded.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Good. Command, we are all clear. Requesting permission for entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Granted. You're free to go. Remember, we don't quite know if the residents here are aggressive, or even anomalous. Approach with caution.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Always.</p>
<p><em>MTF epsilon-6 begins moving towards SCP-6717.</em></p>
<p><em>Video feed shows a sign at the entrance of SCP-6717. The sign reads "Header. Text Text Text Text Text."</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> look at this.</p>
<p><em>E6-3 points to the sign.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> You read that?</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> weird.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Looks like a placeholder.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Yeah, it kind of does.</p>
<p><em>Epsilon-6 enters SCP-6717</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Looks like where I grew up. (<em>pause</em>) Brings back memories.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Looks can be deceiving. Remain alert.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Of course, of course. All I'm saying is that this is a nice break from some of the stuff we've been through recently.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Like [REDACTED]?</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Yeah. Fuck, I wish I could forget that, especially the [REDACTED].</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Don't make me think about it.</p>
<p><em>Epsilon-6 moves forward for five minutes, extraneous dialogue removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Look, in there, there's someone inside.</p>
<p><em>E6-4 gesticulates towards one of the houses. An SCP-6717-1 instance is visible inside, standing still.</em></p>
<p><strong>beta-3:</strong> Oh shit, yeah, Hafeez mentioned these guys during briefing. One, should we engage?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Stand by. Requesting permission from command.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> let's go. Raise your guns.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Raised.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Raised.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> E6-2, you open the door.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><em>Epsilon-6 enters the building with the SCP-6717-1 instance inside. No furniture or illumination is present within the building.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> E6-3, engage with it.</p>
<p><em>E6-3 nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><em>the SCP-6717-1 instance does not move its head or body when talking.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> My name is Name Smith.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Name smith?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Alright, uh, do you live here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> This is my home. I am happy with my home.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> I see. Do you just stand here all day?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> I do not. In 14 minutes I will go to my job. I work there.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C (Quietly):</strong> Timer set for 14 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Okay, and what do you do at your job?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Work.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> And what does work mean, to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> But like, wha–</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Stop. Try something else.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Alright, uh, are there more people like you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Everybody is like me. I am normal.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Are there more people in this town?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Everyone lives in this town.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> What do you mean by everyone?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Me, and you, and everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3 (silently, turned towards the rest of Epsilon-6):</strong> Should i continue? Im thinking this won't go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> I think y–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> I don't recognize you.</p>
<p><em>All team members turn towards the SCP-6717-1 instance.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3 (whispering):</strong> Fuck no</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> We're leaving. Now.</p>
<p><em>Epsilon-6 moves out to the street outside</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Everybody, let's hold off the interactions for now.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><em>E6-2 nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Yeah I'm with you, one. Better not to anger them.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Hey, look. There is one of those guys in like every house.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Oh shit, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Hafeez mentioned an estimate of one to five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Right, yeah, I remember.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Alright, team, what's the game plan from here?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> To follow our mission: recon the area, set up cameras, GTFO.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Yes. Four, you're the camera person, do you think this would be a good spot for a camera?</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Might as well. Remember the satellite map? All identical houses, arranged in a grid.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Right. You should point the camera to that window.</p>
<p><em>E6-3 points to the window of the building with the previously encountered SCP-6717-1-instance inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> That's what I'm thinking. Cover me while I set this up.</p>
<p><em>E6-4 set's up one of their security cameras. Extraneous dialogue removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Should be working now. Command, do you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Stand by for a sec. (<em>pause</em>). Yeah, we see you.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Great. One, what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Remember how the guy you talked with mentioned he was going to work in 14 minutes? That's in about two minutes. We'll wait until then.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Guns?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> No guns, unless they directly engage. Let's not try to provoke them.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><em>E6-2 moves towards a fire hydrant.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Look at this. Styrofoam.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Huh. Should I take a sample?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Go for it. I'll watch your back.</p>
<p><em>E6-4 takes out a small knife, and cuts a piece of the fire hydrant. The styrofoam has been confirmed to be entirely non-anomalous.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> You done?</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Eyes on the doors. Act neutral.</p>
<p><em>Every door visible in the video feed opens simultaneously. An SCP-6717-1 instance exits every door and begins walking down the street.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Perfectly synchronised.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> We'll follow them. Do not let your guard down.</p>
<p><em>Epsilon-6 moves along with the SCP-6717-1 instances for ten minutes. Extraneous dialogue removed.</em></p>
<p><em>The SCP-6717-1 Instances continue into the center of SCP-6717.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> This is it. The town square. Hafeez mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> And that's the building he talked about, the big grey one.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Ominous.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> One, should we enter?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> I'm not seeing any entrance. We should recon the area first. Plus, research got some weird readings off it. I don't trust it. We'll take that later.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Understandable.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Hey, uh, look.</p>
<p><em>E6-4 points towards a smaller office building, five stories high. SCP-6717-1 instances are shown entering the building.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> That's gotta be where they work.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Must be.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Should we go in? Seems like an important place.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> What about that?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> What about what?</p>
<p><em>E6-2 points towards a building to his left resembling a grocery store.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Says "Grocery Food Market" on it.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Right. How about we split. Me and two, we go to the office. Three, Four, you check the Grocery store.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Yes, rendezvous when?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> It's not a big place, tell me when you're done and we'll meet here.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><em>E6-1-C, and E6-2 move towards the office building, and E6-3 and E6-4 move towards the grocery store.</em></p>

<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Thank you, sir. Also, uh, excuse me, but do you know anything about the grey building outside?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> There is no grey building.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> What about that one?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> There is no grey building.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Alright, (<em>pause</em>) thank you.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Hey three, how's it going?</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Just bought this thing.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Some sort of can. Only thing that guy wanted to sell to me.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Got any idea what's inside?</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> None in the slightest. Is the camera ready?</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Should be, command, do you see anything?</p>
<p>Command: Crystal clear.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Also, three, have you seen the products here? All the fruits are plastic, every box is empty. Every label says something like "brand name" or "product".</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Yeah, that's kind of a thing here I suppose. Weird. Should we head out?</p>
<p><strong>E6-4:</strong> Yeah. We're done here.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4 (Over intercom):</strong> E6-1-C, were done. Waiting in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C: (Over intercom):</strong> We're almost done here. See you soon.</p>
<p><strong>E6-4 (Over intercom):</strong> Copy that.</p>

<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Let's see what all this is about.</p>
<p><em>E6-1-C and E6-2 enter the office building.</em></p>
<p><em>The video feed shows a sparsely furnished office space. An estimated 50 SCP-6717-1 instances are seated in front of computer monitors.</em></p>
<p><em>E6-1-C moves over to one of the SCP-6717-1 instances. before it is a cathode ray tube display terminal and a keyboard with numbers. The SCP-6717-1 instance is inputting random numbers into the terminal.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> I am working.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> And what do those numbers mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> They are important numbers.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> I see. Why do you input the numbers?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> Because it's my job.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Who gave you your job?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6717-1:</strong> My boss.</p>

<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Same as the first floor. isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Seems to be. Should we do another survey?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Might as well. Wait, I'm getting something over the intercom. Two, go examine the floor in the meanwhile.</p>
<p><strong>E6-3 (Over intercom):</strong> Hey, E6-1-C, should i purchase something in the grocery store?</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C: (Over intercom):</strong> Unless you think it's dangerous, go for it.</p>

<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> There's text over here.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Can you read what it says?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Barely, looks like a tag.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Like a grafitti tag?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>E6-1-C:</strong> Shit, did someone get here before us?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Maybe.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span>NOTICE FROM SCP-6717 RESEARCH TEAM</span></h4>
<hr/>
<p>In accordance with recent discoveries, the SCP-6717 research team has decided to expand upon the behavioral details of SCP-6717-1. Below you shall find interviews with, and descriptions of the anatomy and behavior of, SCP-6717-1 instances.</p>
<p>— Dr. Mohammed Hafeez, Lead Researcher, Observation post 249-C</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-6717 is populated by 300<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> humanoid entities, referred to as SCP-6717-1. SCP-6717-1 instances are externally identical to <em>homo sapiens</em> (humans) but with notable internal and behavioral differences. SCP-6717-1 instances populate the residential housing, and act as the town residents. All SCP-6717-1 instances are of Caucasian descent, and can appear as either female or male, with either gender making up for 50% of the population. Every male instance is identical in corporal attributes, and the same applies to every female instance. Autopsy reports have shown that SCP-6717-1 instances lack internal human biology, consisting solely of skin tissue. SCP-6717-1 instances also lack genitalia, mammary papilla<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, navels, or any body hair else than on the head. The throat and nasal cavities of SCP-6717-1 instances terminate below the vocal cords, and behind the nasal vestibule respectively. SCP-6717-1 instances do not breathe, and do not require oxygen nor sustenance for survival. It is as of yet unknown what happens to matter consumed by SCP-6717-1 instances.</p>
<p>If any SCP-6717-1 instance is terminated, another instance of the same gender will manifest in its' residence at the start of the following routine. The remaining biomass of the terminated instance will dematerialize over a period of ten hours.</p>
<p>Behaviourally, SCP-6717-1 instances act similar to humans, albeit with impaired cognital function. SCP-6717-1 instances adhere to a set schedule of daily routines which every instance (with certain outliers) perform. These routines appear to serve societal functions within SCP-6717. In these routines, SCP-6717-1 instances assume one of five roles: "worker", "Grocery Food Store worker", "Food Brand Diner worker", and "mailman". SCP-6717-1 instances are capable of simple conversation on a few set topics, but are entirely incapable of comprehending concepts not part of their daily routines.</p>

<hr/>
<p>As has been proven in testing, SCP-6717-1 instances react with aggression to those who touch the grey tower, but will not react when they percieve another instance is touching the building. Thus we chose a different approach regarding the following Exploration Log: To create a temporary MTF team (MTF Nu-9 "Homeowners") consisting of MTF operatives that look similar to SCP-6717-1 instances, to minimize suspicion, and have them try to infiltrate SCP-6717 and breach the building at the center of SCP-6717.</p>

<p><strong>Logbook author:</strong> MTF Operative N9-1-C<br/>
<strong>Log:</strong> Today was our first day. Good god, what a place this is. It's all just <em>slightly</em> uncanny. Our first day has been fairly easy so far, all things considered. We started the day off by being dropped off by a truck in the middle of a highway in 33-degree heat, dressed in fifties trenchcoats, and had to walk up to the town. But stepping foot inside was quite the mindfuck, we'd just been in the desert and now we're in this, nostalgic, serene, timeless, neighborhood. It was strange. What's really weird is how there is no wear on anything. Everything looks all fine and clean and newly painted. Hasn't this place been in the desert for a while? Wouldn't dust sweep in?</p>
<p>Anyways, after we entered the town we went around looking at all there was to see, which wasn't much in particular. We checked in on the cameras the previous guys had set up, and there weren't any problems there. We also looked for corpse parts where the previous guys had shot some of the residents, but we found nothing. Apparently, the residents are skin all the way through, which unsettles me a little bit. We then headed towards the town center, and retrieved the explosive breaching device left by the previous group, who never got to detonate it. After that, we went and purchased some of the cans, and after receiving a "go ahead, but maybe don't eat too much of this stuff" from command, we ate it. It was, well, underwhelming. It tastes like exactly nothing. In fact, I'm eating some right now as I write this. The substance is grey, and is like a grainy sludge, and there really isn't anything more to say about it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the real shit starts. We're gonna have to go to "work", which i am not looking forward to. The descriptions we've been given are pretty bleak. Pressing random buttons all day without moving is not necessarily hard, but must be <em>extremely</em> boring. This is to test my patience I suppose. I'll end this here, I gotta get some sleep soon.</p>

<strong>Log:</strong> God, I fucking hate myself.</p>
<p>Today has been <em>very</em> exhausting. I and the rest of the team went to "work" with the town residents. We started by waking up roughly at the time the other instances woke up, but by 08:00 we had to be ready at the door. We walked in silence, like some absurd parade, into the town center. We got to our work, and you would not believe how taxing that "work" was. We sat there for a solid <em>eight and a half hours</em>, tapping at buttons, not moving a single muscle. We weren't even allowed to go to the bathroom, since there is no goddamn bathroom in that building. Now, we hadn't eaten or drank much the day prior, but I was near fighting for my life at around 4:30 pm. And when the clock finally struck 4.45 pm, we finally got to move. I don't think I've been stiffer in my entire damn life.</p>
<p>So, we went to the fake grocery store and bought some fake food, and were just about to head home when <em>I</em>, the <em>team leader</em>, decided was a good time to <em>mess it all up</em>. We were walking past the grey building, when I stopped and pointed toward it. In an attempt to be funny, I said something along the lines of "If all goes to plan, that thing's gonna get cracked open like a cold beer tomorrow" Which made <em>every, single,</em> town resident in the area immediately silence and look at me. We'd been talking about that building all the time, and not a single resident had batted a single eye, but <em>that</em> made them notice all of a sudden. Its confusing, every time you think you have a good grasp of how these things behave, they throw some kind of curveball like that at you, it freaks me out.</p>
<p>But I haven't even mentioned the worst thing about this incident yet. Since this was a strict violation of our purpose (to infiltrate SCP-6717) We're gonna have to stay one more day. The original plan was to enter the building tomorrow, but we'll have to "regain their trust", as if these guys don't forget who you are immediately after you leave their line of sight.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to Hafeez after we're done with this.</p>

<strong>Log:</strong>I think I'm gonna go fucking mad. Working with people who look almost exactly like you is freaky enough, but working with people who look like you, trying to infiltrate a town of <em>fake</em> people who look like you? That REALLY does numbers to your mind, let me tell you. Also, I'm almost certain there is something not good for you in that food.</p>
<p>Today was Saturday, and was a relief compared to yesterday. All we had to do was walk to the diner and buy some "food", then talk to some of the residents. It sounds like a no-brainer, but this too was hard. The way these things speak is so fucking weird. Say you're talking about "sports", discussing that "the ball is round" or something equally pointless, when someone spontaneously switches the topic to talk about the weather, and you just have to immediately roll with it. Or sometimes don't, when the others completely ignore the attempt to switch the topic.</p>
<p>This entire place is also starting to make me lose it. Everything is just so nice and perfect and fake. I feel like I've been losing track of time. I feel like I'm becoming one of them. It feels like I'm in a bad, weird, dream. It's also extremely easy to get lost, in fact, we almost did today, trying to go back to our base house. Since every house and every street is completely identical, trying to find your specific building is near damn impossible. In fact, command had to guide us with the help of drone footage. It was a real ordeal.</p>
<p>Also, the "mailman" came by our house today and gave us a "newspaper". I'll scan it in when I get back. Or someone else will. Cause I'll be taking my damn vacation.</p>

<strong>Log:</strong> Good lord, I was not suited for this mission. None of us really had that much appropriate experience, since we were chosen for our looks, and not things that matter like skill, or teamwork.</p>
<p>I write this safely inside the Site-249 Observation Post 249-C, more back to my old self. I apologize for my crude and unprofessional language in the earlier reports. It was a taxing mission, I was frustrated, and I had no real chemistry with my team members.</p>
<p>Today, was the big day. Today, we went head-on with the grey building.</p>
<p>We woke up early, at 06:10, to be done with everything once the SCP-6717-1 instances woke up. We gathered our gear, brushed our teeth, and set out. Despite waking early, I felt clear-headed. I think it was the relief that my trip was soon to be over. Together, we moved in silence towards the center of SCP-6717.<br/>
Arriving at the center, all was silent. Everything was certainly more creepy that way. I, N9-3, and N9-4 were guarding, our guns raised, and N9-2 was setting up the breaching explosives left by the previous MTF team, along with some of our own. We were not going to risk awaking the entirety of SCP-6717 without at least doing some damage. We also mounted cameras, temperature gauges, and weather stations. Above, a Foundation helicopter was hovering, equipped with missiles. Setting everything up took quite a while, so when we were done, the SCP-6717-1 instances had already gathered in and around the church, listening to their "priest", seemingly unbothered by us. We were still wearing the costumes, so I assume that fooled them. After we had set up the breeching devices and all instruments, I got the honor to press the button. Now, in hindsight, I don't really believe explosives were the way to go, given we had no clue what was inside, but command had made their decision.</p>
<p>So. I pressed the button. While I covered my ears, a massive boom cracked the building open. As the smoke and dust dispersed I was met with a wave of heat, it felt like I had opened an oven. Inside, the building didn't have any floors, like we thought it would. Instead, there was a single large room. And almost as large as the room itself stood a big, black, egg, which must have been over 40 feet tall<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>. We never got to see anything more properly, as the explosion had angered the SCP-6717-1 instances, and we had to get picked up by the helicopter.</p>
<p>For some reason, Hafeez and his team refused to give me clearance to view the file for the egg, strange.</p>

<p>SCP-6717-2 is an object of unknown origin, resembling an egg in shape, measuring 8 meters in width and 12 meters in height, estimated to weigh ca. 600 metric tonnes. SCP-6717-2 is located within the now reconstructed central building of SCP-6717. The building housing SCP-6717-2 is coated in a black metallic material, which is connected to the SCP-6717 power grid. The metal heats the room inside, producing an internal temperature of 45°C. The surface of SCP-6717 is black in color and is made of a silicate-based substance. The substance is anomalously hard, with an absolute hardness scale value of 1250, and a Brinell scale value of 1700 HB. Attempts at piercing or damaging SCP-6717-2 have previously failed, and further attempts are discouraged.</p>
<p>Inside SCP-6717-2 is a liquid substance of unknown composition, with an estimated higher density than water. Thermal and radiographic imaging has revealed a humanoid shape inside SCP-6717-2 assuming a fetal position. Due to the composition of the surface of SCP-6717-2, precise measurements are unable to be made, but the shape is estimated to be 15 meters tall standing upright, assuming standard human anatomical proportions. The humanoid figure has grown by 18cm every year since its discovery in 1998. Assuming linear growth, the entity inside SCP-6717-2 will become too large to fit inside SCP-6717-2 in 2055.</p>
<p>The Hume measurement of SCP-6717-2 is 112, compared to the Hume level of 89 present in SCP-6717.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> on 2009-08-10, an error in the Site-249 power grid infrastructure resulted in SCP-6717 receiving a power input of 94% of its designated 18 daily megawatts for 11 hours. During this timeframe, SCP-6717-1 instances displayed unusual aggression, and the Hume reading of SCP-6717-2 and SCP-6717 changed to 119, and 85 respectively.</p>

<hr/>
<p>In light of the recent discoveries made regarding SCP-6717 and SCP-6717-2, I've been thinking, and I would like to propose a theory regarding SCP-6717.<br/>
SCP-6717-2 requires heat through electricity, presumably to be able to hatch, which it previously needed to source from the U.S. power grid. But a single building requiring an immense power input would look suspicious. But if hundreds of buildings require that input, things aren't that suspicious anymore. And in regards to why SCP-6717 appears so "fake", I'm not exactly certain. Perhaps it doesn't need to appear believable, as no one will come near it given its remoteness. Or who/whatever created SCP-6717, and laid that egg, doesn't quite understand how to fool humans. I believe we should be fearful of whatever might come out of SCP-6717-2. The Hume levels are worrying, and I have a gut feeling that whoever is behind SCP-6717 has reasons to prevent us from reaching that egg.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Dr. Andrea Ortega.</p>
