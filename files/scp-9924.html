<p>SCP-9924</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each SCP-9924 location is to be guarded at all times by Foundation agents. Public access to these locations has been restricted through a variety of explanations, including waste spills, nature preserves, and private property. If an individual enters an SCP-9924 location they are to be removed and given Class A amnestics. If the same individual attempts to enter an SCP-9924 location multiple times, especially following an Omen Event, they are to be investigated for potential association with anomalous objects.</p>
<p>For 24 hours following an Omen Event, Foundation agents are to watch for any entities exiting SCP-9924-1. Any entities that leave during this time are to be apprehended and presumed anomalous.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9924 is a two-meter-wide road made of packed dirt that exists on every continent on Earth. The dimensions and material of SCP-9924 are identical in each instance, regardless of the local soil composition. Changes made to one SCP-9924 instance are not reflected on the others, however any removal or manipulation of the material of SCP-9924 will be reversed if it goes unobserved for more than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-9924 enter an active state for 24 hours following an Omen Event. An Omen Event is defined as a major astronomical,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-770449-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-770449-1')">1</a></sup> social,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-770449-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-770449-2')">2</a></sup> or biological<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-770449-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-770449-3')">3</a></sup> event at some place on Earth.</p>
<p>If an individual walks along SCP-9924 during an active period, they will be transported to SCP-9924-1. SCP-9924-1 is a city built in a variety of architectural styles. People inside SCP-9924-1 will experience a few non-dangerous mental shifts, including vague hallucinations and the inability to keep track of time. These effects have no lasting impact after leaving. A full list of mental effects that have been documented can be found attached to this file.</p>
<p>During active periods, individuals are freely capable of entering and leaving SCP-9924-1 via SCP-9924. At the end of an active period, any individuals who entered through SCP-9924 will be transported to the location where they entered.</p>
<p>SCP-9924-1 is populated by human-like individuals designated SCP-9924-2. Instances of SCP-9924-2 have no name or consistent appearance. Each individual looking at an instance of SCP-9924-2 will see a different person. Age is the primary way of identifying instances, as it will be consistent across all observers. Instances of SCP-9924-2 removed from SCP-9924-1 will lose their anomalous properties. A few instances of SCP-9924-2 have distinct, inhuman appearances. These appearances are visible from any observer. Whether these instances change when leaving SCP-9924-1 is uncertain.</p>

<p><strong>Exploration Log 9924-1:</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-58240<br/>
<strong>Researcher:</strong> Researcher Garcia<br/>
<strong>Omen Event:</strong> The Spring Equinox</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Yeah, loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Good, your body cam is coming through fine</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> So, what kind of things am I looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> We’re trying to learn the origin of this SCP. Look for the center, there should be a castle there.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> That’s where this started?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> We’re not sure, but it’s the best direction to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Whatever you say. I think I can see the castle from here.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> If it’s that massive tower, then yes.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Interesting. Previous expeditions didn’t mention a tower. How far away is it?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Hard to tell, I have to look directly into the sunrise to see it.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Okay, then just try to get closer.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Did you choose this?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Sorry, just making small talk.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I don't think that's entirely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I'm bored, throw me a bone.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You need to stay focused.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Well how am I going to do that when this question is rattling around in my brain?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It's that important to you?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> A lot of things are. Come on, indulge my curiousity.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> No, I do not choose my projects.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Well do you enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You can drop this.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I'll take that as a no.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I am good at it, that’s what matters.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Sort of a bleak way of looking at things.</p>
<p><em>An instance of SCP-9924-2, appearing like a young man, notices D-58240 and approaches.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Sorry, have I greeted you yet?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> You look like you haven’t been here in a while.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> A while? You may be confusing me with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Do you need someone to show you around? It can be jarring.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You should go with it, but don’t trust it too much.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Don’t know if I need directions, I’m just going to that tower.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Well that’s great. I work there actually, so I can help you out.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Is saying hi to people your job?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> No, I’m actually a farmhand. I tend the tower’s garden.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Farmhand and gardener are two different jobs.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> <em>(To Garcia.)</em> I don’t think he cares. <em>(To SCP-9924-2-1.)</em> That’s very interesting, I used to know a farmhand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Really? Me too, that’s why I became one.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Then they must have been nothing alike. So, you know a lot about the tower?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Of course, who doesn’t? It’s the heart of the city.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Do a lot of people go there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Oh no, they’re not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Not allowed?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> That complicates things a bit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Well the gates won’t open for just anyone.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> But you tend the garden, can you get in?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I only tend the one outside. I’ve never seen what it looks like past the gates.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Who do you work for? They’ve gotta be able to get in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> How could it never have seen its supervisor?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Says the voice in my ear telling me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Touche.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> You should still come up and look at the place. There are some beautiful flowers.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed.</em></p>
<p><em>When the tower is within sight, the gate is revealed to be open.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> So much for no one going in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> That doesn’t make any sense. The doors are never open.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Maybe someone important’s coming through.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> It has to be you.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> If I were important, I wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Play along. Whatever gets you inside.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> The way I see it, you’re the one thing that’s different.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I guess you’re right. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Me?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> You’re showing me around, aren't you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’ve never seen the inside.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Neither have I. Come on.</p>
<p><em>They start to go inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> While I appreciate keeping a source of information around, keep in mind these are not normal people.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Oh I don’t trust a single person in this place. They’ve been looking at me weird since I got here, but I have my own curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You don't trust them? Funny way of showing it. You've been awfully friendly.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> It's a way of coping with stress. Makes people like you more, which is usually safer.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Tend and befriend.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It's a psychological theory. Alternative to fight or flight based on human tendencies towards sociability.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Yeah, I guess. It's kept me alive this long</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It can get you killed in a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Don’t talk to me like that, I know the risks better than you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> There’s so many flowers.</p>
<p><em>On the inside of the tower is a large spiral staircase lined with flower boxes.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> And you don’t take care of these ones?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’ve never seen them before now.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Well someone must.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’d love to meet them.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> It’s a long way up.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Then let’s start already.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I suppose I haven't asked, what's your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’m a farmhand.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Not actually what I asked.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’m sorry, what did you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Your name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I don’t think I get the question.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> How do you not—?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I believe it’s saying it does not have a name. More common than you would expect in a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Fine, then I’m calling you Gardener.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Not farmhand?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> No, bad memories with that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I met you today, I’m not about to share my whole life.</p>
<p><em>The tower shakes suddenly.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Did you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><em>It shakes again.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> It started happening when we crossed that floor.</p>
<p><em>The tower begins shaking in regular intervals. Approximately one time per second.</em></p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It sounds like a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> A heartbeat?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I did say it was the heart of the city.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I do not want to hear you be smugly literal right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Whatever, is this dangerous? Are we about to fall?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I don’t think it’s going to shake any more than this.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Wind now? Gardener, what is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> It’s just a light breeze.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> We’re still inside.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You’re almost at the top. It’s possible there’s a mundane reason, but I would assume this is some other property of the tower.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> We’re getting closer to the sky, the air has more say here.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> We’re getting to the end of the stairs now. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Obviously, between the wind and the shaking I’m not about to start running.</p>
<p><em>The two exit to see a large garden.</em></p>

<p>The garden at the top of the tower</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Where'd the flowers go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I'm sure they're somewhere around here?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Just weird to see the peak of the tower have such a bland garden.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Bland? Are we looking at the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Maybe that's the wrong word. Just… compared to the stairs, there's no color.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> It just has to be born.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What, the flowers?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Everything.</p>
<p><em>The wind picks up.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Everything and everyone needs to start somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I guess I can appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Watch its words. It's not talking about the garden anymore.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Are you ready to begin?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Begin what? I didn't agree to anything.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> That was never a requirement.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> No easy escape routes. If this goes wrong, your best bet is to use the flower beds to break your fall. It will hurt, but you will survive.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Do you hear the envoy?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Can't hear anything over this wind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> Of course, then I will have to amplify his voice.</p>
<p><em>It approaches a pillar and puts its hand to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-1:</strong> I’m becoming something more.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Brace yourself.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Gardener, you’re scaring me.</p>
<p><em>The wind appears to reach gale-levels as the instance of SCP-9924-2 begins to dissolve into flower petals.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I don’t think it’s doing anything.</p>
<p><em>The instance dissolves almost entirely, leaving its heart floating in the air, still beating. The petals form into a large face.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">I am the beginning and the birth. I am flowers and petals and wind. I am the start of that which you never want to end, and I am what you miss when it is gone. I am Spring.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What did you do with him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">I am the farmhand as well. He has met his purpose.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I think you’re getting me confused with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You need to get away from there.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">There is no mistaken identity. There is not the premise of a farce. You are meant to be here to begin your tale.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Sorry, the voice in my head is telling me no.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Get away. Now!</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Is that a book?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It’s another anomaly. Do not touch it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">Do you remember how you got here?</span></span></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I walked.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">Your position, how did you reach it?</span></span></p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I didn’t kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> I’m a D-class. We’re supposed to be death row inmates, aren’t we? I don’t remember committing a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I believe you. Maybe there’s a record error. I can try to advocate for you, just get out.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> You're not a very good liar. Why are you so scared of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> It is a highly dangerous anomaly. Touching it may kill you and me both.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-770449-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-770449-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Don't swap out your bad lie for a worse one.</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Fine, it won’t kill you, but it could cause a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9924-2-2:</strong> <span style="font-family: 'Uncial Antiqua' ;font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #c49039">Read it. The tome will answer your questions.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> What’s my name?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> I don't have the records in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> Try again. What's my name?</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> Your name is Amanda Brown.</p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> And what’s my position?</p>
<p><strong>Garcia:</strong> You are a D-class at the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-58240:</strong> You are the worst liar I've ever known.</p>
