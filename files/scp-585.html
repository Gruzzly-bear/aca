            <h1>SCP-585</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-585</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-585-2-4 are to be kept in a standard hazardous-object containment at Site-19. Pencils modified by SCP-585 are extremely dangerous and should be returned to their normal state at the end of testing. As of Incident 585-1, no pencil should be sharpened for more than fifty (50) rotations without O5 level approval.</p>
<p>SCP-585-a is stored in a glass vacuum flask, which is locked in storage vault ██. Special authorization by Dr. ████ or any senior Foundation staff is required for experiments involving SCP-585-a.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-585-2-4 are small, two-hole pencil sharpeners made of brightly-coloured plastic. ‘The Factory’ is printed in slightly raised text on the undersides. Any pencil inserted into the small hole of SCP-585 and turned clockwise will be sharpened, as is normal for a pencil sharpener. However, with each rotation the ‘sharpness’ of the pencil’s point continues to increase without any apparent limit. Any pencil sharpened by SCP-585’s small hole that is then inserted into the larger hole and turned counter-clockwise is ‘unsharpened’ with each rotation undoing the effect of one previous rotation in the small hole. (Only the shape of the pencil is changed — lost mass from shavings is not restored.) The tip of affected pencils can be broken off, but the point will retain its sharpness and remain dangerous.</p>
<p>Preliminary testing indicates that never-sharpened, ‘flat’ pencils reach the normal maximum sharpness a sharpener can achieve after twenty (20) rotations. From this point on SCP-585 will shave exponentially less mass off of the pencil with each rotation. At thirty (30) rotations, a pencil dropped from one (1) meter embedded itself by ten (10) centimeters into a solid steel bar.</p>
<p>SCP-585 works best on thin cylinders of wood cored with graphite. SCP-585 will also function with other easily shave-able materials such as plastic or paper cored with graphite, or with a pure graphite stick. Pure wood or plastic does not produce the effect, nor does any material that cannot be shaved by an ordinary pencil sharpener.</p>
<p>SCP-585-1-4 were recovered from an elementary school in ████ after [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p><strong>Incident 585-1:</strong> A standard HB pencil, never used, was chosen for extended testing of SCP-585-1. Pencil is now designated SCP-585-a.</p>
<p>- After twenty (20) clockwise rotations in the small hole of SCP-585, SCP-585-a was applied to a sheet of paper. Functioned as a normal pencil</p>
<p>- After thirty (30) rotations, SCP-585-a was confirmed capable of piercing steel. A sheet of paper was sliced in half by the point.</p>
<p>- After forty (40) rotations, SCP-585-a was attached to a string and dropped from one (1) meter’s height onto bedrock. SCP-585-a penetrated 0.5 meters.</p>
<p>- After fifty (50) rotations, the same test as above was performed. SCP-585-a penetrated five (5) meters of bedrock.</p>
<p>- After sixty (60) rotations, SCP-585-a penetrated fifty (50) meters of bedrock.</p>
<p>Testing continued until at exactly one hundred (100) rotations, SCP-585-a’s tip began radiating extreme heat, causing its wooden component to burst into flames. Further testing on the graphite core [DATA EXPUNGED]. The item was deemed too high of a risk to keep, considering that another could be easily created, and SCP-585-a was inserted into the large hole of SCP-585-1. The extreme heat caused SCP-585-1 to melt. SCP-585-a placed in a vacuum flask for storage.</p>
