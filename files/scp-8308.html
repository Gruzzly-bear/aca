            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8308</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8308 has been legally pronounced dead. Ownership of its works has been passed on to the Wilhelm estate. All known public recordings of SCP-8308's livestream have been deleted.</p>
<p>SCP-8308 is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Should SCP-8308 become responsive at any point, Site Director Richard Donn is to be notified immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8308 is Tony Wilhelm, author of ██ novels in the 'pulp fantasy' genre. It assertedly has the ability to perceive other realities, which highly resemble SCP-8308's novels. However, it is currently unknown how much of its work was inspired by its visions. The exact mechanisms and limits of SCP-8308's abilities are also unknown.</p>

<p>SCP-8308 at the beginning of its livestream</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On 02/12/2024, SCP-8308 began a livestream on the social media platform ██████, which it began by announcing that it would be writing its next novel over the next week. It then began to narrate a chronological sequel to its previous work, <em>The Mourner's Magiks</em>, in extreme, monotonous detail, which did not fit its previous style of writing. Throughout this narration, it looked directly at its webcam, did not blink, and took no breaks whatsoever.</p>
<p>On 05/12/2024, approximately 87 hours from the beginning of SCP-8308's livestream, Foundation webcrawler Memo-02 ("Marathon") alerted the local Site-309 to its unusual activity. After some deliberation, the livestream was shut down and an investigation proceeded.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>
<div class="report-box">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Recovery</span></h3>
</div>
<p>SCP-8308 was found at its home in Poplar Grove, Illinois, where it was still narrating its novel to its webcam, seemingly unaware that its access to the ██████ streaming platform had been blocked. Despite not having moved for around 90 hours, it did not show any signs of having urinated or otherwise dirtied himself.</p>
<p>SCP-8308, which continued its narration, did not react to any Foundation agents' attempts at communication as it was brought to a Site-309 Kant <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/and-this-one-explains-humes" target="_blank" target="_blank">Hume</a> Imager, where a Hume level of ~340 was observed localized within its brain. This level did not change until approximately 34 hours later, at which it dropped to a baseline, nonanomalous level as SCP-8308 stopped narrating. Notably, this final narration did not bring any narrative conclusion to the story of the sequel, instead stopping in the middle of a dialogue exchange.</p>
<p>Dr. Noah Addams was then able to conduct an interview with SCP-8308, which became responsive.</p>

<div class="quote-block">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Mr. Wilhelm?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> Hmm? Ah, this is different. Quite different. And not quite what I'm looking for. But I suppose I can always expand my range.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> …Tony? I'd like to ask you—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> Not sure if my publisher will like it, though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Mr. Wilhelm, please. I'd like to ask you some questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> Ah, wait…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8308 looks to its sides, then at Dr. Addams.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> It seems like I'm here, then. You seem important. Dignified. Royalty, perhaps? What was it you said, your highness?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Dr. Addams is fine. I wanted to know more about your livestream, specifically—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> Oh, yes! My <em>look</em> into the wonderful world of Descotes. It's one of my favorites, even if not many exciting events happen.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Why did you decide to livestream this… so-called look?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> Creative processes are everything these days. I just wanted to share mine. Surely a woman of your stature should understand. You must show the little ones your own process, sometimes. To demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Demonstrate what?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8308 points to himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> The <em>gap.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Addams pauses for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> I see. And can you tell me your process?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8308 raises an eyebrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> I'd prefer not to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Addams:</strong> Wh— what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8308:</strong> I'd really rather not.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8308 became unresponsive for the rest of the interview. Upon being escorted to a containment cell, SCP-8308 sat in a chair and has since remained motionless, showing no need to blink, eat, drink, urinate, or defecate.</p>
<p>Due to the hypothetical nature of SCP-8308's abilities, further investigations &amp; interviews have been attempted. However, SCP-8308 has shown to be immune to amnestics, psychic suggestion (through both paratechnology and/or reality-bending), memetics, and other miscellaneous anomalous measures.</p>
<p>On 14/03/2025, during a routine inspection within the Site-309 Kant Hume Imager, SCP-8308 became responsive for a moment, and the Hume levels localized within SCP-8308's brain rapidly elevated to around ~360. It closed its eyes, opened its mouth, then shook its head. SCP-8308 then spoke:</p>
<div class="quote-block">
<p>I'd prefer not to anymore. Not here.</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-8308 has been unresponsive since.</p>
