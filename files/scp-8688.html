            <h1>SCP-8688</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> AO-8688</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> AO-8688 is in Site-43's I&amp;T Isolation and Storage area, kept within containment chamber IT-8688.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> AO-8688 is a set of anomalous objects consisting of a desktop computer, monitor, peripherals and assorted unknown components. AO-8688 has undetermined anomalous properties - the Foundation is, however, positive that containment should be continued. I'm sure it's important, I'll get to it once I can get Eileen off my ass.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Hey, this is Lillihammer — I swear I'm going to get back to this eventually, so <strong>NOBODY ELSE TOUCH IT</strong>, okay?</p>
<div class="danke site">
<p>Really Lillian? You thought that this might help me?</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>I haven't looked at it in a while, alright? What does the file say?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<p>You still haven't looked at it? It explains why nobody else worked on this file, they're all too scared of you and your threatening addendum.</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>I'll show you my threatening addendum.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following this email correspondence, Researcher Garrison attempted to locate AO-8688, to begin further research.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 11/19/2018</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Footage is from Foundation security cameras within Site-43's I&amp;T AO containment archive, inside of Chamber IT-8688. Heather Garrison was the only researcher in attendance.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Heather Garrison enters the chamber, placing a pad and pen on the desk, as well as setting a tape recorder down. She presses "record".</em></p>
<p><strong>Heather Garrison:</strong> This is Heather Garrison, taking care of Lilli's messes. I mean, examining AO-8688. AO-8688 appears to be some old computer covered in a thick layer of dust. I don't think the dust is anomalous.</p>
<p><em>Heather wipes her finger over the keyboard, and the monitor turns on. Current information suggests that AO-8688 has been plugged in to a power source for the entire span since last worked on by Dr. Lillihammer</em></p>
<p><strong>Heather Garrison:</strong> It's still plugged in? Lillian, don't you know you should always power down your electronics? Now let's see—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Garrison looks at the monitor — an unlock screen for a currently unidentified operating system is displayed. The image stutters, glitching and being replaced with a minor cognitohazard for 5 milliseconds. Heather winces, and looks away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Heather Garrison:</strong> Well. That's definitely Lil's work — I'd recognize it anywhere at this point. It feels like her.</p>
<p><em>Heather begins to write on the page. As she does, she dictates to the tape recorder as well.</em></p>
<p><strong>Heather Garrison:</strong> I am now transcribing this with pen and paper, as I record it into a vocal recorder. I believe that I have been exposed to a minor cognitohazard designed to induce forgetfulness or lack of interest in this anomalous object.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the result of Lillian's possessiveness, and not related to the anomaly. However, due to the fact that the anomalous effect may be more than just one of Lillihammer's creations, I am recording this across multiple media forms, in an attempt to avoid any antimemetic effects.</p>
<p><em>Heather puts down her pen and stops the recording. She releases a frustrated, but subdued yell of frustration.</em></p>
<p><strong>Heather Garrison:</strong> Thanks Lils. Guess you have to help me out here.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Dr. Garrison exited the containment chamber, and appeared to pause for a second. After a beat, she resumed walking, exhibiting only slight symptoms of disorientation. After Dr. Garrison examined her notepad, it is noted that she reacted in surprise and frustration based on the contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Okay, in my defense - it's really funny. Like it's so rough and a complete hack job of a meme? I can't believe I made this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<p>I can't believe you work-roofied me, from something you did over two decades ago. Can you please fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Huh. Two decades?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<p>Yes Lillian, time unfortunately, marches ever onwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>I don't think that's right.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<p>Lilli, it doesn't matter how many times you blow up the site, time is still passing.</p>
</div>
<div class="danke site">
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Hmm. Doubtful.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After Dr. Lillihammer was alerted to the existence of a cognitohazard limiting research into AO-8688, a countermeme was developed that negated the effect, allowing Dr. Garrison to continue research into the anomaly. After beginning research into the AO, Dr. Garrison moved for the object to be reclassified as a full SCP. Reclassification is pending.</p>
