</div>
<p>SCP-7262 is to be kept in Site-246's anomalous medical wing and monitored daily for any threats to its health. Due to the nature of the anomaly, SCP-7262 has been permitted to wear a short sleeve t-shirt and athletic shorts for ease of documentation.</p>
<p>Within its first week at the Foundation, SCP-7262 requested the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A television - <span style="color: green">Approved</span></li>
<li>A Nintendo switch - <span style="color: gold">Pending</span></li>
<li>A selection of books - <span style="color: green">Approved</span></li>
<li>Access to social media - <span style="color: red">Denied</span></li>
<li>Access to only Discord - <span style="color: red">Denied</span></li>
<li>An art tablet - <span style="color: gold">Pending</span></li>
<li>Traditional art supplies - <span style="color: green">Approved</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-7262 is permitted to submit requests for items, which are subject for approval depending on their nature. SCP-7262 is not to be permitted access to any items it could use to potentially harm itself.</p>
<p>SCP-7262 is to be administered Quetiapine, Fluvaxomine, and Bupropion on a regular basis by its medical team. Requested augments to this regimen are to be reviewed by Site-264's medical staff.</p>
<p>SCP-7262 is to have weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Kenneth Hart. As SCP-7262's mental state is linked with its anomalous properties, staff are to refrain from relaying upsetting information to SCP-7262 unless deemed absolutely necessary. Failure to do so may trigger its anomalous properties. Additionally, usage of SCP-7262's preferred name and pronouns is recommended when interacting with it.</p>
<p><strong>Edit as of 05/11/2022:</strong> Due to SCP-7262's aversion to eating as a result of its poor mental state, culinary staff have been notified to provide meals that it has expressed favoritism towards in the past.</p>

</div>
<p>SCP-7262 is a 24-year-old non-binary human formerly identified as Jonathan "Gutz" Everett. When in a heightened emotional state, SCP-7262’s body will undergo multiple physiological changes that would typically result in death. These changes typically entail damage to the structure and function of joints, ligaments, and tendons, as well as complex fractures. Organ damage, internal bleeding, and gross distension of limbs, trunk, and head are also common.</p>
<p>Duplication or disappearance of organs and bodily fluids has also been observed. It is also typical for bodily fluids to become discolored or to be replaced with various beverages. However, this damage does not appear to cause SCP-7262 any emotional distress or discomfort. For a list of documented alterations, see <a href="javascript:;">SCP-7262 Alteration Log</a>. When SCP-7262 returns to its emotional baseline, all of the damages will reverse with no complications.</p>
<p>It has been noted that SCP-7262's medical records prior containment indicate that it had recently sustained three broken ribs, a broken arm, and a broken nose. When discovered, no proof of this injury was present, leading to the conclusion that SCP-7262's anomalous properties reset any non-anomalous injuries.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Um- this is gonna sound crazy. But I- my body is messed up! My ribcage is visible- a-and nothing else! No organs or blood or anything! We-Well, there’s some blood but it’s pink! And it- it doesn’t hurt! It should hurt! I just lifted my sweatshirt, cause like- I felt it push in! And this—</p>

<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> We’re gonna send an ambulance to your home. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Does my name matter?</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> It’s standard to know who I’m talking to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> It-It's G-Gutz.</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> Alright, Gutz. Have you taken any medications recently?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Only my psych meds! Can you tell me what’s w-wrong with me? Why is this happening?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 continues to sob]</em></p>

<p><em>[SCP-7262 takes a deep, long breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> Good job, sir. We’re going to get you the help you need. What medications do you take?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Seroquel, F-Fluvaxomine, Wellbutrin! But I didn’t take drugs! <em>[breath]</em> I-I only take my medications as prescribed! I’m not an addict, I-I don’t experiment! I-I'm out of these anyway! I- I feel like I can’t breathe! I-It should hurt! B-Breathing this hard should hurt! But there’s nothing to hurt!</p>

<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> Do you have a history of taking drugs or alcohol? And do you take any other medications than the ones you told me about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Um— god what’s the name? I don’t know. I-I take one for seizures? It’s yellow and starts with a T!</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> Give me a minute… ah, Topiramate. Gutz, do you take anything else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> J-Just some anti-nausea meds and an EpiPen!</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator:</strong> Can you tell me the names?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> It doesn’t matter, <em>[breath]</em> I-I didn’t overdose on anything!</p>

<p>Foundation operatives intercepted the call. Emergency Medical Task Force Iota-44 “Bedside Manner” was dispatched to assess the situation in the place of civilian emergency service workers. During SCP-7262’s transfer to the Foundation, it was determined that its condition was stable. It is noted that SCP-7262 was found with a half opened bottle of <em>Quetiapine</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> in its lap.</p>

<strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Stanley Diamond</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Hello, SCP-7262. That is what you’ll be known as, for clarification.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Oh, cool.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> ‘Cool’?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Yeah. That’s cool. Just ‘7262’ would do. But yeah. That’s a cool name.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I have to admit, I’ve seen a lot of sapient anomalies and not one of them thought their SCP designation was cool.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> <em>[shrugs]</em> What can I say? I like that better than my deadname. If I had to chose the name you people called me, it would be Gutz. Cause that’s my name. But, the number is like… a cool nickname.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> ‘Deadname’. Are you gender non-conforming?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Yeah. I’m non-binary. I’m still like, super confused about all of this, but it makes me really happy that you asked. You guys are cool with that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I’m personally fine with it. In general here, your identity doesn’t really matter to us since we’re not going to be addressing it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Cool with me! <em>[smiles]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> How are you feeling right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Weird. I’m… feeling a lot of emotions… I’m just… super confused. Why is this happening?</p>
<p><em>[Multiple disembodied eyes with pink and purple irises as well as black scleras<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> materialized around its body. These eyes began to produce cyan blue tears. As this occurred, its eyes took on the same appearance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I was next going to ask how you noticed the first manifestation. How did it feel? Did you feel anything just now?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 lifted its arms, pulling up its sleeves.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Ah- it happened again! This one is uh, less freaky somehow. I’m not literally missing organs. I don’t think. And uh, no. I didn't feel anything.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 smooths its fingers under one of the eyes on its arm, causing the eye to blink.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Pull up your jumpsuit leg.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 does as instructed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> God, it seems they’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Is your vision affected?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> No. I can see just fine. I- this is what it was like last time! I was uh… going through it. And suddenly, the pillow I was hugging caved into my stomach. I lifted my hoodie, and I saw it.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262's calm smile fades.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Can you see out of those other eyes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> No. I can feel the tears against my skin, though. This is so weird…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I see. <em>[writes something down]</em> SCP-7262, we noticed that on a private account of yours, you draw artworks containing people in similar situations to your anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Oh, yeah. Uh, pastel gore, aesthetic gore art work. It’s kinda how I get out my feelings when times are tough. Instead of um, gouging out my organs, I draw characters gouging out their organs. It’s calming.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I see. That’s definitely something we will be looking into.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> It’s not like, an anomaly or whatever. Many people draw it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Yes, but there’s a reason that your artwork started to reflect in real life. That’s definitely not a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> I suppose it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Yes, and your recent artworks depict characters that look like you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> So?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> It was just an observation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> It's weird you guys are just okay with me. Being… how I am. I know I have a lot of problems… mental, physical, and now uh… this. And I'm also just… really anxious being here. I know that- I don't really know anything about this place. I just want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Well, the whole reason you're here is so we can help you with your anomaly. We see all sorts of people in situations like yours. We can help you with your other issues, too. We promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> You’ve got a scar on your face that seems kinda shiny.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> A-Ah, yes.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Diamond smooths his index finger over his scar.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> There are crystal pieces imbedded in it. It was the result of a containment breach. That's all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Well, I think it looks cool.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 touches one of its thighs]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> I- <em>[pause]</em> I’ve got scars, too. I’m still trying to understand that… I shouldn’t be ashamed. And uh… to stop adding more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> We’ll get you in with a therapist.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> I can’t afford a therapist. Hell, I'm out of my medication because I'm fighting with my insurance. <em>[pause]</em> Most of my medication.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> You’re not paying for anything here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> O-Oh. That’s a welcomed change.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> <em>[chuckles]</em> You’re not the first one with that reaction.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Oh um, I have another question.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> What do my friends think happened to me? I- I recently made a habit of disappearing for a few weeks then worrying them. I don't… I don't want them to think that I'm dead. Especially um… <em>[shakes head]</em> never mind. Can I like… talk to them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> That's… still being processed. But, it's highly unlikely you'll be given internet access. At least, not social media.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 looks visibly worried.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Wh-What? I can't talk to them? Like- e-ever again?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Most likely not, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> N-No! You can't be serious! For real?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 begins to shake. It grips the sides of its head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I apologize, SCP-7262. But they can't know what happened to you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 places a hand on its chest. A pink substance, later identified to be SCP-7262's blood, seeps through its clothing and stains its hand. SCP-7262 then performs a pulling motion, revealing a human heart colored similarly to SCP-7262's blood. SCP-7262 looks to Dr. Diamond. He notes seeing SCP-7262's iris shift color to match its blood, as well as having a misshapen pupil which Dr. Diamond described as 'heart-shaped'. SCP-7262 begins to cry.]</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The week of SCP-7262's entrance into the Foundation, a thorough psychological evaluation was conducted on SCP-7262 by Dr. Hart. The following are the results.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-7262's anomaly appears to be triggered when it enters a heightened emotional state, primarily negative emotions. SCP-7262 has the following diagnostics on file:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Borderline Personality Disorder</em></li>
<li><em>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</em></li>
<li><em>Major Depressive Disorder</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although not an exhaustive list, the following behaviors have been observed:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Poor self esteem;</em></li>
<li><em>Self defeating and harming behaviors;</em></li>
<li><em>Suicidal ideation;</em></li>
<li><em>Panic and anxiety attacks with no external trigger;</em></li>
<li><em>Extreme emotional swings;</em></li>
<li><em>Dissociation;</em></li>
<li><em>Reliance on social media;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>SCP-7262 has been kept on its previously prescribed medications to attempt to alleviate its symptoms.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, SCP-7262 appeared incredibly distressed by the fact that it would not be allowed to contact any one from the outside world for the entirety of its time in containment. In response, its anomalous effect has been rapidly activating multiple times a day. Attempts to alleviate this stress in other ways are currently being discussed.</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>It was decided that as SCP-7262's mindset appears to play an integral part in its anomaly's function, research is to be done into its past relations and interactions.</p>
<p>The following will be split into three separate addenda:</p>
<p>Addendum 2-A: In-person Relations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup><br/>
Addendum 2-B: Interpersonal Relations<br/>
Addendum 2-C: Familial Relations</p>

<h5 id="toc8"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum 2-A: In-Person Relations</strong></span></span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<p>Foundation psychologist Dr. Kenneth Hart reached out to a collection of persons that SCP-7262 has known within recent years for further information about SCP-7262. All interviewees were told that SCP-7262 is a missing person.</p>
<p>Although many interviews revealed similar information, below are relevant portions of these interviews that revealed unique information. During the interviews, SCP-7262 was referred to with masculine honorifics. The transcripts have been altered to reflect its identity.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Interviewed: Dylan Bray (former friend)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> You only knew [Mx.] Everett for a few years, then?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Bray:</strong> Yep. We weren't best friends or anything, but I got along with him fine. First few years of high school. I don't think I could tell you anything about why he'd be missing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Well, any information is helpful. What type of person was he back then?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Bray:</strong> Less weird. He made more efforts to actually interact with the other guys in his grade.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Bray:</strong> It means what I said it means. I kinda stopped associating once he started identifying as "non-binary" or whatever. I thought only girls subscribed to that shit. He started focusing more on school then, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Interviewed: Alan Ryan (college peer)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> When did [Mx.] Everett’s activity begin to dwindle?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ryan:</strong> First semester, third year. His first and mostly second year, he was one of the club’s most active and hard working members. But, he came back the next year different. I think it was stress. He had his first seizure during the club, his health issues probably took a toll on him. He eventually just stopped showing up all together. Which is a shame, he’s a really talented artist. I wonder what he’s doing now. Besides uh, being missing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. So you think he began to miss because of his health issues?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ryan:</strong> That, and something else. Even before his seizures started that next year, he was different. I could tell something else was going on. His health issues didn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Physical health issues tend to induce mental health issues. If I'm right, he already had mental health issues, which was probably rather tough on him.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ryan:</strong> Yeah… I felt bad for him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> What types of artwork did [Mx.] Everett do? Do you still have any of his club assignments?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ryan:</strong> Oh, I have a few. But obviously not with me. He did these really fun cartoony-style human drawings. He did this one piece with tons of colors and a figure with their head coming off. It was an assignment for a piece based on personal experience. It's the last illustration he submitted before his activity began to fully tank.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ryan:</strong> Yeah. Like I said, he was a real talent. I … I hope you guys find him.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Interviewed: Xander Wells (current friend)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Mr. Wells:</strong> We… last met in person a few months ago. Their car got totaled early last month, so they haven't been able to go too many places. It has had to uber if he really needs it, but knowing him, he's primarily stayed in its house. Ordering things to the house. I offered to go to his place, or pick him up and drive to mine, or just be the one that drives us around, but he turned me down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Why do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wells:</strong> Poor thing suffers from a boatload of issues. They assumed that I'd see it as a burden that he doesn't want to do the driving. I tried to insist, but he wasn't hearing it. I've been really worried about its mental state.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Expand on that.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wells:</strong> He’s been withdrawing from social stuff. We’re in this Discord server together. They've been talking more in the vent channel. I messaged him about it privately, and it dodges the questions. They’ve said some really concerning things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Like?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wells:</strong> “It would be easier if I could just disappear”. “I wish I could scoop out my insides”. “I feel like cutting my arms into pieces”. Stuff like that. He does gore art work, and it’s beautiful. Usually he just draws his OCs- his characters. But recently the character they’ve been drawing looks like them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. So he’s been expressing the urge to hurt himself?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wells:</strong> <em>[Nods]</em> Yeah. I… I really miss him. I hope he’s alive. I… I need him to be alive.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTICE:</strong></em> Mr. Wells discord profile has been identified as user <em>telecryptid</em> nicknamed <em>📺Local TV Man📺</em></p>

<p>Research was done into SCP-7262’s family members. It was discovered that SCP-7262 was raised by its father Robert Everett with its mother Jane Everett absent. It was raised alongside its older brother Aaron Everett.</p>
<p>SCP-7262’s father refused further interrogation claiming he wanted nothing to do with SCP-7262. Fortunately, it’s brother agreed to participate in questioning about SCP-7262. The resulting interview is documented below.</p>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWED:</strong> Aaron Everett<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Hart</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Hello, Mr. Everett. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> No problem. I- it's been a bit since I've talked to Jon. I can't believe he's missing. I have no idea where he could've gone. Besides, you know. <em>[hesitates]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> The afterlife. It would make sense if he just… couldn't take it one day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. Mr. Everett, is there anything going on in your brother's life that you think would cause him to attempt serious harm to himself?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> I mean, he has BPD. Everything makes him think that way. But, in particular… <em>[hesitates]</em> He called dad asking for money. Jon <em>never</em> asks dad for help. Dad told him to meet in person, so he ubered over there despite being broke. He must have been super desperate. I don't really know how the conversation went. But it didn't end in any money lent. That's all I know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. What type of relationship does your brother have with your father?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> They don't have one. Not now, anyway. Dad kicked him out of the house for being non-binary the second he turned 18. Literally, he woke him up at two in the morning and said he had twenty minutes to gather his belongings.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> That's terrible. Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> He stayed with a friend until I moved out just a few months after. Then, he stayed with me until I helped with the funds for him to go to college. I-I don't know that much about his identity and stuff, but he's always gonna be my brother- er, I don't know what term he prefers. Anyway, I'll always care for him. I do my best to help him out. But, his recent financial troubles have been getting at him. He… he doesn't ask for help. I had to beg him to take the ride to college. Whatever happened made him desperate enough to ask dad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Are you still in regular contact with your father?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> No. Dad never officially cut me off or anything, but I kinda strayed from dealing with him as time went on. Because he's…</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Everett points to his head with his index finger pointing outwards, moving his wrist in a circular motion.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> I'm tempted to ask what happened. To ask my dad. But he'd probably give me some twisted version of the story. Jesus. I'd never forgive my dad if he's the reason I'll never see my brother again. I-I know he was on the ledge a lot… <em>[sighs]</em> this is all so nightmarish.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Thank you for your time. You'll be updated if we have any updates.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Everett:</strong> Thanks. I'd do anything to just ensure that he's safe. I… I hope you guys find him.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> You need to eat. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> The same. The same as every other day. I don't want to be here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Well, I'm really sorry about that. But, we can't release you. It could be dangerous with an anomaly as unpredictable as yours.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> This fucking sucks. I just- <em>[trails off]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Well, I have some questions to ask you. We noticed while looking through your socials-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> You went through my messages?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> We needed to find any information that could help us find what events may have lead to why your anomaly manifested. We've noticed a topic that was mentioned a lot was your relationship with your father. And an alleged conversation that took place the day before your anomaly manifested. Could you elaborate on what happened?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> I don't want to talk about what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Alright, you don't have to. Next, I wanted to ask about your friends.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> My friends? You mean the ones you're letting think I'm dead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> That's still being discussed. You seemed to grow distant from them, particularly in the last few months.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> So?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> It was clear that they cared a lot about you. They all seemed really worried about your mental decline.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> I was just being a bother. They shouldn't have worried so much.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> I… see. Specifically, I wanted to ask you about your relationship with Xander Wells.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 visibly flinches. It crosses its arms, turning its head away from Dr. Diamond.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> What about him?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> From our research, he appears to care a lot about you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Yeah. He does. I… I care a lot about him, too. <em>[mutters something]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 was quiet for a moment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Why do you care? You're never gonna let me see any of them again. I'll never see them, I'll never see him!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262's voice raises.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Why did this have to happen to me? My dad always said people had to walk around eggshells on me, that I complain too much! So I try to not ask for help. The one time I asked for help it leads to this fucking mess!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> Take a few deep breaths, 7262. It's going to-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Be okay? Fuck off with that bullshit!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 begins to cough, coughing up a lime green liquid. The skin and fabric on its throat and chest begins to decay, revealing its bones, which were wrapped in snapdragon flowers. Lime-green tears flow down its cheeks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7262:</strong> Nothing is ever gonna be okay again! This is fucking miserable! I wanna go home!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7262 pounds its hands against the sides of the bed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Diamond:</strong> We can pick this up later.</p>
