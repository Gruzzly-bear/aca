<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All suspected SCP-9797-A instances not in Foundation custody are to be monitored for signs of symptom progression. Operatives embedded in medical networks will investigate potential SCP-9797-A instances: telltale signs are depression, apathy, alexithymia, and hypoxemia coupled with a notable lack of suicidal thoughts. Suspected SCP-9797-A instances must be prescribed high-dose antidepressants as a preventative measure and undergo routine blood tests.</p>
<p>SCP-9797-A instances in Phase 2 or greater are to be taken into permanent Foundation custody. Contained instances are allowed standard amenities and psychiatric care for non-hostile sapient humanoids per Foundation Code of Conduct and Ethics.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Additionally, SCP-9797-A-2 instances are allowed non-obstructive interaction with on-site personnel until signs of progression to Phase 3, at which point they pose a risk of harm to others.</p>
<p>Personnel suspected of exposure to SCP-9797-B may resume work under psychiatric monitoring, preventative medication, and routine blood testing. Personnel will immediately be contained on-site should they exhibit signs of transformation into SCP-9797-A-2. However, they are permitted to continue duties until they pose a threat to Foundation personnel, per Foundation Code of Conduct and Ethics.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9797 is an anomalous, contagious disease affecting exclusively human subjects (referred to as SCP-9797-A) initially resembling common depressive mood disorders. Its vector of transmission is a thick black fluid generated (referred to as SCP-9797-B) by SCP-9797-A instances. SCP-9797-A subjects invariably share additive symptoms in five phases of infection (noted as SCP-9797-A-1 through -5):</p>
<p>Phase 1: Symptoms are mostly indistinguishable from major depressive disorder or similar mood disorders. SCP-9797-A-1 instances experience fatigue, hopelessness or despair, alexithymia, and high pain tolerance. Treatment of SCP-9797-A-1 instances is possible with high doses of antidepressant medication (particularly SSRIs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> in conjunction with NDRIs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>), but cannot be cured and must be medicated indefinitely. The approximate duration of Phase 1 without treatment is eleven months.</p>
<p>Phase 2: SCP-9797-A-2 instances experience mild hypoxemia, progressive loss of smell and taste, and severe fatigue and alexithymia. The skin of SCP-9797-A-2 instances becomes tinged dark due to hypoxemia and the presence of SCP-9797-B within their blood. SCP-9797-A-2 instances often commit acts of self-harm; however, they seemingly cannot commit suicide or otherwise voluntarily enter highly dangerous situations. The approximate duration of Phase 2 is seven months. Antidepressants are largely ineffective at slowing the progression of SCP-9797 at Phase 2 or greater.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Cysts containing SCP-9797-B begin growing in epithelial tissue of SCP-9797-A-3 instances. Cysts may grow as large as 5 cm, and when burst, spurt out a large quantity of SCP-9797-B. Direct contact with this substance risks transmission of infection. SCP-9797-A-3 instances cannot smell, taste, feel pain, or see color. Additionally, instances report extremely severe fatigue and complete lack of emotion. The approximate duration of Phase 3 is two months.</p>
<p>Phase 4: SCP-9797-A-4 instances experience pseudocoma. Instances’ entire bodies are covered with black cysts. Direct contact is likely to result in transmission. SCP-9797-A-4 instances exhibit severe hypersomnia; instances sleep or are otherwise unresponsive for up to 20 hours a day. The approximate duration of Phase 4 is one month.</p>
<p>Phase 5: SCP-9797-A-5 instances rapidly lose weight despite intravenous nutrition. Instances’ bodies gradually turn black and grey over the course of Phase 5. After approximately nine to ten days, SCP-9797-A-5 instances vanish. Inorganic implants or fixtures are unaffected by the process.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9797.14.3.2023:</strong> Discovery</p>
<p>On 9 March 2023, Marathon.aic intercepted and redirected an emergency welfare check request to Site-51 following suspicion of anomalous activity. Foundation Urban Procurement Division agent Anthony Crawson was dispatched to 4300 Lilac Way, Stafford, VA disguised as local police. Crawson breached the apartment and extracted SCP-9797<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> . The following bodycam footage was recorded during the incident:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>&lt;BEGIN VIDEO&gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p>Crawson approaches the door of SCP-9797 and knocks. A viscous black substance is seen oozing on the floorboards.</p>
<p>Crawson: Stafford County Police! We're here to help. Please come to the door.</p>
<p><em>No response is heard. Crawson continues knocking.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: (shouting) Police! Open the door, we’re here to help!</p>
<p><em>No response is heard. Crawson puts his ear to the door. Muffled sounds can barely be heard from inside.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: (shouting) Open the door!</p>
<p>No response is heard. Crawson pulls a keychain from his pocket and unlocks the apartment door. He draws his pistol and enters.</p>
<p>Crawson: Stafford Police! Show yourself!</p>
<p><em>Crawson enters the main room. The floor is covered in black ooze. SCP-9797 is laying on a couch, immobile. It is covered in black cysts. The ooze emanates from various wounds. A TV is playing opposite the couch. Dishes, food packaging, and numerous bottles pile on the table and around the couch.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: (muttering) Damnit.</p>
<p><em>Crawson proceeds to clear the rest of the apartment. Various bottles and microwave food items litter the floor in the main room, kitchen, and bedroom. Most surfaces of the bathroom are stained black and red.</em></p>
<p><em>Crawson returns to the subject, where he produces sampling vials and collects the black substance. He notices the eyes of SCP-9797 tracking him.</em></p>
<p><em>Crawson crouches to the head of SCP-9797.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: You awake? Talk to me, what happened?</p>
<p><em>No response. Crawson checks pulse and breathing of SCP-9797.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Breathing is heavy. Pulse weak but present.</p>
<p><em>Crawson tilts the head of the anomaly and shines a flashlight into its eyes.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Pupillary response intact. Hey buddy, we’re gonna get you better, alright? Just stay still.</p>
<p><em>Crawson moves to pick up SCP-9797. In doing so, he accidentally presses directly on a cyst, bursting it. Pus lands on his face and neck.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Shit shit shit, it’s in my eye! Damnit!</p>
<p><em>Crawson drops SCP-9797 and rushes to the apartment bathroom.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Shower, shower! Where's the damn shower!</p>
<p><em>He locates the shower. He washes his neck and face thoroughly.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Ugh. God I hope I didn't catch anything-</p>
<p><em>Crawson pauses.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: What the hell?</p>
<p><em>Crawson tracks his finger left and right with his eyes.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Huh. Hope medical's competent for once.</p>
<p><em>Crawson returns to the body.</em></p>
<p>Crawson: Alright, buddy, let's try that again. Hope I didn't hurt 'cha too badly.</p>
<p><em>Carefully, he lifts SCP-9797 and transports it to his vehicle.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9797.15.3.2023:</strong> Debriefing</p>
<p>In accordance with standard procedure, Agent Anthony Crawson was debriefed by Researcher Caroline Brown, researcher within the Urban Procurement Division and the assigned Research and Containment Head of SCP-9797. The interview was conducted via intercom, recorded below, to prevent violation of quarantine.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Researcher Brown: Recording started. Debrief with Anthony Crawford, Foundation operative assigned to SCP-9797. Today is March 14, 2023. Am I loud and clear?</p>
<p>Crawford: Loud and clear. Good to see you, Caroline. But do you really have to go through this every time?</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Good to see you, too, Anton. And I'm just being safe. Anyway, onto the questions. “Please describe first contact with the anomaly.”</p>
<p>Crawford: It was… strange, more than anything. There was black gunk everywhere. Like someone spilled paint all over the floor. The lady didn’t look too hot, of course, and she wasn’t moving. I thought she was dead. Being the source of all the gunk, she was pretty much covered in the stuff. And where she wasn’t covered in it, she looked like she had the plague or something. Big dark bubbles basically everywhere.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: "What indicated it was anomalous in nature?"</p>
<p>Crawford: You've seen it yourself. I’m no expert in medical stuff and whatnot, but I’m pretty sure people with the plague don’t start bleeding black enough to cover a whole apartment.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Yeah. It's… disturbing, to say the least. Okay, “Please describe the surroundings of the anomaly.”</p>
<p>Crawford: You ever watch those videos where they clean out hoarders’ houses? It was kinda like the “before” segment of those. Packages, food, bottles, paper towels, plates, you get the idea. Junk everywhere, like she hadn’t gotten up in weeks. And- ugh, the smell. Smelled like death and rot. I can’t imagine what drives someone to live like that.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Interesting. “Did you notice any obviously anomalous materials or objects other than the anomaly itself?”</p>
<p>Crawford: The black stuff of course. But other than that, not really. She seemed like a normal person who, well, happened to draw a terrible hand.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: I’ve… visited the anomaly. Just for description, you know how it goes. There’s something about it that makes me… ugh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Crawford: What, angry or something?</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: I don’t know! Maybe angry, but also sad, and also afraid. Like, what if that happened to my mother? What if she died, all 'cause she went to water her flowers or something, and just so happened to breathe in some bad air? I don’t know what I’d do, Anton.</p>
<p>Crawford: Listen to yourself. You sound ridiculous right now. Plus, you’re asking the wrong person.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Maybe. Maybe I just need to vent to a friend. Sorry. And let's get back on topic. “Did you make any harmful contact with the anomaly?”</p>
<p>Crawford: Not harmful, at least not that I know of. There was that black stuff that got on my eye. No clue what it is, or if it did anything to me. Well, it “drained” my vision, if that makes any sense. Strange as hell. Kinda like seeing a black-and-white movie through one eye. Whatever it did, I washed it off ASAP. Not pleasant getting sprayed with junk that smells like concentrated sickness. At least the weird sight issue went away pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: “You noticed the anomaly seemed to be 'alive.' What brought you to this conclusion?”</p>
<p>Crawford: She was… looking at me. Just… staring into my eyes. She didn’t look in pain- er, of course she looked in pain, but she didn’t have a pained expression. Only staring at me, kinda like she was bored, and I was a distraction.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: When I was with… it, I saw that too. It's, well, when you see someone who looks like <em>that</em>, you expect them to be wincing or something. Showing some kind of pain through their eyes. Nothing, though. Maybe it's the paralysis.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Brown clears her throat.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: “Are there any other important comments you wish to make?”</p>
<p>Crawford: Uhh… not much. I guess she didn’t fit the vibe of your everyday occultist, or really any GOI. If anything, she seemed… yeah, like someone who pulled a bad hand. But bad things happen, and we're here to clean it up. "Die in the dark so they live in the light," or whatever.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Yeah. Still feels… off, though. Regardless, thank you, Anton. This session has concluded.</p>
<p>Crawford: See you, Caroline.</p>

<p>Researcher Brown: Huh. I'm surprised, but glad to hear it. Gotta take what you can, right?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797 blinks three times. Researcher Brown giggles.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Sorry. Rhetorical question. Here. <em>She swipes her tablet.</em> “Do you feel in need of psychological care?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797 blinks three times.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Noted. When our nurses come around, they’ll ask you again. Our psychologists are great doctors and great people. Okay, “Have you noticed these strange occurrences for more than a week?”</p>

<p>Researcher Brown: “Have you noticed them for more than a month?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797 blinks once.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: “A year?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797’s eyes drift slightly before refocusing. It blinks once.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Sorry for the boring questions. I’ll have to figure out a better way to communicate. “Two years?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797 blinks twice.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Thanks. Whatever it is, we’ll stop it soon. <em>She swipes her tablet.</em> “Do you believe you are in serious danger, up to and including death?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797’s eyes drift off and refocus multiple times. It blinks once.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Hey. We're all here to help. No need to be afraid. <em>She clears her throat.</em> “Have you previously contacted medical professionals, emergency services, or other figures of authority to assist you?”</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797’s eyes drift off. It does not respond.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: We're almost there. You got this.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9797.5.4.2023:</strong> Rapid Decline in Health of SCP-9797</p>
<p>The following is a medical report on the health of SCP-9797 following a visibly noticeable decline in body mass. It was first observed by Researcher Caroline Brown on 3 April 2023.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 4/4/2023<br/>
<strong>Patient:</strong> SCP-9797<br/>
<strong>Attending Physician:</strong> Dr. Shawn Taulyn</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Rate:</strong> 32 BPM<br/>
<strong>Heart Rate:</strong> 98 BPM<br/>
<strong>Temperature:</strong> 36.0°C<br/>
<strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> 89/40 mmHg<br/>
<strong>SpO2:</strong> 82%</p>
<p>The patient is almost entirely covered in black cysts; these are also present in the mouth and nasal cavity. Intravenous feeding is ineffective at preventing weight loss. Weight has dropped to 35.4 kg from 66.0 kg at time of admission. The patient is no longer creating urine or stool. Symptoms of expected multi-system organ failure (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, jaundice, heart arrhythmia/cardiac arrest) are not occurring. The patient is turning grey without mundane explanation, affecting internal and external body tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9797.12.4.2023:</strong> Disappearance of SCP-9797</p>
<p>On 11 April 2023, SCP-9797 began fading before vanishing entirely. Researcher Caroline Brown was present during the incident. The following video was recorded via security camera during the phenomenon:</p>

<p><em>SCP-9797 continues to fade. Nurses arrive. They are unable to help, as SCP-9797 is now fully intangible.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Is- is she dying?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9797 is almost entirely invisible. Researcher Brown is holding loosely to the gown surrounding SCP-9797.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9797.17.6.2023:</strong> Historical excerpt of SCP-9797</p>
<p>On 15 June 2023, Foundation Internet webcrawlers discovered a digitally transcribed medical document of a patient similar in symptoms to SCP-9797. Initial analysis suggests origin between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. SCP-9797 is reclassified as Pending until further information can be gathered. The relevant excerpt can be found below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>“The diseased Man has become enveloped in black Sores, appearing that the Great Death had claimed him. Nevertheless, he speaks adamantly that he is in no Pain, Physical or Spiritual; that in fact he could not feel Pain, or taste Food and Drink, or see any more than Gray and Black.

<p>Researcher Brown: Recording started. Interview with Anto- Anthony Crawford, SCP-9797-A instance and Foundation employee. Today is February 9, 2024.</p>
<p>Crawford: Hi. Get on with it, please.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Oh. Okay then. "What symptoms, if any, have worsened since infection with SCP-9797?"</p>
<p>Crawford: Hard to feel emotions anymore. Kinda like, you know what you're supposed to feel, just - <em>he takes a deep breath</em> - you don't. Real strange.</p>
<p><em>Crawford pauses to catch his breath between sentences.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: And, obviously, the whole breathing thing. It feels like the air just - doesn't have oxygen. I breathe fine, no pain there, but it's - it isn't working.<br/>
<em>Researcher Brown pauses.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Can you, uh, roll up your left sleeve?</p>
<p>Crawford: Yeah, sure. Why?</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Those red marks on your arm. Are you alright? What happened there?</p>
<p>Crawford: Oh. Trying to feel something.</p>
<p><em>Crawford lets out a stifled laugh.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: Sounds stupid when I say it out loud. It's… stimulation. Can't feel much else, so I started scratching. It helps a bit. I - stopped tasting, or smelling, too. Like a permanent stuffy nose. Or really bad COVID. So it helps to - get my brain going as much as it can.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: What about the antidepressants I prescribed you? Anton, I'm sure there's another way.</p>
<p>Crawford: It's - yeah, it's helpful. Not very, but anything's good. Takes me from - wondering why I exist to wondering what I did to deserve this.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Hmm. "Is your anomalous condition interfering with your ability to work?"</p>
<p>Crawford: Look at me. Do - do I look able to work?</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Well, you seem to be moving around fine. Plus, I didn't write this question.</p>
<p>Crawford: Uh-huh. Yes, it is definitely - interfering. I mean, I can't hardly jog. And, I seem to - avoid danger like the plague. I'm not afraid, it's just… I'm not sure. I can't do it, and that's all - all there is to it.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: So, like, a mental block?</p>
<p>Crawford: Yeah. Guess you could say - so.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Alright. Now, I have to ask this with these kinds of conditions. "Have you considered or attempted suicide?"</p>
<p>Crawford: Huh. No, I - haven't. Never crossed my mind. I wouldn't - be offended, anyways, Caroline. You have a job to do.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Yeah. To save you like I couldn't save that woman.</p>
<p>Crawford: Is - is this all about that? You can't - handle a death? Let go a little.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Are you kidding? We have a duty to these people. Die in the dark so they live in the light, right?</p>
<p>Crawford: Well - can't fix what ain't there. She's gone, Caroline. I'll - probably be with her soon, wherever she went.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Snap out of it! You're depressed, Anton. Try to have some optimism.</p>
<p>Crawford: "Depressed" doesn't - sound right. Just… melancholy.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Same thing. Didn't you want me to "get on with it?" Here: last question. "Do you feel connected to any anomalous entity, have received a revelation, or otherwise acquired knowledge since your interaction with SCP-9797?"</p>
<p><em>Crawford laugh-coughs.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: I don't think I'd - consider myself enlightened. Just a different perspective. Feeling "feelingless" changes - how you see things, I think. Or maybe I'm talking out of my ass. Probably just - talking out of my ass.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Whatever you say. Thank you for your cooperation. This interview has concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9797.1.3.2024:</strong> Newly recorded instance of SCP-9797-A</p>
<p>On 27 February 2024, Eric Walters, a potential SCP-9797-A-1 instance, was investigated by embedded Foundation operatives in Fayetteville, NC. Upon analysis of bloodwork, trace amounts of SCP-9797-B were discovered within his blood. Walters will be provided with multiple potential treatments to slow or stop the progression of SCP-9797, routinely rotated to test the efficacy of each. As SCP-9797 appears untransmissible during Phase 1, Walters has not been taken into Foundation custody. However, he will be monitored for progression into Phase 2.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9797.6.4.2024:</strong> Historical excerpt regarding SCP-9797</p>
<p>On 31 March 2024, Foundation webcrawlers discovered a personal account regarding a potential SCP-9797-A instance, dated to the late sixteenth century. The document has been translated, and the relevant excerpt can be found below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>A wretched man entered our great city today. He displayed his black marks for all to see, and claimed he was the true Christ. When we asked him for proof, he told us this: "See how I am defiled, and see how I slouch. See what the sin of mankind has made me." Then, he prodded at his black pockets until they burst and spilled black water over the ground. "See how I bear the very manifestation of evil within me. It will gnaw at me, destroy even the pleasure of suffering, and it will kill me. And then I will be resurrected, and bring the end of days with me." Of course, we thought him ridiculous. Pestilence is a monstrous thing, melting the minds of its sufferers and turning them mad. As expected, he could no longer stand, and laid still for the rest of the day.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9797.4.5.2024:</strong> Progression of symptoms in Anthony Crawford, SCP-9797-A instance</p>
<p>On 3 May 2024, Anthony Crawford requested medical assistance to his containment unit, complaining of sudden skin discoloration and loss of color vision. Hazmat-equipped medical staff documented the new symptoms for research and treatment. The medical report can be found below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 3/5/2024<br/>
<strong>Patient:</strong> Anthony Crawford, SCP-9797-A instance<br/>
<strong>Attending Physician:</strong> Dr. Shawn Taulyn</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Rate:</strong> 24 BPM<br/>
<strong>Heart Rate:</strong> 80 BPM<br/>
<strong>Temperature:</strong> 36.2°C<br/>
<strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> 93/54 mmHg<br/>
<strong>SpO2:</strong> 86%</p>
<p>The patient complains of "seeing in black-and-white," recalling a previous interaction with the anomaly which resulted in a similar, albeit temporary, effect. Patient reports extremely severe fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of sensation of pain, minor numbness in extremities without pins-and-needles sensation, and recurring sleep paralysis without hallucinations. Skin is desaturated and slightly dark in color. Large patches of black discoloration, measuring between 1-3 cm in width, have appeared across the skin.</p>

<p>Researcher Brown: Recording started. Interview with An… Anton Crawford, SCP-9797-A instance. Today is May 6, 2024.</p>
<p><em>Crawford is audibly breathing.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: So, uh. Can you describe your symptoms for me?</p>
<p><em>Crawford takes a deep breath.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: Thought that's what - the doctors were for.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Yes, in their own way. They're just interested in the symptoms. I'm interested in <em>you</em>.</p>
<p><em>Silence pervades the room.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: Are - are you confessing, or-</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: What? Oh, no no, I meant like…</p>
<p><em>Researcher Brown sighs.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: You- you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Crawford: I get it. Sor - Sorry for being - stupid. Probably effects of the - the whole emotion - thing.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Right. Symptoms. Umm. "How have your symptoms progressed in recent weeks?"</p>
<p>Crawford: No emotion. At all. Makes it hard to - have a conversation. It's like talking with - a different creature. Also, the damned black - black and white thing is - back. Way back when we - we found that girl. Can't see color. Now both eyes.</p>
<p><em>Crawford pauses to catch his breath.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: Breathing's way worse. Can't hardly feel - anything anymore. Physically, I - I mean. Nothing hurts. And I can't - can't tell what I'm - touching with my hands. Unless I'm looking at them.</p>
<p><em>Crawford pauses again.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: And - I just feel helpless. Pitiful. It's not an - emotion. More so knowledge. Like, if my dad - saw me like this. I know he'd just - feel sorry. Sorry I couldn't live - live like he did. Nothin' more opposite - fighting fire than - just layin' in - your own filth.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Please stop. You've done so much, Anton. Being part of the Foundation, and bringing us that woman, and taking the SCP upon yourself - I'm sure you've already saved so many people.</p>
<p>Crawford: What, so it was - <em>good</em> that I got sick?</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: No, of course not! I only mean that… it's…</p>
<p><em>Researcher Brown pauses.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: You made the best of your cards.</p>
<p>Crawford: Damned terrible cards I - I drew, then.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Brown audibly exhales.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Brown: Look. SCP-9797 is obviously taking a massive toll on your mental state. I'll see if I can get a therapist or a psych or someone to help you.</p>
<p>Crawford: Don't bother. I'll probably be - asleep. Or out of breath.</p>
<p>Researcher Brown: I… just, stay strong, Anton. Do it for me, if you have to.</p>
<p>Crawford: Am already. Breathing's harder than the - boot camp they put us - agents in. I'll let you - know if I stop breathing. Okay?</p>
<p><em>Silence, broken by an unusually loud exhale from Crawford.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: Sorry. I'll - I'll stop trying to crack jokes if - if it makes you feel - that way.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 16.5.2024:</strong> Convergence of SCP-9797 symptoms</p>
<p>Black cysts have begun to form on the SCP-9797-A instance Anthony Crawford's skin. Due to the instance developing symptoms similar to the original SCP-9797-A instance, it is theorized that SCP-9797 may progress consistently across all subjects. Below is a potential timeline of symptoms, alongside phases of the disease, to better distinguish the severity of SCP-9797 infection:</p>
<p>Phase 1: SCP-9797-A-1 instances exhibit common depressive symptoms. Trace amounts of SCP-9797-B are detectable within their blood. Treatment effectiveness unknown.</p>
<p>Phase 2: SCP-9797-A-2 instances become increasingly depressed and emotionally numb. Hypoxemia begins to occur, likely due to hematological interaction with SCP-9797-B. Additionally, the senses begin to dull, leading to persistent understimulation and boredom. Instances' skin will visibly darken due to high presence of SCP-9797-B. Immune reaction to SCP-9797-B does not occur. Treatment effectiveness unknown.</p>
<p>Phase 3: SCP-9797-A-3 instances are severely depressed but mentally blocked from suicidal thoughts. Complete loss of taste, smell, and pain occurs. Instances lose feeling in their limbs, starting from hands and feet. SCP-9797-B pools under the skin, eventually forming large blisters or cysts. Instances are extremely fatigued.</p>
<p>Phase 4: SCP-9797-A-4 instances become incapable of motion; however, they retain control over their eyes. Instances are aware and conscious, but sleep for most of each day. Cysts cover their skin and begin forming in other epithelial tissue, notably the mouth and sinus cavity. Organ systems do not fail despite the internal disruption these cysts would mundanely cause.</p>
<p>Phase 5: SCP-9797-A-5 instances rapidly lose weight without organ system damage. They begin to slowly turn grey over the course of multiple days, at the end of which they become intangible and disappear entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3.6.2024:</strong> Proposed treatment of late-phase SCP-9797</p>
<p>Following the apparent reversal of symptoms in Eric Walters, an SCP-9797-A-1 instance, Researcher Caroline Brown has submitted multiple proposals to stop or reverse symptoms in Anthony Crawford, an SCP-9797-3 instance. The following requests have been submitted to Site-51 Department of Wellbeing:</p>
<p>PROPOSAL 1: High-dose dextroamphetamine-amphetamine combination. Potential to disrupt progression of symptoms, particularly fatigue and dull senses. <span style="color: orange">- MODIFIED - Low-dose dextroamphetamine-amphetamine combination approved. Dosage may be increased if subject responds well.</span><br/>
PROPOSAL 2: Drainage of epithelial cysts on Crawford. <span style="color: red">- DENIED - Contamination and infection poses too great a risk.</span><br/>
PROPOSAL 3: Participation in clinical trials of the Site-51 Anomalous Pathogen Neutralization Facility. <span style="color: red">- DENIED - All positions have been filled. Subject is not vital enough to the continued existence or efficacy of the Foundation to warrant replacement of participants.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 10.6.2024:</strong> Incident report - 9 June 2024</p>
<p>On June 9, 2024, Anthony Crawford awoke shortly before seizing. Blood testing revealed that Crawford had dangerously high levels of amphetamines in his body. A video recording from his chamber has been transcribed below. It indicates the possible course of events leading to the incident.</p>

<p><em>Anthony Crawford awakes and quickly sits up. He is breathing very deeply and quickly.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: No. No no no. Put me back. I'm not supposed to be here.</p>
<p><em>He begins screaming.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: PUT ME BACK! GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE!</p>
<p><em>Anthony Crawford begins to seize. Attached medical equipment alerts staff to his condition. They quickly arrive and administer lorazepam to control the seizure.</em></p>

<p>Crawford: Don't remember. Sorry.</p>
<p>Soleil: That's alright. Do you have any ideas as to what could have occurred?</p>
<p>Crawford: Uh… Dunno. Maybe I saw some - ancient god or something. All I know is I - I sounded schizo.</p>
<p><em>Scribbling on a notepad is audible.</em></p>
<p>Crawford: I'm kidding, lady.</p>
<p>Soleil: It's a possibility. If you have any guesses you think are better, please let me know.</p>
<p>Crawford: Probably just - tweaked out on meth. You'd think the whole - "can't - feel anything" thing would - change that. Who knows.</p>
<p><em>Mallory Soleil continues writing on his notepad.</em></p>
<p>Soleil: I would agree that the cause is probably the side effects of an amphetamine overdose. It's prudent to come up with as many differentials as possible, though.</p>
<p>Crawford: Huh. I guess - maybe I felt too - much. Might just be the - same as meth overdose. I dunno. Only drug I ever - did was weed.</p>
<p>Soleil: Elaborate. How do you think you "felt too much?"</p>
<p>Crawford: Like, uh. When you - have to get up - to piss in the middle of - the night. You turn on the - bathroom lights, and it's not - any brighter than normal. But it still - hurts to see 'cause - you're used to the dark.</p>
<p>Soleil: Oh. I get it. Extremely severe overstimulation, or something approximate to that.</p>
<p><em>Scribbling noises.</em></p>
<p>Soleil: Thank you for your input. You are a close friend of Caroline Brown, correct?</p>
<p>Crawford: Yeah. Ever since we got - thrown in the UPD.</p>
<p>Soleil: We would like to understand the cause of Dr. Brown's mishandling of medication in order to determine her punishment. Do you believe it was intentional poisoning?</p>
<p>Crawford: No. Never. Caroline's a - sweet, sweet girl. Can't stand seeing - bad things happen to - good people. Apparently, she thinks I'm - good enough to - violate medical - recommendations.</p>
<p><em>More scribbling noises.</em></p>
<p>Soleil: So you believe it was effectively an accident?</p>
<p>Crawford: Yeah. Stupid accident, but - that happens. And, hey. If you have any - input in her punishment. I don't wanna see - see her locked away - from me. I know her. If she can't - be here when I die, she'll - she'll never forgive herself. Probably won't anyway.</p>
<p><em>Mallory Soleil scribbles on his notepad for the last time.</em></p>
<p>Soleil: I understand.</p>
<p><em>He pauses.</em></p>
<p>Soleil: Actually, I don't. You have my sympathy, though, if it means anything. I can't possibly comprehend how you feel, what with almost all your senses being lost, but I can relate a bit. Emotion doesn't come easy to me.</p>
