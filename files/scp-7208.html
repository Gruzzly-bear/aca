<p>Information about SCP-7208 is limited to personnel with Level 4 Clearance or higher; <span style="color: #430704">further research has been suspended indefinitely.</span></p>
<p>Personnel are advised to avoid <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>DIVINING</sub><sup>CONCEIVING</sup></span> SCP-7208 any unique or specific definition. All personnel directly involved in the <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>OBSERVATION</sub><sup>SUPERVISION</sup></span> of SCP-7208 are to be screened biweekly for indications that they have attempted, consciously or unconsciously, to <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>UNRAVEL</sub><sup>FATHOM</sup></span> SCP-7208 or any of its elements.</p>
<p>Personnel who understand SCP-7208 are to be terminated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7208 is the <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>RHAPSODY</sub><sup>TAPESTRY</sup></span> of concepts that preside over <span style="color: #430704">luck</span>. SCP-7208 has only been partially analysed, due to its aforementioned <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>NATURE</sub><sup>PERSONALITY</sup></span>. The portions known to the Foundation correspond to the concepts of probability, randomness, circumstance, and <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>SERENDIPITY</sub><sup>SYZYGY</sup></span></span>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>ABIGAIL</sub><sup>AMELIA</sup></span> Weaver</span>, director of the analysis of SCP-7208 until its indefinite suspension, is currently held in a standard humanoid containment cell until further notice.</p>
<p>From the limited portions of SCP-7208’s <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>TOPOLOGY</sub><sup>CATEGORY</sup></span>, it was hypothesised that SCP-7208 <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>PERMEATES</sub><sup>DOMINATES</sup></span> up to █8.14% of the Nöosphere in such a way that it at least partially intersects with human concepts of faith, hope, intention, and <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>CREATIVITY</sub><sup>FREEDOM</sup></span></span>.</p>
<p>As a result, SCP-7208 and its constituents are directly impacted by a subject’s <span style="color: #430704">interpretation</span> of their meaning. This is somewhat <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>ALLEVIATED</sub><sup>REMEDIED</sup></span> by SCP-7208's special containment procedures, namely the use of <span style="color: #430704">pataphors,</span> which effectively prevent subjects from constructing a coherent mental picture of the <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>RHAPSODY</sub><sup>TAPESTRY</sup></span> onto which they may, consciously or unconsciously, suppose their own <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>VERSE</sub><sup>STITCHING</sup></span></span>.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7208-ρ:</strong> Upon reviewing all available documentation pertaining to SCP-7208 and Protocol-7208-ρ, it has been <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>DETERMINED</sub><sup>DETERMINED</sup></span></span> that SCP-7208 an <span style="color: #430704">intranarrative</span><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A narrative that is primarily influenced by its own characters.</span> meme complex whose central theme is "perception is reality, and reality is perception," reflected in its conflation and subsequent reinforcement as a Nöospheric entity by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>Any and all interaction with SCP-7208 has been <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>DETERMINED</sub><sup>DETERMINED</sup></span></span> to cause retroactive alterations to baseline narrative, corresponding to assumptions related to SCP-7208 itself, its constituents, individuals directly involved in researching SCP-7208, and <span style="color: #430704"><span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>SERENDIPITY</sub><sup>SYZYGY</sup></span></span>.</p>
<p>All personnel directly involved in the <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><sub>OBSERVATION</sub><sup>SUPERVISION</sup></span> of SCP-7208 are to be amnesticised as soon as possible in order to mitigate the risk of an ∀K-Class "Immersion Break" Narrative Collapse Scenario.</p>
<p>The Foundation has concluded that <span style="color: #430704">luck</span> is inherently pataphysical.</p>
