            <h1>SCP-1310</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1310</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The building containing SCP-1310 has been designated Site ███. It is to have the appearance of being condemned and awaiting demolition. The door leading to SCP-1310 is to be opened for at least 20 out of 24 hours per day, in order to minimize possibility of generation events. All specimens emerging from SCP-1310 are to be detained for questioning. Following the questioning session, all specimens of SCP-1310-A,-B and -C are to be treated with protocol England-1310-84.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1310 is the designation for examination room 10 at the former "[REDACTED] Pediatrics" center located on the campus of the [REDACTED] Medical Center in ██████, Ohio. SCP-1310 has the dimensions of 5m x 3m x 5m. The room is designed for simple medical examinations of individuals under 18 years of age, and is decorated with an animal-themed mural on the western wall. It has all the typical apparatuses of a mundane medical examination room, such as a case for syringe disposal, a sink, a supply of gauze and tongue depressors, and an examination table.</p>
<p>SCP-1310 enters an active state when the door to the room is closed for, on average, a span of 5 minutes and 43 seconds. After that time has passed, at least one human being will emerge from SCP-1310, having been generated within the room's confines. The process by which the generation is done is not understood, and attempts to record the inside of the SCP-1310 during the generation process have resulted in failure of all electronic equipment.</p>
<p>The generated humans will fall under three specific categories: one under the age of 18 (hereafter designated SCP-1310-A) and one which the first specimen will usually treat as its parent or guardian (SCP-1310-B). In some cases, a third specimen (SCP-1310-C) will be generated, identifying itself as a doctor or nurse employed at [REDACTED] Pediatrics. These subjects will have memories that correspond to actual people and locations in the town of [REDACTED] and surrounding areas; however, these memories are fabricated. No records of any instances of SCP-1310-A and -B have been found as of the date of writing [██-██-20██], despite items such as social security cards and drivers licenses being found on several of the specimens.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1310-01:</strong> Following the acquisition of SCP-1310, instances of SCP-1310-A, -B and -C ceased appearing for a 4 month period. Believing there to be a link between the status of the [REDACTED] Pediatrics facility and the appearance of SCP-1310-A and -B, Dr. ███████, the researcher overseeing containment of SCP-1310, ordered the clinic be re-opened and operated as normal for a period of three months. During that time, ██ new instances of SCP-1310-A appeared, with the same number of SCP-1310-B. ██ instances of SCP-1310-C were generated as well. See Document 1310-02 for details.</p>
<p><strong>Document 1310-02:</strong> <em>I knew I was on to something! If we let patients into the clinic, SCP-1310 outputs new instances of SCP-1310-A and -B. I have formulated a theory that SCP-1310 exists simultaneously in at least two, if not more, universes. When the door to SCP-1310 is closed in both the opposing universe(s) and in this one, then SCP-1310 re-routes the people within the room to this universe. The only discernible difference between our universe and theirs is that instances of SCP-1310-A and -B do not exist in our universe; request testing to see if inter-universal travel is possible using SCP-1310; if so, then perhaps we could get into contact with the other universe's Foundation!</em> -Dr.███████</p>
<p><em>Dr. ████████'s request has been approved. Testing is scheduled to begin<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">7-26-200█</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">12-1-200█</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3-12-200█</span> [Edit 7-5-200█] : It has been almost a year since Dr. ████████ has requested testing with SCP-1310, but has not been able to test, as D-Class have not been requisitioned to him for testing. This issue is to be remedied ASAP. [Final Edit: 7-12-200█] Dr.████████ has canceled testing, citing a lack of test subjects.</em>- O5-█</p>
<p><strong>Incident 1310-B-31:</strong> On 5/20/20██, SCP-1310 was opened for cleaning, and a single specimen of SCP-1310-B was found inside, with no accompanying SCP-1310-A or -C. SCP-1310-B-31 identified himself as Charles Freedman and stated that he had been an employee of the Foundation for the past five years. SCP-1310-B-31 was taken into custody, and interviewed. The following is a transcript of this interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&gt;Begin Log&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> You said that you worked for the Foundation. Why should we-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> I didn't just work for the Foundation. I was your research assistant. You went on for hours about your bullcrap theories about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> How fortuitous. And, if you were my research assistant in this other universe, what, pray tell, were you doing inside of SCP-1310?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> You asked- no, you <em>told</em> me to go in there. Then the door shut, and when I came out, nobody remembered who I was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Because you do not exist in this universe. Now, you claim to have a girlfriend named-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> Oh my god. <em>SCP-1310-B-31 sighs loudly.</em>Get your head out of your ass, ████████.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> Ever hear of Occam's Razor? What's a simpler explanation: the room porting people over from other universes at complete random? Or people from this universe going into 1310 and entirely erasing people from this timeline?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Don't be absurd. All the evidence suggests-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> Chew on this for a second, then. You remember all the times you were going to test it on humans? See if they could go into other universes? How the tests <strong>never happened</strong>? What if they did happen, and nobody remembers it, because that's now how SCP-1310 works?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> I think we're done here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> No, we aren't. And one last thing: I know about all the specimens emerging from 1310 that you never reported. There must've been, what, 12 of them? Maybe more? All in <em>D-Class Uniforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Guard, escort him out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1310-B-31:</strong> (sounds of struggling) Listen to me! You hid data! <em>SCP-1310-B-31 directly addresses the microphone.</em> I have proof! Listen to me!</p>
<p>(At this point, SCP-1310-B-31 was sedated and escorted out of the room)</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>While I will admit that he did have some valid information on the Foundation, there is no evidence to suggest that I hid evidence. In the other universe, perhaps, but in baseline, there is no reason for me to hide evidence. What would I gain from it?</em></p>
<p><em>Hopefully, we can get protocol England-1310-84 over with and make sure he never tries to bother us again.</em>- Dr. ████████</p>
<p><em>In a follow-up interview conducted by Foundation security at Site-███, SCP-1310-B-31 directed staff to Dr. ████████'s office, where a file containing photographs of unknown SCP-1310-B subjects was located, along with several notes regarding the alleged missing data. All SCP-1310-B subjects were wearing D-Class uniforms.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to the gross incompetence displayed by Dr. ████████ regarding SCP-1310, his employment has been terminated as of 4/20/20██. Containment Procedures will be updated by the <a href="/antimemetics-division-hub">Antimemetics Division</a> in accordance with the findings presented by SCP-1310-B-31.</em>- O5-█.</p>
