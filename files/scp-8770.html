<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Satellite data is to be altered to hide the presence of SCP-8770. Ship traffic is diverted from the area via the placement of several isolated danger buoys around the perimeter and anchored to the anomaly. These are to be checked by a Foundation team on a monthly basis to ensure that their placement has not shifted.
<p>In the event that a buoy's placement has shifted, a diving team is to be dispatched and SCP-8770 is to be monitored for changes in its geometry, the buoys then adjusted accordingly to these shifts.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the anomaly is to be left abandoned.</p>
<p>SCP-8770 is not to be inhabited.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8770 is a vessel in a state of irregular structural flux, located upon the sea floor of the Atlantic Ocean at ██°██'███.█''N, -██°██'██.█''W. The exterior of the anomaly most frequently resembles that of a man-made, sunken vessel roughly 355 meters in length on average.</p>
<p>While external changes of SCP-8770 occur at seemingly random intervals, notable or consistent shifts have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in materials that make up outer structures — metal into wood, wood into metal, instances of stone, fabric or glass</li>
<li>Occurrences of new walls, suggestions of the creation of additional internal rooms</li>
<li>Large junctions of metal beams jutting downwards towards the sea floor</li>
<li>Indistinct railings along top portions or formed balconies</li>
<li>Steering apparatuses resembling those found on ships of inconsistent age</li>
<li>Nonsensical directional signs</li>
<li>Engine structures and propellers consistent with that of motorized boats and submarines</li>
<li>Wires</li>
<li>Roofs and sidings resembling those of residential homes</li>
<li>Windows resembling those of residential homes</li>
<li>Doors resembling those of residential homes</li>
</ul>

<p>All structures are often in states of high decay and water damage. The undersea area around SCP-8770 is almost a complete ecological dead zone, devoid of all marine life, with the exception of some corals that have grown on the structure of the anomaly.</p>
<p>During initial analysis, it was discovered that SCP-8770 exerts a minor memetic influence on its surroundings — increasing feelings of unease and discomfort in those that are within 5 meters of its exterior.</p>
<p>All attempts to access the interior of SCP-8770 via unmanned submersibles have resulted in the complete cessation of all technological functions upon entry. Approximately three submersibles were lost before the prospect of a manned investigation was proposed and subsequentially approved.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8770:</strong> The first four manned expeditions into SCP-8770 were undergone to determine the internal dimensions of SCP-8770's interior. Teams were instructed to remain on the outskirts, staying along the exterior wall as much as possible. Over the course of these explorations, the following was noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interior was notably clear of any water damage that is expected of a structure of its nature</li>
<li>The appearances and disappearances of hallways, doors and windows at random</li>
<li>SCP-8770's interior dimensions have been recorded differently each perimeter expedition</li>
<li>SCP-8770's interior does not match the dimensions of its exterior, in spite of exterior shifts</li>
</ul>
<p>The fifth expedition was an attempt to discover the center of SCP-8770.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Log 8770.5:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote" style="background: none;">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Three members of MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") — codenamed BLACK CARPET, NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS — were deployed to find the center of SCP-8770.</p>
<p>To determine if SCP-8770's memetic properties intensify by internal proximity, the heart rate of all present individuals were monitored and recorded.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Gamma-6, do you read?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> Copy that, Command.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Loud and clear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS STABLE]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> We read.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[NINGEN'S BPM IS STABLE]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Good. Proceed into SCP-8770.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The team approaches the top portion of SCP-8770. This section has the appearance of the upper deck of a commercial fishing ship. There are broken posts and rotted barrels. Two paddle wheels emerge from parts of the hull, their bottom-halves seemingly fused into the rusted metal. These antiquated pieces appear out of time and place.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>SCP-8770 visibly stretches on for rough 30 meters in all directions, the rest of the anomaly obscured by the water’s turbidity — leaving only distant, towering silhouettes and shadows against the blue.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The water is still, devoid of movement and life aside from Gamma-6 as they draw closer. Their swimming stirs bursts of dust and debris when they level with the deck.</em></span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> There's an opening in the floor of the hull up ahead. Should make for easy entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> I see it too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The three swim to the gap in the hull. There is a ladder covered in algae and barnacles that descends into the space. The team swims inside.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The interior appears like that of a standard submersible, though in the growing absence of sunlight all three members of Gamma-6 turn on their headlights. The three's respirators are the only sounds detected.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN takes a roll of reflective, waterproof tape and wraps a strip around one of the rungs of the ladder.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> I'll use these to keep track of where we're going. This place is a labyrinth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Good thinking. <em>[She pauses]</em> Let's hope there isn't a minotaur.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>There's a quiet laugh amongst the team.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> You sure that’s gonna work, though? The interior of this place seems to shuffle around.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Hopefully, when it shuffles, there’s a rhyme-and-reason to it. If we find our markings, they may still lead us back — especially with one right by the exit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN pats the ladder, the orange tape now fastened to the rung.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> It’s also better than nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS nods.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> You think there's something in here they want us to find?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Since the other teams found squat on the outskirts, they wanna see if there's a center to this thing. They just wanna know if it <em>has</em> one, y’know? A source. Not like there's any actual traces of life around this thing, anything that's mobile seems to avoid it like the plague.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> <em>[She nods again]</em> Well, that's good for us I'd reckon.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN cuts the tape, and pulls away. BLACK CARPET has since pulled out a heavy duty compass.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Alright, let's get moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The other two nod, and follow him as he begins to swim down the corridor. The visibility is considerably low, only allowing sight roughly a meter ahead. After approximately ten seconds of swimming, a hatch is seen at the end of the hall.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> …it's like a warship's hall in here, all untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> I'll open the hatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN goes to reach wheel handle, only for it to turn before he can grasp it. There's a loud hissing heard as NINGEN gasps through his respirator.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> The hell—?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The hatch wheel turns in a full circle, before the hatch itself slowly opens inwards without being</em></span> <em><span class="depths">touched</span>. <span style="color:black;"><br/>
MATAGI CARCASS and BLACK CARPET come to a stop behind NINGEN.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> …I feel a current.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> Me too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Command? Door just opened itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Noted. Keep going, but be on alert.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Through the hatch is an open room.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>A living room.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Several pieces of furniture are situated around the space, all facing an inactive television. A coffee table with a few coasters and an empty glass upon it. The floor is carpeted. A bookshelf is situated against the far wall. BLACK CARPET approaches it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> <em>[She swims to the center of the room, and turns in a small circle]</em> It's… not rotted. No coral, no rust — nothing. So at least it’s… consistent?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Yet the outside looks like it's been underwater for decades. <em>[He brushes a hand along the carpet, it stirs no debris]</em> Hm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>There is a pause of silence amongst the team.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> You think that lamp over there would be a good place to tape?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Yeah, I'd reckon so.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN glances back at the hatch. It is still open. He swims over to a lamp that sits in the corner and begins to wind the reflective tape around it.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[NINGEN'S BPM HAS STABLIZED]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Someone come look at this so I know my eyes aren't playing tricks on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS and NINGEN turn to her. NINGEN approaches.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>BLACK CARPET is holding one of the books from the shelf. Despite being within the water, it is undamaged and unaffected. She turns to show it to NINGEN.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Random assortments of words and letters fill the pages without rhyme or reason. Some are shown to be blank when BLACK CARPET begins to page through.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Yeah, yeah no you're seeing that right. It's all… <em>[He traces a finger along the page]</em> gibberish.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> They're all like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS turns to the rest of the room. On the far side, past the couch and lamp, is the open entryway to a kitchen. She swims inside to investigate.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Within is a dining table, four seats situated around it. Like the living room, the place is untouched by rot, rust or any other signs of water damage. Upon the table are placemats, plates, silverware — all organized and laid out. Empty cups. A set of cupboards line the one wall above a counter with an inlaid sink. Along the same wall rests a fridge and an oven, the wires from the fridge are spread out all over the floor. None of them seem to be live.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN and BLACK CARPET enter the kitchen as well.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> It's like… everybody up and left. Table's set for dinner and everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Are there any actual signs of this place ever being inhabited?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS opens one of the cupboards. It is empty. She opens another. It is empty. She opens the fridge, and it too is empty. The light inside it does not turn on.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> …I don't think so. All empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN's respirator hisses as he exhales.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Command? We've found an empty living room and kitchen. No sign of any past habitation or life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Affirmative. Are there any other paths?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>BLACK CARPET is experimentally turning the knobs on the oven. The one burner begins to glow a soft red when she turns it up. Swiftly, she turns it back off — than glances over her shoulder at NINGEN.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> I saw another hall past the bookshelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> We'll head there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Very well. Proceed.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The team exits the kitchen as a group, and BLACK CARPET leads the way.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>At the end of the hall is a child's bedroom.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Like the living room, its interior conditions are pristine in spite of its sunken nature. There's a small bed against the far wall, a nightstand by its side. A bureau is a few meters away, with a lamp resting upon it. Everything is untouched, undamaged, unscathed. The walls appear to be pale, but the exact color is difficult to discern due to the water.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS finds the interior of the bureau to be filled with children's clothes. Unworn. She swiftly closes the drawer to keep them from floating upwards.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>A teddy bear is suspended at the ceiling, back facing the floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>NINGEN swims up to retrieve it. He turns the bear in his hands to examine its front.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>It's face and front is covered in mold and rot. Festering, dark splotches. Bits of coral.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>He releases it with a hiss of his respirator.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:black;"><strong>[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM HAS RAISED]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Jesus—!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> NINGEN, the hell—?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Well— fuck. Found our first trace of — of water damage inside this thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>BLACK CARPET swims over, and takes the bear. She examines it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Sure is… this was up against the ceiling, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Yeah— yeah it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS swims upwards and puts her hand against the ceiling. She tries to push against it, test it for any weakness or damage, but it does not give.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> …still pretty solid up here. The ceiling itself doesn't seem to be damaged.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> …huh. I wonder why that thing's like that, then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> Hell if I know — but it may mean something.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>As MATAGI CARCASS pauses to think, BLACK CARPET turns her attention down to the bear in her hands.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> I'm gonna leave this in here, we can bring it back with us on the swing back to see if it's… got anything specifically weird about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Sounds good.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>She releases it. It floats back up to the ceiling. Its rotted face now stares down at the floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The team quietly swims out of the room.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>There is a new door on the left hall. It is ajar.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Ah.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Well, that’s the first structural shift we’ve seen while in here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Not uncharacteristic of the anomaly, but good to note.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> It's a way forward, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>There is a moment of silence, before NINGEN relays the door's appearance to COMMAND.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>COMMAND:</strong> <em>Proceed deeper.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> Very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>They enter through the door after NINGEN marks the handle with tape, and begin traveling down the new hallway. Extraneous exchanges over the next hour and a half have been removed for brevity.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Over the course of this time, the team passes forty-four bedrooms, eighteen kitchens, twenty-six bathrooms, and fourteen living rooms. The furniture within range wildly in time period, mixes of modern and ranging previous centuries with little consistency.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Periodically, they leave indication of their path via fluorescent tape.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>As they progress through hallway after hallway — it is noted by the team that water damage and rust has become noticeable in places. There are holes in some walls, piping visible within. Discordant rods of metal, scattered instances of rotted wood or furniture against otherwise pristine pieces.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>The team stops for a brief break within the fifteenth living room, having to have opened a ship hatch to enter it. The hatch is left ajar behind them. There is a window on the far wall of the room. NINGEN shifts to check the levels of oxygen within their tanks.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>BLACK CARPET holds up the compass and glances at the window. It indicates that she is facing south. Theoretically, this window's placement is impossible in relation to the rest of SCP-8770.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>Beyond it is an expanse of water. BLACK CARPET's light illuminates off a massive tangle of wires and pipes in the distance. There are unclear silhouettes past it all that appear to be moving. The body camera footage shows only blurs. There is a faint current emanating.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Maybe it was <em>supposed</em> to be, but I don't think it is anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>BLACK CARPET turns back to the window. It is gone.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><strong>BLACK CARPET:</strong> Like when the landlord paints the walls to hide the wood rot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;"><em>She traces the now-wall with one hand, glove sliding over the water-damaged metal and dry-wall. Flecks of rust float off into the water.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;"><em>NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS are within the living room once again. The furniture has rotted. The bent lamp lay on the floor in a pile of scrap. Twitching.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Down a new hallway, one that was not there the previous loops, there is another marking of tape.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>NINGEN stares at it blankly.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Without a word, the two remaining team members swim down the new hall, following the new set of markers.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> …this looks like the engine room from earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> It does.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> Maybe that means something. Maybe we’re… maybe we’re—</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The two of them turn a corner within the room.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Hanging from the ceiling, tied around rattling pipes, are hundreds of strips of fluorescent tape.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The room is a dead end.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> <em>[Muttering]</em> No— no no no—</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He shakes out his head frantically, raises his hands to grip his respirator. His breathing is shaking, heavy bursts of bubbles against the vibrating water.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS is still. Her swimming has faltered, gaze cast up at the ceiling. At the strips of marking tape <span class="depths">that seem to wave.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> …is it mocking us?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>NINGEN:</strong> We don’t even know if there is an <em>it!</em> We could just be losing it! Lost in some fucking hellscape! We’re not getting out of here— we <em>can’t—</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>NINGEN swims backwards, gaze glued to the ceiling. His back and arm touch the walls. He begins to scream.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>MATAGI CARCASS whips around with a shout, she swims over and tries to grab him. His thrashing causes dirt and rust and algae to cloud the water.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> <em>COMMAND! COMMAND PLEASE—</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She sounds on the verge of tears. NINGEN can be heard sobbing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>MATAGI CARCASS:</strong> <em>Please do something— I don’t want to die in here—</em></span></p>

You can save me from the rot and the pain. You can bring your warmth into these halls.</span></p>

<em>Gamma-6 never left.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They couldn't have. So here they lay, twitching and writhing against the frame. This place holds and holds and it does not let go.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>It is lonely.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>How could it not be?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Wires wind into flesh, pull it taught against sea-eaten metal and rotted wood. A desperate, fatal embrace. The wood melts into their wetsuits, it fuses them to these walls. Command tries to sputter out cries through broken communications, and it falls upon ears that can no longer answer. It is hungrily devoured by the water that surrounds in all its crushing power, so far and deep bellow. They lay with mouths gaping, with fingers twitching, like a fish soon to die. But no, no they will not die. Not yet. It will not let them. It wants their warmth, it wants the warmth of the living inside it once again. If that warmth comes through blood in the water, then let it be so.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>A house is not a home without people within. A ship is without purpose if there is no one to steer. A shipwreck is a type of corpse.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The wires are in their organs now, too. It infests everything that it can, everything that it can hold. Red wires through arteries like a mockery of blood, blue wires through grey matter — holding, holding, holding. Glass of face masks crack, respirators sputter out bursts of failing air when their throats fail to produce a sound. The tanks will last them two hours more.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The hull — the wall — the house creaks. Its foundation settling.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The wires are in their eyes. Their skulls have melted to the metal. They are finally at peace.</em></span></p>
