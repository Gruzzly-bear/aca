SCP-7747-1 is currently held within Site-107’s Anomalous Medical Wing. Additionally, at least two personnel (one medical staff and one security staff member), are to remain near SCP-7747-1’s cell at all times in case it awakens. If the previous occurs, refer to Site-107 Director Anya Williams for further instruction.
<p>SCP-7747-1’s Hume level is to be monitored constantly. If its Hume level surpasses 400, Director Williams is to be contacted for further input. The laceration and surrounding area on SCP-7747-1’s chest is to be monitored for further anomalous behavior.</p>
<p>SCP-7747-A is to be kept within anomalous item quarantine in Site-107 until further testing with the object has been planned. It is not to be handled without nitrile gloves until further notice.</p>

</div>
</div>
<br/>
SCP-7747 refers to the anomalous circumstances under which Dr. Luca Calma (henceforth designated SCP-7747-1) entered a seemingly perpetual state of REM sleep, and the related events in the intervening time period. On September 19th, 2020, SCP-7747-1 spontaneously manifested within the common area in Site-107's west wing, unconscious with a pair of surgical scissors (designated SCP-7747-A) lodged in its chest.
<p>During recovery it was noted that the skin near SCP-7747-1's chest emanated a soft blue light. After SCP-7747-1 was confirmed stable, present staff agreed to measure SCP-7747-1’s Hume levels to assess any previously unknown anomalous properties. SCP-7747-1’s Hume level was 340, nearly that of typically powerful reality bending entities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, an I.D. vaguely resembling an official Foundation identification card with the following information was found on SCP-7747-1's person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Level 4 Access<br/>
Full Name: Ángel Rosas<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup><br/>
Department: Multiversal Affairs<br/>
Position: Extradimensional Scientist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After SCP-7747-1 failed to react to external stimuli, it was determined to have a GCS of three.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Later MRI testing revealed the deterioration of numerous regions within the cerebrum, most notably, the Broca's area<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, primary motor cortex<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, and basal ganglia<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.The reason for its condition is currently unknown, but hypothesised to be correlated to SCP-7747-A. Additionally, when screened after SCP-7747, SCP-7747-1's right forearm was covered in relatively fresh lacerations not previously present.</p>
<p>Approximately three months prior to SCP-7747, SCP-7747-1 began to exhibit fatigue, which it attributed to long hours of work. The only physical health condition discovered during health screenings was its Albinism. In the week leading up to SCP-7747, SCP-7747-1's coworkers reported that its speech had became slurred and nonsensical, and had been leaving work early. After being questioned about this, it stopped going to work altogether, and did not reply to any communication attempts. Additionally, SCP-7747-1 was not present at its home. Director Williams was scheduled to interrogate it on this behavior as soon as its location was determined.</p>

</div>
</div>
<br/>
Although little is officially known about SCP-7747 and related anomalies, the Department of Neurology was contacted to conduct a series of readings on SCP-7747-1 using the OViM3.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> The readings were conducted in an attempt to record any comprehensible information that may provide any insight on its motives, and other helpful information regarding SCP-7747.
<p>Below is the up to date list of completed OViM readings. Results will be added as each reading is complete. Analysis of the results has been scheduled for the near future to identify any potential cause of SCP-7747.</p>
<p>Unidentified individuals that appear more than once have been numbered. Unidentified-3 refers to a disembodied voice.</p>

<p>A figure resembling SCP-7747-1 is in a dimly lit hospital room. Within approximately three minutes, an unidentified human male manifests. The two begin to converse.</p>

<p>SCP-7747-1 is inside a Foundation office cubicle. It is looking at the documentation file for <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-445" target="_blank">SCP-445</a>. It reaches into the computer screen, pulling out a stack of SCP-445. A sheet of paper slips out of the pack, transforming into a box. SCP-7747-1 attempts to open the box, but is unsuccessful. A few moments later, the box opens. SCP-7747-1 looks inside the box.</p>
<p>The sequence ends.</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-7747-1 is conversing with an unidentified human female within what appears to be a Foundation office room.</p>

<p>SCP-7747-1 is sitting in front of a table in a blank white space. It is wearing a Greek comedy mask. On the table is a medical kit. It removes a pair of surgical scissors resembling SCP-7747-A, two bandages, and an antiseptic packet and places them on the table. SCP-7747-1 talks seemingly to itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-7747-1:</strong> The numbness is back. I thought that ranking up would help. Once I was assigned to this task, I had hope again.</p>

<p>A plush toy of a golden retriever and what might be a coffee cup are now on the table. (Notably, the two items bear resemblance to two anomalous items that had gone missing for approximately two weeks before being returned.)</p>

<p>SCP-7747-1 is standing in an unidentified site storage room. It opens one of the lockers. Inside is the same medical kit as before. The kit opens. Inside is an ace of diamonds playing card. SCP-7747-1 picks up the card. It transforms into the "Mission X" report. SCP-7747-1 flips the page on the report, slicing its finger on the page.
