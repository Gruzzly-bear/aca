<p>&lt;<em>Start Transcript</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Thorson, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Director, a series of systems failed on the 22nd, and after checking some logs, there were multiple ontological shifts detected.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Right. And that is…</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> A bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> How bad? You're the only one who noticed anything, so—</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> I am also the only one at Site-33M who takes mnestics — and I can guarantee that something is different.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> What changed?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> SCP-8426.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>A pause. Dir. Yarrow clears his throat.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Remind me what that project is.</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Sir, I was hoping you would know.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Did we build it here?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> You don't know?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> That's what I've been trying to tell you—</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> What does the machine do?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Again, sir, I do not—</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> What about the staff who worked on it. Can you find someone, and have them repor—</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Sir. That is what I have been trying to tell you; not a single person knows what SCP-8426 is.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> To confirm: you are telling me that there is a machine that we may have built, in our Site — and we all know nothing about it?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> How could this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> I'm not sure yet, but I have a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Which is?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Somehow, I think the concept of what we made was forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> That sounds like bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> That's what you said when you hired me.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Silence.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> What do we need to figure this out?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> A full audit. We need to figure out what this does, who made it, and how it works — after all of that, then we can worry about why it changed.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> And how are you going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Thorson:</strong> Very slowly.</p>

<p>To identify the purpose and origin of SCP-8426, reconstructive ontological investigation was <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">initiated by Technician Thorson</span> — to do this, each piece of the larger machine was examined on the micro-ontological level to identify general components and usage. Next, their perceived purpose was estimated, based on the ontological overlap present, such that the general functionality might be surmised. Finally, the assumed purpose and origin of the device will be estimated, based on the information available.</p>
<p>To determine the initial perceived ontological purpose, 30 Site employees were shown SCP-8426, and asked to guess the purpose of the device, based solely on <span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A">appearance</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand B">smell</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand C">taste</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand D">visual inspection</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand E">intuition</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand F">tactile interaction</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand G">the assigned object number</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand H">an artist's rendering</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand I">vision</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand J">instinct</span>. The employees were asked to select the best fitting purpose, from a list of potential applications; this list was biased towards manufacturing, due to Site-33M primarily serving as a manufactory, rather than containment site.</p>

<hr/>
<p><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Surface level perception of SCP-8426 has been deemed inconclusive</span> for determining the purpose of the device. While it may appear as though the majority of respondents perceived SCP-8426 as related to 'Manufacturing', given the sample population being predominantly mechanics, welders and technicians, that is more likely indicative of who was asked, rather than being some ontological truth.</p>
<p>At <em>most</em>, the only thing we can suppose from the initial inspection is that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">SCP-8426 is not a weapon.</span></p>
<p>To confirm this assumption, SCP-8426 was ontologically compared to the concept of each category, and the degree of ontological overlap was returned. The following table displays the percentage of shared ontological meaning between SCP-8426, and each concept:</p>

<p>Due to the lack of consistency and reliability within the above presented documents, <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">further analysis of SCP-8426's documentation has been deemed pointless</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> SCP-8426 Technical &amp; Semantic Specifications</p>
<p>Given that subjective analysis of associated documentation failed to find any significant new information, investigation continued via objective analysis. Namely, SCP-8426 was analyzed through two frameworks: physical and ontological.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>SCP-8426 Physical Analysis</strong></span></p>
<p>To gain further insight into the purpose of SCP-8426, physical analysis identified the overall composition of SCP-8426, significant components or pieces of the larger construct, as well as major traits and/or aspects of SCP-8426.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Composition:</strong> Material analysis and carbon dating of SCP-8426 <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">failed to find any significant information</span>, due to the learned knowledge being overt through visual inspection. SCP-8426 is composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anomalous Alloys/Metals: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">12%</span></li>
<li>Non-anomalous Alloys/Metals: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">30%</span></li>
<li>Organic Materials: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">2%</span></li>
<li>Ectoplasm, Orphic Outflow, or Alternatives: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A B C D E">5%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand F G H I J">40%</span></li>
<li>Advanced Polycarbonate Compound: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A B C D E">51%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand F G H I J">16%</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is typical of other significant Foundation-constructed devices, and supports the conclusion that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is Foundation-made</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong> Through testing, data records and estimations, the following technical specifications were determined for SCP-8426:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">5' x 5' x 5'</span></li>
<li>Weight: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">~3900 lbs</span></li>
<li>Maximum Charge: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">57 megajoules</span></li>
<li>SCP-8426 Chamber Operating Temperature Range: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">270K - 4.128 * 10<sup>30</sup>K</span></li>

</ul>
<p>Due to the lack of information that can be surmised from these details, no new conclusions may be drawn. The information gathered is both <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">contradictory, and vague</span>, and thus was deemed irrelevant.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Component Pieces:</strong> Due to the continued lack of information provided by analyzing the broader defined elements of SCP-8426, analysis of the components that constitute SCP-8426 was undertaken. Due to a complete inability to tally any of these components accurately, no total counts are provided — below is a list of notable components, that may or may not be present in varying quantities within SCP-8426:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Industrial Capacitor(s)</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">Compensated Pulsed Alternator(s)</span></li>

<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">Thaumic Energy Sink(s)</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Magnetic Field Generator(s)</span></li>

<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">Indeterminate Propulsion System</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">final two components are assumed to exist</span> within SCP-8426 through observed behaviors, but the full functionality is still poorly understood. Based on the remaining components, it is clear that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">SCP-8426 is a device</span> <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">requiring and involving significant quantities of energy</span>, in addition to <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">requiring an additional material for operation</span>, as indicated by the presence of the loading chamber(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>SCP-8426 Ontological Analysis</strong></span></p>
<p>Using the information gained through physical analysis, and with the understanding that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">information gathered based on perception had increased unreliability</span>, investigation attempted to analyze SCP-8426 in alternative ways. Due to the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">ontological nature of the anomaly impacting SCP-8426</span>, investigation elected to utilize both Semantic and Ontological analysis to identify the core 'ideas' associated with SCP-8426.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Semantic Composition:</strong> A significant issue in understanding SCP-8426 has been the ontological redefinition event; due to this, our understanding of the conceptual nature of SCP-8426 is limited to the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span>. To understand what SCP-8426 <em>is</em>, we analyzed the semantic composition of SCP-8426 via Noospheric mapping and direct ontological comparison. The following concepts are presented, based on their ontological overlap with SCP-8426:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A">17%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand B">80%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand C">60.2%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand D">0.1%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand E">44%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand F">30%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand G">0%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand H">-20%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand I">7%</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand J">25%</span></li>
<li>Weapon: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">0%</span></li>
<li>Machine: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">98.5%</span></li>
<li>Appliance: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">76%</span></li>
<li>Ferrite: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">43%</span></li>
<li>Human: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">0%</span></li>
<li>Detonator: <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">5%</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above initial results, our assumption that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span> was validated, while additionally allowing for us to conclude that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a human</span>. This also introduced a new major possibility, that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">SCP-8426 may be an device or appliance</span>. Further ontological analysis has centered around this <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">potential answer</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Associated Adjectives:</strong> To investigate the core issue, namely, what SCP-8426 <em>does</em>, analysis was done to identify applicable adjectives and descriptors, to determine what functions SCP-8426 may likely have. The following adjectives are presented, and colored based on reliability:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Advanced</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">Precise</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Anomalous</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">Dangerous</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">Warm/Hot</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Hollow</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A B C D E">Valuable</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand F G H I J">Worthless</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">Useful</span></li>
<li><span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">Convenient</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the wide range of applicable descriptors, only the most commonly present definitions have been deemed relevant; for example, although SCP-8426 appears to be <span class="srPre">(The following statement is improbable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoImprob">associated with the adjective 'Dangerous'</span>, not only is this infrequently true, but it contradicts the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span>. Therefore, we strongly believe that the device is <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">an advanced mechanical device</span>, that was <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">created by the Foundation</span>, which <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">serves a given, specific purpose</span>. The purpose of SCP-8426 is still variable; however, with this basis, as well as the physical components, the function of SCP-8426 can be <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">further extrapolated</span>.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> SCP-8426's Functionality and Purpose</p>
<p>Throughout the investigation into SCP-8426, there has been one common goal: understanding what SCP-8426 was built to do. After gathering the above contextual, component and semantic information, we are now in a place where <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">we can use said observations and assumptions to extrapolate the primary function of SCP-8426</span>. The following is a recreation of the order of operations SCP-8426 takes, upon theoretical activation:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>SCP-8426 Activation Reconstruction</strong></span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Step 1: Loading Material(s)</span></h3>
<p>Due to the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is hollow</span> and based on the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">presence of material loading chamber(s)</span>, we suggest that the first step in activation was loading the material chamber(s). Due to the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span>, we can assume that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">ammunition is not being loaded</span> into SCP-8426; and given that component analysis suggests that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">SCP-8426 does not create an additional end product</span>, we believe that this <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">'material' is the target of SCP-8426's functionality</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Step 2: Energy Generation</span></h3>
<p>Given the presence of <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">capacitors, compensated pulsed alternators, and other intake connections</span>, the next logical step in the operation of SCP-8426 is to <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">fill the capacitors</span>, such that SCP-8426 can be activated. Given the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">maximum electrical draw of SCP-8426 is 57 megajoules</span>, it is clear that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 was designed to store, and then use significant amounts of energy per activation</span>. It is <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">unclear how long said generation takes</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Step 3: Energy Application</span></h3>
<p>Once SCP-8426 has collected enough energy, <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">that energy must be used in the activation</span>. Via adjective comparison and component analysis and the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426's operating chamber has a significant range of operating temperatures</span>, we suggest that SCP-8426's primary function is the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">direct application of said energy to the 'material'</span>. Furthermore, given the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">continued traits revolving around heat or thermal energy</span>, we suggest that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 applies thermal energy to the 'material'</span> for a <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">given duration of time</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Step 4: Ejection</span></h3>
<p>Once SCP-8426 has applied the thermal energy to the 'material', the functionalities and components that remain unused center around <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">the application of force</span>, such that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">a directional force is applied to the material</span>. Due to the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">lack of a dedicated output chamber</span>, we believe that the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">material is ejected from SCP-8426, post-thermal application</span>. Upon ejection, an activation cycle of SCP-8426 is completed.</p>
</div>
<p>We believe that the <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">above reconstruction of SCP-8426's functionality is accurate</span>, and therefore, <span class="srPre">(The following statement is uncertain):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoUncertain">we can use this information</span>, alongside specific details to narrow down the potential conceptual definition of SCP-8426. Given that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span>, we explored <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">non-violent applications using similar functionality</span>: specifically, we were looking for a machine that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">applies heat</span>, is <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">useful</span>, and is <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">a machine or appliance</span>. We reached the following conclusion:</p>

<p>While this may seem absurd, given the conceptual restrictions, perceived functionality, and possible applications, a <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">toaster is the most likely option</span>. If not for the fact that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is not a weapon</span>, there would be significantly more potential purposes; however, as we know that is impossible, all that remains is a toaster. <span class="srPre">(The following statement is unpredictable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoRand A B C D E F G">Due to the associated cost with operating SCP-8426, and the minimal benefit, SCP-8426 is to remain in Containment Chamber 07 and will not be activated.</span><span class="ontoTip ontoRand H I J">Due to the damage caused following a single test activation of SCP-8426, all further testing has been suspended.</span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong> Continued Ontological Observation</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the investigation into SCP-8426, the resultant hypothesis was rejected by both researchers and administrative staff alike; however, replication studies <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">confirmed the initial conclusion</span>, and reaffirmed that <span class="srPre">(The following statement is probable):</span> <span class="ontoTip ontoProb">SCP-8426 is a very expensive toaster</span>.</p>
<p>To further confirm this, a Foundation-made AIC webcrawler was tasked with monitoring all video traffic on the internet, identifying recordings with a significant portion of overlapping ontological traits when compared to SCP-8426. Through said comparison, researchers believe that we may gain further clues to the events leading to SCP-8426's conceptual abstraction. Research is ongoing, and any new matches are listed in the table below:</p>
