<p>Foundation webcrawler IO-SCAN/04J-3C5-O32 is to monitor sites hosting <em>Minecraft</em> mods and modpacks in order to find and remove copies of SCP-7813. Similarly, Foundation worm IO-WORM/67B-N5R-CTN is to routinely scan for computers connected to the Internet with modded <em>Minecraft</em> clients and delete any copies of SCP-7813 present in the filesystem.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Locating the destination of the EVE packets emitted by SCP-7813 is of utmost priority.</span> <span style="color: #3355ff">See Addendum 7813.II.</span><br/>
<span class="divider"><span style="font-size:1.375em;"><strong>Description</strong></span></span></p>
<p>SCP-7813 is a 196.2 MB .jar file containing a mod<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> for the video game <em>Minecraft</em>. The mod does not add any gameplay features on its own; rather, when combined with magic-themed mods, SCP-7813 converts the virtual EVE particles generated by "magic" performed ingame to physical EVE particles and transfers them to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an unknown location</span> <span style="color: #3355ff">a summoning circle located within SCP-7813-2 (see Addendum 7813.II).</span> The effect works with all versions of <em>Minecraft</em> since 1.7.2, and its anomalous effects have been shown to activate with mods including <em>Thaumcraft</em> (all versions, including addons), <em>Blood Magic: Alchemical Wizardry</em>, <em>Ars Magica 2</em>, <em>Ars Nouveau</em>, <em>Astral Sorcery</em>, and <em>Witchery</em>.</p>
<p>It is believed that the amount of EVE generated by SCP-7813 over the course of its existence so far is enough to summon multiple demiurgical pluripotent entities, each capable of causing multiple simultaneous K-class scenarios. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">As such, locating the destination to which this EVE is sent is of the highest priority.</span> <span style="color: #3355ff">See Addendum 7813.II.</span></p>

<p><span class="custom-heading">Distribution</span>Foundation worm IO-WORM/3N8-MA5-CA2 was programmed to collect data on a sample of 50,000 devices on which <em>Minecraft</em> and the Forge modloader were installed, and found 17,049 copies of SCP-7813 across 12,762 devices.</p>
<p>Foundation webcrawler IO-SCAN/G43-5CH-NH5 has detected the presence of SCP-7813 in various popular modpacks distributed through major <em>Minecraft</em> community websites, typically with a filename including antimemetic character sequences. This allows SCP-7813 to be packaged with other modifications without the knowledge of the player or even the modpack developers. As of this writing, 21 modpacks out of the most popular 50 modpacks on the popular <em>Minecraft</em> modding platform CurseForge were found to contain copies of SCP-7813.</p>
<p><span class="custom-heading">Code Analysis</span>Extracting SCP-7813 revealed a total of 38 Java class files. All identifiers in these files have been obfuscated, and no information can be determined about the original identifiers in the Java source code.</p>
<p>Files not containing anomalous or otherwise noteworthy code have been omitted from this list.</p>
<p><strong><tt>aa.class</tt></strong> (1.67 MB) is an implementation of the Moulin-Himuro protocol, a method of transferring EVE particles by means of TCP/IP packets, which appears to be an optimized version of an open-source implementation based on the original paper<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong><tt>p.class</tt></strong> (68.41 MB) contains the bulk of the information relating to the destination of packets sent by SCP-7813, including several IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The majority of the file's content consists of two Base64 strings encoding high-resolution grayscale images. The first is an intricate name sigil encoding the identity of a previously unknown Tartarean entity; the second is a summoning circle. This information serves to direct the EVE-containing packets towards some thaumaturgical ritual upon reaching their destination; however, there is insufficient information to determine the location or nature of said ritual beyond the involvement of a Tartarean entity.</p>
<p><strong><tt>f.class</tt></strong> (1.31 MB) defines a class that functions as a narrative upwards socket (NUS), which is used to generate EVE particles in baseline reality from "magic" performed in the game world. Compared to the most efficacious open-source NUS system, ReVO 7.2 by Fong, Paterson and Zhang<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, this implementation is able to generate approximately 13.6 times more EVE from an equivalent fictional source.</p>
<p><span class="custom-heading">Conclusions</span>It is highly likely that SCP-7813 is being used to supply EVE for an unknown demonic ritual. Similar approaches to summoning particularly powerful demons have been attempted, as with the attempted summoning of <a href="/scp-4950">SCP-4950</a>; since then, Massenet and Kovalev<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> have proposed more efficient, almost completely automated methods, including a proof of concept that only requires that a human is actively using the computer.</p>
<p>With this information in mind, the worst-case scenario is that SCP-7813 may be intended to gather an extremely large volume of EVE in order to summon either many lesser Tartarean entities, or one or a few highly powerful demiurge-level entities. We recommend that the anomaly be reclassified to Keter at the bare minimum, and that webcrawlers and worms be set up to delete copies of SCP-7813 from all devices connected to the Internet.</p>

<p><em>[MTF-け-17 is exploring the interior of what appears to be a family restaurant. No diners or staff are present, and a touchscreen is embedded in each table, displaying an English word accompanied by a symbol.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> Hm… Morikubo-san, what's an anagram for <em>SILENT</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morikubo:</strong> Try <em>LISTEN</em>. If that doesn't work, <em>ENLIST</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki looks back at the panel and inputs</em> LISTEN<em>, and after receiving no response,</em> ENLIST<em>. The panel turns green and a jingle plays, indicating that the puzzle is complete.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Looks like that's the last one.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki turns to the door next to the cashier counter, which is now open. A stack of eight coins has also appeared on the cashier counter. Dr. Kōsaka collects the coins and proceeds towards the door.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> What is this… no, there's something not right here. This isn't something that belongs in the Yumegēmu I know.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki approaches the doorway, which opens into a hallway with pitch black walls, at the end of which is a brightly lit room. A humanoid entity can be seen through the doorway.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Hiyama:</strong> What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> I-I'll go ahead and take a look.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki proceeds through the hallway. As she approaches, the humanoid entity (later designated SCP-7813-1) becomes clearer, and horns are clearly visible on its head. It is standing in the middle of the room, staring at a wall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> Umm… hello?</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki enters the room, followed by the rest of MTF-け-17. A computer is visible in front of the wall opposite the entrance. SCP-7813-1 turns to the exploration team; its motion appears to be "stuttering".]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Oh hey. About time someone showed up around here. You're from the SCP Foundation, right? Can you help me get out of here?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Kōsaka motions for the rest of the exploration team to remain quiet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Before we make any kind of agreement, I'd first like to know a bit about you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> My name is Sōta Kisaragi. And yes, I'm a demon, but, well, look, what I am doesn't matter. Thing is, I've been trapped here for months.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7813-1 points to what appears to be a demonic summoning circle surrounding it, and attempts to walk away from the center of it. However, it is repeatedly teleported back such that its center of mass is directly above the center of the circle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> See?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morikubo:</strong> … You say it doesn't matter, but isn't this only possible because you're a demon? Like, I'm fairly certain that's specifically a <em>demon</em> summoning circle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Let me handle this.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki turns to Researcher Hiyama.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> <em>[quietly]</em> This doesn't seem like a sidequest… I don't think Yumegēmu would just naturally generate something like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> I don't know, four months? My sense of time doesn't really exist any more.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morikubo:</strong> That kind of thing hasn't existed here for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> That's to be expected. Do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Not at all. Am I even still in Japan?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> You are, don't worry. We're in a little town called Yumegēmu, in the east of Tokushima Prefecture.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Yumegēmu? You're not very good at coming up with fake place names, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Satohama:</strong> I know it sounds dumb, but I believe it's called that because being in this place is like dreaming that you're in some video game.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Still doesn't excuse it sounding dumb though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Kisaragi-san, please remain still while I inspect the summoning circle. Satohama, Kuroki, can you inspect the computer?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Satohama:</strong> Got it!</p>
<p><em>[Agents Kuroki and Satohama approach the computer. Several programs are running, including Paradolphin<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>, which is recording several hundred million packets of EVE particles every second from over 30000 different IP addresses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Satohama:</strong> <em>[quietly]</em> Am I seeing this right?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> <em>[quietly]</em> It peaked at 550 million… H-have we stumbled into a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ayase:</strong> Kōsaka-san, can I get a clearer view of the summoning circle?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Of course. Kisaragi-san, I hope you don't mind if I take some photos?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Do whatever you want. Can't do much about it from here anyway.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Kōsaka takes several photographs of the summoning circle using her Foundation-issued smartphone and sends them to Command.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ayase:</strong> Lumina-chan, does this match anything in the database?</p>
<p><strong>Lumina.aic:</strong> Sure does! That's the summoning sigil found in SCP-7813's source code. Here, I'll pull it up for you.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Ayase compares the two images visually.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ayase:</strong> Looks like it. Remind me to send an excerpt from the exploration video to that skip's research team.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Satohama, what's the situation with the computer?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Satohama:</strong> There's three or four hundred million packets of EVE particles coming through this thing every second. If my math is right, I think that's around… 75 million HVE<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>? Certainly more than anything I've ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Hiyama:</strong> What? I know we're on top of the Great Asia-Pacific Ley Line<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>, but even so that's still a lot…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morikubo:</strong> Gee, you think? You could probably summon Lucifer himself a hundred times a second with that kind of EVE flow.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Hiyama:</strong> Shall we try disconnecting the computer from the internet?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Might as well; at least it'll stop the circle's EVE buffer from building up any further. Kuroki?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kuroki:</strong> O-on it!</p>
<p><em>[Agent Kuroki turns back to the computer and disables the Wi-Fi and Ethernet settings. She kneels down to inspect the back of the computer case and pulls out an Ethernet cable joined directly to the wall. No change in the summoning circle's activity is observed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Hiyama:</strong> Looks like there's still EVE left inside the summoning circle itself.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Satohama:</strong> Given how much traffic was going through the computer, I can't say I didn't expect that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Well, if only it were that easy, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kōsaka:</strong> Well, I think we should be on our way. My apologies, Kisaragi-san.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> You don't need to apologize. I wasn't even expecting visitors today. Anyway, I'll be here if you ever find a way to get me out of here… I guess.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Kōsaka leads the exploration team out of the room.]</em></p>

<p><span class="divider"><span style="font-size:1.375em;"><strong>Addendum 7813.III</strong></span></span><span class="subtitle"><strong>SCP-7813-1 and SCP-7813-2</strong></span></p>
<p>SCP-7813-1 is a Tartarean entity resembling a young adult male of Japanese descent, with small curved horns on either side of its head and a thin, long tail covered in a layer of keratinous film, ending in an arrowhead-shaped chitinous tip. SCP-7813-1 identifies itself as Sōta Kisaragi, a minor Acedia-class demon spawned in 2006. From its spawning until its involvement with SCP-7813, SCP-7813-1 had been residing in <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/toyoho-hub">Tōno Yōkai Sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>SCP-7813-1 is generally amicable, and researchers who have conversed with it report that it generally has a nonchalant attitude, even to its current predicament.</p>
<p>SCP-7813-1 is known to have been in contact with various members of GoI-093 ("PAMWAC"), including <em>Minecraft</em> mod developer PoI-778513 (username "rinrin_studio").</p>
<p>SCP-7813-2 is a small pocket dimension accessible through Nx-58. Due to the anomalous properties of Nx-58, there is no fixed entrance to SCP-7813-2; however, Kant counters installed in the interior indicate a consistent ambient Hume level of 86 Hm, suggesting that the interior of SCP-7813-2 is only partially affected by Nx-58's properties.</p>
<p>SCP-7813-2 contains a single room measuring 8.3 m × 6.8 m. A large summoning circle is present on the floor, which activates irregularly with an average frequency of 2.7 Hz; each activation summons SCP-7813-1, instantaneously teleporting it to the center of the circle. At the time of discovery, a desktop computer had been set up against the wall opposite the entrance to provide EVE particle flow to the summoning circle, using the anomalous properties of Nx-58 to remain in operation at all times. Due to the large volume of EVE stored in the summoning circle, any attempt to damage, alter or disable the summoning circle at present would likely release enough EVE to destroy the pocket dimension, completely destabilize the structure of reality in Nx-58, render the Kansai, Chūgoku and Shikoku regions completely uninhabitable, and generate lethal levels of aspect radiation throughout the rest of the Japanese Archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, and parts of the Russian Far East and Northeast China.</p>
<p>While the computer has been successfully turned off, after which it demanifested due to Nx-58's properties, it is estimated that the amount of EVE stored in the summoning circle will allow it to continue to repeatedly summon SCP-7813-1 for at least the next 250 years.</p>
<p><span class="divider"><span style="font-size:1.375em;"><strong>Addendum 7813.IV</strong></span></span><span class="subtitle"><strong>Background Information Relating to SCP-7813-1 and PoI-775813</strong></span></p>
<p>In October 2024, SCP-7813-1 made several posts on the "gaming" section of GoI-093 ("PAMWAC")'s imageboard, in which it professed its dislike for <em>Minecraft</em> magic mods for being "inaccurate" and "cringy", singling out <em>Way of the Conjurer</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>, a modification created by fellow GoI-093 member PoI-778513, for being "the least accurate depiction of thaumaturgy [he had] ever seen", and threatened to reveal PoI-778513's personal information unless the mod was "revised to include a proper depiction of the magitek you claim to be an expert on". In retaliation, PoI-778513 obtained SCP-7813-1's name sigil, began to develop SCP-7813 and through unknown, likely anomalous means, inserted it into various popular modpacks. Of note is that SCP-7813-1 and PoI-778513 had been on amicable terms up until this incident; prior discussions between them indicate that they had similar interests, including sandbox games and idol anime series.</p>
<p>Following the discovery of SCP-7813-1's posts on GoI-093's imageboard, Foundation staff identified PoI-778513 as Rinko Akasaki, at the time a high school student residing in Tokushima Prefecture. When questioned, her family members, teachers and classmates claimed to be unaware of her programming ability or involvement in the anomalous community. In view of PoI-778513's exceptional programming skills in both anomalous and non-anomalous programming languages, frameworks and paradigms, the Department of Anomalous Programming requested for her to be offered a scholarship to Shikoku Central Public University, a Foundation front organization, on the condition that she would join the Foundation after graduation. PoI-778513 accepted the scholarship and completed her course of study in 2029, at which point she was hired by the Foundation as a Junior Researcher.</p>

Junior Researcher Rinko Akasaki submitted a proposal to neutralize SCP-7813 and free SCP-7813-1 to the Minecraft Division. After discussing the proposal, Dr. Henry Friedman and Dr. Yukino Makimiya requested to meet with Researcher Akasaki through teleconferencing.</p>
<div class="custom-blockquote">
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-79<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 2031/07/16<br/>
<strong>Present:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junior Researcher Rinko Akasaki, Department of Anomalous Programming <em>(via videoconferencing)</em></li>
<li>Dr. Yukino Makimiya, Minecraft Division</li>
<li>Dr. Henry Friedman, Minecraft Division</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Makimiya:</strong> Good evening, Akasaki-san.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Good evening. Have you read through my proposal?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> I've read through it, yes. Unfortunately, I have to reject it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> What? But…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> For one, while your proposal is certainly technically feasible, installing a narrative upwards socket anywhere within <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3513">SCP-CN-3513</a> would pose a significant real-world threat to personnel accessing Site-418-α, including you. We don't have full control over SCP-CN-3513, so there's no guarantee that someone won't, for example, send a lit block of TNT through the socket and make your computer explode.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> But the narrative upwards socket only exists on the client. If you don't have the socket mod, there's no way for that to happen. And only things in the client's memory can pass through the socket, so the possibility of remote sabotage is—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> <em>[interrupting]</em> For another thing, sending such a powerful item to SCP-CN-3513 would also introduce the risk of it falling into the hands of anyone else on the server. There's a reason we don't send certain modded items there.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> But… but it'll only be there for as long as it takes to send it through the upwards socket, and then I can easily toss it into lava… plus, you've already been blocking access to CN-3513 on the official client for years; the risk should be negligible at this point—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> Enough! Site-418-α is the most important site for the Minecraft Division's virtual containment program. It's the only location where the OPERATOR Protocol can be executed, and the facility itself is the product of years of dedicated work. I can't accept even the slightest chance of losing it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Please! At least let me see Sōta-kun. I need to apologize to him. For my sake, if not his.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Makimiya:</strong> Akasaki-san, I understand that you regret what you have done to SCP-7813-1. I can sympathize with your intentions. If you can provide sufficient evidence that this will safely work…</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I… I'm certain it will work. I was the one who wrote SCP-7813, I wrote <em>Way of the Conjurer</em>, I designed the mechanics, I drew the textures for every item. I even wrote the code that supports -2 and anchors it to Yumegēmu.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Remember what you said to me when we first met, Dr. Friedman? That I was one of the most talented programmers you had ever got to know? That you wished that Site-15 hadn't gotten to me first? That you had a lot to learn from someone like me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> That is certainly true. However, while you may be an excellent game designer and an even better software developer, you could do with a little more caution.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> But I know for certain this will free him. You know, every night I think about how much Sōta-kun has missed while trapped in there, and how lonely it must be in that empty room, and how it's all my fault… that guilt is really getting to me. Please, let me free him. If not for his sake, for mine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> Emotional arguments will get you nowhere, Akasaki. I cannot allow this unless you come up with a way to do it without putting the entire Minecraft Division on the line.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Makimiya:</strong> Henry, I think she has a point. I've been in a similar situation before, and it can really reduce your productivity, not to mention the toll it takes on your body. I got an email from Site-15's resident psychologist yesterday. Akasaki-san has been stressing over this since she found out what happened to SCP-7813-1. At this point, I'm worried for her safety. I think we should let her have this one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Friedman:</strong> If it's your request, Yukino, I suppose I can make an exception. Still, if I log in tomorrow and half of Site-418-α is gone, I certainly won't be happy. I will make the arrangements for you to come to Site-79 tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Researcher Akasaki arrived at Site-79 on 2031/07/18. After arriving, a Minecraft Division operator created Anomalous Object 79013 under her supervision.</p>
<p>Following a briefing on navigation within Nx-58, Researcher Akasaki was temporarily implanted with a subdermal RFID chip, equipped with a small-scale local reality anchor to protect AO-79013 from being altered, and permitted to enter the Nexus limits accompanied by MTF-け-17.</p>
<p>Upon discovering the entrance to SCP-7813-2, Researcher Akasaki requested that MTF-け-17 wait outside the door while she entered unaccompanied.</p>
<p>The following log was recorded by the surveillance camera and microphone system within SCP-7813-2.</p>
<div class="custom-blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Recording&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Oh, I haven't seen you before. New hire?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Well… I would have preferred not to meet you in such circumstances, Sōta-kun. I've come to offer my deepest apologies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Huh? Who are you and what are you apologizing to me for?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> It's me. Rinrin. The one responsible for… for all this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> … You're Rinrin? You look so different from how I'd imagined you.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I suppose. And I'm truly sorry. I didn't mean for you to be trapped for so long. I was immature and inexperienced, and I didn't know just how much power I was dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> So, have you found a way to get me out of here or something?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> … That's why I'm here. It's the least I can do, right? After all the trouble I've caused you…</p>
<p><em>[Researcher Akasaki retrieves AO-79013 from her handbag.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Timepiece of Eternity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>. You have no idea how hard it was to convince them to try this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> … Well, even if I've been rubberbanding in place for years, I can still appreciate the irony in that. Saved by the very mod that got me into this mess to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Back then, when I saw that you hadn't posted in months, I was worried, you know? And then when I joined the Foundation, they didn't tell me what had happened to you. I had to search the database for my own creation, and… well, ever since I found out, I could never shake off that feeling of guilt.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> I mean, to me, I was in the wrong too. I went too far, threatening to dox you. I don't know what got into me back then.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I mean… you were young. We both were.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> But even still, trapping me here for 250 years is kind of disproportionate, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I… I didn't know it would generate that much EVE, or that so many people would download it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Well, what are you waiting for? Free me from this prison.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Alright then. Here goes…</p>
<p><em>[Researcher Akasaki places AO-79013 at SCP-7813-1's feet. The directions of the hands on the watch instantaneously change, and SCP-7813-1 loses its balance and falls backward. It remains in a sitting position on the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Ow. Well, I'm still on my ass after five seconds, so I guess it worked.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Y-yeah. <em>[pauses]</em> I honestly don't expect to be forgiven. You don't have to force yourself, I mean… I can understand if you hate me still…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Rinrin, you forget that I'm a demon of <em>sloth</em>. A wrath or pride demon would have held a grudge, but me? That's way too much effort.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I see. Well, in that case, we ought to head back. I… actually, how are you gonna get back to Toyoho?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Honestly, I don't know.</p>
<p><em>[The two remain silent for 16 seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Come to think of it, why did we end up fighting, anyway? As immature as I was back then, I don't think I'd have gotten into such a petty argument with you, especially since you were one of my few friends in those years.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> I… I don't know. It might be another anomaly. Now that I look back on it, I don't know what got into me either. I remember staying up four nights in a row just coding out that mod.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Four nights in a row? I could never do that.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> By the way, I realize I never told you my name — I'm Rinko Akasaki.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Well, you'll always be Rinrin to me. It's a cute nickname, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Well, if it's you, I guess I'm okay with it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7813-1:</strong> Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Akasaki:</strong> Yeah. I'll take you with me to Site-79; they'll likely need to have you stay for a while until you're fit to return to Toyoho.</p>
<p><em>[Researcher Akasaki and SCP-7813-1 leave SCP-7813-2. Approximately 30 minutes later, all audio and video feeds from within SCP-7813-2 are lost.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Recording&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>As of 2032-07-01, SCP-7813 is considered Neutralized; no extant copies of SCP-7813 have been detected since 2028-08-31, save for an archival copy saved in Site-79's central database. A team led by Researcher Akasaki has used the narrative upwards socket implementation in SCP-7813 as a base for MiNUS, a cross-platform NUS with unprecedented efficiency, with bindings in C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, Python and Rust.</p>
<p>The SCP-7813-1 designation is no longer in use; Sōta Kisaragi was held at Site-79 for three months to ensure that he did not retain any of the anomalous effects related to SCP-7813, after which he returned to Tōno Yōkai Sanctuary with the help of <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/jagpato-hub">JAGPATO</a>. Researcher Akasaki remains in regular contact with him, and the two are now again on friendly terms.</p>
<p>SCP-7813-2 no longer exists; it is assumed to have collapsed due to the latent anomalous effects of Nx-58 after direct observation was lost for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Investigation is ongoing into the cause of the unusual behavior mentioned by Mr. Kisaragi and Researcher Akasaki in the above log.</p>
