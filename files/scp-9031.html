<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong></p>
<p>The Scope-139<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> has been stablished in the Fort Simpson village to head the research and containment procedures of SCP-9031, under the supervision of the Department of Meteorology and the Department of Zoology.</p>
<p>In accordance with the agreement between the Canadian Regional Council and the Government of Canada, the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will provide continuous and comprehensive support in handling SCP-9031 cases.</p>
<p>The Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce will investigate and alert the Foundation of any reported death on Canadian territory that indicates the onset of an SCP-9031-A case, in which instance Foundation agents shall maintain surveillance on all subjects who have been involved with the perishment or have been closely related to the victim. Once the particular subject affected by SCP-9031-A is identified, they will be captured and transferred to Scope-139 under the excuse of having committed a crime for which they will be sentenced to life imprisonment or +90 years in prison; the crime in question will be falsified by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>
<p>The subject will be interrogated and held at Scope-139 until their death. The gold formed by the corpse of the subject will be used to fund operations. Foundation agents will intervene in local weather reports and news broadcasts to cover the effects of SCP-9031-A on the fauna and climate around Scope-139.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to conceal the existence of SCP-9031-B and prevent tourist interest in it, given its classification as a World Heritage Site since 1978 in addition to the Canadian government considering the economic benefit of the park necessary; instead of restricting access completely, strict regulations for touristing SCP-9031-B wildlife have been designed under the guise of hostile, in conjunction with the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>All tourism companies operating in Fort Simpson village have been acquired by the Foundation.</li>
<li>All visits to SCP-9031-B must be strictly accompanied and guided by a Foundation agent or Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce agent undercover as a tour guide.</li>
<li>Video surveillance systems have been installed along the road connecting Fort Simpson village to SCP-9031-B.</li>
<li>Gold mining and excavations in SCP-9031-B have been prohibited by national law of Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies about SCP-9031-B and SCP-9031-C are being conducted.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9031-A is a pattern of behaviour and anomalous events that manifests around individuals throughout western Canada and the north-western United States. Originally it was believed that the phenomenon exclusively affected individuals in Canada; however, on 1998 and 2002, SCP-9031-A occurred in Idaho and Alaska, respectively. A case of SCP-9031-A occurs precisely every five months. Subjects recorded to date have shared the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kleptomania or obsession with money.</li>
<li>Experience in management or leadership jobs.</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction with their current financial status or family situation.</li>
<li>At some point in their life, they have directly or indirectly harmed another person for financial gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event that has been determined to correspond to the initiation of the SCP-9031-A process is the perishment of a loved one whom the subject admired or respected in some way. The demise will always occur in a manner (be it accident, homicide, or suicide) in which a sharp object pierces the heart of the deceased.</p>
<p>From that moment on, precisely every twelve weeks, the subject will experience visual hallucinations in which they will see brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) in different situations. The individuals interviewed claim that they were subconsciously able to determine that the encounter was not a threat. During this process, the subject's language will begin to change and adopt vocabulary which until this date have not been identified as any known human language. Once the subject reaches fluency in this unknown language, they will die abruptly. The body will take on a mummified appearance and transmute into solid gold of between 20 and 22 carats. Trees of the genus Populus (aspen) and Picea (spruce) will begin to sprout from the area surrounding the corpse.</p>
<p>However, observations made by the SCP Foundation indicate that the consciousness of the affected subject persists after death, becoming a Class-Terminal spectral entity. The SCP-9031-A process will continue with an acceleration of the degradation of the subject's material possessions, while their surfaces are autonomously carved to express verses in Proto-Athabaskan covering the entire surface.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Lastly, the final phase of SCP-9031 involves a change in wind patterns and non-domestic animals behavior within a 540km radius of the subject. The wind will begin to move cyclically from the subject's area to SCP-9031-B, and non-domestic animals in the area will likewise follow the same wind pattern. This weather condition will persist until the subject moves to SCP-9031-B, at which point it will disappear and SCP-9031-A will come to an end.</p>
<p>SCP-9031-B is the entirety of Nahanni National Park Reserve, Northwest Territories, Canada. The fauna and flora of SCP-9031-B exhibit the following unnatural qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete absence of ageing.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Complete absence of feeding needs and predatory behaviour.</li>
<li>Abnormally organised behaviour: patrolling habits, communication between species and a tendency to observe humans from a distance.</li>
<li>Potential hostility, which is provoked only when a human attempts to interfere with the park ground.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Abnormal weather patterns have been observed within SCP-9031-B, in which portions of wind at ground level move randomly and arbitrarily within a region of effect. This region of effect moves around SCP-9031-C. Vocalisations have been identified in the same language expressed by subjects affected by SCP-9031-A. Fauna within SCP-9031-B has been shown to respond peacefully to these vocalisations.</p>
<p>SCP-9031-C is a sculpture made of solid gold of between 12 and 14 carats buried beneath the center part of SCP-9031-B. Its total mass has been estimated to weight ~400000 Kg. The structure resembles five mummified humans of 4 meters height, sat with crossed legs, holding each other arms, forming a ring facing inwards, and wearing sculpted clothes that resemble traditional indigenous clothing of the western canadian region. In the center of the ring, there is a sculpture of a spruce seed. Every part of SCP-9031-C shows written engravings in the same languages acquired by SCP-9031-A affected subjects.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM: HISTORY:</strong></p>
<p>The anomalous properties of SCP-9031 were originally described by the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after studying the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Frank McLeod and Willie McLeod in 1904, and Charlie McLeod in 1907.</p>
<p>Frank McLeod and Willie McLeod are the first known subjects affected by SCP-9031-A. The reason behind why the two were affected at the same time is unknown, but it is believed that it might been related to the fact that the two were involved with gold mining within SCP-9031-B. Charlie McLeod was the second registered case of SCP-9031-A. Mayor information regarding the progress of SCP-9031-A and the circumstances surrounding the McLeod brother prior to their deaths were not registered neither investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but their bodies were relocated to a government research facility in 1908 and fake perishment was disclosed.</p>
<p>The studies conducted by the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce from 1910 to 1920 in SCP-9031-B registered spectral vocalizations in the area recognized as the respective voices of Frank, Willie and Charlie McLeod. From the 1920 decade to the 1970 decade, ~70 cases of SCP-9031-A were handled by the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce, allowing the identification of the common qualities shared among subjects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> There have been found records of the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce advising the Canadian government to not allow SCP-9031-B being classified as a World Heritage Site, but it is unknown if the Canadian government could not interfere in the UNESCO veredict or it simply did not try to interfere.</p>
<p>It was not until the consolidation of the Canadian Regional Council in 1984 and the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce being now under Foundation supervision that the records about SCP-9031 were discovered and it received an SCP designation (SCP-CA-710) in 1985. Geological and meteorological studies started being conducted, leading to the discovery of SCP-9031-C in 1992, and te first effective translation of its written engravings was made on 1999, which resulted in the following inscriptions on each part of the sculpture:</p>
<ul>
<li>First human sculpture: "The greed. "</li>
<li>Second human sculpture: "The damnation."</li>
<li>Third human sculpture: "The tuition."</li>
<li>Fourth human sculpture: "The transition."</li>
<li>Fifth human sculpture: "The nature."</li>
<li>Spruce seed sculpture: "The persistence."</li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of two cases of SCP-9031-A affecting Melany Hunnisett in Idaho in 1998 and Elov Finch in Alaska in 2002 prompted a subsequent change in the threat level associated to SCP-9031, with the O5 Council becoming involved with the item and assigning its current designation as SCP-EN-9031. Continuous seismological investigations of SCP-9031-B and SCP-9031-C detected the beginning of autonomous movement towards the southeast simultaneously with the occurrence of SCP-9031-A in Idaho. Considering the threat that range of effect of SCP-9031 may increase, and the anomaly itself may evolve, the O5 Council and the Canadian Regional Council are designing new containment measures for SCP-9031-A and considering potential extraction and retention measures for SCP-9031-C. Currently, SCP-9031-C is moving at a pace of 25cm per year.</p>
