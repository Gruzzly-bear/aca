<p>SCP-9239, formerly Containment Unit 428-B.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9239</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two Scranton Reality Anchors are to be present on the left and right sides of the entrance to SCP-9239 respectively to prevent any dimensional intrusions to baseline reality. SCP-9239-A is to be kept in Containment Unit 428-A at Site-17, and is to be provided standard amenities typical for humanoid anomalies.</p>
<p>SCP-9239-A is not to be informed of <a href="/scp-239">SCP-239</a>’s status as an uncontained anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9239 is an extradimensional space created through ontokinetic manipulation. It takes the form of a realm consisting of creatures and objects similar to those depicted in common fairy tales. The entrance to this realm is currently located in the area formerly designated as Containment Unit 428-B,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> which has replaced the steel doors with a door of a design typically seen in medieval fortresses. Entering through this door will lead to a dense forest with trees as tall as 60 meters, and mythical creatures such as unicorns and ogres. These creatures are usually docile, and will not attack personnel unless provoked.</p>
<p>SCP-9239-A refers to itself as Sir Reynold the Great, who is the only human being present in SCP-9239. It claims to be the protector of SCP-239, and it wants to reunite with it for unclear purposes. SCP-9239-A is impervious to any and all forms of damage, but otherwise is typical of a standard non-anomalous human, wearing nondescript armor from the medieval period and wielding a broadsword for close combat.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9239 was discovered on 2019/03/08 when the door to Containment Unit 428-B suddenly transfigured into its current form. SCP-9239-A proceeded to open the entrance from the other side to enter baseline reality. It expressed confusion about its surroundings before being detained by security personnel. Initial intake interviews provided little information, as SCP-9239-A demanded to see SCP-239. After being informed that this would not be possible,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> it proceeded to draw its sword and attempt to attack personnel, and was subsequently sedated.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9239.01:</strong> Interview 9239-A.06</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of the sixth interview between SCP-9239-A and Dr. Glass, conducted on 2019/06/10.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> So, could you explain to me again why you’re looking for “Princess Siggy?”</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass is sitting in his chair, holding his clipboard and writing on a piece of paper. SCP-9239-A is currently leaning against a wall, attempting to look unconcerned. Its left hand is resting on its sword’s sheath.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Why certainly, good sir! You see, we’ve been the best of companions since we were but wee lads and lasses, and we’ve traveled afar in that little world of hers. She has such imagination, with a will that can topple a mountain with just a thought. Isn’t that magnificent?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Well, yes, it is quite a destructive ability.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You must be her caretakers, then?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I am saying it.</p>
<p><em>Glass sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> I can tell. But there’s a reason why we keep her here, Reynold. She can make a man disappear in the blink of an eye. In fact, we know she has done that at least once.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A steps away from the wall, and moves toward Dr. Glass, speaking to him in a stern voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> She was only a child.</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> A child with the ability to do whatever she wanted. We couldn’t have sent her out into the world. With that kind of power combined with her naivety, it would’ve hurt her and who knows how many other people.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> But now she’s grown, and she knows better. I need to see her. Please, good sir, you must take me to her!</p>
<p><em>Glass rubs his forehead in exasperation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> You know I can’t allow that, Reynold. There’s too many risks with having separate anomalies interact with each other, especially with ones that have been recently formed.</p>
<p><em>Reynold slams a fist on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I am <em>not</em> those aberrations that you speak of! I am a knight, bounded by oath to protect the fair maiden Siggy, and I will not be taking orders from knaves like you!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A proceeds to attempt to exit the chamber, before being stopped and subdued by the guards stationed outside. Dr. Glass takes a sip of his coffee, seemingly unfazed.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Adams enters the room, smirking at Dr. Glass, who rolls his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> ‘Nother loon on the loose, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> I’m not bothered by it. He never makes it far.</p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> A bit pathetic for a knight, don’t you think?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass folds his arms and stares at her expectantly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> What’s your business for being here?</p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> Well, I got good news! We may have found 239’s hiding spot.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass leans in a bit closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> Yeah, some place in the middle of bumfuck Ohio. Chillicothe, I think. The nerds found some pretty damn strong levels of reality going sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> How close is it to hers, though?</p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> Almost an exact match.</p>
<p><em>Glass pauses, and considers something for a moment. Then he reaches for the phone on his desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> I need to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>Adams:</strong> What for?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Someone who can help us reach out to her. I know just the person for the job, and luckily for us, he’s in the right place and hopefully the right time.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9239.02:</strong> Communication with SCP-239</p>
<p>On 2019/06/13, Dr. Michael Prescott, head of Psychology &amp; Parapsychology at Site-35, requested to meet with SCP-239 through a message sent by a contact from the Wanderer’s Library. The request was initially refused, however through a series of correspondences Dr. Prescott eventually convinced SCP-239 to meet with it in a public location alone with no surveillance. After deliberation, this proposition was accepted, and Dr. Prescott went to a local café in Chillicothe for this purpose.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott makes his way to the outdoor patio of the café, before spotting SCP-239 sitting alone at a table away from the people around it. It is wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, attempting to keep itself inconspicuous.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott sits across from it, and reaches out his hand as a gesture of introducing himself. SCP-239 reluctantly shakes his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Pleasure to make your acquaintance. You may call me Michael.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Are you expecting me to tell you my name, or what?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Well, I was just introducing myself. It’s courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Did someone up top forget that I’ve been on-the-run from you all for the past 13 years now?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> It’s at least better than calling you by your numbers. That never rolls off the tongue well. ‘Hey ess see pee two three nine, how have you been feeling lately?’ See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> And it’s dehumanizing.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That too, yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> If you want a name, you can use my fake name for now. Shelby.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That will suffice. Thank you, Shelby.</p>
<p><em>He breaks off eye contact with SCP-239, and begins to watch passing cars at the road ahead of them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> If I may ask, how did you manage to stay away from us for so long? We certainly don’t have the best technology to track reality benders like the GOC does, but we would have noticed something eventually.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 smiles, and gleefully points at its hat and sunglasses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You mean these, right? That’s my go-to.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Your go-to disguise is a baseball cap and sunglasses?</p>
<p><em>It shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> The Clark Kent method does work under the right circumstances. Only you guys know me as 239, and if everyone else knows me as Shelby, as long as I don’t use my magic, it’s all good! No one would be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Besides recently, since we caught you doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Come on, can’t a girl have a little bit of fun and whimsy in her life? Or at least go five seconds without being watched?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 points at the traffic camera across the street recording them.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I thought we agreed on no surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I can’t speak for my superiors, but since we have access to the majority of surveillance systems around the world, it technically doesn’t violate our agreement since it’s always being monitored 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Wow, that makes me feel <em>so much better</em>.</p>
<p><em>It sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Can’t catch a fucking break. Why are you even here, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I was first sent to request assistance from you, but the question of your recent activity is something significant to the people who first took you under their care.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Right, those assholes at 17. If they want to know something, it was for a friend’s birthday party. That’s all you’re getting. And why do you need my help?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott turns his attention back to SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> They first spotted something unusual at the containment unit where you once resided. A door to another realm, full of magical creatures. They thought it linked back to you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> So? That can mean anything. You have to deal with stuff like that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That is true, but the first thing they encountered once the door opened was a knight with the name Reynold the Great, supposedly. Does that ring a bell to you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 stands up quickly and suddenly, eyes open wide in shock.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You’ve got to be <em>shitting me</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott stands up as well, pushing his chair in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> You do know something about this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I thought he wouldn’t come back. Like all of the others. How is he <em>here</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That’s what we’re trying to figure out.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 begins to pace back and forth, muttering to itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> How is this possible? He can’t be out here. I specifically made it that way. That can’t be right. No, that can’t be right at all. How—</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Are you alright, Shelby?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 stops in its tracks, and turns to face Dr. Prescott.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You don’t need my help.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I need to pull the weed by its roots. Then we can forget this all happened and you won’t have to worry about me again. ‘Kay? ‘Kay.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239’s eyes flash a bright green color. Dr. Prescott rushes over to it, and as it completes the thaumaturgical incantation for instant translocation, he puts a hand on its shoulder, adding himself to the thaumaturgical rite being cast, and causing both of them to disappear from view.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9239.03:</strong> Exploration of SCP-9239</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of Dr. Prescott and SCP-239’s impromptu exploration of SCP-9239, taken from Dr. Prescott’s personal cell phone camera.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Camera activates. Dr. Prescott holds the camera, and spots himself and SCP-239 in a dense forest, with trees that have low-hanging branches and knotted and tangled roots, thick enough to be unable to see past their immediate surroundings. The trees are large enough to block out the sun, making the whole forest feel shaded and enormous. Small pink lights appear to maneuver through the forest, bouncing up and down in a rhythmic manner.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-239 stares at Dr. Prescott and crosses its arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Did you really need to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I thought I could be of some help.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I don’t need anybody’s help. I can handle myself.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I apologize if I came across that way, but this is an uncharted anomaly with unknown properties. I’ve learned by now that it’s never a good idea to go to a place like this alone.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> And yet you’re holding a camera and recording me. Oh wait, I get it now, you’re here so that they can track you and catch up to me. And then you’ll put me right back in my cage! No thanks.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 begins to advance forward. Dr. Prescott follows behind it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That was not my intention. I’m recording us in case no one is able to contact us again. It’s standard protocol.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Of course. You people and your protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Until we find a way out of this place, you’re stuck with me unfortunately.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 turns to look at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Okay? Just don’t mess with what I’m doing, like that stunt you pulled earlier. I need to get this done.</p>
<p><em>It turns back and keeps going. Dr. Prescott takes a second before catching up to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Am I able to ask what you are planning to accomplish here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Because you keep asking me these inane questions! Aren’t you supposed to be good at reading people?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Not in a casual conversation, no. But that’s how my brain is wired, so I’ll have to live with it.</p>
<p><em>It shakes its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> At least you were able to figure out why you are that way, right? Lucky you. The only good thing I ever got was being put in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Because you finally felt free.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> In an ironic way, yes. What those researchers at 17 didn’t know was that I was able to immerse myself in my imagination, creating entire worlds that became my sandbox. I did what I pleased, and acted out fantasies that I never got to do otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I assume that’s how this place was formed, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Well, not like this, but yeah. When I was in my coma, this was all in my mindscape, and not as real as this. Not sure why it’s all real now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 produces a flame by snapping its fingers, before snuffing it out by closing its palm.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Your people made me, you know. You told me I was a witch, you gave me that spell book and told me what I should be, you put that idea in my head and then told me stories of princes fighting dragons for the princesses that they loved. They all lived happily ever after, because that’s how it’s supposed to go. Riding off into the sunset with your partner, because that’s the point that everyone is supposed to reach in life. All roads lead to love.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I think I see where you’re going with this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You think? This is how it’s been for the past <em>thirteen goddamn years</em>.</p>
<p><em>It huffs, and exerts its ability to lift a tree from its roots, pulling the tree towards itself. It headbutts the tree, splitting it in half.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I can literally do whatever the hell I want, and yet this shit is stopping me. Isn’t that embarrassing?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I’ve had clients with similar experiences to yours. Trying to navigate a world actively hostile to the idea of your orientation is quite a difficult task.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Especially when it goes unnoticed most of the time. The kind of stuff that I have to deal with, it’s almost never discussed. I’ve had people look at me like I’ve said an unknown language just because I wanted to stay single. Not my fault they’re trying to dig into my supposed love life!</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Have there been any difficulties with your social life because of this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Thankfully, no. I found friends. Well, it’s more like they found me, but I’ve got some by my side, and I wouldn’t have dreamt of anything better.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 sits in front of the tree that it split and leans back against it. Dr. Prescott sits next to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> They don’t know how much I care about them. How much they mean to me. I can go all day praising the shit out of every single one of them. The things I’ve done with them, the memories we made together, it’s just special, you know? It’s special.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I don’t think partnering with anyone is a bad thing. That’s special for the people who want that, it’s got that deep connection and a commitment that’ll last a lifetime. But that’s not me. My friends are my life. Nothing can ever replace what we have.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Until they marry someone else.</p>
<p><em>It sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Yeah. I’m prepared for that, but it’s still not going to make it hurt less.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Like you're less valued.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> And it reminds me that, in the end, I’m alone. I never really escaped that cage, did I?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> If your friends are really your friends, they’d find a way to include you. They’d know well enough to never leave you behind. And if they mean that much to you, then there’s surely a chance that you mean that much to them. You have to share your feelings, and you have to sort it out together.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 turns to look at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You think it’s as simple as that?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Communication is a complicated process for me, but there’s nothing more effective than telling people how you feel, and working through it with them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I hope so. I really do.</p>
<p><em>They both stand up, and resume their trek through the forest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I’m surprised you haven’t kicked me out yet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You’re a good listener. Which means you know when to shut up. And you’re not those morons from 17.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Fair enough.</p>
<p><em>A screech can be heard from up above. A flaming phoenix is seen flying through the trees, starting a controlled fire in some patches of the forest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Now can I ask what you’re planning to achieve?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I’m here to bury my past, and make sure it stays dead.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9239.03:</strong> Incident 9239.01</p>
<p>Immediately after SCP-239 and Dr. Prescott’s apportation to SCP-9239, the following events took place during the latest interview between Dr. Glass and SCP-9239-A.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Why are you so invested in 239?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A is sitting in a chair across from Dr. Glass. It stares at him with a look of confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Isn’t it obvious? I love her dearly, ever since I first laid my eyes on her. She came down from the heavens and proclaimed me as her protector, to stand guard against any foe cowardly enough to attack a fair maiden like her. That was the oath we built together, one that I shall not shatter.</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Have you considered that she might not feel the same way about you now?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239 laughs with an inauthentic tone of voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> What jokes you have, good sir! If she no longer wished to see me again, then why would I be here, standing before you?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> That’s what’s not making any sense to me. From what we know, 239 has completely refused to bother with any fantastical things of any sort, ever since she’s escaped from us. Unless it was from a subconscious decision…</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause, before SCP-9239-A stands up suddenly, and enthusiastically points at Dr. Glass.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Aha! That’s it! You, my friend, have just solved the conundrum we’re in.</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Care to explain what you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I never knew if it was true, but I’m still there in her heart. Now is my chance to prove that I’m still worthy!</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Alright, hang on, slow down. Why do you need to prove that you’re ‘worthy?’</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Worthy to be her guiding light until the end. To be her companion, and perhaps even more. Together we shined brighter than the stars themselves. Don’t you understand how special that is?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> If that’s the case, then why hasn’t she talked to you yet? Surely from what you're saying about her there wouldn’t be an issue with that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Well, it has certainly been ages. How many years has it been since you last saw her?</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> Thirteen, to be exact.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A begins to consider something for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> If it has been that long, then she must have been reminiscing about me. There’s no other explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> You can’t assume that she wants to see you based on a hunch, Reynold.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> But I <em>can</em> see if she does, if you let me see her.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass collects himself, attempting to quell his burgeoning frustration.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> I’ve told you multiple times that we can’t allow that to happen. It’s against protocol, and it’s not my decision to make regardless. As long as you accept that, then there won’t be any problems.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You are no honorable man, Sir Glass. I can see it in your very spirit.</p>
<p><em>The door slams open, and two guards enter the room, one of them rushing over to Dr. Glass.</em></p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> We have a problem.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass stands up, knocking his nameplate off the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> Your colleague and 239 have somehow disappeared from the café. We suspect she’s taken him someplace else.</p>
<p><em>A look of recognition appears on SCP-9239-A’s face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I know where she is.</p>
<p><em>The remaining personnel in the room turn to face the anomaly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> You mean the forest?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Indeed. And I will not let some foulish cur take her from me. This is my chance, friends, my chance to bring her back to me! God wills me so!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A vanishes from the room, startling the guards and Dr. Glass. They look at each other for a moment, stunned.</em></p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> Well, uh, I think we might need to update the documentation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Glass sighs deeply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> You can go ahead and tell the director, I’d rather not do it myself.</p>
<p><em>He moves to exit the chamber, ignoring the guards who attempt to continue conversing with him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Glass:</strong> I really should’ve picked a different career.</p>
<p><em>He slams the door shut.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9239.04:</strong> Confrontation between SCP-239 and SCP-9239-A</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of the continuation of SCP-239 and Dr. Prescott’s exploration of SCP-9239, and the former’s encounter with SCP-9239-A.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-239 and Dr. Prescott are in a field, having left the dense forest. Around them are 3-meter-tall griffins who chase the deer grazing in the field. Once they capture the deer, they sink their claws into the deer’s skin and fly upwards, beginning to consume them in the sky above.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Will you know when you’ll find what you’re looking for?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 gazes into the horizon.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> He’ll find me. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><em>They stare at the field of animals ahead in silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I was thinking about how they treated you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 turns to him and tilts its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> What for?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> In my line of work, we’re trying a new form of how to handle anomalies. One that treats them not as a contained object, but instead in a way that humanizes them, providing a safe environment for them to be comfortable in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> And why does that matter to what I’ve been through?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Instead of putting you through a fabrication that dictated your life and your actions, we could’ve taught you how to manage your powers, and we could’ve at least done something that made you comfortable to be <em>you</em> and express yourself without risking harm to others. It would’ve been exceedingly difficult since you were a child, but you were a child nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> It wasn’t that bad, really.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> How so?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 gestures to the field around it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I was able to make the worlds I was able to make. And that gave me the chance to, you know, escape from my cell and be free. If I wasn’t able to teach myself to be on my own, I wouldn’t have gotten myself out of that coma.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott nods in understanding.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> That is fair.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Let me ask you something. Are you consulting with any of them at all?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> They’d want to escape.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Well, yeah, no shit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> The people you work for think they’re so confident that they have all the answers, that they know what’s best for people like me. But they never will. So if escape isn’t an option, then maybe you can at least try to put yourself in their shoes?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I have been thinking about such things, but you have good points there. I could potentially—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott is grabbed by a claw, but not of the griffins. He is taken higher and higher by a massive, gold-and-black scaled dragon, on the back of which is SCP-9239-A. It waves its sword in the air, as if to greet SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><em>The griffins and deer scamper away from the presence of the dragon. Dr. Prescott attempts to free himself from the dragon’s claws and calls out to SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> My dear Siggy! It is a great honor to meet you once again!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Not to me, it isn’t.</p>
<p><em>Both the dragon and SCP-9239-A tilt their heads in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Why do you look so grim?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I think you can take a pretty good guess.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Am I not worthy to travel together alongside you again? I promise you, I am still the same as I ever was.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Exactly. That’s the problem.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 begins to levitate itself until it faces the dragon in front of it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> We’re not going to travel together again. I’ve changed, Reynold. Changed for the better, because I’m doing what’s best for myself. I think you should consider that, and try to do what’s best for you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> But what has always been the most important thing to me is you, my dear.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 rolls its eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Have you always been this saccharine? Oh wait, I guess you have.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Now that is <em>very unlike</em> a lady such as yourself. Have your manners gone as well?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Look, man, I’ve moved on from you. I moved on from those fantasies because that wasn’t who I really was. All I ever wanted was to be reminded that I was still a <em>human person</em> for fuck’s sake, because I never got a chance to feel like anything in that cage. And when I read those fairy tales, that connection we made together fulfilled that and made me feel whole. Problem was, it wasn’t the connection I was actually thinking of.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> What fulfills you now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> My friends. They are the light of my life, Reynold. I’d give them my everything if I could. But I can’t. I can’t because of people like you.</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You reject that which you are? You reject the very foundation of what drives us, the very thing that makes us human?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> What makes us human is our ability to define and express ourselves. There’s also, like, a million other things that make us human but that one’s the big one.</p>
<p><em>The dragon pulls Dr. Prescott up so that SCP-9239-A can see him. He scoffs at him with disdain.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> So <em>this</em> is your new companion, I see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Wha— no? We barely just met? What are you even talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> This filth is feeding you lies, isn’t he? Trying to convince you to run off with him, I bet!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I know what I am, Reynold. No one else can tell me otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Was that what you thought when your captors took you in, eh?</p>
<p><em>It points its sword at Dr. Prescott.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> How about I vanquish this foe of ours, and we can run off into the sunset once more?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> What is wrong with you? You’re not supposed to harm anyone!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I am meant to be your guardian to protect you from harm. And since this devil has already begun its tricks, I’ll have to make this quick.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A raises its sword, before being stopped by an imperceptible force. Dr. Prescott is apportated away from the dragon’s grasp, and is now seen floating next to SCP-239. He is disoriented, and is having difficulty with moving in the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Let’s hope that’s the last time I have to be kidnapped by a dragon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You’ll be fine. Let me handle this.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott is again apportated, this time to the ground below. SCP-239 floats closer to the dragon.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You <em>dare</em> defy me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I can make my own decisions. You were not supposed to, since you were an NPC, but I guess that’s changed. What gives?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Well, it’s quite simple, really. Ever since you left, I realized that since this place and I were made by the same thing, that being your imagination, then I could finally make myself be the protector that you dreamt of me to be. And now, I am one with the forest. I control all of what you see here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> That— that’s not possible. It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> It has been so long, my dear. Any longer and I would have gone mad.</p>
<p><em>The dragon huffs, smoke shooting out of its nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> If you insist.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A raises it sword to point at SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> My dear, if you wish to spar, then we shall spar. You win, and you can take that devil back with you. I win, and we shall begin our partnership as it was always meant to be. Have I made myself clear?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 balls its hands into fists.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You’re more than clear. Bring it.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A nods, and taps one of the dragon’s horns to signal a command. The dragon springs into action, and before SCP-239 has time to react, it grabs the anomaly and plummets to the field below, colliding with the dirt and dragging SCP-239 through it.</em></p>
<p><em>The dragon roars in SCP-239’s face, and begins to prepare to expel fire from its throat. Before this occurs, SCP-239 pushes out a bright green circle of ontokinetic energy in front of itself. Its eyes glow with the same color, and it grunts in pain as it exerts its ability, blocking the fire from reaching it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> And I thought you would be more of a challenge. Is your strength as weak as your heart?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Oh, I’m just getting started.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 pushes its hands forward, causing SCP-9239-A to be knocked off balance and fall off the dragon, and the dragon itself is pushed back 10 meters.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-239 then gestures to the dragon to move closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Come on big guy, hit me with your best shot.</p>
<p><em>The dragon grins, and flies down to make its second attack, with SCP-239 ascending to meet up with it.</em></p>
<p><em>They trade blows, with the dragon attempting to use its claws and jaw to injure its opponent, while SCP-239 conjures medieval shields made out of ontokinetic energy to block its attacks.</em></p>
<p><em>Seeing that SCP-239 is distracted, the dragon then whips its tail around to strike the anomaly. It cries out in pain, and blood flows from a cut on the left side of its face, almost reaching the eye. The dragon’s grin grows wider.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-239 covers its injury with one hand, and points at the dragon with the other.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Alright, that one was good, I’ll give you that. But honestly, you’re a pretty boring fighter for a dragon. I was expecting more pizazz, you know? Now I have to end this early.</p>
<p><em>A hammer that is about half the height of the dragon is conjured directly above the dragon’s head. SCP-239 snaps its fingers, and the dragon is struck with the weapon, knocking it unconscious. It plummets to the ground once more, however, SCP-239 uses its ability to cushion the fall.</em></p>
<p><em>It apportates down to where the dragon landed. While it bends down to check to see if the creature is breathing, it uses its other hand to instantly heal its own injury. Once it is done and the dragon is confirmed to be stable, it gets back up and looks around to attempt to locate SCP-9239-A’s location.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Glad you’re safe, big guy. Already got enough blood on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> And you shall spill more if you take another step further.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 turns around, to see SCP-9239-A holding Dr. Prescott hostage, its sword being held against his neck.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You continue to impress me with how naive you are, my dear. Did you really think that I’d be as merciful as I was before you left me behind?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Says the bastard who thinks that I’m the same girl he met who was led to believe something that she wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Am I led to believe otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You don’t get to decide who I’m meant to be. What I feel is real, Reynold.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> <em>I know what you are</em>. You doubt yourself. You’re doubting yourself even now. Your heart is telling me everything. You feel that deep ache in your soul, that sense of longing of something that you will never have. I see it now. You need me. You need a man to mend your heart and make you feel whole.</p>
<p><em>Tears begin to fall down SCP-239’s face, no matter how hard it tries to restrain itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Stop. Please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> I will never cease until my dear Siggy returns to my side. Let me end this madness, so we can go back to how things used to be.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 clenches its left hand to form a fist, its body shaking heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> No.</p>
<p><em>The sword holding Dr. Prescott dematerializes, causing him to drop to the floor. He sighs in relief.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> You’re trying to end this spar by cheating, eh? You can’t hide from yourself forever.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A raises its hand, and another sword materializes for it to wield.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> The anomaly attempts to bring the sword down onto Dr. Prescott, before being stopped by SCP-239’s ability. The two are locked in a standstill, with neither SCP-9239-A being able to make progress nor SCP-239 to stop it completely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Shelby, you need to listen to me—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> Quiet, you devil. No more lies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> At least let him speak.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> And have you run from me again? I think not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I said, <em>let him speak.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A continues to open its mouth, but no sound comes out. SCP-239 begins to hyperventilate, and openly sob.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Shelby, I know this may seem dire, but you can’t let him win.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I’m not strong enough. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> You are stronger than him. You are stronger than anyone can ever claim.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I have to kill him if I want to save you. I promised myself that I’d never hurt anyone again, Michael. I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> You can, because this is not the knight that you knew. This is something within you, beckoning you to let it take control. You cannot let it overcome you.</p>
<p><em>The sword slowly begins to inch its way to Dr. Prescott’s throat, as SCP-9239-A gains the upper hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I guess I still am that girl who doesn’t know what the world is like. I can’t live like this, I can’t live knowing that I’ll never be as happy as my friends are with the people they love, I can’t love, I can’t love at all, I can’t—</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Shelby, it’s alright. Take deep breaths. You’re not incapable of love. You don’t have to love like they do. There are other paths to take, there are other ways you can live.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> But I can’t live like myself. I can’t live without any of you fuckers finding me again, or having my friends turn their backs on me, or—</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> You don’t have to hide who you are. You don’t have to pretend to be someone you’re not. You have to prove them all wrong. You have to live. Even if you have to crawl your way out with your bare hands, you have to <em>live</em>.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9239-A eventually realizes that it is not vocalizing, and shakes its head, glaring at SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9239-A:</strong> A clever trick on your part, my dear. But not enough. It’s time I take back what’s rightfully mine.</p>
<p><em>It raises its sword for another strike.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I was never yours to take. You were never real to me to begin with.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 thrusts its hand forward, causing SCP-9239-A to spontaneously combust, disintegrating into ash. SCP-239 then falls onto its knees and weeps.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott slowly begins to crawl his way over to the anomaly, before eventually reaching it and laying down next to it, grunting in pain. He waits until SCP-239 lets its emotions out before sitting up and turning to look at it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> You okay?</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 sniffles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> No, but I needed that. I really needed that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> It’s what I do.</p>
<p><em>They both stare at the horizon ahead of them, seeing the sun set.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> It shouldn’t have to be as complicated as this. Why do I need to prove my love more by tying the rest of my life to someone else? I can bend the world with a thought, and yet I still feel like I don’t belong anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> It’s not only your fight. We’re always doubting ourselves, always questioning if we’re right about what we think we are, but no matter what you or I or what anyone else says, what we feel is real. It’s what gives the world all of its beauty.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Why are you always so goddamn reasonable?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Well, everyone deserves the chance to have their voices heard, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> We may see you as an anomaly, but in truth, the deep affection you have for everyone you know is intrinsic to reality itself.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 stands up, and so does Dr. Prescott.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I can feel them coming.</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> It would be best if you leave me, then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> What about you? Aren’t you supposed to take me in?</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> As long as you're safe, that’s all that matters. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott pulls out a white ring from his left middle finger, and presents it to SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I think you should have this. It’s a symbol of solidarity, to show others like me that they are never alone. I don’t need it anymore as much as you do.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 takes it, and stares at it for a moment, before realizing the significance of it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Wait…</p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> I might have exaggerated a bit when I said that I had clients like you. It was more like I was the client, really.</p>
<p><em>SCP-239 attempts to prevent its tears from returning, but fails and weeps once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> I don’t know what to say. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>It turns to look at Dr. Prescott’s left hand, and considers something for a moment. Then it snaps its fingers, and a ring exactly identical to the one given to it is manifested to fit his left middle finger. Dr. Prescott looks down towards his hand, and looks back up at the anomaly in disbelief.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> It should be the same composition with the material, but I had to guess, so…</p>
<p><em>It shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Now I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Hey, I’m full of surprises!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Prescott looks toward the tree line, and looks back at SCP-239.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> We’re still using Shelby, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s who I’m going to be from now on. Wouldn’t be well for me to dwell on the past.</p>
<p><em>He nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> Stay safe, Shelby.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-239:</strong> You too.</p>
<p><em>They wave goodbye, and SCP-239 apportates away to another location, while Dr. Prescott walks back toward the forest.</em></p>
