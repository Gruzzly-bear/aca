<p><strong>O5-4</strong>: Do you disagree?</p>
<p><strong>Offet</strong>: (a pause) No, I suppose not. It's the only way we could classify her. Uh, excuse me: it. But do we really just leave it alone, and bend to its whims whenever it calls us? It feels like a slap in the face.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4</strong>: Think of it this way, Offet: you attend to the basic needs of other anomalies, correct? We don't spoil or coddle them, certainly, but we don't neglect them, either—if only out of safety. Who's to say what this one might attempt if we don't, at times, humor her?</p>
<p><strong>Offet</strong>: She didn't strike me—excuse me, <em>it</em> didn't strike me as the type who'd enjoy being humored, ma'am. But I do see your point. (sighs) Forgive my haranguing, it still feels like she thinks we're her servants, waiting around for her pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4</strong>: (chuckles softly) Buried under that mountain of exhaustion and hate and heartbreak, she's still a Queen at heart. Ordering others around is in her blood. If one of the last remaining monarchs of our world were to invite me over for tea, I'd attend happily. Of course, I wouldn't pass up the chance of conversing with a living, breathing relic of mythology, either. Could you?</p>
<p><strong>Offet</strong>: (a pause) No ma'am, I couldn't. All the same, I may make some revisions to this document after all.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4</strong>: By all means. I will leave the rest to you, Offet. Give my best to Bouquet.</p>
<p><strong>Offet</strong>: Thank you, ma'am, I will.</p>

<p><strong>Item #</strong>: SCP-7632</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Esoteric/Binah</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: SCP-7632 is currently contained in noospherical space, although it has the ability to materialize in perceptual reality (SCP-7632-A). It has been known to appear primarily in Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, although its influence is global. At varying intervals, SCP-7632 will request the presence of a Foundation member, either through telepathy or other anomalous means. In order to maintain containment, this member, regardless of clearance or importance, must be given a temporary leave of absence and delivered to the location specified by SCP-7632. A Site Director or other Senior member of staff must be notified of this departure, and make arrangements to transport said individual to the location requested. After an unspecified period of time, the requested Foundation member will reappear at or near their original location, whereupon they must be recovered and debriefed. Amnesticization is discouraged unless approved by those with Level 4 clearance or higher.</p>
<p>During interactions, the requested Foundation member is to treat SCP-7632-A with courtesy and respect. Recording devices, weapons, third parties, Scranton Reality Devices, and antithaumatic devices are not permitted, unless specified otherwise. Gifts to the entity must first meet with Director or Senior Staff approval. SCP-7632-A is generally benign and will avoid hostility unless extensively provoked. Interaction with SCP-7632-A is entirely dependent on the entity itself; any attempts to locate it outside of these times is prohibited.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-7632 is a pataphysical sentient archetype of the human consciousness, primarily representing negative feminine thaumaturgical energy. During its manifestations, it has been known to appear as a human female of varying ages, ethnicities, and forms (SCP-7632-A), with a variety of names and titles associated with it (See attachment 7632-1, "Nomenclative Associations"). SCP-7632-A is capable of high degrees of thaumaturgical behavior, including ontokinetics, polymorphosis, spatially displacing objects and entities, issuing cognitohazards, and amnesticising others; its long exposure to the noosphere has also given it considerable knowledge and intelligence. It is fluent in all known mundane languages and several anomalous ones, including Fey, Sarkic, Ortothan, and various Daevite languages, and is capable of telepathic communication.</p>
<p>It first materialized in Greece and Colchis (present-day Georgia) circa 1300 BCE, and had spread its influence to Celtic regions by 275 BCE. Reports of its manifestations were also referenced in India during the 6th century CE, and China during the late Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) and early Northern Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), suggesting that it affected merchants traveling the Silk Road. It found a foothold in colonial America during the late 17th century, though research hypothesizes it may have arrived centuries, if not millennia sooner. By the mid-19th century, its influence could be documented worldwide; as such, a small amount of levity regarding the Veil of Secrecy is permitted.</p>
<p>[Edit]: Although the Elan-Vital Energy readings of SCP-7632-A have not been fully studied or measured, they are estimated to exceed a Casper Intensity of ten-thousand.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-A</strong>: Senior Researcher Offet (Site-278) is to be inquired for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-B</strong> (revision): The first individual SCP-7632 requested was O5-█, who was escorted to an undisclosed location by MTF Alpha-1 (Red Right Hand). Alpha-1 formed a 100-meter perimeter around the area and remained on guard until contact with O5-█ was reestablished. O5-█ was returned safely and debriefed by O5-4.</p>

<p>Overseer-Five wasn't surprised when the Lady contacted her shortly after O5-4's conversation with Offet, nor was she intrigued by the location chosen. It made perfect sense for them to meet in the Wanderer's Library: after all, witches are entirely dependent on stories, and this witch was one of the oldest and most widely-circulated. She was, however, curious how the Lady managed to convince the Librarians to allow a "Jailer" to visit. At least, in a wry twist of fate, there was tea at the table.</p>
<p>"Hello, Morgana," Five said, nodding respectfully. The Lady leveled a gaze as deep and enigmatic as the sea at her.</p>
<p>"Hello, Glaistig. I had wanted to speak with Tilda as well, but I didn't think she would come. Poor choice of location and all. No matter, you're just as good. I feel like you'd understand me from…a more appreciable perspective."</p>
<p>"I'd prefer it if you didn't use that name," Five said, grimacing. Macha smirked.</p>
<p>"Oh? Well, that is a touchy subject in our circles, isn't it? But as you wish; I'll just call you Five. Please, be seated, and help yourself. It's roast dandelion tea." Five thanked her and sat. The tea was hot, earthy, and subtle.</p>
<p>"I didn't think I'd be welcomed here," Five remarked. Baba Yaga showed rows of rotten, crooked teeth.</p>
<p>"Why? Do you have overdue books?" Five's eyes flickered.</p>
<p>"Let's just say that the Foundation's relationship with the Library is…<em>strained.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh," the Queen remarked idly, as if the politics of extradimensional spaces meant nothing to her. "Don't worry, I've got some clout here—or did you forget who you were talking to?"</p>
<p>"Point taken," Five admitted, raising her cup. As if to prove this, she spotted a Docent hovering by, without so much as glancing their way.</p>
<p>"Besides," Rangda added quietly, "I live here. It's the only home I've ever known."</p>
<p>"Not Colchis?"</p>
<p>"You know what I mean," Jadis muttered. "Here—stories. That's where I exist. The Evil Queen. The Wicked Witch. The deceptive wife. The child-eater. I'm a caricature."</p>
<p>"A fate few would envy," Five muttered behind her cup. Knowing better than to let the Lady stew in her bitterness, Five cut to the quick. "So, to what do I owe the pleasure?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps some advice is in order," Nimue murmured. She glanced at Five, noticing her intrigued expression. "Don't give me that look. I'm not too proud to hear from another perspective." Five smiled faintly and silently assented. The Queen simmered for a moment before asking, "Do you think it's possible for me to have a happy ending?"</p>
<p>"In my line of work, very few things are impossible," Five remarked. She finished her tea, then gestured around. "Look around you. This library contains every story ever written, and many that are not written." She poured herself one more cup before adding, with a smile, "Surely a few would work in your favor."</p>
<p>"Ah yes, children's stories where the heroine is a brave little girl in a world full of magic, or one of those ridiculous 'magical academy' fantasies bloated with maudlin whimsy. Eiko Watanabe<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> almost ruined my reputation as much as Jakob and Wilhelm!"</p>
<p>Five nodded sympathetically. "Couldn't you just make one yourself?"</p>
<p>"I've tried that before," Elphaba murmured, sinking her head into her hands. "I've tried it more times than I can count. Over and over. It never lasts. In my endings are terrible new beginnings, and yet…" In her despondency she forced out a self-effacing laugh. "Van der Miir once thought he had a monopoly on madness, but how insane must I be to keep hoping, past desperation, to the point where it's masochism?"</p>
<p>"Ah, so that's why you wanted to speak with my associate," Five deduced. "The two of you have quite a number of traits in common."</p>
<p>"Am I to take that as a compliment?" Grimhilde said.</p>
<p>"You may if you like." Jezebel shrugged. She emptied her cup, took Five's empty one, and smashed them together in her hands. An origami pigeon fluttered out of her opening palms, making its way to one of the shelves, where it transformed into a book.</p>
<p>"Very elegant," Five complimented, and a humble smile crossed the Lady's face. "So how do you propose to achieve your goal? Surely not by drawing our people into your quarters, one by one, in the hopes that they'd provide an answer."</p>
<p>La Befana looked away and said nothing.</p>
<p>"And what would you do if and when your goal is reached?" Five prodded. "Disappear? You're forever tied to the human subconscious, whether you like it or not. No ending, however happy, can erase that. A part of you will always be a witch; your story will continue as long as there are storytellers. Perhaps you should take your own advice, and move on from anger to acceptance."</p>
<p>There was silence between the two for a long time. A subtle shift overtook the Queen's composure. She looked up, directly into Five's eyes.</p>
<p>"I knew I was right to seek you out," she said quietly, her eyes flashing with disquieting inspiration. Morgan le Faye pushed her chair back and stood; Five stood with her. "You're right, you know," she continued: "there's no permanent solution to my dilemma. But just as I illuminated you and…your associate," she added with a curling mouth, "so too have you brought new perspectives to my doorstep. I thank you."</p>
<p>"Should I be alarmed?" Five said, nervously chuckling. The creature before her smiled gleefully, turning into a fox-demon. There was a wild sense of peace, though, in Consort Daji's eyes: mischief, not malice.</p>
<p>"I've been going about this all wrong. Aristotle had the right idea the whole time: a means between the extremes. Why shun my fate when I can embrace it, even enjoy it? And who knows — perhaps there are yet some tales in this treasury that sing of my praises, and call me hero, and lift me upon grateful shoulders, even as my heart breaks and my world burns. People do so love to see their characters survive the fire. I can keep my pride in spite of it all. But first, my dear friend, some indulgence is in order. I've just recalled an artifact of mine that may assuage me in times of despair."</p>
<p>"And what might that be?" Five asked. The Lady grinned; one could almost imagine her cackling underneath a full moon.</p>
<p>"Let's not spoil the ending just yet. You are dismissed, Chelsea, and I? I am Zoroaster, emerging from his cave to greet the morn renewed! Give my best to Tilda — and to Phillipe, if you see him again. Ah," she sighed to herself, "when shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done, when the battle's lost and won: that will be ere the set of sun."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Overseer-Five jolted awake, finding herself outside the Wanderer's Library, in the clearing where the witch had instructed her to wait. She took a moment to compose herself before contacting Alpha-1.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-C</strong> (revision): Recently a manifestation of SCP-7632 was sighted in the Wanderer's Library, though this could not be verified.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-D</strong> (revision): On ████ April 2023, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-826">SCP-826</a> was reported missing. Twelve hours later, SCP-826 was found on top of its safe, with a note attached, written in Colchidian and ancient Greek. Translated, it reads, "Thank you for holding onto it. Briefly took it back for personal use. No need for alarm if you see it missing again. Ask █████ and ███████ for further details." It was signed in liquid gold, with the astrological sign of Aries.</p>
