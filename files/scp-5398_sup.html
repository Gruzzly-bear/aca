<p>SCP-5398 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber outside of testing.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5398 was a 16 year old male humanoid of Sri Lankan descent, formerly known as Mihindu Fonseca. SCP-5398 was capable of regenerating lost cells at an accelerated rate. While the rate of regeneration differed depending on the type of cell, it was found to regenerate at least 10 times the rate of baseline humans.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On March 13<sup>th</sup>, 2018, SCP-5398 was in a motor vehicle accident in Galle, Sri Lanka, which resulted in 4 casualties and 2 injured, including SCP-5398. Upon arrival at Asiri Hospital Galle, first responders and medical personnel began to report signs of accelerated regeneration. Foundation agents embedded within the hospital quickly used cover story Chi-42<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> to extract SCP-5398 from the facility. Amnestics were used as needed. Foundation agents were able to confirm that SCP-5398 did possess enhanced regenerative capabilities during transport.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-5398-1:</strong> 26 hours following test #28 (see <strong>Testing</strong>), SCP-5398 began to report increasingly great pain from its left inner elbow. Upon examination via the camera placed on its armband, it was seen that while the discoloration caused by the <em>necrotizing fasciitis</em> infection was visible, cell death was found to be heavily slowed. This resulted in SCP-5398's regenerative properties being capable of regenerating cells at a rate faster than the cell deaths. It was also seen that the infection was beginning to spread to further areas of SCP-5398's arm. The fail-safe for the procedure was immediately enacted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> While the procedure was completed without any complications, upon regeneration, the limb was unchanged in regards to the infection. A state of emergency was called with regards to SCP-5398, and testing was expedited for the purpose of removing the <em>necrotizing fasciitis</em> bacteria within SCP-5398. SCP-5398 was also to remain in its provisional containment during this time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DECOMMISSIONING DEPARTMENT TERMINATION REQUEST</span></p>
<p>ITEM TO BE TERMINATED: SCP-5398</p>
<p>REASON FOR TERMINATION: As of yet, there is currently no way to remove the <em>necrotizing fasciitis</em> infection from SCP-5398, and is theorized to be impossible (see <strong>Addendum-5398-1</strong>). As inhalant anesthetic is not as potent as intravenous, SCP-5398 is constantly suffering. There is the additional issue of SCP-5398 being unable to be properly tested, as we would no metric to gauge the rate of regeneration coupled with the rate of cell death.</p>
<p>RECOMMENDED TERMINATION METHOD: Ingested botulinum toxin. This allows the termination to be unaffected by SCP-5398's anomalous properties.</p>

<p>I am Eleonora Grosse, the, at the time of SCP-5398's termination, Chairwoman of the Ethics Committee. Following the reading of the prior sections of this document, you are most likely appalled by the actions of the Foundation, and rightfully so. That is the reason why I, personally, am editing this document, to apologize for what we have done. Apologize for the medications it was refused, for the allowance of test #28, and especially for the termination of an otherwise benign anomaly. I have not only come to apologize, but also show you what precautions have been taken to ensure this is not repeated. There will always be lapses in ethical judgement. What we must do is remember them, and prevent them.</p>

<p>From this moment forward, all baseline testing of self-repairing humanoid SCP subjects is to follow similar procedure as to those listed below.</p>
<p>Note: All of the following tests are to be done by automated systems to ensure swift execution of the procedure. This is done to ensure the regenerative capabilities of the SCP subject do not interfere with the procedure.</p>

If possible, 10ml of blood are to be taken for testing. The subject is then to be questioned whether this caused them any pain or discomfort. If yes, all further testing is to be done under anesthesia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Epidermal Regeneration</td>
<td>A 5cm square is to be removed from the epidermis. Time from removal to full regeneration is to be recorded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Burn Regeneration</td>
<td>An end of a small copper rod is to be heated to 70<sup>o</sup>C, and subsequently held to the epidermis of the subject until a first degree burn manifests. Time from burn appearance to full regeneration is to be recorded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bone Realignment</td>
<td>A bone is to be dislocated. Time from dislocation to relocation is to be recorded. Should the time surpass 5 minutes, the bone is to be manually relocated and treated as a non-anomalous dislocation.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The SCP subject is to be informed of these tests prior to the enactment of the procedure. Should the subject make requests regarding the location of the tests, they are to be followed unless deemed unsafe. The SCP subject is to be allowed access to pain suppressing medication following tests as needed.</p>
<p>Additional testing requires Ethics Committee approval. Tests may also be requested to be added to the prior list, however, this will also require Ethics Committee approval.</p>
<p>For an illustration of properly adhering to this mandate, see <a href="scp-4820.html">SCP-4820</a>.</p>
<p>FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: REASSIGNMENT, DEMOTION, AND/OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.</p>
