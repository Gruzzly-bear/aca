<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9444 is kept in High Security Containment Chamber 7A at Site-47 in a constant, specialised medically induced coma, known as Procedure Lumet.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> IV, catheter, and colostomy bags are to be refilled/replaced daily, and enhanced liquid rapamycin injections are to be administered weekly. SCP-9444 must be remotely monitored at all times in case of sudden re-gaining of consciousness.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> In this scenario, the immediate vicinity will be evacuated and anaesthetic gas will flush SCP-9444's containment chamber until loss of consciousness is confirmed.</p>
<p>Accumulated currency produced by Procedure Lumet is to be retrieved daily from Site-47, and allocated use by the Accounting and Budget Departments.</p>

<p><strong>00:17:02</strong> <em>You, son of God, have been born with incredible powers beyond your comprehension—but you have squandered your blessing, and subverted the natural order. For this, you have become one with it. A heavenly cog in our machine.</em></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9444 is Amir Hariri, a 23-year-old human male with the ability to manifest any physical denomination of the United States dollar, including coins, banknotes, and collector coins, via mental concentration and focus—the size, amount, and distance of manifested items correlating with the amount of concentration needed. Manifested currency is otherwise non-anomalous and indistinguishable from its mundane counterparts, and can not be de-manifested.</p>
<p>SCP-9444 is hostile, dangerous, and will terminate Foundation personnel if given the chance. It is estimated that it takes at least 0.4 seconds for it to terminate targets via manifestation of currency within their vital organs, nervous system, and/or brain. It is capable of manifesting currency to locations up to 70 kilometres away from its current position, and only requires an approximate location and knowledge of a target's appearance to successfully complete a precise manifestation within their body.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Log:</strong> SCP-9444 is responsible for at least six incidents in which it used manifested currency to terminate political and corporate figures. These assassinations, known as Incidents 9444/1-6, have caused threats to normalcy, the economy, the Foundation, and the United States Government, needing correction via government and Foundation resources.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Foundation was first alerted to SCP-9444 on 2024/12/25, after staff at Washington Memorial Hospital reported finding a half dollar coin embedded within a deceased patient's brainstem.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Over the proceeding months, similar incidents continued to occur, focussed on individuals involved in the petroleum and natural gas industry, and Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>In late February 2025, Foundation agents, aided by clairvoyant and energy-sensitive personnel, determined the approximate location of the responsible party was Baltimore, Maryland. MTF Kappa-79 ("Radars of the Lost Ark")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> were dispatched to determine their exact location, succeeding after Incident 9444/6. SCP-9444 was identified as Amir Hariri, a 23-year-old male of Lebanese-American heritage. Hariri was studying political science at the University of Baltimore, and was found to be a member of multiple subversive groups in the area, including SG-5598<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and SG-5823.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that SCP-9444 had realised its anomalous ability at the age of seven, wherein it mainly used it for minor financial gain until the age of nineteen. After enrolling at University of Baltimore, the anomaly gained radical beliefs fuelled by its classmates and various subversive groups on-campus. SCP-9444 then began manifesting currency to aid these groups and their activities, before transitioning to committing acts of violence. It is currently believed that fellow members of these groups were unaware of SCP-9444's anomalous abilities and actions.</p>
<p>After SCP-9444's residence was identified, the SCP Foundation and Unusual Incidents Unit<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> launched a joint tactical effort to detain the anomaly. On 2025/2/15, SCP-9444 was anaesthetised while it slept, detained, and transferred to Site-47. It has not been allowed to regain consciousness since. Containment procedures were then established, and Procedure Lumet was developed to exploit SCP-9444's anomalous abilities.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>02:07:45</strong> <em>You are God's lamb offered to us, as we are his chosen people. We are the blessed peacekeepers. The ones who hold the ruler. The ones who draw the lines. The ones who enforce his holy law—the one true law.</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of the original document written by Senior Researcher Dr. Warren Lumet detailing Procedure Lumet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comatose is to be induced via a mix of pentobarbital and propofol administered intravenously. Standard mechanical ventilation, IV feeding, and fluid pushing procedures are to be installed.</p>
<p>Two coiled leads attached to electrodes are to be guided into the brain via a 14 mm hole drilled through the subject's skull. These wires are to be connected to and powered by a battery pack placed in the subject's chest wall. The electrodes are to be attached to either side of the temporal lobe—one will administer a constant electrical charge of 0.47 volts, and the other will administer an electrical charge of 0.15 volts every 0.5 seconds. This will allow SCP-9444 to constantly manifest currency in the desired denomination and amount, even while unconscious.</p>
<p>The following should also be installed/administered to guarantee constant revenue generation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thick blindfold to prevent light entering through eyelids;</li>
<li>Headphones constantly playing white noise and/or looped, pre-recorded audio at a loud volume to prevent mental clarity and demoralise the subject;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></li>
<li>Weekly injections of enhanced liquid rapamycin to reduce cell-aging and aid longevity;</li>
<li>Pedestal placed directly behind subject's head for holding manifested items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculations estimate that this procedure will generate roughly $100 per minute, or $144,000 per day. Revenue generated annually will be roughly $52,600,000.</p>
