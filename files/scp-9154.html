<h1 id="toc1"><span><strong>ExxArc Dossier</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>Founded:</strong> 2059</p>
<p><strong>Base of Operations:</strong> Christchurch, New Zealand</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> ExxArc was initially founded under the name Exxon-Aramco as a merger of the two largest oil corporations at the time, but later rebranded itself as ExxArc after merging with additional corporations within the fossil fuel industry, the entirety of which it has since grown to incorporate. At its height in 2065, ExxArc had a net worth equivalent to 11% of the world's GDP, but has since been in decline due to dwindling oil supplies.</p>
<p>In the past decade, ExxArc has begun to expand into the anomalous world as a means to prolong its lifespan. Sub-veil activities have included using anomalies to replenish oil wells, mask carbon emissions, and the incorporation of anomalous microbes in some industrial processes.</p>
<p>Due to their efforts to keep their anomalous activities hidden from the public, and ExxArc being the sole supplier of multiple critical resources, the Foundation has maintained neutral relations with ExxArc, but has on occasion taken actions against ExxArc assets when the veil has been threatened.</p>
<p>ExxArc's current CEO, DeForest Morgan, has been in control of the group since 2063, and has an estimated net worth in the trillions of euros.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="toc2"><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h1>
<p>SCP-9154 is an anomalous species of coral phenotypically identical to the staghorn coral (<em>Acropora cervicornis</em>). SCP-9154 differs from non-anomalous staghorn corals in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9154 instances are able to expand each day by an amount equivalent to fifty years of growth in non-anomalous staghorn corals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The planulae<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> of SCP-9154 are capable of locomotion at velocities of up to 9 m/s<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. They display a strong preference for attaching to stationary metallic, ceramic, and plastic surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Artificial surfaces that SCP-9154 instances grow on are slowly transformed into aragonite<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9154 is highly resilient to high temperatures and low pH levels, being able to survive temperatures of up to ~80°C and pH levels down to ~2. This resilience is also found in its zooxanthellae.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Areas in which SCP-9154 is present see a rapid rise in biodiversity, with other marine species constantly manifesting, denoted as SCP-9154-1 instances. These include previously extinct species native to the Western Atlantic Ocean, such as:
<ul>
<li>Whale sharks (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>)</li>
<li>Longsnout butterflyfish (<em>Prognathodes aculeatus</em>)</li>
<li>Goliath groupers (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Apart from regularly taking the form of extinct species, SCP-9154-1 instances are entirely non-anomalous.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="toc3"><span><strong>Discovery:</strong></span></h1>
<p>The Foundation first became aware of SCP-9154 on 2086-05-13, after receiving communications from ExxArc stating that an oil platform off the coast of Nicaragua had been rendered non-operational by the sudden appearance of a coral reef and promptly collapsed into the sea.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> ExxArc granted the Foundation temporary access to the rig on the condition that it would attempt to devise a way to protect further ExxArc assets from damage, asserting that they would take decisive action if SCP-9154 could not be warded off effectively. For additional information, see Addendum 9154.1.</p>

<h2 id="toc4"><span><strong>Addendum 9154.1 — Initial site investigation:</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2086-05-13</p>
<p><strong>Personnel present:</strong> Dr. Vasileiou, Junior Researcher Reyes, Steve Bennett<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Vasileiou was the Foundation's foremost marine biologist prior to 2065, by which point marine biologists had become mostly obsolete.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Extraneous footage omitted for brevity.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou, Reyes, and Bennett dive from the SCPS Cousteau, being immediately met by a massive school of yellow jacks (<em>Carangoides bartholomaei.</em>) that begin to flee as soon as they enter the water.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Woah.</p>
<p>&lt;As the yellow jacks swim further away, they reveal a large rocky structure resembling a crane overgrown with several species of corals and sponges approximately 5 metres below the group. The crane is circled by numerous species of triggerfish, wrasse, and angelfish. A goldentail moray eel (<em>Gymnothorax miliaris</em>) peeks out from a hole in the structure, and a loggerhead sea turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) fades into existence in front of Vasileiou.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou (quietly):</strong> You're… back.</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> There's just so much here I haven't seen in… decades. Corals, sponges, queen angelfish, cherubfish, sargassum triggerfish, and not a damn moon jelly in sight.</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> It's kinda like diving into an aquarium.</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> That's… one way to put it.</p>
<p><strong>Bennett:</strong> You two can marvel at this stuff later, you have work to do.</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou mumbles something.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Fine, let's descend. Reyes, get the containers ready.</p>
<p>&lt;As the group descends, Reyes reaches into his bag, taking out a net holding several empty sample containers. He opens the net and takes out a container before closing the net again.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Staghorn seems to be the most abundant coral here. It was—is a reef-builder, so it makes perfect sense for it to be the primary anomaly here.</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou gets a pair of pliers from her belt. She hesitates for a moment before snipping off a piece of staghorn coral, which she places into the container Reyes is holding.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The group takes additional samples of various species of coral, sponge, tunicate, tube worm, and bryozoan over the course of half an hour without incident, while slowly descending along the structure. As the group descends, the shape of an oil platform on the bottom becomes increasingly clear. A large mass is visible in the center of what appears to be the heli-pad.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Looks like a giant barrel sponge, but it looks way too big for how long it's been here, even more so than the rest of the animals here. Let's get a closer look and take some samples.</p>
<p>&lt;As the group descends further, an adult whale shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) measuring approximately 16 metres with 7 remoras attached fades into existence 9 metres from the crane. The shark immediately begins to circle it.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Reyes and Bennett continue to descend towards the sponge. A Nassau grouper ( <em>Epinephelus striatus</em>) is floating half a metre above it.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> If I'm not mistaken, this thing should be a good two thousand years old based on the size. What do you think, Vasileiou?</p>
<p>&lt;Reyes looks around.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Vasileiou?</p>
<p>&lt;There is no response from Vasileiou, Bennett and Reyes look around and see her slowly treading water approximately 10 meters above them. Reyes begins swimming upwards toward her, but is immediately grabbed by Bennett.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Bennett:</strong> Stop, you need to decompress, Trimix only goes so far.</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Right, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Bennett:</strong> Doctor, are you alright?</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou appears unresponsive. She is slowly sinking. Her breathing is getting louder.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Vasileiou, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Twenty years…</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> It's been twenty god damn years. Twenty god damn years since all of this was lost.</p>
<p><strong>Bennett:</strong> You need to calm down, Doctor, easy breathing. I get why you're upset, I really do, but we're seventy meters down, this isn't one of those leisure dives from back in your day.</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou's breathing slowly calms down.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> You're— you're right.</p>
<p>&lt;Vasileiou begins to descend again.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The group continues to swim towards the sponge.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> You're right Reyes, this specimen has got to be at least two thousand years old, yet it obviously wasn't here a few days ago. Remarkable.</p>
<p>&lt;Reyes takes out a container, Vasileiou takes a scraping from the sponge and places it in the container.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Bennett:</strong> That's very fascinating, but I think we should take a look at the legs of the rig, we need to know how the hell these things toppled it.</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Yeah, I'm curious about that as well. If anything, corals build structures, they don't tear them down like this.</p>
<p>&lt;The group resumes swimming in the direction of the closest edge, passing by a wide variety of sponges and corals, many of which not known to grow at the current depth. Small fish dart in and out of holes in the rig as well as porous sponges as the group passes them. As they pass the edge of the oil rig, its snapped legs come into view, all overgrown, moreso around the points where they have snapped. Vasileiou approaches one of the snapping points and looks closer.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> This is aragonite, all the way through, there's no doubt about it. The anomaly must be turning the surfaces it grows on into the very same mineral that stony corals build their skeletons from.</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> That would explain the collapse, an inelastic material like that would be more prone to breaking like this.</p>
<p>&lt;Extraneous footage omitted for brevity.&gt;</p>

<p><em>Two decades have passed since the last coral reefs disappeared, and most of the remaining marine life with it. Habitats vanished, food webs collapsed, with dire consequences for life on land. I believe that containing this anomaly, which has been designated SCP-9154, would be a grave mistake, as its existence presents an unprecedented opportunity for ecological restoration. I propose classifying SCP-9154 as an 'Archon', as it has demonstrated the ability to restore not just the ocean of the past, but also a past normalcy where we don't have to use ectoentropic anomalies to keep the masses fed.</em><br/>

<p>Over the following 2 months, Foundation researchers carried out a series of experiments on SCP-9154 in attempts to discover methods for repelling it from specific structures. Two such methods were discovered: covering artificial surfaces with natural materials such as sediment and rocks such that there is no space for the growth of SCP-9154 instances, or maintaining a water temperature above 80°C. However, the former proved insufficient when applied to active oil platforms in the field, and the latter was deemed infeasible due to the required energy upkeep.</p>
<p>Communications from ExxArc ceased on 2086-07-14, by which point all off-shore oil and gas rigs in the Caribbean Sea had been rendered non-functional or destroyed by SCP-9154.</p>

<h2 id="toc6"><span><strong>Incident Report 9154-860723</strong></span></h2>
<p>At 02:30 2086-07-23, the Foundation research vessel SCPS Cousteau reported unusual movements off the coast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti being detected by on-board sonar. Over the next 30 minutes, this was corroborated by other Foundation vessels deployed in the region, revealing a total of 450 objects appearing to be in the process of spreading out evenly across the surface of the Caribbean Sea at high velocities.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[03:15]:</strong> Foundation military vessels in the region, including aerial and aquatic combat drones as well as MTF Theta-5 "The Bigger Boat", are mobilised. All civilian and research vessels are ordered to evacuate to the closest port. Civilian vessels are given a cover story of potential signs of an impending seaquake.</p>
<p><strong>[03:32]:</strong> Nearest Foundation vessels come within range to attempt to establish communications, demanding identification from the unidentified objects, which are now identified as vessels of some kind. There is no response.</p>
<p><strong>[03:35]:</strong> Foundation vessels demand identification once again under threat of seizing the unidentified vessels. No response.</p>
<p><strong>[03:40]:</strong> Thermal sensors aboard Foundation vessels detect a sudden rise in water temperatures. Relative humidity rising.</p>
<p><strong>[03:46]:</strong> Thermal imaging satellites observe growing hotspots emanating from the location of the unidentified vessels.</p>
<p><strong>[03:58]:</strong> Cameras aboard Foundation vessels observe visible evaporation from the water surface.</p>
<p><strong>[04:14]</strong> Foundation vessels enter visual range. No crew is observed aboard any of the unidentified vessels, which lack any visible decks.</p>
<p><strong>[04:17]:</strong> Steam significantly reduces visibility, one Foundation-operated helicopter crashes into the sea. Crew is presumed dead.</p>
<p><strong>[04:18]:</strong> Bubbles start forming near the surface at a rapidly increasing rate.</p>
<p><strong>[04:19]:</strong> Foundation crews are forced to retreat below deck to avoid the extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>[04:21]:</strong> O5 Command orders all Foundation vessels to open fire against the unidentified vessels immediately.</p>
<p><strong>[04:24]:</strong> Water temperature reaches 100°C.</p>
<p><strong>[04:43]:</strong> The unidentified vessels sink.</p>
<p><strong>[04:48]:</strong> Water temperature starts to decrease.</p>
<p><strong>[14:23]:</strong> Water temperature returns to baseline.</p>
<p><strong>[15:00]:</strong> A cover story claiming that a natural mass-bleaching event caused by a sudden heat wave killed off the SCP-9154 instances in the Caribbean Sea is fed to the media.</p>
<p><strong>[16:20]:</strong> Sonar fails to detect any sign of life below the surface.</p>
<p><strong>[16:45]:</strong> Plankton sampling finds no living plankton of any clade.</p>
<p><strong>[17:00]:</strong> The Caribbean Sea is classified as an ecological deadzone.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The incident resulted in a death toll of over 300 civilians and 12 Foundation personnel. ExxArc privately took responsibility for the incident, blaming the Foundation's lack of success in finding an economically feasible method of deterring SCP-9154, and that no further action will be necessary provided that SCP-9154 is not reintroduced to the wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<h2 id="toc7"><span><strong>Statement from the O5 Council</strong></span></h2>
<p>It is the opinion of the O5 Council that the recent actions by ExxArc constitute an act of mass-ecocide, in addition to showing a blatant disregard for the veil. In light of this and the potential for ecological restoration that SCP-9154 represents, it has been decided that the Foundation must take decisive action to ensure the restoration of Earth's marine ecosystems and past normalcy.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The O5 Council has voted to enact the following resolutions:</p>
<strong>§ 1</strong> The Caribbean Sea Agreement is rendered null, and all cooperation with ExxArc will cease effective immediately.<br/>

<h2 id="toc8"><span><strong>Addendum 9154.3 — Artificial reef project:</strong></span></h2>
<p>To best ensure the survival of SCP-9154 as it begins to populate the Pacific Ocean, a number of locations have been chosen based on their distance from ExxArc assets, a recent history of having or being in proximity to coral reefs, and having few to no civilian inhabitants. Using Site-85 on Midway Atoll as a base of operations, artificial reef projects will be carried out in the following locations:</p>
<p><strong>Hawaiian Islands:</strong></p>

<li>Ka'ula</li>
<li>Lehua</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Fiji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conway Reef</li>
<li>Monuriki</li>
<li>Ogea Driki</li>
</ul>
<p>Experiments carried out on SCP-9154 have previously shown that concrete mixed with at least 20% plastic waste acts as a suitable substrate. The reefs will thus be constructed using reef balls made from this material. So far, SCP-9154 has only been known to generate SCP-9154-1 instances matching Caribbean and cosmopolitan species. Whether this is a constant regardless of the location of an SCP-9154 instance has remained untested until now.</p>

<p><strong>On Sunday morning, the main reactor of the recently upgraded tokamak reactor outside Lyon, France exploded, leading to a death toll of over 120 000 people. While the cause is still unknown, protests against planned and existing fusion reactors have erupted all over the world.</strong></p>
<p><iframe allowtransparency="true" class="html-block-iframe" frameborder="0" src="/scp-9154/html/20e6f90623847291157c64003dd28b050fbd6683-55784238698364301"></iframe></p>
<p>In the hours following the event, protests erupted globally outside of planned and existing tokamak reactors in 53 countries, with protestors calling for an immediate halt to the construction and operation of these reactors.</p>
<p>Two hours after the tragedy, ExxArc CEO DeForest Morgan held a press conference from his New Zealand villa, condemning the recent tokamak breakthrough as dangerous and announcing that he would personally donate 500 000 000€ towards the reconstruction of the city's Northern parts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Following the Lyon explosion, all 34 EU member states, in addition to 73 other countries, demanded the unplugging of anomalous power sources from the European power grid, threatening the expulsion of the Foundation from their territories. Despite complying with these demands, France and Italy proceeded to demand that Foundation assets be removed from their territories immediately, resulting in the reef projects in French Polynesia being abandoned. Foundation spendings on renewable energy will be increased by 50%.</p>

<h1 id="toc9"><span><strong>Addendum 9154.4 — Reef Project Completion</strong></span></h1>
<p>After the placement of the final reef ball on 2087-01-17, mature SCP-9154 instances and planulae were introduced to each of the artificial reefs. SCP-9154 fully colonised each site within a span of 3 days. The anomaly exceeded expectations by also growing on multiple natural surfaces in addition to the concrete-plastic surfaces provided, including in locations where artificial reef projects were not carried out, as well as manifesting SCP-9154-1 instances corresponding to Pacific species, rather than the Caribbean species that had previously manifested.</p>
<p>On 2087-02-13, surveillance satellites observed the sudden collapse of 43 oil platforms in the Western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean over the course of a day. While ExxArc refused to share any information, it is assumed that the incident was caused by SCP-9154 partially turning the support structures to aragonite.</p>
<p>To preserve the veil, the disinformation campaign regarding SCP-9154 has been intensified. A cover story explaining the collapse of the oil platforms as being the result of a series of eco-terrorist bombings has been fed to the media.</p>

<h1 id="toc10"><span><strong>Addendum 9154.5 — White Band Disease Outbreak</strong></span></h1>
<p>On 2087-06-21, Theta-17 reported what appeared to be a rapid bleaching event while patrolling a newly formed SCP-9154 reef off the coast of Java, Indonesia. The reef was additionally observed to be mostly devoid of nekton<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>, and the few animals observed were reported to be lethargic and dissolving. Coral samples sent to Dr. Vasileiou at Site-85 were promptly identified as being afflicted by white band disease, which had played a major role in the final waves of reef extinctions during the 2060s alongside bleaching.</p>
<p>Massive Parallel Sequencing<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> identified a previously unknown species of <em>Vibrio</em>, tentatively named <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> due to the past association with white band disease of the <em>Vibrio</em> genus. Subsequent qPCR<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> revealed that this species was present in high abundance within the coral samples.</p>
<p>During a dive in the following days, Dr. Vasileiou and Junior Researcher Reyes discovered a torpedo lodged in the sediment next to a large formation from a pre-2060s reef. The torpedo had been modified to possess four lateral valves, which were slowly discharging an effluent slightly more opaque than seawater. qPCR testing revealed a high concentration of <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> in the effluent.</p>
<p>Testing carried out on <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> revealed multiple anomalous properties, which were noted to be similar to those of SCP-9154, namely ectoentropic replication, extremely rapid aquatic locomotion, and higher environmental resilience than what its biochemistry should allow. <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> has additionally been found to be capable of forming endospores<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On 2087-07-09, <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> was confirmed to be present within tanks holding SCP-9154 at Site-85, resulting in the death of 90% of SCP-9154 samples, but was stalled by maintaining these tanks at a temperature of 70°C. The suspected presence of an ExxArc agent within Site-85 is currently being investigated.</p>
<p>Since the start of the outbreak, SCP-9154 has appeared at several previously unaffected marine Foundation facilities, but has not converted surfaces to aragonite at these sites. The reason for this is currently unknown. Additionally, cetacean SCP-9154-1 instances around these locations have displayed unusual behavior, such as humpback whales singing at hitherto unrecorded frequencies and dolphins jumping aboard Foundation vessels.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong><br/>
"There is no doubt in my mind that we are dealing with a genetically engineered strain of <em>Vibrio</em>, none of the past coral-infecting strains should be naturally present in the wild anymore, not to mention the similarities to SCP-9154 and its ability to form endospores. While a high temperature has proven effective at protecting SCP-9154 instances in captivity, it's just not feasible to maintain the entire ocean at 70°C. I have reviewed our options with the Microbiology Department, and our suggestion is to start producing bacteriophages to combat <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> as soon as possible. In the meantime, antibiotics such as ampicillin may prove effective at stalling the progression of the outbreak."<br/>

<p>With the approval of the O5 Council, the construction of a facility for bacteriophage production has begun at Site-██<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup>. Based on the current state of viral replication technology and the rate at which <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> is spreading between SCP-9154 reefs, the facility is estimated to be operational within 3 months, by which point 5% of such reefs are expected to remain.

<p>On 2087-11-02, Junior Researcher Reyes discovered a cluster of SCP-9154 instances growing on an old oil barrel near Site-85. While desiccated, I believe these may be the key to restoring life to the ocean, and therefore propose the following:</p>
<p>1. Resume the construction of the bacteriophage replication facility at Site-██ and approve the cultivation and further testing of SCP-9154 instances on dry land until the replication facility is fully operational. This may allow us the time we need to ensure the future survival of SCP-9154 in the wild.</p>

Since the outbreak of <em>Vibrio corallocidium</em> began, SCP-9154 has curiously refrained from converting the surfaces of Foundation-operated structures to aragonite.

<div style="margin-bottom: 1px; font-size: 1rem;">
<p><strong>A hot topic for the past two years has been the reintroductions and disappearances of coral reefs, and the havoc this has wreaked on the economy. More recently, an eco-terrorist collective known as 'Manufactured Extinct' has carried out a worldwide campaign of bombings against ExxArc facilities. We interviewed ExxArc CEO DeForest Morgan to get his thoughts on the situation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nielsen:</strong> The recent bombings by the eco-terrorist collective known as 'Manufactured Extinct' have forced hundreds of ExxArc facilities to close and cost thousands of jobs. Are you able to divulge how these terrorists have been able to carry out these attacks?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Yes, we have come to find that these bombings have been carried out using cloaked hypersonic drones. Now you might say, "Hey, how are terrorists able to access state-of-the-art military technology like that?" Well I'll tell you, they are being funded by the fusion lobby. They try to paint us as environmentally destructive, despite it being proven time and time again that ExxArc has had net zero carbon emissions for the past ten years, not to mention the amount of death and destruction caused by fusion. Their vile propaganda is what has inspired these terrorists, and their funding is how the terrorists are able to do what they do.</p>
<p><strong>Nielsen:</strong> It really is worrying to see. What are ExxArc's plans for dealing with this situation?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I'm afraid I can't share that with you for the time being, but rest assured that ExxArc is not going down any time soon, and all the jobs that these terrorists have taken, well, they'll be back before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Nielsen:</strong> Are you planning any action against the fusion lobby for their role in all this?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan:</strong> Our legal department is currently reviewing our options. That's all I'll reveal for now.</p>
<p><strong>Nielsen:</strong> What do you make of the failure of the coral de-extinction project?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan:</strong> I think it's time we accept the fact that their time has passed.</p>

<p>Since efforts to improve the resilience of SCP-9154 began, it has displayed multiple new anomalous properties, namely the ability to survive indefinitely in dry environments, aerial locomotion at velocities of up to 20 m/s<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup>, and the continuous manifestation of seawater<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> when growing within confined, unflooded areas. It is currently theorized that Foundation efforts to allow SCP-9154 to survive on land inadvertently led to SCP-9154 developing these abilities. No SCP-9154-1 instances have been observed to manifest in dry environments.</p>
<p>SCP-9154 instances growing from airborne planulae have been noted to almost exclusively attach to the surfaces of facilities directly tied to ExxArc.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h1 id="toc22"><span><strong>Addendum 9154.8 — Disappearance of DeForest Morgan</strong></span></h1>
<p>On 2088-03-19, Foundation surveillance satellites discovered the presence of SCP-9154 instances at the New Zealand residence of ExxArc CEO DeForest Morgan. Upon arrival, MTF Delta-4 'Minutemen' found that the entirety of his mansion, as well as the surrounding walls, had been overgrown with SCP-9154-instances. Delta-4 were able to enter Morgan's residence without incident, as no guards were present and security systems were already disengaged.</p>
<p>Inside the mansion, Delta-4 encountered a small colony of New Zealand sea lions (<em>Phocarctos hookeri</em>) resting around a flooded hole, which was identified as a bunker.</p>
<p>Once the site had been secured, a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8154">Pikaia</a> MKVI ROV<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup> designed for cave exploration was used to properly navigate the interior of the bunker.</p>

<p><strong>Personnel Present:</strong> Dr. Vasileiou, Junior Researcher Reyes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The ROV is lowered into the water, revealing that the interior of the bunker has become home to a kelp forest. On the floor of the room are numerous SCP-9154 instances, along with sea stars, bryozoans, crayfish, and various species of shelled gastropods. Blue mokis (<em>Latridopsis ciliaris.</em>) and striped trumpeters (<em>Latris lineata</em>) swim amidst the giant kelp.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> How is this able to grow without any sunlight?</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> I'm guessing it's another anomalous property we've missed, like the whole growing on land thing.</p>
<p>&lt;A New Zealand sea lion swims into view, it is looking directly into the camera of the ROV before swimming at it, bumping into the ROV with its nose.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Aww, I think it's curious.</p>
<p>&lt;The sea lion engages in playful behaviour with the ROV for around 2 minutes before turning away from the ROV and swimming in the direction of a stairwell.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Hmm, I wonder what the sea lion could want down there. I'm gonna follow it.</p>
<p>&lt;The ROV begins to follow the sea lion into the stairwell, the interior of which is overgrown with kelp and bryozoans like the previous room. The sea lion shows no reaction to the ROV's approach. Shoals of small fish scatter as the ROV approaches. The sea lion and the ROV pass two floors descending the stairwell, both with kelp forests lit by unusually bioluminescent jellyfish. The sea lion leaves the stairwell at the third floor down, which appears to have been turned into a deep-sea reef.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Vasileiou:</strong> Most unusual, you would expect to see this at much greater depths than this.</p>
<p>&lt;The sea lion swims up to a rock formation at the center of the room, scaring away a morid cod (<em>Lepidion sp.</em>) that was hovering above it. The formation is covered in SCP-9154 instances, other types of coral, and sponges. It is vaguely shaped like a human clenching its throat, from which an SCP-9154 instance is protruding.&gt;</p>
