<p><strong>Special Containment Procedure</strong>: Agents are to be assigned to the edge of SCP-7680’s perimeter to stop any individuals from entering the affected area without proper authorization. Any agents entering the affected zone must be briefed on this document and be aware of SCP-7680-1’s abilities. Agents should not interact with SCP-7680-1 if encountered, as the entity will completely ignore personnel that do not engage with it. Individuals trapped within the affected area during a restructuring event should be considered lost until effective containment measures can be implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-7680 is the designation given to Site-77 and the surrounding 100km of land following SCP-7680-1’s attack on the site. The affected area appears to reset itself to 11:30 am February 9th, 2019 upon SCP-7680-1’s death or discretion. The memories, placement, and state of humans and objects revert to how they were upon a Reset Event.</p>
<p>A secondary effect of SCP-7680 is the slow degradation of reality within the area. Reset Events have begun to make random objects or structures within the site operate in a fashion not consistent with baseline reality. The most common form of this has been the size of objects becoming inconsistent with their appearance. This makes certain walls intangible and specific boxes able to be felt while meters away. Other observed effects include locations experiencing kinetic buildup and barrels displaying anomalous resistance to blunt force, other effects observed have not been listed due to quantity. These anomalous effects seem to increase with each Reset Event and it is unknown if this is intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong>: SCP-7680 first came to the Foundation’s attention after Site-77 started sending repeated emails, reports, and breach alerts to neighboring sites. After contacting staff and observing outgoing security footage, it was discovered that time was reverting at seemingly random intervals. Further investigation revealed an intruder breaching the site, now dubbed SCP-7680-1. SCP-7680-1 is suspected to be the cause of SCP-7680, as the effect began when it arrived and the subject appears to retain memories between Reset Events. SCP-7680-1 appears as a baseline human, consistently wearing archetypical “cowboy” attire with the addition of a Nintendo Power Glove<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The subject is a Hispanic male standing around 1.8 meters tall. SCP-7680-1’s outfit is suspected to relate to the anomaly in some way, specifically its glove, which is believed to be the source of SCP-7680.</p>
<p>SCP-7680-1 uses its ability to repeatedly breach the site and terminate the Site Director, Shirley Gillespie. The subject will normally stick to the same route, only ever deviating if a more effective route to terminate Site Director Gillespie is discovered. Gillespie reported that she did not know SCP-7680-1, and is unaware of a potential motive.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1 - SCP-7680-1’s Routes</strong>: A record of routes taken by SCP-7680-1 has been documented here in order to better understand how to contain SCP-7680. This report has been compiled from both site security cameras and a listening device that MTF Agents managed to plant on SCP-7680-1.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy-001 Countermeasures</strong>: Senior Researcher Regan Morgan was assigned to the containment of SCP-7680. She developed a number of countermeasures that made this method completely impossible for SCP-7680-1. The hope was that SCP-7680-1 would become bored when its strategy became difficult. This has not resulted in the capture of SCP-7680-1 but it has provided information on its background and motivation. The list of these countermeasures can be found here:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-001</strong>: An automated message was sent to Dr. Stevens upon each Reset Event. This message told him not to smoke and managed to keep SCP-7680-1 from assaulting Stevens and stealing his keycard.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 reset the site several times in an attempt to get Stevens to leave the building. Eventually, it started utilizing a plate from a nearby dumpster, placing it against a wall and head-butting it. This plate was affected by SCP-7680’s secondary ability, allowing SCP-7680-1 to phase through Dr. Stevens’ office wall and assault him.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-002</strong>: Natalie Crane was sent an automated message instructing her to stop SCP-7680-1 every time they pass each other in the hall. Additionally, she was told to do whatever she could to keep it from walking away.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 initially tried ignoring Crane, but this became impossible as she started blocking its path. It proceeded to say, “Run’s dead,” before strangling Crane and snapping its own neck. Following cycles showed SCP-7680-1 preemptively killing Crane instead of ignoring her.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-003</strong>: Esther Grant was sent an automated message telling her to hide in the kitchen before SCP-7680-1 entered the building.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 reset several times in an attempt to find Grant in her usual spot. Eventually, it searched the Grand Mess Hall and found her in the freezer. SCP-7680-1 made a remark about her “stupid, bugged out pathfinding” before killing her with a kitchen knife, followed by itself. Subsequent cycles showed SCP-7680-1 stealing a chef’s hat and killing Grant in the freezer every time.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-004</strong>: Psi-7 is sent a message informing them of SCP-7680-1 and told to stand at the South Grand Mess Hall door and wait for it. It was suggested that they use non-lethal means as, at this time, the anomaly had not displayed the ability to reset outside of his death.</p>

<p><strong>Progress Report From Senior Researcher Regan Morgan</strong>:</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Progress Report-001</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>You know, there’s a lot of bad omens and superstitions in the Foundation. Despite being an organization run by scientists, you’d be hard-pressed not to find at least a handful of doctors that believe in old wives’ tales. Normally I don’t pay any mind to these but goddamn it, I should have listened when One said, “Don’t fucking go to Italy for vacation.”</p>
<p>Site-77 has had another containment breach and lucky ole me was the nearest person able to head this investigation. I just had to see Venice, huh? Well, now I’m stuck in a tent in the middle of a desert surrounded by a team composed of whoever happened to be nearby at the time. Needless to say, no one wants to be here.</p>
<p>Let’s just get to the anomaly. At first, I thought this was someone with a vendetta against Gillespie as killing her seemed to be his primary objective. Then we put the mic on the guy and my perception of him changed. The first sentence we gathered from him was, “Woah baby, that’s a big dub. Gold splits and +15, this is definitely a new PB for sure, let’s get some dubs and bits in the chat now boys.” So I thought, “Wow, this man is clearly insane and speaking gibberish.”</p>
<p>Little did I know, an assistant in the other room somehow recognized these random phrases and told us to see if there were any signals leaving the site. Sure enough, we found an unrecognized signal leaving the building. We put the IT guys to work finding out what it was and where it was going. This is when we started implementing the countermeasures and I notices his word choices. He said the word “guys” a lot. That, along with a few other phrases tipped me off on what was going on here. I needed to call my twelve-year-old cousin to be sure but I knew what it was.</p>
<p>The signal turned out to be a live stream where at least a hundred viewers watch and comment on SCP-7680-1’s actions. The title of the stream is “Site-77 Any% World Record”.</p>
<p>This person was doing an activity that my assistant described as “speedrunning”.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy-002</strong>: Following the various countermeasures implemented by Researcher Morgan, SCP-7680-1 abandoned the previous route all together in hopes of finding more efficient methods. During this process, several attempts were made to both remove the glove and subdue SCP-7680-1. All attempts to take the device were unsuccessful as the glove appeared to be attached via a powerful adhesive. Attempting to subdue SCP-7680-1 also failed as it managed to bite down on a Potassium Cyanide capsule fitted to its back molar. Further attempts at containing were halted until proper ideas could be conceived. SCP-7680-1 spent three days routing before finalizing its second strategy.</p>

<p><strong>CM-005</strong>: Ted Wilmer was given ample ammunition and warning before SCP-7680-1 arrived. The desired result was to recreate the effect CM-004 had. Providing an obstacle that SCP-7680-1 would have to adapt to.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Wilmer successfully killed SCP-7680-1 twenty-seven times. However, by the twenty-eighth attempt SCP-7680-1 had memorized where Wilmer would aim and used this knowledge to successfully overpower and kill Wilmer. To make up for lost time, SCP-7680-1 has started skipping everywhere it goes. It refers to this as “bunny hopping” and says it saves 3.4 seconds. The validity of this has yet to be determined.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-008</strong>: Staff were told to empty the pens from the mugs before SCP-7680-1 arrived. This was meant to make the staircase method completely impossible.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Staff constantly managed to pour out all but one mug. This was initially viewed as a success, since SCP-7680-1 needed at least four in order to make the climb. However, after some routing, SCP-7680-1 managed to launch itself most of the way up by throwing a grenade at the ground, placing a dinner plate above it, and standing on the plate. The blast manages to launch SCP-7680-1 to a height that makes one mug viable.</p>

<p><strong>Progress Report from Senior Researcher Regan Morgan</strong>:</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Progress Report-002</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Before this assignment, my only interaction with video games was when my sister Amelia handed me a controller and disrespected me so viscerally with Pikachu in Smash 64 that I completely ignored them the rest of my life. I never suspected that knowledge of “gaming” and its “culture” would be relevant in my career.</p>
<p>I also didn’t expect my assistant, who had previously only prepared coffee, to be working as my right hand man. His name is Caden and he’s honestly been invaluable to this mission. At first, he acted as my translator as 7680-1 had a habit of saying a string of words like, “Maybe we can pull a BotW wind bomb and that would make a faster Oblivion paintbrush strat.” I would hear this and just think, “Wow, that certainly sounds like it means something.” But Caden knew exactly what these thing meant and was able to walk me through it. I really can’t believe I’m saying these words but… gaming kind of is its own culture with differing subcultures.</p>
<p>The one we’re dealing with is the speedrunning subculture. No matter how many times Caden explains it to me I don’t really understand the appeal. These people spend hours and multiple attempts on the same game in order to play it faster than other people. Some get paid for it but many, like 7680-1, do it for fun. I really don’t get it, there’s no incentive or reward for doing it. It is solely just for fun.</p>
<p>In the beginning I didn’t think this information would change anything. We’d just get the glove off or kill him repeatedly till he gave up. Caden told us that wouldn’t work but we didn’t listen because he’s just an assistant, what does he know? Well what do you know, he was right.</p>
<p>Countermeasures 005-008 were failures as he had planned ahead for people taking the glove, and only seemed more excited to do the run when we were trying to kill him or block his path. So I returned to Caden and asked him what to do.</p>
<p>He said that 7680-1 and all other speedruns do what they do because it’s fun. There are plenty of games and places that these people can choose from but they are specifically dedicating themselves to this one because it’s fun. We need to make it not fun.</p>
<p>Now I thought we were already doing that by taking away things he needed and giving the security guard plenty of guns to kill him 20 times over. Caden thought differently, saying that making something difficult doesn’t make a game less fun as most players and speed runners specifically are masochists. The more difficult you make something, the better they’ll feel when they beat it. He said that I could put an army between him and Gillespie and it would only make 7680-1 want to kill her more. To better explain this, he showed me clips from a game called “Bloodborne”.</p>
<p>I was shown two boss fights (enemies at the end of a level), one was a big horse monster and the other was some dude with a birdcage on his head. He told me that the difference between these two fights is the difference between a game being fun and a game being tedious. The horse is an unforgiving, relentless enemy that punishes the smallest mistakes and the other runs away for 20 minutes before spamming a single attack that will instantly kill you. The main idea of what he’s saying is that it’s not that we need to make a brick wall. It’s that we need to make his route a chore.</p>
<p>So that’s what we did. We let him go through the entire route, over an hour long build up, just to snipe him in the air at the end. If he wanted to re-attempt, he’d have to spend another hour getting to that point only to die again. Caden described it as evil and exactly what we needed. Once again, the kid was right.</p>
<p>SCP-7680-1 is currently rerouting again and I’m confident that if we can continue this strat, we can make him quit within a month or two.</p>
<p>If I can take a moment to get something off my chest? I’ve been feeling very angry recently. I know this is probably irrational but there’s an intense hatred inside me, directed at 7680-1. I’m not sure why. Maybe the endless attempts at containing him only to fail repeated are hitting a little too close to home. I came to Italy in order to forget about 7570 and yet here I am. Feeling the same fucking thing. Reset. After reset. After reset.</p>
<p>Fuck Frankie and fuck [REDACTED].</p>

<p><strong>Strategy-003</strong>: SCP-7680-1 has begun using various reality distortions and even other anomalies within Site-77. The degradation has started to complete break aspects of reality. It has been estimated that within one month, a dangerous anomaly is likely to escape and leave the effected range of SCP-7680. Within two months, reality is estimated to have degraded to a point where the site is considered lost. The following is the most recent strategy SCP-7680-1 has utilized:</p>

<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 starts the cycle 5km from the site. It immediately turns around and crouches before jumping backward. This activates an area of kinetic buildup that propels it at a speed of 640 km/h directly toward Site-77.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Fuckin’ spectacular ABH. God, this exploit takes me back to my “Half-Life 2” days. How many of you were viewers back then?</p>

<p><strong>Strategy-003 Countermeasures</strong>: Senior Researcher Regan Morgan is aware of the threat the Reset Events pose and is doing everything in her power to contain SCP-7680-1. With the threat of a reality failure and the build-up of anomalies with nowhere to go, the O5 Council has considered moving someone else to the head of this project. Researcher Morgan assured results by the end of the month:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-009</strong>: With the threat level of SCP-7680 so prominent, more drastic measures have been considered. Guards were told to shoot at the power Glove in hopes of destroying the device.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: It was discovered that the Power Glove is seemingly impervious to all types of damage, physical or magical.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-010</strong>: The dinner plate that SCP-7680-1 regularly uses to clip into the building has been removed from the dumpster in hopes of slowing SCP-7680-1.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 managed to perform a backwards long jump by utilizing the dumpster itself to “interrupt the jump animation” which propelled it through the wall.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-011</strong>: An attempt was made to open a dialogue with SCP-7680-1. Normally the Foundation doesn’t negotiate with active terrorists but the threat was deemed extreme enough to consider. The hope was that SCP-7680-1 could be reasoned with once the situation was explained to it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 initially ignored all attempts at communication but eventually he was cornered by Esther Grant who attempted to warn it. SCP-7680-1 appeared to mainly talk to its chat during this, commenting on the “stupid, melodramatic dialogue”.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CM-012</strong>: All doors were left open. SCP-7680-1 was given a Clearance Level 5 keycard and a handgun. The desired result was that SCP-7680-1 would complete the fastest possible time and become bored with the run. This was a last resort as this meant SCP-7680-1 would be able to leave with the Power Glove.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: SCP-7680-1 managed to kill Site Director Gillespie in two minutes. Following this, it admitted that the run would likely not produce a better time. It appeared as if SCP-7680-1 would completely give up and leave. However, on its way out of the building, Natalie Crane stopped SCP-7680-1, saying that its outfit was against the dress code. SCP-7680-1 stated, “Fuck it, let’s just have a 100% run, boys,” before shooting Crane and starting a rampage through the site. Further cycles done by SCP-7680-1 have shown it abandoning the formula altogether in favor of random violence.</p>

<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Progress Report-003</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>I won’t lie to you. I’m kind of at a loss. We had one plan. Just the one. Make the game so boring that the idiot threw his controller at the screen and fucked off. Yet, that didn’t work and I should have known that it wouldn’t because I know guys like him. I might be a stranger to the culture but I know him. People like him are petty, they don’t accept losing or ever being put in a position that makes it seem as if they’re not on top. The chat is an echo chamber, he kills Crane repeatedly for a grudge she doesn’t even remember, he fucking emotes when he makes a good time. He’s a literal child and this is his temper tantrum.</p>
<p>He’s going insane in there. Releasing anomalies, killing staff, and just setting off the various explosives in the building. That’s bad enough but it’s made even worse by the site collapsing more and more by the day. People are falling into the ground and getting thrown into the stratosphere for stepping on small sections of ground with a slight angle. It won’t be long until the entire building becomes a black hole or crater.</p>
<p>We’ve been pulling all-nighters to keep up. Every full night’s sleep is at least 100 resets and 1,000 more “glitches”, as Caden calls them. The kid’s really been helping out recently. Pointed out a few things we probably would have never noticed, like how 7680-1 likely sees his chat through his glasses. He’s even been writing the recent countermeasure reports. As if those are helping us any. I just don’t know what else to try.</p>
<p>Well, that’s not <em>exactly</em> true. I do have a plan. A plan that has to be executed perfectly if it has any hope of working. You see, there’s one thing I have that he doesn’t. I have every stream he’s ever done. His every action for the past month. I’ve studied the way he acts, fights, manages resources. I know him better than he probably knows himself and THAT is something I can use. There are encounters, entities, and objects he will go out of his way to avoid and if I can catch him off guard with these, I might be able to beat him. I’ve run it by Caden and while he agrees that it could work, it’s very likely that something would go wrong. And unlike 7680-1, I only get one attempt. Fuck. Might as well.</p>
<p>Caden knows the culture, Frankie’s doing it for fun and to beat him we have to make it un-fun. But now we’re not dealing with a speedrunner, we’re dealing with an asshole suffering from a God complex. Lucky for me, I have experience in that department.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Congratulate me?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Yeah! At first they were <em>pissed</em> about this but after we really thought about it, you’re doing us a favor. Site-77 is the biggest container of anomalous items in the world. With the degradation of reality, you’ve practically erased these issues from existence. All those problems are getting no clipped right into the void. I mean, do you know how much we’ll save on electricity and water alone?

<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: No… Well, yes… But you shouldn’t be doing this!</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: I’m a bit confused. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Fight back! Try to stop me!</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: What’s the point? You’re too good. Uncontainable. And a big money saver, I mean the insurance on this place-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Listen! You’re going to go back to how it was or-</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Or? Or what? No, let’s be real, Frankie, what leverage do you really have? You gonna reset again? Go ahead, we can have this conversation again and get this place one more step into the ground.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Fucking stupid bitch! You’re ruining this for me! Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing. I’m not going to be Bugs Bunnied by you! You want me to give up! But guess what? There are other places, other sites. I’ll just go there and start from scratch! But you</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 points its gun at Morgan who rolls her eyes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Oh noooo, a gun. Please don’t shoot me.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 fires but the bullet bounces off the air directly in front of Morgan. SCP-7680-1 looks at the gun confused.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Wow, guess this doesn’t really happen to you? No wait it definitely did. Strategy one, step four, you always managed to hit a barrel with a “janky hitbox”. Well, I went ahead and had the processing guys line my lab coat with pieces of that barrel. You see, you have all these tools at your disposal but never actually took the time to utilize them. I mean look what I was able to put together in eight minutes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: You… What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: The God-run.</p>
<p><em>(Morgan presses a button on her wristpad that opens one of the nearby crates. An instance of SCP-1507 exits and immediately rushes SCP-7680-1 who tries to dodge but is ultimately attacked by the creature. Morgan picks up the baseball bat.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: How did you describe it? “The stupid, eight-second, grab animation”.</p>
<p><em>(Morgan swings the bat and manages to connect the blow with the top of SCP-7680-1’s head. This knocks SCP-7680-1 away from SCP-1507 but the creature is immediately on it again before the subject can react.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: That one was a little high, hold still a moment.</p>
<p><em>(Morgan swing directly into SCP-7680-1’s jaw, knocking a few of its teeth onto the floor and once again separating SCP-7680-1 and SCP-1507. At this moment Consultant Caden Worley conducted a cyber assault on SCP-7680-1’s stream. Hundreds of dollars worth of channel memberships and donations were sent to SCP-7680-1, overlaying his vision with animations and loud sound effects.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: I can’t fucking see anything! There’s fucking OMEGALULs all over my screen! Mods! Ban that-</p>
<p><em>(Morgan grabs the base of SCP-1507 and throws it back at SCP-7680-1, trapping him in another struggle. This time, Morgan runs to SCP-7680-1 and grabs the glove, attempting to pull it off. She is unsuccessful as SCP-7680-1 manages to crush the head of SCP-1507 and pull away from Morgan.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Fuck you, I win!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 places the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. However, the gun has exhausted its bullets and does not kill SCP-7680-1.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Yeah… Wasn’t really going to give you a full clip, now, was I?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 reaches for the button on its Power Glove, the empty pistol still in its hand. Morgan is faster and presses a button on her wristpad. A small explosive detonates in SCP-7680-1’s hand, completely removing the non-gloved arm from its body and throwing SCP-7680-1 to the ground.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: But I was going to leave an explosive in the gun just in case you tried to press the button. That’s the thing about streaming all your stuff. You become predictable. You never use your Power Glove hand to shoot and absolutely never put a gun away, even when it’s empty.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Fucking bitch!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 swings its remaining fist at Morgan, only to have it bounce off the air a few inches from her face.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Ugh, I thought we went over this. Barrel.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Oh, fuck this!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 attempts to press the reset button with its nose but Morgan swings her bat, first hitting its head, followed by a hard swing into its arm.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Will you fucking stop! I can’t even feel that!</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Yeah, doesn’t change the fact that your arm is broken.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 looks down and attempts to move its arm, eventually finding it to be unresponsive. It then runs for the edge of the room, likely attempting to press the button against the wall. Morgan hits its knee as it runs, knocking it to the ground. She quickly mounts the subject and removes a mug from her lab coat, dumping the contents onto the Power Glove. SCP-7680-1 pushes Morgan off of it but fails to stand as a collection of unmoveable pens are pinning its hand to the ground. SCP-7680-1 starts biting loudly as Morgan crosses the room and pulls SCP-512 from a crate, its handle having been removed and the point sharpened.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Trying to bite your suicide pill? Yeah, I knocked that out of your mouth like three minutes ago. To be honest, I wasn’t sure if this was going to work. There were a lot of what if’s in my plan, but I’ve found that in recent years I’ve always been lucky.</p>
<p><em>(Morgan stabs SCP-512 into SCP-7680-1’s leg and ensures it won’t be pulled free. SCP-7680-1 begins banging its head against the floor in an attempt at suicide. Mogan crosses the room with her bat, stopping in front of the window.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Wow, look at that snow. 649 really is something, huh? Thought experiment Frankie, what do you think is gonna give first? The immovable pens, the magic umbrella, or the skin keeping that glove on your hand?</p>
<p><em>(Morgan shatters the window with the bat, releasing gale force winds into the building. SCP-512 begins violently pulling SCP-7680-1 to the opening, the only thing keeping them tethered being the pens.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Okay, yep, I think I’m having a change of heart.</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Wow, really?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: We can talk about this, right?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Eh, never really been one for pointless conversations.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 slides a bit closer to the edge as the skin of its hand begins to peel.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: This is a bluff right? I mean, you guys don’t kill anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: You’re not an anomaly though. Just the thing on your hand, and trust me, we’ll take very good care of that.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 slips a bit more.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7680-1</strong>: Please, come on, I don’t wanna die!</p>
<p><strong>Morgan</strong>: Take solace in the fact that you’ll die as you lived. Quickly.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7680-1 is yanked free of the glove and pulled into the snowstorm. It flies wildly in the air for several minutes before various lightning bolts strike SCP-512. Killing SCP-7680-1 instantly and permanently.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: SCP-7680 is to be kept in a safe containment locker at Site-7 when not being utilized by Senior Researcher Regan Morgan<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Any personnel wishing to transfer or cross test the device must first receive authorization from Researcher Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-7680 is a modified, indestructible Nintendo Power Glove capable of saving a place in time and reverting back to it upon the users death or the press of the “start” button. The range of this ability has been estimated to be over 100km and can revert everything apart from other Nintendo Power Gloves.</p>
<p>The object has a secondary effect that becomes progressively worse the more times an area experiences a Reset Event. Objects within the effected area will experience reality distortion similar to several popular glitches in the gaming phenomenon of “speedrunning”. These effects will slowly correct themselves over time so long as no other Reset Events occur.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong>: SCP-7680 was discovered following a number of raids of Site-77 by Frank Odelle Sanders II. Sanders utilized SCP-7680 to “speedrun” the murder of Site Director Gillespie. It is not believed that Sanders did this for any vendetta but instead as a form of entertainment. Sanders streamed all of his attempts and many of his viewers were known members of the group Gamers Against Weed. Further investigation into this connection is ongoing. The Foundation acquired SCP-7680 after leading researcher Regan Morgan mobilized an unsanctioned attack on Sanders that resulted in his death. Several overseers, notably O5-8, advocated for disciplinary action against Morgan, but such measures have yet to be taken.</p>
