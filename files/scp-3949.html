            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3949</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation webcrawler I/O-NYSE is to monitor for posts mentioning <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> or its characters. Any flagged posts are to be immediately reported to Mobile Task Force Omicron-5 ("TRUE Fans"). MTF Omicron-5 is to determine if these posts originated from SCP-3949, and if so, to respond to these posts until the SCP-3949 instance deletes itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3949 denotes a series of accounts, presumably all created by a single entity, located on various social media websites, forums, and message boards.</p>
<p>All of SCP-3949's posts center around the (nonexistent) animated series <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> or the fan community supposedly surrounding it. However, researchers have managed to extrapolate information about <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> through SCP-3949's posts. According to these extrapolations, <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> is in the sci-fi genre and had four seasons before going on indefinite hiatus. In-depth information can be found in Supplementary File 3949-R238.</p>
<p>Attempts to trace the origin of SCP-3949 have so far proven unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Approximately 2% of people who view SCP-3949's posts will become convinced that <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> exists, and that they have watched at least one episode of it. Remembered details of <em>Penumbra W.A.V.E.</em> are mostly consistent across different people. These false memories cease once SCP-3949 deletes itself, but can return upon the next SCP-3949 emergence.</p>
<p>SCP-3949 has a very timid temperament and generally does not respond positively to negative comments or responses to its posts. In most cases, SCP-3949 will respond a few times with attempts to induce guilt in the responder, before deleting itself and all its posts entirely. After this, SCP-3949 will reappear under a new username after a variable period ranging from 9 to 72 days.</p>
<p>After Incident 3949-119, SCP-3949 has not created any new accounts. After one year of inactivity, SCP-3949 was reclassed Neutralized.</p>

<td>066</td>
<td>A reposted uncredited artwork depicting one character wielding the Storm Sword and standing over a defeated foe.</td>
