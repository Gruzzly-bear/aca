<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Brazilian Branch of the SCP Foundation is to thoroughly monitor all news outlets for any potential mentions of SCP-1377.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-1377 reemerges and civilian unrest reaches or exceeds the levels of the previous manifestation, Mobile Task Force "Brand New Day" is to be dispatched throughout the national territory while <em>Operation Sunlight</em> is initiated once more in a joint effort with the Department of Continuity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1377 was an anomalous pathology of unknown origin that circulated within the Federative Republic of Brazil during March 2021. It would dematerialize an individual’s physical form before confining consciousness within their shadow,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> with the effects extending to any individual who came into direct contact with it.</p>
<p>Ontoelectric thaumaturgical investigation indicates that the functionality of the psyche was not compromised by SCP-1377, and reports of a faint heartbeat being heard from the victims were common.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Although SCP-1377 was considered irreversible, exposure to high-intensity light had shown to be capable of completely disintegrating anomalous shadows. This would be later deemed a euthanasia procedure by the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Decommissioning - Operation Sunlight</p>
<p>The first cases of SCP-1377 were reported on the morning of March 4, in the city of São Paulo, with the disappearance of local families followed by increasing public disturbances. Several other reports were confirmed across the country shortly after, and within a week, the total numbers were of 320,000 infected individuals.</p>
<p>From March 12 to 29, the general population remained indoors to avoid contact with SCP-1377 and spend time beside their families. At this point, most individuals had also taken measures to entirely prevent light from entering their households. Then-President Jair Messias Bolsonaro assisted the SCP Foundation in seizing and restricting all attempts at external communications from Brazilian territory.</p>
<p>Due to the escalating economic complications for the United States arising from this behavior — particularly the disruption of food exports — and the concurrent destabilization of the Brazilian people, the SCP Foundation developed <em>Operation Sunlight</em> to neutralize the threat within the country.</p>
<p>The operation consisted of the following measures:</p>
<p>• Creation of SCP-1377-1, a series of high-intensity luminous spheres augmented through thaumaturgical means. Each instance had a range of 1,000 km and was deployed across one of the country's five regions. They were remotely activated at 11:00 AM on March 30, and immediately euthanized those infected with SCP-1377;</p>
<p>• Infusion of SCP-1377-1 with memetic agents designed to ensure that neither its activation nor SCP-1377’s victims could be mentioned by the Brazilian population;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>• Deployment of Mobile Task Force "A Brand New Day" to combat individuals of high cognitive resistance actively frustrating the Foundation’s containment efforts;</p>
<p>• Expunction of all documents pertaining to the victims to ensure consistency with mass memetic application.</p>
<p>By the following day, Brazil had resumed to Normalcy.</p>

<p>March 30, 2021, was the most lethal day in the recent Brazilian history — in just 24 hours, 3,780 deaths were registered due to COVID-19. Brother. Sisters. Others.</p>
<p>The fascist President, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, who had dismissed the issue as "just a little cold" and delayed the purchase of the vaccines by importing the American antivax approach to a country known for its massive vaccination campaigns and great universal healthcare, went even further as to mock people <em>suffocating</em> while hospitals across the country ran out of oxygen tanks.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Just the year before, when confronted by the media about his heinous attacks against us, he had replied:</p>
<p>"I am no gravedigger. What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>Since then, 700,000 deaths have been registered due to COVID-19 in Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro, who attempted to coordinate a coup after losing the 2022 elections, is being tried as you read this — but not for his declared genocide of his own people. Of the <em>unforgettable</em>.</p>
<p>We were humiliated.</p>
<p>We were forced to move on.</p>
<p>We were prohibited from mourning.</p>
<p>In this shortform of mine, I tried depicting the overwhelming feeling of dread that the conscientious people in this country have had to endure for a time of pain that was stolen from us while Bolsonarism is still on the rise, and the next general elections now get closer.</p>
<p>The stain in my heart is a requiem for thousands of innocent souls.</p>
