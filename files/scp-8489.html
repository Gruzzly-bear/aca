<p>Site-86 Ethics Committee Liaison Henri Cosztonne.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8489</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8489 is to be stored in a low-security item storage locker at <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8749" target="_blank">General Purpose Site-86</a>. In the interest of his mental health, Henri Cosztonne is not to be allowed access to this file or any information within it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8489 is the collective designation for two left hands, severed at the wrist, which were recovered from the personal apartment of Site-86 Ethics Committee Liaison Henri Cosztonne. Both instances of SCP-8489 are anomalously preserved, having shown no signs of decomposition during their time in Foundation custody. However, both instances are susceptible to damage, and neither has been observed to heal or bleed.</p>
<p>One hand<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> is larger in size than the other<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and possesses thicker hair on the back of the hand. Both hands possess differently-sized but otherwise identical titanium rings on the ring finger. These can be removed and damaged normally. Genetic testing of SCP-8489 resulted in a match between SCP-8489 and Cosztonne in a manner that indicates a familial relationship.</p>
<p>Both instances of SCP-8489 were discovered by Cosztonne in his bedroom on January 28, 2020, following which he immediately reported the sighting to site staff. A subsequent review of footage from his personal home security system discovered multiple appearances of SCP-8489 in the years leading up to their discovery, none of which set off the security system.</p>
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Addendum 8489.01: Timeline</span></h1>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>03/08/2013 3:14PM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen for the first time. It crawls on its fingers from behind a mirror in the far side of the room. It crawls along a side table before grabbing a Valentine's Day card between its thumb and index finger and using the remaining fingers to return to the mirror.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>10/30/2013 9:28PM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen crawling along the same side table and grabbing a homemade birthday card before retreating behind the mirror.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>07/15/2014 3:48AM:</strong> SCP-8489-A is seen for the first time. The two instances work together to slowly remove a poster from the wall. The two carry the poster together behind the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent footage indicates this poster was never replaced following this incident.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>06/27/2015 11:57PM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen removing a small jewelry box and a receipt from a nightstand before retreating.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior footage indicates the item had been acquired by Cosztonne earlier that day.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>12/29/2016 5:14PM:</strong> SCP-8489-A and -B are seen working together to cut and collect significant portions of Cosztonne's hair before retreating.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent footage indicates Cosztonne never grew his hair back to its previous length following this incident.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>03/11/2017 2:53PM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen grabbing a framed photo from the side table and attempting to move toward another before hurriedly retreating behind the mirror upon the door to the bedroom opening. Cosztonne does not appear to notice it.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>06/19/2017 6:03AM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen removing a small rainbow-colored homemade clay vase before retreating.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior footage indicates this item was given to Cosztonne by his son the day before.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>01/31/2018: 2:18AM:</strong> SCP-8489-A and -B are seen working together removing the last remaining poster on the wall before retreating.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent footage indicates Cosztonne's walls remained barren following this incident until the discovery of SCP-8489 in 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>10/09/2018 12:49AM:</strong> SCP-8489-A and -B are seen removing several pieces of memorabilia related to the Broadway musical <em>Cabaret</em> from various places in the room throughout the night and taking multiple trips behind the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent footage indicates Cosztonne did not acquire any new pieces of such memorabilia since.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>02/13/2019 4:40AM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen removing a douche and two unopened condoms from a nightstand drawer before retreating.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent footage indicates a prolonged period of turmoil between Cosztonne and his husband following this incident. Cosztonne's husband was not seen sleeping in Cosztonne's bed again until 10/14/2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>01/28/2020 7:49AM:</strong> SCP-8489-B is seen attempting to remove a metal ring from a nightstand before quickly retreating behind the mirror upon Cosztonne's phone alarm going off at 7:50. Cosztonne is seen shrieking, rushing over to the mirror and tearing it away from the wall, upon which he sees SCP-8489-A and -B perched on the wall behind it. The space behind the mirror is otherwise empty. Both instances cease all movement and fall to the floor. Cosztonne is seen intermittently hyperventilating and pacing around his room for nearly 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Cosztonne handed SCP-8489 over to Site-86 containment staff upon his arrival at the site. Neither object has been observed to move since the incident.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Addendum 8489.02: Incident 8489.01</span></h1>
<p>On February 14, 2020, Cosztonne was hospitalized following a heart attack, showing difficulty breathing. Emergency surgery was performed, in which a right hand similar in appearance to SCP-8489-B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> was observed within his chest cavity. Due to the object's firm grasp on his heart, a heart transplant was necessary to avoid significant risk to Cosztonne's life. Cosztonne was observed to make a slow but full recovery following the procedure. Shortly after his recovery, Cosztonne filed for divorce with his husband, Site-86 HMCL Supervisor George Cosztonne. No anomalous activity related to Cosztonne or SCP-8489 has been reported since. Updates to above file pending.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h2 id="toc2"><span><strong>NOTICE FROM THE SCP FOUNDATION ETHICS COMMITTEE</strong></span></h2>
<p>Following intense deliberation by the Ethics Committee, the attached image has been allowed to be added to this file, due to the presence of possibly important context for the SCP-8489 research team. Image was acquired following the team's discovery and enabling of Cosztonne's home security system's facial recognition setting. The relationship between the named individuals and SCP-8489 are unclear. Further research is pending as of March 6, 2020.</p>
