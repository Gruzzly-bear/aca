            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8147</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8147 is to be kept in a standard Safe object containment locker. Testing on SCP-8147 is strictly forbidden following the events of Incident 8147-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8147 is a 4-meter-wide 3-centimeter-thick circular ring made of bronze, with three brackets on its backside that enable it to be mounted to a wall. In addition, the object has a USB port and a standard American 120 V power plug. When SCP-8147 is powered and is attached to a keyboard, its interior turns into a black void which behaves as if it is solid. When a user types on the keyboard, white text appears in this void.</p>
<p>If, at any time, the user hits the "Enter" key, the text disappears, and an image of an hourglass will appear on the surface of SCP-8147 for anywhere from three seconds to two hours.</p>
<p>Following this, the interior of SCP-8147 will become a Class IV Dimensional Rift, enabling the user to travel into an alternate world (designated SCP-8147-1). This world will roughly match the textual description the user entered prior. No material from within SCP-8147-1 may pass through the rift.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 8147-1:</strong> On 4 April 2023, a test was being conducted on SCP-8147 where it was prompted to create "A planet identical to Earth, except that humans never evolved." However, Site-03 briefly lost power 2.47 seconds after SCP-8147 entered its "hourglass" state. Upon losing power, SCP-8147 immediately formed a Class IV Dimensional Rift instead of shutting down as expected. Upon entering, the SCP-8147 Exploration Team stepped onto mountainous, rocky terrain. Exploration Team Captain Roberts was immediately alerted to a human entity (designated SCP-8147-2) dressed in overalls chiseling a rock with a jackhammer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[SCP-8147-2 stops the jackhammer and stares at the exploration crew.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8147-2:</strong> Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Roberts:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8147-2:</strong> You folks gotta leave. This is a construction zone.</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Roberts:</strong> I thought this planet wasn't supposed to have humans. Are you human?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8147-2:</strong> As human as you are! I'll be outta your way once it's finished. Now scram!</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Roberts:</strong> Wait, what <em>made</em> this planet?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8147-2:</strong> You're lookin' at 'im. Fuckin' hate planet duty.</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Roberts:</strong> And exactly <em>how</em> long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8147-2:</strong> 'Round about two-and-a-half quadrillion years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All tests on SCP-8147 are now forbidden as per Ethics Committee fiat, including the planned Test #297.</p>
