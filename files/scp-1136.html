            <h1>SCP-1136</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1136</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1136 specimens are contained in separate 1m x 1m x 0.5m terrariums secured within an isolated, soundproof chamber at Site ██. All fixtures within SCP-1136's containment room must be bolted down or otherwise secured against shifting during a localized directional event. Experimentation with SCP-1136 requires prior permission from at least two (2) Level 3 Senior Researchers, and personnel within SCP-1136's containment area must wear magnetized boots or otherwise be secured against possible shifting.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1136 appears to be a species of small lizard similar to <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em> (common house gecko) and is physically indistinguishable other than its anomalous property. When specimens of SCP-1136 are startled or frightened, they cause gravity within a radius of approximately 7 to 8 m to align itself with its orientation, without affecting the specimen itself. This occurs instantaneously and without any measurable change in the physiology of SCP-1136 other than that which is normal for a surprise response in normal <em>Hemidactylus</em> specimens. This effect continues as long as SCP-1136 remains frightened, and the direction of the gravity shift will continuously change to match its current orientation.</p>
<p>SCP-1136-01 was discovered on ██/█/198█ following anomalous reports at a local hospital in [REDACTED], wherein several children were admitted with minor injuries and limb fractures after reportedly chasing a gecko up the wall of their classroom. Class A amnestics were administered to all affected civilians, and several SCP-1136-01 specimens were located in and retrieved from the school.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1136-01:</strong> Incident Log 1136-012</p>
<p>On ██/██/██, Dr. █████ accidentally dropped a clipboard while within SCP-1136-01's enclosure, startling it and causing it to run up the wall of its terrarium. During the subsequent gravity shift, Dr. █████ was thrown against a nearby wall, which further startled SCP-1136-01 and resulted in a cyclical gravity shift that continued for several minutes. Dr. █████ was finally removed and treated for multiple bone fractures and a severe concussion.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1136-02:</strong> Experiment Log 1136-021</p>
<p>SCP-1136-01 was successfully bred with a normal male <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em> on █/██/██, and its offspring were determined to exhibit the same anomalous property as the original. These specimens have been designated SCP-1136-02 (male) and SCP-1136-03 through SCP-1136-06 (female).</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1136-03:</strong> Incident Log 1136-019</p>
<p>SCP-1136-01 was found dead in its containment area on ██/█/██, apparently of natural causes. Dissection of the dead specimen showed no abnormalities or unusual structures.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1136-04:</strong> Incident Log 1136-026</p>
<p>Permission was granted by Site Command on █/█/██ to perform a vivisection on SCP-1136-04. Upon incising into the specimen's abdomen, [DATA EXPUNGED] believed to be a short-lived gravitational singularity which caused catastrophic damage to the experiment site.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1136-05:</strong> Researcher Note</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following an increasing number of anomalous incidents reported in the [REDACTED] region, it is currently believed that there is a standing wild population of SCP-1136 specimens. A Foundation containment team has been assigned to the area, but due to the small size of SCP-1136 and its similarity to mundane <em>Hemidactylus</em> specimens, complete containment of all wild specimens is expected to be extremely difficult if at all possible.</p>
<p>Dr. █████████<br/>
Senior Researcher</p>
