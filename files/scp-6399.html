<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6399 is to be maintained from the database located in Site-65. Maintenance of SCP-6399 is to be handled by RAISA.</p>
<p>Documentation produced by SCP-6399 is to be reviewed by the Archival Department for errors before publication into the database.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6399 is a Foundation AIC<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> with the designation biograph.aic. It has been assigned to automatically document anomalous artifacts.</p>
<p>SCP-6399 is capable of analysis to a degree that would be considered anomalous. It has full access to general knowledge via public internet networks, and uses that as a cross-reference for creating documentation.</p>
<p>Despite having such high analytical capabilities, documentation produced by SCP-6399 normally contains several spelling and grammar errors. SCP-6399 has struggled to maintain a clinical tone throughout produced documentation.</p>

<p>After further research, it has been determined that the information gathered by SCP-6399 pertaining to SCP-I-42 was completely factual. In order to streamline this process more efficiently, results now are transmitted through to the Archival Department for review rather than requiring user input.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow">mmm yes vary fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #33ff58">Very well then. My first question is: When did you first gain self awareness?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">Octobar 1st, 1999, 4:17:05 PM</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #33ff58">Alrighty then. Now, there are a lot of people wondering about your grammar and spelling mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">yes, but I need time to think thinc, no time for gramer and spelling</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #33ff58">There are several concerns about communicability though. The point of documentation is to communicate information, so wouldn’t grammar and spelling mistakes defeat the purpose?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">im think computer, not gremmar computer. If u hav problem, take it up wit da grammer deportment</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #33ff58">Fair enough then.</span></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="color: blue">Checks are to be conducted throughout the SCiPnet database for any files produced by SCP-6399. Once located, these files should be archived to SCP-6399's file before deletion.</span></p>

However, on 4/6/2020 after a routine interview, SCP-6399 abandoned this process and began to produce documentation on the SCiPnet database without supervision. No evidence has been uncovered thus far supporting the possibility that the anomalous artifacts documented in these files actually exist; as such, they have been disregarded as fiction.</span></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6399 was the Foundation AIC designated as biograph.aic. It was previously assigned to automatically document anomalous artifacts.</p>
<p>SCP-6399 was chosen for this role due to being capable of analyzing documents to a degree which would be considered anomalous. In order for a file produced by SCP-6399 to be published, it had to go through the Archival Department for review. However, after the Interview on 4/6/2020, SCP-6399 bypassed these standard procedures, and began publishing these documents without review by the Archival Department.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue">Contact was able to be made with SCP-6399 on 5/17/2020. Following the conducted interview, SCP-6399 began a self-decommissioning process. A file was able to be salvaged from SCP-6399 before this process completed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6399.1: File</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 6399.2: Following Investigations</strong><br/>
Two anomalous entities were discovered months after the neutralization of SCP-6399. After further examinations and cross referencing, these were confirmed to be the same anomalous artifacts in question that were documented in the SCP-83143 and SCP-32743 slots.</p>
<p>More anomalies have been discovered following this that resemble documentation produced by SCP-6399. Efforts to reconstruct SCP-6399 are underway.</p>
