<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imperative</span> that all Site-64 personnel remain unaware of the 1991 collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This is to be enforced via the remote administration of gaseous Class A amnestics if necessary.</p>
<p>Site-01's Antimemetics Liaison is tasked with using INTERTEL-064 to conduct Protocol R daily, at exactly 23:59.</p>
<p>Site-64's nuclear stockpile has been relocated and all access points to its former location have been cemented over. Previous activation sequences are now solely capable of instigating RED ALERT status for a period of fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9064 is Foundation-made antimemetic concept <em>"UNDERKILL"</em> (AM-68-1).</p>
<p>Following the Soviet Union's first successful nuclear test in 1949, the O5-Council voted 12-1 in favor of the Foundation becoming nuclear-capable, citing a need for deterrence below the Veil. Between the years of 1957 and 1991, Site-64 was designated as the Foundation's nuclear response site.</p>
<p>By 1962, eleven requests for First Strike Approval had been submitted to the O5-Council, all containing fearful diatribes about how the Foundation must strike first, lest destruction become imminent. Hesitant to revoke Site-64's nuclear response capability, the Council chose to seek alternative methods of abatement.</p>
<p>At the direction of the O5-Council, <em>UNDERKILL</em> was created to target the conceptual fear of nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. The project was deemed a success, with the Council only receiving three First Strike Approval requests between 1963 and 1991.</p>
<p>By February of 1992, rates of workplace accidents, containment breaches, and non-adherence to essential safety protocol had increased dramatically. Personnel began to act irrationally — with no sense of caution nor avoidance of danger.</p>
<p>An investigation was performed and researchers discovered that <em>UNDERKILL</em> had remained active, beginning to consume the <em>abstract concept of fear</em>, in lieu of its target concept.</p>
<p>Protocol R serves as a stopgap containment measure to stave off the expansion of <em>UNDERKILL</em>'s scope of effect via temporally condensed satiation. The Protocol works by manufacturing its target concept in a concentrated form, concluding when all memory of its occurrence is consumed.</p>
