<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A three-kilometer area around each SCP-7907 manifestation is to be evacuated for forty-eight hours. Individuals exiting SCP-7907-1 are to be given psychiatric and/or amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7907 is a poltergeist, believed to be PoI-3947, that assumes the form of an emaciated male humanoid wearing a Venetian carnival mask. Direct eye contact with the entity has been known to cause severe cognitohazardous harm including personality alteration, memory loss, and psychosis. SCP-7907 can trigger pseudobulbar affect<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> through its cognitohazardous speech. A black book entitled "Liber Mortis" (designated SCP-7907-3) is believed to be the source of the entity's cognitohazardous properties.</p>
<p>SCP-7907 will manifest itself and a standard-size carnival tent (designated SCP-7907-1) within the United States approximately once per decade, during an SCP-7907-A event. Manifestations last up to two days, during which time the entity and decomposing bodies puppeteered by it (designated SCP-7907-2) perform anomalous and/or anatomically impossible circus tricks.</p>
<p>Individuals can enter and exit SCP-7907-1 during an SCP-7907-A event, though the entity has been known to react aggressively to research and/or rescue expeditions. When an SCP-7907-A event is concluded, the entity and all objects related to it spontaneously dematerialize. Individuals inside SCP-7907-1 during dematerialization have reported falling and remaining unconscious until the next SCP-7907-A event. Promotional advertisements are occasionally left behind following dematerialization, and information from them has enabled prediction of future SCP-7907-A events.</p>

<p><em>May this letter find you in good cheer, for ours is beyond measure. At long last we've secured a plot in San Fransisco for the traveling circus show.

<br/>
Although first located in 1934 through an SCP-7907-A event, subsequent research indicates that the entity has been active since 1906, when LoI-3210, a circus tent commonly known as "Langmeyer's Laugh Emporium," disappeared during a 7.9 magnitude earthquake. Surviving records from the deceased PoI-3948<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> confirmed the connection between PoI-3947 and SCP-7907.

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site Director Emery Novens</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dr. Angela Grant</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Director Novens questions Dr. Grant on her experience inside SCP-7907-1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Written Transcript]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Could you tell us how you became trapped within SCP-7907-1, Dr. Grant?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> It happened while I backstage with my team. We found twisted carnival masks, bloody swords, and… <em>[whispering]</em> I think there were some props made of <em>human skin.</em> I was photographing pages from this creepy black book when we heard someone coming.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> It was SCP-7907, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> Yes. <em>[pauses]</em> He was tall and stick-thin, but I couldn't get a good look at the guy because he was covered head-to-toe in fancy circus clothes. The man's outfit was so colorful he looked half-peacock, and his face was covered by a grinning mask. It was leaking some kind of black fluid, and the <em>smell…</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Grant vomits on the floor of the interview room. Director Novens sends for a janitor and offers a towel to Dr. Grant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> …You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> My legs were like jelly, and I barely managed to hide under a table before he came into the room. "Trying to nab my secrets, eh?" I heard that hideous mask speak to us, "A good performer never shares a jot, but methinks <em>you'll</em> be sharing things with <em>me</em> instead…" I caught a glimpse of his eyes while he was staring at one of my colleagues, and suddenly all I could see was the swirling purple light in the empty eye-sockets of his mask. It felt… <em>[pauses]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens [quietly]:</strong> It's alright, you're safe here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> It felt like he was stealing thoughts right out of my <em>head.</em> I felt ideas, memories, even whole chunks of my psyche being sucked out as if a leech had latched onto my brain.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Did it try to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> He didn't see me under the table, at least, I don't think he did. That guy went to each of my colleagues, looking them in the eyes with that same light, and kissed them on the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> It <em>kissed</em> them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> The guy looked more like he was <em>sucking</em> something out of their mouths, but I didn't get a good view. A few moments later I fell unconscious. The last thing I remembered was hearing someone weeping, "Sorry. Sorry. So sorry…"</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Do you remember anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> I remember waking up under the same table and finding a spot under the stands to hide in. That's where your agent found me.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Nothing <em>else?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grant:</strong> No. <em>[pauses]</em> Can I leave now?</p>
</div>

<br/>
<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Dr. Grant is to be referred to a site therapist weekly for physiatric care, and archives of her photographs of SCP-7907-3 are to be assigned level 4/7907 classification.<br/>

<p><em>The show's earnings were poor this week, and Alton has been acting quite strange as well. He showed me a book of magicks with profane inscriptions, insisting that we use its unholy powers for the show. I told Alton to burn the book before it hexed us all, but he refused to listen. I fear for his soul.</em><br/>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site Director Emery Novens</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> MTF Agent Max Maxwell</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Director Novens questions Agent Maxwell about his version of events during the SCP-7907-A event of 1964.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Written Transcript]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Greetings, Agent Maxwell. You'll be pleased to know Dr. Grant is safe and in good health thanks to your brave actions. Shall I schedule a meeting with her?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Yes, and let's get down to brass tacks while we're here. You didn't invite me just for a pat on the back, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> You are correct, Agent Maxwell, and as direct as ever. Our interview with Dr. Grant was… <em>inconclusive.</em> We hope that your account will clear some things up.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Of course, sir. We first rushed the circus perimeter, and the boys started drawing lots for who'd have to go inside. I offered to take Chip's place when he drew a short straw, and then me and the unlucky fellas entered the tent.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> You <em>volunteered?</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Yeah. <em>[chuckles]</em> Probably a stupid idea in hindsight, but Chip had a baby girl and I didn't want that on my conscience.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> <em>[smiles]</em> A commendable sentiment, Agent Maxwell. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> The inside was <em>huge,</em> ten times bigger than the tent at least, and there were these frankensteined <em>creatures</em> prancing around on their hind legs upstage. Some of the other guys were distracted by all that, not to mention the smell of rotting flesh, so I told them to keep their eyes peeled. There were people trapped in this magic building, and we had to rescue them.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> And was that when you found Dr. Grant?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Yes, I found her hiding under these bleacher-type seats… Well, I suppose <em>heard</em> her is more accurate, seeing as the woman was babbling like she'd been shell-shocked. I told her that help had arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> How did she react to that statement?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Laughter. <em>[pauses]</em> And by that I mean <em>laughter.</em> She started laughing uncontrollably and rolling on the floor, to the point where some of the circus-zombie-things started turning and getting angry. I didn't have time to chit-chat, so I hoisted the gibbering woman over my shoulder and high-tailed it out of there. She kept babbling, "He told a funny! I know a funny!" as if she'd never heard a joke before in her life, so I knocked her unconscious with an elbow to the head. <em>[looks down]</em> Couldn't risk attracting more of those circus freaks, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> I'd say you made the right decision, Agent Maxwell. <em>[pauses]</em> While we're on the subject of the SCP-7907-2 entities, did any of them try to stop you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> The little ones did. Their bodies felt like carrion and were about as strong. You think they'd flee after the first few gunshots, but those guys were practically throwing themselves at us saying "Shoot! Shoot! Don't hold back!" <em>[pauses]</em> We didn't, not that it made much of a difference. Even with a dozen bullet holes those bastards still kept crawling towards us. At least the bullets actually slowed them down; no such luck when it came to the other guy…</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> SCP-7907, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> Yes. He rose and spoke as I was running headfirst out of the circus with my mates. "Think it's funny to spoil my show, do you?" He said to us, "I'll tell you what's <em>really</em> funny!"</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> And what was "really funny?"</p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> ████████████ ██████ ███ █████ ████████</p>
<p><em>Director Novens begins laughing uncontrollably, making spasmodic motions and crying from both eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Maxwell:</strong> …I still don't get it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> All MTF Mu-13 task force members that entered SCP-7907-1 are missing and presumed dead, with the exception of Agent Maxwell. Director Novens remained incapacitated for two hours and continued to suffer from pseudobulbar affect for a week.<br/>

<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> I'll cut to the chase so you numbskulls can understand: you're here because a few hours from now this field will have a big tent in it, and we need to rescue the people trapped inside.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> Luck?</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Yeah… luck. I got this job by luck, after bagging a shoplifter who happened to be a <em>shapeshifter</em> as well. When the Foundation brass showed up they were so impressed they offered to take me on as a field agent.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Vance [shouting]:</strong> I don't know! I'd keep someone else from being assigned to it at least, and maybe I could've figured something out!</p>

<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> That's all I ever wanted… <em>[smiles sadly]</em> It was mom that first got me this job. She was an MTF legend too.

<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> <em>[chuckles]</em> Yeah, she was. <em>[pauses]</em> Mom trained me harder than anyone else, and by the time I was sixteen I had three black belts, extensive firearm training, and knowledge of every MTF procedure in the book. <em>[sighs]</em> But I also had Usher syndrome…</p>

<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Great, I can save the tissues and Ben &amp; Jerry in that case.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> <em>[pauses]</em> So what happened while I was out?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> You <em>saved</em> us. Without that visor trick I never could've grabbed the book.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> <em>[snorts]</em> Guess the equipment was good for something after all.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> And taunting the skip? That was brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Instinct is what that was. <em>[points at Agent Vance]</em> <em>You're</em> the one who came up with the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> <em>[blushing]</em> Oh, it wasn't that great…</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Are you kidding? I <em>never</em> could've stopped that freak without your book idea. <em>[lightly punches Agent Vance's shoulder]</em> I'd say this one was a <em>team effort.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Vance smiles, then looks at Commander Maxwell's face. Her smile vanishes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> Um, Max? You <em>might</em> wanna look in that visor right about now…</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> If you say so, Sadie. <em>[puts helmet visor in front of face]</em> Is there something on my- <em>[gasps]</em> MY HAIR!</p>
<p><em>Commander Maxwell stares at his bald reflection.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> Your face, too. <em>[scratching back of neck]</em> The residue from that spell added a decade or so, if I had to guess.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> This is awful!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Vance:</strong> It could be worse, Max. <em>[snickers]</em> You could be sporting a comb-over, for instance.</p>
<p><em>Commander Maxwell glares at Agent Vance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> My wife's gonna kill me…</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Commander Maxwell requested a meeting with Director Novens following the incidents of the prior SCP-7907-A event.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Written Transcript]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Greetings, Commander Maxwell, and my deepest condolences for the loss of your agents.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> They were good men… <em>[pauses]</em> and women.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> That they were. <em>[sighs]</em> I must also apologize for the Foundation's oversight.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> <em>Oversight?</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> It seems the late agent Vance wasn't entirely <em>forthcoming</em> about her daughter's physical impairment when filling out the MTF application forms. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience of working with a crippled-</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> She's not <em>crippled,</em> Emery. <em>[smiles]</em> She's the best damn rookie I've ever met.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> <em>[raises eyebrow]</em> I see. And you believe this in spite of her insubordination?</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Yeah. <em>[pauses]</em> I do.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> I'll inform the disciplinary board in that case. They'll be happy to hear your testimony, if this young woman really <em>is</em> as exceptional as you say.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> There's one other thing…</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Yes? Whatever you need, we can take care-</p>
<p><em>Commander Maxwell hands a sheet of paper to Dr. Novens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Ah. <em>[pauses]</em> I see…</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Millie threw a fit when I came home looking like… <em>[points at face]</em> <em>this,</em> and to be honest I don't blame her. This last mission nearly got me killed, and it took a decade off my life at least.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> You can't just-</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> -Quit? Not without thirty years of service or a special exemption, I know. <em>[points at uniform]</em> I've been wearing this since the 60s, Emery; there's your twenty years. And up here? <em>[points at face]</em> There's the other ten.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> The Foundation thanks you for your service… <em>[pauses]</em> and sacrifices. Still, a man of your talents would be wasted working in ordinary society. <em>[places sheet on the table]</em> Your keen mind, selfless spirit, direct demeanor-</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> Enough with the flattery, Emery. Just get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> <em>[leans forward]</em> A little birdie told me there's a vacant office in site thirty-four…</p>
<p><strong>Commander Maxwell:</strong> <em>[grabs sheet from table]</em> What's the position?</p>
<p><strong>Director Novens:</strong> Site Direc-</p>
<p><em>Commander Maxwell rips the sheet in half.</em></p>
