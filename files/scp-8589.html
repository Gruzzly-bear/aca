            <h1>SCP-8589</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8589</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8589 is to be collected and stored in a windowless containment chamber at Site-19. 115.2m<sup>3</sup> of SCP-8589 has been collected at time of writing.</p>
<p>Whenever SCP-8589 is discovered to be in use at a Foundation or civilian facility, appropriate measures are to be taken to replace it, and the recovered material is to be forged into bars and transported to the aforementioned containment chamber. An altered version of this article has been written and is to be provided to civilian persons who question the necessity of its recovery. If SCP-8589 is not provided voluntarily at this point, MTF-Ptah is to be mobilized for its recovery.</p>
<p>Investigation into civilian usage of SCP-8589 is to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8589 refers to approximately 1.5 tons of stainless steel, originally collected from a naturally occurring deposit in Dixie Valley, Nevada. The material is of considerably substandard quality, consisting primarily of tin (43.6%), aluminum (22.5%), and chromium (10.7%), with trace amounts of carbon, iron, gallium, hafnium, lead, platinum, iridium, silicon and titanium. SCP-8589 is considered stainless steel only by technicality as it lacks the material's usual durability due to its unrefined composition.</p>
<p>SCP-8589 emits a Class-III memetic hazard which causes observers to believe that it is the ideal material to use in any scenario that would require a metallic substance. Affected individuals will believe that the material possesses qualities which it does not possess, such as advanced durability, Hume reduction, reality-anchoring properties, etc. Further memetic properties have arisen but are inconsistent, such as causing persons to incorrectly determine its composition, incorrectly recount its origin or how they came into possession of the substance, or incorrectly identify the mass, volume, density, melting and/or boiling transition point, hardness, etc. These occur despite measurement instruments returning correct readings. See research documents for a complete list of false properties.</p>
<p>SCP-8589 was initially discovered on July 25th, 2008. After initial testing was completed, researchers concluded (at the time) that SCP-8589 was a more potent variant of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-148" target="_blank">SCP-148</a>, having the capability to suppress or block any extrasensory or mind-altering anomalous effect, or, in some research, suppress <em>any</em> anomalous effect.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> In response to an email regarding how best to proceed in light of this false discovery, O5-5 sent the following to research lead Dr. Harrah:</p>

<td>An experimental remote-controlled telepath robot is utilized to test the veracity of SCP-8589. The hypothesis is that SCP-8589 will block telepathic messages sent to on-site Class D personnel. As the signal-blocking insulation in <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079" target="_blank">SCP-079’s</a> containment unit has been replaced with SCP-8589, SCP-079 covertly hijacks inbound transmissions to the telepath and issues commands to telepathically convince Dr. Maynard and Security Agent Skinner that they are Chaos Insurgency agents operating with the intent to grant SCP-079 access to facility operations. This results in the most severe containment breach currently on record. 225 personnel are killed.</td>

<p>Following the catastrophic containment breach on August 10th, 2013, a Foundation-wide halt on containment studies was implemented pending an investigation into the cause of the breach. Advancements in memetic inoculation practices and technology developed for this investigation allowed for the discovery of the actual anomalous nature of SCP-8589 on December 13th, 2013. The following order was received by primary Foundation containment specialists on December 15th, 2013, following further research and O5 deliberation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>O5 Council Direct Communication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">December 15th, 2013</p>
<p>Recent developments with regards to SCP-8589 have startled us greatly, as we imagine it must have many of you. However, there is relief in knowing that we have identified the cause to our problems.</p>
<p>The unfortunate nature of humans is that humans are fallible. The unfortunate nature of the Foundation is that we are staffed by fallible humans. We are all victims to the fatal flaw of <em>being flawed.</em></p>
<p>The good news is that once you have identified the source of a problem, you can finally begin to fix it. All facilities are to be searched for the usage of SCP-8589 in their construction and are to be appropriately modified for its removal, followed by an update to any relevant anomaly's special containment procedures to reflect this alteration, where necessary.</p>
<p>Check containment procedure update logs for a list of affected containment units. Note that this list is likely very incomplete.</p>
<p>This is the end of an era.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-The O5 Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To date, misunderstandings regarding the nature of SCP-8589 are thought to have resulted in 58 containment breaches and 346 casualties.</p>
