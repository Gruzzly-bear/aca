<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-5227 was an anomalous weather formation centered around Antuco, an abandoned Chilean village, and lasted from June 8th to 10th, 1976. SCP-5227 manifested as a fog descending on Antuco and completely covered the village, drastically reducing visibility and communications. The anomaly was originally identified as such due to its observational anomaly and rapid formation— weather sensors at Facility 57, 23km from Antuco, depicted SCP-5227 as a static blur during its three-minute formation (1:07AM - 1:10AM local time). Attempts to hail the Foundation observation post in Antuco through radio resulted in failure. Further testing confirmed SCP-5227 had the anomalous capability to block radio transmissions.</p>
<p>A 3-man expedition from MTF PI-3 "Garcas Oligarcas" was planned to ascertain the status of Antuco. Several hours before departure, another agent was added to the expedition. The thick forest surrounding Antuco and the exceedingly low visibility made vehicular and aerial travel infeasible. The team departed Facility 57 on foot at T+6 hours.</p>

<p><em>[Team is hiking through the jungle. SCIPIONI and GARLÉS take the lead, while PETROCCHI and CASEROS bring up the rear.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> He wasn't pleased with that, no sir. But it was really his fault, if you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> How's that?</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> If he didn't want me to sleep with his wife, he should've sold me the damn car!</p>
<p><em>[All laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> But I did, and so he had me demoted to field duty. It's not the worst job in the world, though. Certainly keeps you in shape.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> All that form-filling really burns calories, eh?</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Alright, <em>you</em> can fill the forms out when we get back. No? That's what I thought, stupid.</p>
<p><em>[Laughter, followed by silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What's your story, Damian?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Oh, me? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> We've never seen you around Fifty-seven before.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Oh, yes. I'm a transfer.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> From?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Ah, Thirty-two. It's up in Panamá.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Oh, I have a friend up there. Do you know a Captain Carlós?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Uh, no, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> How long've you been at Fifty-seven?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Only a few days.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Whoof, no time to even settle in. Well, no problem, you'll be able to settle in fine when we get back. The boys in Antuco are probably just wondering why they're not getting the baseball on the radio anymore!</p>
<p><em>[Laughter, followed by silence. The team continue slashing through the jungle, occasionally using compasses and maps to guide them, when someone loudly falls into the brush.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Shit!</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> <em>[Laughing]</em> Get off the ground, dumbass.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Oh no, I was planning on bunking here for the night. Make yourself useful and give me a hand.</p>
<p><em>[Grunting.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Great, now I get to hike covered in mud. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Your fault for slipping. The sun's not even down yet.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Forget the sun, I can't see a goddamn thing through this goddamn fog. It feels like the <em>air</em> is pissing.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Wonderful image, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I suppose we're nearing Antuco, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Who has the map? Pedro?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Ah, we're certainly closer, but there's still a ways to go. It's hard to get an exact estimate, the fog makes keeping distance hard.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I see. But if the fog is getting thicker… we must be going the right way.</p>

<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Man, I feel bad for the poor suckers assigned to that outpost. For all they know, the war's kicked up again.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> All the more reason to get to them faster.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> I couldn't handle that.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Handle what?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> That kind of isolation, man. Two guys in the middle of a goddamn ghost town, and only a radio for company. Shit, not even the radio now. I'm a talkative guy, but-</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> You're telling me.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> - <em>but</em> what if the partner is a prick or something? Or something like this happens and you're cut off from damn near everything? Too much risk involved for me, no sir.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> It's an observation post, right?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Security post, actually.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> For Fifty-seven? It's in the middle of the mountain, there's no way to get to it without getting on every camera they have hidden on the path.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Better safe than sorry. It's a good place for an installation, though. Antuco's been abandoned since before I was born.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Beats me. It was barely ever big enough to get on any maps, and then over a few months all the people just seem to have moved away. And then we put the observation post there and it's been quiet ever since.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Oh.</p>

<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Whoever decided the MRE menus should be fed to the lizard.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> He'd probably taste better than these pieces of shit.</p>
<p><em>[Both laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Food is food.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Sure, but not all food is created equal. I'd throw a hundred of these plastic trash-bags away for one hot choripán right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Do you ever think about anything besides food?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Yes. Sometimes I think about sex.</p>
<p><em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Hey, has anyone seen my necklace?</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Little silver cross necklace. I had it on when we set out.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Maybe you dropped it?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Off my neck?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Well, maybe it got snagged on a branch. Was it important?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> I didn't know you were religious, Pedro.</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> I- I'm not, really. It's complicated.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Oh. Alright. Maybe we'll find it on our way back? For now, let's get into bed — we're setting out real early tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> There, you can see the rooftops. We're nearly there now.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Speak for yourself, this fog is ruining my visibility. Could be a village or an army, I can't make it out.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I see it. It can't be more than an hour from here if we keep the pace.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Alright. Let's not waste any time.</p>
<p><em>[They continue through the brush. Several minutes pass.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Hey, Alejandro?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Can I ask a weird question?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Uh, okay?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Um… not really? I don't know, it's complicated. I don't go to church, but I like to think that there's something up there looking out for us. Y'know?</p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Yeah, I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> You're not turning into a Bible thumper, are you? <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CASEROS:</strong> Heh, yeah. I don't know. Just curious.</p>

<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> We don't know what's out here.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Look, I understand the first-mission shivers, but this is as tame as it gets. This village has been abandoned since the war started. I guarantee you this is just some failure of the sen-</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> No. No, greenhorn is right. We don't have any intel, we need to be cautious. Overconfidence kills. Everyone, quiet.</p>

<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> I've known Pedro for years. That wasn't him.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> He was compromised.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> By what?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Okay, look, I don't know what happened to him, but the last thing he said was about the center of the town. He said that was where the fog was coming from. That's where we're going.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What did you say to me, soldier?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> We're not going to the center of town. We're going to the observation post on the edge, seeing if anyone is alive, and then we're going back.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> I'm your commanding officer and you just killed one of my men. You're treading on thin ice.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What?</p>

<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I'm taking command of this mission effective immediately.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Your new commanding officer. Captain Scipioni, we will be progressing to the observation post at the edge of town. That's an order.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What's at the center?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> That's classified.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Is the fog dangerous?</p>

<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What's the source of it?</p>

<p><em>[GARLÉS enters a small mud and wood hut. The one-room building contains a bunk bed, two flipped chairs, several steel lockers, and a table covered in defunct communication equipment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Get in.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What the hell is going on? How do you have Level-5 Clearance?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> I'm on your side, I swear. But for now, we need to get away from that fog. You saw what it did to Pedro.</p>
<p><em>[GARLÉS shuts the door once all three have entered. He moves to the table, inspecting the equipment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Can you explain what the fuck is going on here, Damian?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> With all due respect, Captain, that's classified. All you need to know is that people much higher up than you have very specific instructions about what is going to happen here. You are obligated to help me stop this mess.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> We saw the fog's source, it was coming from the center of town. Why are we all the way out here?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> This is the best spot to get a signal out. A minor weakness in the anomaly's structural integrity, exploited using paratechnology.</p>
<p><em>[GARLÉS reaches into his bag and pulls out a small spherical device with a blue light.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> What is that?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> It is a radio signaller, amplified using thamaturgy. Just enough to punch through SCP-5227.</p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> Who are you signalling to?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Fifty-seven. More specifically to an air squadron stationed there on standby. Once they get the signal, they'll give us a small delay and then bomb this hellhole to kingdom come.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Why? What are you trying to destroy?</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> That's classified.</p>
<p><em>[GARLÉS turns away to the table to begin setting up the device.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Okay. All I know is that suddenly the greenhorn is claiming to be a Level 5 secret agent, one of my team members is dead in the dust by your hand, you won't let us even investigate what's causing this. Our job. I don't know <em>who</em> you are, but</p>

<p><em>[Gunshot. GARLÉS' calf spurts blood and he crashes to the floor, dropping the device.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> FUCK!</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> Sorry… sir, but you've killed a Foundation operator and are hindering the proper investigation of the anomaly. I am hereby relieving you of command. We're finding out what's causing this. The wound's not lethal, and there's a first aid kit in the locker.</p>
<p><em>[PETROCCHI advances and takes the transmitter from the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> And we're taking this.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> You… you two don't know what you're doing. You're going to ruin everything. I'm ordering you to stop-</p>

I'm not sure how I feel about this whole project, friend. I just don't know how to be comfortable with what we're doing. I'm a religious man, you know that. It's hard to be a man of God in this Foundation, but I try. I pray for my soul, and everyone else's. This is… blasphemous.</p>
<p>What they're asking us to do — it's not a question of technology. We have the technology, we've had it since we took it from the Axis after the armistice. But we've never needed it. I understand that the Foundation is faced with containing more and more, for lack of a better word, theological threats. But we have to ask ourselves if fighting fire with fire is a good idea. Just because we have to contain gods doesn't mean we need our own.</p>

Sir, with all due respect, you can't do this. I understood that our prototype hasn't been exactly up to shot but this is bleeding edge paratechnology. No one quite understands what we're working with, stumbles are inevitable. And, frankly, the fact that we've created a prototype at all is a testament to the skill of the team.</p>
<p>There is simply far too much invested into this to cancel now. The facility would have to be completely razed, and we just don't know what that would do to the prototype. It's — we believe it's at an infantile stage of development, and a disturbance in its environment could be disastrous. It's not like disposal is an option. With all due respect, sir, you've let the genie out of the bottle. Burying it is not a solution.</p>

In a few seconds, the majority of the fog has been removed and the facility is visible in its whole. Pipes and computer displays cover the walls, focusing in the center of the room around a large industrial vat set into the floor.

<p><strong>PETROCCHI:</strong> No, really. I don't believe in God, but I know that you don't play with things you don't understand. People stationed at this outpost have the highest turnover rate in the sector. I always thought it was because of the isolation, but no, it's because you buried a fucking monster underneath them! How many people have ended up like Pedro?!</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Look. I'm sorry about Pedro, I am. He was a casualty, and it was my fault. But I didn't make the thing that did that to him.</p>

You cannot weaponize a tool that you're expecting to be stabbed in the back with! And you sure as hell can't get rid of it this easy.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> For all we know it's not even a fucking god. Just some fucked up <em>thing</em> that we brewed in a vat and decided to deify.</p>
<p><strong>SCIPIONI:</strong> It doesn't matter if it's actually a god or not. You- the entire Council fears this thing like a god. It doesn't matter what it is, it might as well be a god. You all gave it this kind of power. You can't control what it does with it anymore. Symbols have power, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>GARLÉS:</strong> Then what the fuck are we supposed to do? Just not be scared of it?</p>

The chain breaks, dropping the cross into the vat where it begins sinking. An infantile screeching rings out as the bombs suspended in the sky begin detonating one by one.

<p>Following the termination of the camera feed, all bombs suspended in the air above Antuco simultaneously detonated at low altitude, out of range of aircraft. The exterior facade of Satellite Facility 57-Beta collapsed, and ground troops conducted an excavation operation to breach into the building.</p>
<p>The body of Supervisory Agent Damián Garlés was discovered; the cause of death was determined to have been respiration of the vat amniotic fluid. The vat itself was completely drained. Captain Valentino Scipioni was found at the bottom in a state of shock, sitting next to an unidentified desiccated corpse crushed by the large metal cross.
