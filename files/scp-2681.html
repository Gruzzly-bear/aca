            <h1>SCP-2681</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2681</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No anomalous animals are to be contained at Site-██.</p>
<p>SCP-2681 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. SCP-2681 may only be removed from its cell by level 2 personnel or higher. The subject's basic needs are to be maintained at all times to prevent the compulsion of SCP-2681-1 instances.</p>
<p>Medical prescriptions for SCP-2681 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramelteon</li>
<li>Fluoxetine</li>
<li>Clonazepam</li>
</ul>
<p>Any instances of SCP-2681-1 that attempt to enter the facility are to be sedated immediately and released.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2681 is an 18 year-old human male whose emotional state, thoughts, and needs compel the behavior of nonhuman animals<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> (thereafter referred to as instances of SCP-2681-1) within a 2 kilometer radius. This results in compelled animals attempting to meet the desires and needs of SCP-2681.</p>
<p>SCP-2681 cannot control its compulsion effect. Consequences have ranged from minor nuisances to fatalities. Despite acting on the subject's desires, thoughts, and needs, instances of SCP-2681-1 have not been recorded to comply with SCP-2681's suicidal or self-harming desires.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2681-1: Discovery</strong></p>
<p>SCP-2681 was discovered following an incident at a ███████, Ontario mental health facility in which the subject's anomalous properties triggered while outside shortly after being processed. The object was referred to said mental health facility upon both parents expiring in front of him 2 hours prior, having been mauled by dogs while walking.</p>
<p>The following is an attached log of the event in which SCP-2681 was recovered, recorded via the facility's security cameras.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>[SCP-2681 and other patients are escorted outside by an orderly. The entire time, SCP-2681 is visibly distraught and attempts to resist following orders. It is eventually shoved outside by the orderly, and the door is shut behind it.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-2681 bangs on the door as all the other patients in the courtyard stare at it. SCP-2681 hyperventilates, then paces around the courtyard.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The orderly remains near the door, appearing to speak to SCP-2681.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Pigeons, owls, and hawks begin flying into the courtyard, smashing into the door and swooping overhead the other patients. According to eye witnesses, who were later amnesticized, SCP-2681 shouted apologies as it attempted to stop the SCP-2681-1 instances from flying into the door.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Facility staff contact emergency services.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Rats, raccoons, and possums climb over and under the fence and begin assailing the door, which is starting to show cracks.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Cats, dogs, foxes, and other larger mammals charge the fence, attempting to break through. A few cats break through, and begin rubbing themselves up against SCP-2681 while appearing to hiss at the orderly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[One of the windows of the facility is opened, and a swallow flies in. It flies down the hallway and toward the orderly, attacking him with pecks and scratches. He catches it and wrings its neck.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The Foundation picks up on the possibly anomalous disturbance and dispatches covert agents to contain SCP-2681 and all the affected SCP-2681-1 instances.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Multiple SCP-2681-1 instances break down the gate, and consequently, the glass door, to maul the orderly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[All the animals within the area of SCP-2681's effect have been already affected, so no additional SCP-2681-1 instances are believed to have been created. The orderly which SCP-2681 had become upset with was mauled by multiple dogs, cats, and foxes following the Foundation's arrival to the facility, resulting in his death.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The SCP-2681-1 instances continue attacking the corpse of the orderly while SCP-2681 continues to scream and weep. Foundation agents enter the facility and begin taking statements from witnesses. SCP-2681 immediately volunteers itself as the cause of this event. Foundation agents amnesticize civilians and extract SCP-2681.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-2681-1 instances are tranquilized and released.]</em></p>

<strong>Addendum 2681-2: Intake</strong><br/>
<br/>
SCP-2681 was questioned upon arrival at Site-██ to confirm its history and anomalous properties. The following is an attached log of the relevant interview.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Okay, we are now r—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> It's all my fault. I know it's my fault. First my parents, now this guy… I just… I wish I was never born. I wish they would just kill me. My entire life it's been like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Well, that gets some questions out of the way. You said your whole life has been like this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> My parents said they barely had any time to even hold me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> So ever since you were born, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> My first memory is of a pack of dogs attacking my dad because I was mad at him for yelling at me. My mom said that when I cried as a baby, birds would crash through the windows trying to shove worms down my throat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> What measures did they take to protect you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> They moved from out in Saskatchewan to inner city ███████ in a pet-free apartment building to get away from all the dangerous animals. Or at least as many of them as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> That sounds like an impossible task.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> You don't say.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> So what was your childhood like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Like I said, rough. A lot of animals accosting my family and I. When I was old enough to start school my parents fought about whether or not to send me. They chose to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed to go out. I wasn't allowed to make friends. Every day I would sit in my room and watch as the birds crashed into my window. Do you know how many times we had to replace the glass in the last five years?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Gallix shakes his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Twenty times.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I empathize. Isolation like that sounds awfu—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> It <em>was</em> awful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> So what happened leading up to all this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> My parents they… they couldn't decide what to do with me. I just turned eighteen two days ago, and they kept saying that I couldn't go away for college or even find a job with my… let's call it a condition. Anyway, they were arguing about what to do with me. Nôhtâwiy wanted us to go back to Saskatchewan; he thought that this condition was a curse placed on our family by someone and we had to go sort it out. Nikâwiy, she thought we should stay in ███████ since we had avoided most of the troubles.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Eighteen, huh? Wow. I'm surprised we didn't pick up on you sooner.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> What are you people, anyway, the Men in Black? Warehouse 13?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I'll answer that later. Please go on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Fine. As I was saying, we had avoided most troubles. But then… the rats came. It turned out that one of our neighbors had been a hoarder. He died, and when they found him, he was half-eaten by rats that all scurried out of his apartment and into ours. Because of course my condition attracted them. Anyway, we couldn't get rid of them. So we had to call the exterminator. And that meant having to leave the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> And from there, I assume you got frustrated with your parents while out and about town?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Yeah. For not even asking me what I thought, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I can see how feeling like you have no agency in your own life can be frustrating. Look, we are going to do our best to keep you comfortable down here. You're roughly 3 kilometers underground here, so no animal that isn't here on purpose can get to you. But we're going to have to run some tests.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> You know, they were pretty shit parents, but given the circumstances, I feel like they tried.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I think so too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> By the way, that thing your guys did to the people at the looney bin… The forget-me-juice. Any chance I could get some of that? I'd rather not remember today if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I'll put in a request.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Hiy hiy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: Amnestic treatment for SCP-2681 was approved on the condition it agreed to several tests to log its properties.</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 2681-3: Testing</strong></p>
<p>SCP-2681 was brought to a controlled setting within a bullet-proof enclosure.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Need:</strong> Hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Food was withheld from subject for 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Test Number:</strong> 01</p>
<p><strong>Animals used:</strong> A common rat (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and a common mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The rat killed the mouse and placed its corpse next to SCP-2681. Notably, the mouse did not resist and allowed itself to be killed.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Need:</strong> Hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Food was withheld from subject for 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Test Number:</strong> 03</p>
<p><strong>Animal used:</strong> A Male coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-2681-1 proceeded to gnaw off its own left hind leg and present it to SCP-2681.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Need:</strong> Safety.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-2681 is to be shot with rubber bullets every 10 seconds in total of ten times through small entry holes through the enclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Test Number:</strong> 16</p>
<p><strong>Animal used:</strong> A male green anaconda (<em>Eunectes</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-2681-1 quickly wrapped itself around SCP-2681 before the shots were fired, using itself to defend SCP-2681's torso, legs, and face. SCP-2681-1 was later sedated to prevent a possible attack on personnel.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Emotion:</strong> Anger.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Class D Personnel are to enter the enclosure and antagonize SCP-2681.</p>
<p><strong>Test Number:</strong> 25</p>
<p><strong>Animal used:</strong> A Male Tibetan mastiff (<em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> D-50134 shouted abusive comments towards SCP-2681 for fifteen seconds, but abruptly stopped after SCP-2681-1 snarled and showed its teeth. D-50134 was instructed to keep antagonizing SCP-2681 or he would be returned to general prison population without having his sentence reduced. D-50134 reluctantly continued shouting abusive comments towards SCP-2681 for six seconds until attacked by SCP-2681-1. SCP-2681-1 was sedated to prevent further aggression.</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
<strong>Addendum 2681-4: Post-Testing Interview</strong><br/>
<br/>
SCP-2681 was interviewed following testing. Attached below is a log of said interview.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> You promised me the forget-me-juice. Where the fuck is it? And by the way, you people are fucked up. You killed those animals for nothing. And then you made that wolf? Or a coyote? Whatever. You made it <em>maim</em> itself just fora lark? You people are evil. I'd rather you just kill me, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Look, I'm sorry those tests weren't pleasant, but this is the nature of my job.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Fuck off. I don't even like animals and I feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> So you don't like animals? Interesting. Can you tell me a little about that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Fuck off. I'm not about to be psychoanalyzed by <em>Men in Black</em> Patrick Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I just wish to understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> At what cost?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> Will you cooperate if I get you the amnestics?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Is that what you call that thing? I don't know. I'm at your mercy here. Like some kind of fucking pet dog. Ironic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> You don't have to look at it like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Then how do I look at it? My life is in your hands. I have even less autonomy now than I did before. I may as well be a slave. A funny little slave that makes animals kill you. But now that I'm buried so deep underground, I guess only the prairie dogs can find me. Congratulations. You win. They won't kill me, and all the edges have been so thoroughly sanded off this place I can't kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gallix:</strong> I'm sorry you feel this way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2681:</strong> Are you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: SCP-2681 was prescribed anti-depressants and sleeping aids to keep it in a state of torpor until further research may be conducted. Additionally, the object was administered Class-A Amnestics following this.</em></p>
