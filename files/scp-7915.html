<p>SCP-7915 on a Tenor Saxophone Stand.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7915 is kept within a non-anomalous tenor saxophone case and stored in a Secure Containment Locker in Site-115. SCP-7915 must be cleaned every six months to keep it in a playable state. SCP-7915 must be serviced at "Symphonic's Cleaning &amp; Polishing" once a year to prevent it from falling into disrepair.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><em>"Symphonic's Cleaning &amp; Polishing: Instrument Repair Shop"</em> is a Foundation-owned instrument repair shop located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shipping of SCP-7915 is handled by <em>"Stamps, Carriers, and Parcels",</em> another Foundation-owned shipping company.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7915 is a ritualistic instrument, currently taking the form of a tenor saxophone. When used at night by a subject, regardless of experience with the instrument, they will perform a series of disconnected melodies. During this session, the Moon, regardless of location or visibility, will appear to move closer to the Earth.</p>
<p>The physical distance between the Earth and Moon will not change, however, the local area around SCP-7915 will experience the gravitational effects of the approaching Moon.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Observed to affect a radius of up to twenty miles.</span></p>
<p>As the subject plays SCP-7915, other instruments are heard, accompanying SCP-7915. At the end of every SCP-7915 event, subjects will play the same melodic phrase, designated as SCP-7915-A. As SCP-7915-A is played, the subject will levitate towards the Moon until they've disappeared from sight. Once the subject disappears, the Moon will appear to return to its original state, and SCP-7915 will levitate down to the ground with a note attached to its bell:</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you, my star.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love you.</p>
</div>
<p>All subjects that have disappeared are declared missing, as no trace of them has been found on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>No memetic effects or compulsory effects were found during the testing of SCP-7915. In the event a subject stops playing SCP-7915, the Moon will return to its original position and SCP-7915 will not be able to initiate another SCP-7915 event for three days. During this period, subjects will lack the previous knowledge and ability to play SCP-7915, even with prior experience.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Addendum 7915.1:</strong> SCP-7915-A</p>
<hr/>
<p>After a thorough analysis, SCP-7915-A exhibits no memetic or cognitohazardous properties and has been deemed safe for listening. The following recording was played on a non-anomalous tenor saxophone, supplied by Jr. Researcher Lennings.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Records of SCP-7915 have been found in Greek and Roman mythology as a played instrument in constant reference to the goddess of the Moon, Selene, and Luna respectively.</p>
<p>These records highlight an association between a mortal being and the Moon, with the primary form of contact surrounding a musical display of some sort. The relationship between the mortal and the Moon is characterized by a sense of loneliness and isolation.</p>
<p>Due to conflicting records and the inability to confirm the validity of these events, it is impossible to create a coherent timeline of SCP-7915's location throughout human history. It was theorized that SCP-7915 had the ability to alter its structure and relocate itself, or shift its anomalous properties to another instrument. However, after extensive testing, no additional properties were found in SCP-7915 that match these predictions.</p>
<p>An abridged record of SCP-7915's appearances throughout documented history has been attached below:<br/></p>

He steals a lyre from his father's house and climbs the tallest hill. His father, awakened by the noise, wakes up to witness Acheron using the lyre, believed to be SCP-7915, to serenade a marriage proposal to Selene.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Addendum 7915.3:</strong> Discovery</p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-7915 was discovered in the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, belonging to the missing Stella Turner, an intern who had worked there for the past year. This was paired with reports from several civilians and news networks on the abnormal size and perceived approach of the full moon two nights before.</p>
<p>Camera footage and civilian reports place Stella Turner on the museum's rooftop with SCP-7915. An audio journal was discovered along with SCP-7915 and was taken by undercover Foundation agents embedded in the NYPD.</p>
<p>Transcriptions of the audio logs are appended below:</p>

<p><strong>Stella:</strong> Currently in college to be an astrophysicist. Still getting used to everything, but it's going well enough.</p>

<p><strong>Stella:</strong> I really want to try out one of the telescopes. I haven't actually ever seen the stars, being in NYC and all, so I want my first time to be special. Just looking at the stars, with no one else around.</p>

<p><em>(Stella takes several deep breaths to calm herself. After about fifteen seconds, she continues.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> So I was passing by this old music shop, and in the display, there was a saxophone, like the kind I used to play back in high school. I went in, bought it, and thought I'd relearn how to play it. So there I am, playing Careless Whisper, classic stuff, but when I go to bed, it's like, ethereal.</p>
<p><em>(Several short, shallow breaths are heard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> I get it almost every night now, but there's this lady, silky robes, kind of a blue crystal ball for a head and it leads me out in the middle of the night to the top of a massive hill, and its head turns into the Moon, which is massive by the way, it's taking up about half of the sky right now, and it's calling to me.</p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> And, I don't know, the glow she gives off, it's calming. Not like the sun, but like you're being cradled or cuddled. And it's just… so perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> I started doing research on the Moon after that, and now my room is plastered with posters of Selene from Hot Topic. It's- it's so…</p>
<p><em>(Stella takes a long, deep breath. She continues.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> She's beautiful. (pause) Everything she does is just full of elegance and grace, and it's like I can't even compare. Sometimes, in the middle of the day, I find myself wishing for her, and- it should be embarrassing but it isn't. I just need to tell someone this or I feel like I'll explode.</p>

<p><em>(Silence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Stella:</strong> This Saturday. There's going to be a full moon. I've stolen Dr. Keppler's keys and copied them, so I can get onto the roof when no one else is around. I'm taking the saxophone, she wants me to play a song. A serenade, a serene serenade for Selene.</p>
