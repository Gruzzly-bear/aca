            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5530</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The island of North Uist is to be monitored for any anomalous activity unassociated with known SCP-5530 instances. Any newly discovered instances will be assessed for containment on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>Given the nature of known, active instances, no further containment has been deemed necessary at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5530 is a collection of charms made by the islanders of North Uist, Outer Hebrides, which are traditionally gifted to mark major life milestones. Instances are constructed from a selection of plants and other materials native to the region. Evidence suggests that several hundred more SCP-5530 instances have existed in the past and that local production has been ongoing for at least 500 years. Although the tradition of making and gifting charms has continued through to the present day, those produced from 1999 onwards have exhibited no anomalous properties to date. 67 known SCP-5530 instances are currently active.</p>
<p>The anomalous effects of SCP-5530 are triggered when gifted to an individual or family and will continue until that instance is destroyed. Anomalous effects vary but typically relate directly to the associated life event.</p>
<p>Given that the majority of North Uist inhabitants believe that accounts of SCP-5530's anomalous abilities are local folktales, investigations have been carried out covertly. Initial researchers were instructed to pose as historians researching local traditions for an upcoming publication.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>SCP-5530-4</strong></p>

<br/>
SCP-5530-4 was gifted to Mr. Euan Cochrane in 1742 to celebrate the contruction of his new farm. Although the site was abandoned by the Cochrane family in the early 19th century, the buildings show no sign of decay. For comparison, the surrounding cottages - abandoned in 1945 and 1962 respectively - are in an advanced state of disarray. SCP-5530-4 currently hangs inside the building's main entrance (see photographic log).</div>

<p><strong>SCP-5530-12 (neutralised)</strong></p>

<br/>
SCP-5530-12 was gifted to Mrs. Elsie Gilreath at her birth in 1872. As of 2019, Mrs. Gilreath had only received medical care during the birth of her 2 sons<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and had shown no signs of sickness or infirmity. In September 2019, Mrs. Gilreath's home - along with SCP-5530-12 - was destroyed in an accidental fire. Whilst Mrs. Gilreath was not present at the time and suffered no injuries, she was admitted to the Western Isles hospital the same day and passed away that evening aged 147. It was this well-documented and anomalous life span which first drew the Foundation's attention to the area.
<p>Documentation relating to Mrs. Gilreath's birth has now been altered to give a birthdate of 1925. Where necessary, her true birthdate has been marked as a clerical error.</p>

<strong>SCP-5530 - Interview #31</strong>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Moore<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Ian and Senga Abernethy</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Ian and Senga Abernethy were gifted SCP-5530-32 in 1984 to mark the birth of their first baby. The Abernethys now have 16 more children, all male.</p>

<br/>
<strong>[Begin Log]</strong>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> I'd love to hear about where your charm came from - could we talk about that?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Abernethy:</strong> Well -</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Abernethy:</strong> It was '84 when we had our Dod. He was a fine, strong lad even then. Bawled the house down the second we got him home. Jean came rushing right over with the charm, and meals to last us a week. Said she'd sat up all night putting it together. She's a real saint is Jean, always helping out with the lads. She's always loved kiddies though she never had her own.</p>
<p>It was twins we had next - and again after that. Ian had the snip done back in '89, but it never took. By the time we had Rob, I was making him sleep in the spare room. But he's a fine-looking man, my Ian, even with a few patches of silver on him.</p>
<p><em>[Mrs. Abernethy laughs and gently punches Mr. Abernethy's shoulder.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Abernethy:</strong> We didn't make it to the hospital for Lesley and Lyall. Course, we had the experience by that time. Both lads were healthy but loud. They're all so bloody loud, even when they're little 'uns!</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Abernethy nods in agreement.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Abernethy:</strong> It was maybe 3 weeks after I pitched the bloody charm into the fireplace. <em>Wish you many more</em> indeed!</p>
<p>Those two were our last - and touch wood it'll stay that way. They're good lads all, but a woman can only handle so many men around the place.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5530-41</strong></p>

<br/>
<strong>SCP-5530 - Interview #54</strong>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Moore<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Gracie Lorimer<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Unique amongst active instances, SCP-5530-41 is recorded to have had a negative effect on its recipient. It was given to Ms. Lorimer as a wedding gift in celebration of her first marriage.</p>

<br/>
<strong>[Begin Log]</strong>
<p><strong>Ms. Lorimer:</strong> So they've sent you up here to bother "The Merry Widow of Uist", have they? What are you, from some gossip magazine?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> No, Ms. Lorimer, not at all. We're researching the local grass charms in this area and we've heard you used to have one. Would you mind telling us about it?</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Lorimer:</strong> For a museum is it? Well, that's different. It all started with my first marriage, then. Fynn was furious when he heard I'd be marrying Gillie. He came marching right over here demanding to see me, the daft bastard. Two years since we'd courted and he expected me to be waiting for him? I told him to go boil his head o' course.</p>
<p><em>[Ms. Lorimer laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Ms. Lorimer:</strong> On the morning of the wedding, he was back here. All apologies, he was then. Said he'd made me a little charm to wish me a happy marriage, but his face was thunder. He gave it me and off he marched before I could utter a word of thanks back at him.</p>
<p>The wedding was beautiful but the marriage… we didn't make it to the morning after before we started fighting. He was a changed man the second we stepped out of that bloody church. Did my nut in from then 'til I left him three months later.</p>
<p><em>[Ms. Lorimer smiles briefly, then sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Ms. Lorimer:</strong> I married Fynn next. It was a year or two after and he'd give me no peace til I agreed to it. He wasn't a bad man, but he wasn't a good man either. Not a year later, he left the island and never came back. Only sound I've heard from him since was the divorce papers on my doormat.</p>
<p>After that - well I'm sure you can ask anyone and you'll hear all about it. Married five men and not a one of them kept her. I'd move away, but why should I? I was born here and I'll die here. Alone. Five tries at love is more than plenty.</p>
<p>You'll be wanting to see the charm, I reckon? I don't know why I kept it all this time, the damn thing never brought an ounce of luck to anyone. For all I care you can bloody have it.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Moore<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Elliot Weems</p>

<br/>
<strong>[Begin Log]</strong>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> Mr. Weems, we've been told you're a local expert on -</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Weems:</strong> Aye, I know who you are and why you're here. Small island, isn't it? Word gets around and I knew you'd be calling by. Back in my day, we used to make an effort for a nice occasion. I told them if you want to make a charm you've got to get your seamat from out on the island. But do they listen? No! The cheeky sods tell me my bum's out the windae! Daft, drunk old Elliot Weems spouting off nonsense… and maybe I am, but what of it?</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Weems chuckles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Weems:</strong> The sheep swim out and eat any good stuff these days - and what do bloody sheepies have to wish for but more of the grass and less of the thunder? Do you think sheepies make wishes, Mister? Well if they do then good luck to them is all I'm saying. Now me, I'd wish for another beer, thank you kindly, if you're buying?</p>
<p>When we're finished, then. You'll be wanting to show your appreciation.</p>
<p>My old grannie had one, you know? Nothing fancy. Just a twist of grass me grandad made her. Swam out to the island to get it. Tied it in a bow and hung it on her bedroom window. Course, she lost it before they were married, but she loved him already so's it didn't really matter. That was romance, you see. We've always been a family of romantics.</p>
<p>These days… when Kinzie's young lass married that lad from Swansea, they bought dried grasses on the internet! Next, they'll be paying someone to make it for 'em. Where's the luck in that, I ask you? Buy the marriage on there while you're at it next! Buy the whole bloody marriage and no wonder when it isn't working.</p>
<p>You'll be wanting a picture of me for the book of course. Should I pose here or will we be going out to the island later?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> That will be all for now, thank you, Mr. Weems. I'm sure someone will come back to take the photographs another time.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5530 - Addendum:</strong> After extensive interviews with local residents and a review of the island archives, a team has been dispatched to investigate claims relating to an uninhabited island approximately 2 miles north of North Uist. Samples of plant material will be collected according to local superstition and analysed for anomalous effects.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5530</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The island on which SCP-5530 grows is to be monitored for regrowth. Should SCP-5530 grow to a height of 5cm, the island is to be mowed and the clippings incinerated.</p>
<p>The belief that SCP-5530's anomalous properties are folklore is to be actively encouraged. Any evidence to the contrary is to be destroyed or discredited as appropriate. Given the nature of existing SCP-5530 instances, no further action has been deemed necessary at this time (to be reassessed on a case by case basis if new instances become known).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5530 is a species of marram grass<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> which grows on an uninhabited island 2 miles north of North Uist, Outer Hebrides. The anomalous properties of SCP-5530 manifest when a strand is cut or broken and then gifted to an individual or a family group. SCP-5530 will manifest the specific sentiments of the picker towards the recipient as envisaged at the time of picking. This effect will then continue until the SCP-5530 instance is destroyed. Given the often innocuous nature of SCP-5530, the number of active instances is unknown.</p>
<p>Based on historic records, knowledge of SCP-5530's properties was locally commonplace until the early 20th century. More recently, the practice has been continued as a tradition, with older stories being passed on as folklore rather than factual accounts. SCP-5530 was still used to make charms until the mid-1990s, at which point grazing activity on the island made it difficult to find strands suitable for weaving. Modern, non-anomalous charms of a similar design are now constructed using marram grass harvested from other islands or from non-traditional materials.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5530 Interview #98</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Moore<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Lachlan Wood</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> On 21/10/2020, the research team became aware of an additional active instance of SCP-5530. Unlike other instances, it consisted simply of a dried, knotted strand of SCP-5530 and had therefore not been included within the scope of previous investigations.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Wood:</strong> I didn't think you'd want to talk to me about… would you call it a charm? I mean, it's nothing to look at. Not a lot of charm about it!</p>
<p><em>Mr. Wood laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> Lachlan, we'd love to hear about it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wood:</strong> It was just before you came here that I made it. I know they're usually for weddings and the like, but me Grand-da… he loved all the old stories. All the old ways, you know? I…</p>
<p><em>Mr. Wood sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wood:</strong> It was late and I was drunk, you know how it is. You could see the island from the shore and I just thought - if the sheeps can swim it… I've never been so good at the weaving, so I just tied it in a knot and that was that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> Just something to remember him by, Lachlan - I'm sure he would have loved that.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wood:</strong> Something to send off with the old bastar't, you mean. At the end of the funeral, I tucked it in there amongst the flowers. Not so's anyone could see it except maybe him if he's up there watching.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Wood presses his fingers to his right eye and smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wood:</strong> Lord bless him, he looked so peaceful when we found him. Just curled up in his chair like he was having a quick kip. I kept thinking it was just some daft misunderstanding, yeah? Like - wouldn't it be fine if he could wake back up the net day, just as always? Up and through for first go at the papers, then out to walk the dug. But… Anyways. I hope that helps you. You know - for your book.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moore:</strong> Thank you, Lachlan. Yes. I'll… make a note of that now.</p>
