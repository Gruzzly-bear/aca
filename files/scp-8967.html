<p>SCP-8967 at recovery</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8967</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8967 is to be kept in a secure vault at Vehicular Site 132. Testing is indefinitely suspended per order of Site Director Jason Michael.</p>
<p>SCP-8967-A is to be monitored through a Rieux Unreality Accelerator, modified to be capable of locomotion. Further interaction with the inhabitants of SCP-8967-A necessitates authorization from at least one Level Three researcher.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to operate SCP-8967.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8967 is a white 2003 Toyota Camry, identical in appearance and composition to a non-anomalous car of the same make and model. SCP-8967 has Michigan license plates and minor damage to the rear window. The message found inside SCP-8967's trunk is available for viewing in Addendum 8967-2.</p>
<p>SCP-8967's anomalous properties manifest when a driver<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> makes any change in lane or position without activating the proper turn signal. The subject will instantaneously disappear, and SCP-8967 will drive autonomously to an available parking space before shutting off. The requirements to trigger SCP-8967's effect are based on United States federal law and do not change state-per-state.</p>
<p>SCP-8967's effect will not trigger if the driver is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minor</li>
<li>Not legally able to drive due to drunkenness/disability/lack of a driver's license</li>
<li>Currently enrolled in any driving safety course</li>
</ul>
<p>Subjects affected by SCP-8967 will reappear in an extradimensional location designated SCP-8967-A. This displacement is accompanied by a feeling of vertigo and a sensation of rapid acceleration. SCP-8967-A is a space resembling the inside of a large, dimly-lit warehouse, covering an area of about 3km2. No indications have been found regarding the external geography of SCP-8967-A, and the walls have resisted all attempts to breach them.</p>
<p>SCP-8967-A is populated by 34 humans, identified as victims of a series of disappearances, the news of which led to the discovery and containment of SCP-8967. The subjects appear to be under the effects of a localized <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/end-of-death-hub">ΩK-Class End of Death Scenario,</a> and are unable to age. It is believed that these humans triggered the effects of SCP-8967 before the Foundation discovered it.</p>
<p>The humans inhabiting SCP-8967-A do not require sustenance and act under a compulsion to roam their surroundings. Collective rest periods have been observed, occurring every 16 hours and lasting an indeterminate amount of time; wandering will resume immediately after the rest period has concluded.</p>
<p>Inhabitants of SCP-8967-A appear not to be aware of the presence of others until physical contact is made. Subjects tend to gravitate toward one another over the course of their wandering period, generally colliding and expressing displeasure. After these encounters, both subjects will wander in opposite directions and lose memory of the incident.</p>
<p>Several persons inside SCP-8967-A have developed severe injuries as a result of constant collisions with others, including concussions, broken bones, and lacerations. Subjects appear distressed by these injuries, but in all cases have not acknowledged the causes for them.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8967 was recovered in O█████, Michigan, after a series of disappearances involving the drivers of a Toyota Camry. Surveillance footage of the disappearance of █████ Frink alerted Foundation personnel to the anomalous nature of SCP-8967. SCP-8967 had initially been sold by a car dealership, which, on debrief, had no records of possessing any such vehicle. SCP-8967 had been sold 13 times prior to its recovery.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Experiments 2025-9 - 25</strong></span><br/>
<strong>Attending Researcher:</strong> Dr. Jack Hart<br/>
<strong>Subjects:</strong> D-4983, D-3721, D-2234</p>
<p><strong>Test 1:</strong> While driving SCP-8967 on Site 132's testing course, D-4983 was instructed to make a turn without using a signal. No effect was produced. Later analysis discovered that D-4983 had his driver's license revoked due to outstanding unpaid fines while incarcerated.</p>
<p><strong>Test 2:</strong> D-3721 was equipped with a standard tracker and clothing-embedded video camera. D-3721 was then instructed to make a turn without using a signal. The subject disappeared and could not be located through the tracker. No camera footage was received.</p>
<p><strong>Log 3:</strong> The previous experiment was repeated, with D-2234 being equipped with a modified <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/grant-request-for-the-utilization-of-sub-reality-spaces">Rieux Unreality Accelerator</a> capable of transmitting information superliminally and interspacially. D-2234 disappeared, and successful contact was made from within SCP-8967-A. The following exploration and interview log is available under Addendum 8967-1.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Yeah, just really dizzy. Like when you stand up too fast.</p>
<p><em>Camera footage reveals a large, dark space.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> We're getting video coming back to our end. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> There's darkness everywhere. I can't see shit. And someone here forgot to pay the bills because it's really goddamn cold.</p>
<p><em>D-2234 begins to walk into his surroundings.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, what are you doing? Do not move unless ordered.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> (<em>halts</em>) Sorry. Just felt like a good idea. It's like it went into my head and started knocking things around in there. Like that King book.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Do you mean that you feel compelled to move?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Maybe. You just had to pick the shrimp for this job, didn't you? Because this thing you've strapped to me is heavy as fuck.</p>
<p><em>D-2234 resumes walking and turns on his flashlight. He attempts to adjust the Unreality Accerator.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Do not touch your recording equipment. Walk forward and report what you see.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Look's like someone got killed here.</p>
<p><em>Camera captures a series of dried bloodstains on the concrete floor. D-2234 continues walking</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Are you guys going to get me out of here? I'm getting scared. Can you get me out?</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> We're working on it. The laser rangefinder in your gear indicates that you're approaching a barrier. Can you see anything ahead?</p>
<p><em>D-2234 breathes in and out to compose himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, respond.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Sorry. No, it's too dark. I can't see. Gives me the willies.</p>
<p><em>A figure becomes visible in D-2234's flashlight. It approaches him at a rapid pace and collides with him head-on. D-2234 shouts and falls over. The figure stumbles.</em></p>
<p><strong>ENTITY:</strong> Watch it, asshole! It's my damn street.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Shit! Why don't you look where you're going?</p>
<p>//D-2234 stands up and observes the entity. The figure is a middle-aged human woman, covered in severe bruises and lacerations. Her arm is broken at the radius.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Ask her what she is and what she is doing here.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Right sir, right. The fuck are you doing here? You a ghost?</p>
<p><strong>ENTITY:</strong> I'm trying to get home! It's not anyone else's damn business to know that or where I'm going or any of that crap!</p>
<p>//The woman wanders away into the darkness. D-2234 can be heard cringing at his scrapes.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, follow the woman.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> (<em>unintelligible muttering</em>) They just can't tell anyone, no they don't, it's like they think they own the place.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, respond.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> What? What woman?</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> The woman you just encountered.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> I don't know what you mean, sir.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> So you do not remember colliding with a woman only a minute before?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> No. Bitch probably deserved it.</p>
<p><em>D-2234 continues walking ahead. He comes to a corrugated metal wall that continues in every direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Walk along the wall and tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Yes, sir, I'll do it. There's a door out of here, right?</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> That's what we're working to determine.</p>
<p><em>After ten minutes of walking, a noise comes from the darkness.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> No, what's that? No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> What do you hear?</p>
<p>**D-2234: Hey, I'm not doing this! You gotta get me out of here now!</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Approach the direction of the noise.</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> No, you need to get me out of here right now! Doctor, get me out!</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> You will not be able to exit if you do not cooperate. Approach the source of the noise.</p>
<p><em>D-2234 begins to run away from the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, stop or face termination!</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> (<em>begins to sob</em>) But that's not gonna work, no it's not. Try it, man. Try to put some poison in me or shoot me or strike me with lightning, not gonna work. It isn't gonna let you, don't you fucking know?</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> What? What don't we know?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> We aren't supposed to die here, you numb fuck! Because you can't die when you're already dead!</p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> Why don't you believe you can die?</p>
<p><em>D-2234 remains silent. The noise becomes louder. It resembles a human crying with difficulty.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Hey doc, please get me out of here. Please don't leave me. Come on man, I want to die. I want to die.</p>
<p><em>D-2234 slowly begins to move closer to the source of the noise.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234? We're going to get you out, but you have to cooperate. What's making that sound?</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> (<em>amid heavy sobbing</em>) The ones that really fucked up, they end up like that. Spread out. Everyone walks over them.</p>
<p><em>The camera becomes still. A shuddering, red mass is visible at the edge of D-2234's flashlight. Wheezy, pained moans emit from it</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> (<em>Gags</em>) Oh god, it's like it was <em>exploded,</em> it's everywhere, there's so much of it but it's still screaming—</p>
<p><em>D-2234 detaches the Unreality Engine from his body.</em></p>
<p><strong>HART:</strong> D-2234, equip the harness!</p>
<p><strong>D-2234:</strong> Oh god oh god.</p>
<p><em>The camera shifts as D-2234 lets it fall to the ground. A mass of red, mutilated flesh is revealed, apparently the disemboweled body of an obese man, topped with a misshapen human head. The head lets out wails and moans. The mass's innards have been scattered or trampled on. The pile begins to wriggle as D-2234 screams.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong> The Unreality Engine's mobility functions remained fully operational and were able to perform observational and experimental duties inside SCP-8967-A. No further contact has been made with D-2234.</p>
