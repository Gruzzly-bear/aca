<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A circular perimeter has been established 2km from the current location of SCP-6223, and a preliminary quarantine zone has been established 1km from SCP-6223 as well, subject to further review.</p>
<p>Residents of Caldwell, Idaho, and the Boise, Idaho area, are to be categorized into three groups in regards to SCP-6223. No action is to be taken towards the first group, who are listeners who have never shown interest in SCP-6223. The second and third group, consisting of Boise area radio professionals and listeners of Christian broadcasts, are, under Protocol PARAVELT, to be identified, interrogated regarding SCP-6223 and selectively amnesticized.</p>
<p>All tapes recovered from SCP-6223 are to be stored in the Euclid class media archives at Site 37.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6223 is the KGBN radio station, formerly located in Caldwell Idaho and currently located in the deserts of the Danakil Depression in northern Ethiopia. SCP-6223 was transported to its current location through unknown means. Prior to its designation as an SCP, KGBN served the Boise Idaho area and broadcast Christian radio programs, with programs consisting of sermons and praise music. The station was bought from its original owners, ██████ and ██████ Wilton, by the ViacomCBS Corporation through its fledgling CBS Radio subsidiary. All employees were fired and replaced, and one month following the management change the station building and its broadcast equipment disappeared.</p>
<p>The building was discovered in its current location by a geological survey team from the Ethiopian government. Aside from damage by the elements, the structure was in a general state of disrepair inconsistent with its previous use. The interior and exterior of the building are marked by severe heat damage from an unknown source, but no fire detection systems activated. The interior also contains two charred corpses, presumably belonging to station employees, though DNA samples were inconclusive. Much of the furniture has been damaged extensively, including broadcast equipment, except for two objects: a SanDisk brand flash drive containing broadcast data found on one of the burned corpses (see Addendum 01), and a decorative wooden cross, rotated sidewise, completely intact save for a burn in the shape of the CBS logo. The origin of the building's damage and transportation remains unknown.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p><strong>Addendum 6223.01:</strong> All broadcast data were completely corrupted by the heat damage save for those on the recovered flash drive, which only bore minor corruption. It remains the only conclusive broadcast to originate from SCP-6223 following the transfer of ownership. Due to station protocols of recording over previous data once hard drives fill, it is theorized that this was a broadcast that originated immediately prior to the anomalous destruction of the building. The file contains a record of a program that differs dramatically from usual station fare, and displays a record of several anomalous events. An upload of this audio file is as follows. All individuals are referred to by names given in the file.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>BEGIN LOG:</strong></p>
<p>(<em>An electronic yowl - the distorted data remains of some kind of worship music or gospel. Gradually, it reconstitutes into music again - a choir singing Silent Night. A male voice speaks.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that was the Joseph Reidy Chorus Singers with their version of Silent Night. I am still your host for the Hour of Falling, Fr. Nelson Devin Mothersbaugh, alias your friend DJ Slimy, coming from the borough of Congress Head in the beautiful snow-blanketed state of Maine. As sure as Jesus shining upon you I hope you are having a Merry Christmas. Remember the lessons of last week's sermon, remember that worship is never defined in the Bible. Funny how there’s no place where it says "you must worship this way.”</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Sure, they tell you how to worship in the book of Leviticus and in the New Testament, but I'm not talking about worship that way. The true worship of God happens long before any of those texts are written. In the oldest ancient time, the beginning before the beginning, they were still worshipping God, in what some might say is the true way. Allow me to demonstrate by way of my latest program, coming at you right now as we round the corner on Christmas Day…</p>
<p>(<em>Blurred, glitched noise, the corrupted remains of many many radio shows.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>The noise fades into the soundscape of night in a city. Someone running, feet slapping pavement, they are breathing heavily. There are sirens in the distance.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Fuck, fuck, shit, oh god, fuck.</p>
<p>(<em>The running approaches a car. The door is opened and then slammed shut.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Took you long enough. You get the cash?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Just drive, fuckface! They're on to us!</p>
<p>(<em>A car engine is turned on. It sounds as if it reverses and then drives quickly out of the parking space. The audio glitches and distorts, sounding much like a radio dial being tuned, resolving into the muffled sounds of the car on the highway.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> You see any lights?</p>
<p>(<em>Someone, presumably Paul, shifting in his seat.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> No, no lights. Yet. They must be still in the city looking for us.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Jesus, how dumb do they think we are?</p>
<p>(<em>A pause.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I hope this was worth it, Tony. You know, now, now I can never go back there. Back to my home.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Relax, it's for a good cause. You know my mom in Billings can't pay her medical bills. We were forced into this.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Bullshit. Your mother isn't seeing a dime. You've been trouble since high school.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> What, you don't believe me?!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> (<em>sighing</em>) I guess if I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be here. Wouldn't have all this.</p>
<p>(<em>A duffel bag is shaken around.</em>)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Well, there you go.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence. The noise of the highway. There is a burst of glitched distortion.</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>The sound of traffic is now greatly reduced. The car's turn signal is audible.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Jesus, I can't believe we're getting away with this.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, I've been checking for like ten miles and there's no cops, no nothing. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Why did we get off the highway? If they're not on our tail, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Hey, you feeling tired? I can turn on the radio. Uhhh…I get, I get pretty good reception in this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Wha-? Don't you have a CD player or like an aux cord or some shit?</p>
<p>(<em>The sound of radio stations being flipped through, though mostly static, and gradually they all fade into static.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Damn it! We must be in a dead zone.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah…you know, this radio stuff feels like you're deflecting.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Shut up! I got something!</p>
<p>(<em>The voice of DJ Slimy is audible again on their radio, giving yet another sermon. There is organ music underneath.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> I am still your host for the Hour of Falling, Fr. William Bonaparte II, alias your friend DJ Slimy, coming from the burg of Sodawater, Texas. Listen now as we revisit the story of the prophet Elijah in the Book of Kings and the lessons he can impart.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Oh no, turn this off. This is some Jesus shit. Why the fuck are we listening to this?</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> There was a fire.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> A great fire in the wilderness. And there stood Elijah upon a pale horse, and he survived the fire, and he saw that it was God, and that it was good. I ask you all at home now to cast your eyes out over the fire you are walking towards yourself, out over the infinite plain, and see that fire, visualize it within your mind's eye. Feel the heat. Feel the scorching on your flesh. That is the righteous fire of the Lord. Let us turn our attention now towards…</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I don't like this.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> It's all we got, I guess. These radio evangelists are getting weirder and weirder. I mean, that's what you get with a shrinking listener base, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> No, I mean, where are the cops? We've got a bag of stolen cash from a jewelry store robbery and the moment we leave the city limits, we're just free? That, that doesn't make any goddamn sense, Tony!</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> I mean, maybe the universe provides? Shit, man, just go with it!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> No, no, no, no, I've got a weird feeling. Something's not right, and I got the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight fucking up. Something's not good.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> I mean, I'm feeling great! We got the hell out of Dodge and no one's the wiser.</p>
<p>(<em>There is a brief pause. The sound of a flicker of some kind.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> What the fuck is that? That light in the trees?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I have no ide- JESUS CHRIST, FUCK!</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Wha—?</p>
<p>(<em>The car swerves and then suddenly screeches to a halt. A car door opens and there is the sound of feet on gravel. DJ Slimy's voice emanates from the car reading Bible passages underneath the conversation.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Ecclesiastes 12:10 to 12:14. The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd. Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body. Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Jesus, wha-wha-wha, what was that all about?! What was it? What did you see? An animal?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I dunno. It was, it was huge! It didn't look like a… I mean, I dunno what it was!</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> The lights are gone.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Fuck the lights, we were just nearly hit by some kinda…</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Deer? Elk?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I dunno, it was on two legs! What kinda deer does that?!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> So, was it a person?!.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Jesus fuck, Tony! It didn't look like a person!</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Alright, calm down Paul, calm down, whatever it is, it's gone. We didn't hit it or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> (<em>breathing heavily</em>) We gotta get going. We gotta get outta here. I, I—</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Yeah, I think you're right—</p>
<p>(<em>His sentence is cut off when the tape degrades into digital corruption and glitches, as the distortion becomes unintelligible.</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>The distortion turns into the sound of a car crunching on gravel as it into a parking lot, from context likely a motel. The car turns off.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Look, it's going to be okay. We're like 100 miles out from town now, we didn't hit the…the whatever it was, and most of all we seem to basically be okay. Yeah? So, we're just gonna stay the night until we can get to Billings tomorrow, that okay?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, yeah okay.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Jesus, what a dump.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Seems appropriate for us two.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Hey, lighten up!</p>
<p>(<em>One of the two gets out of the car and shuts the door. The audio returns to glitches and distortion. Snatches of previous programs are audible through the static.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Male voice:</strong> Help!</p>

<p><strong>Desk clerk:</strong> Welcome to the Starbright Motor Inn. Wi-Fi Password is in the room, and we do serve a free complementary coffee and pastry in the morning, but no breakfast.</p>
<p>(<em>A car drives by, very loud and close.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Desk clerk:</strong> Can I put you down for one room, then?</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> (<em>attempting to disguise his voice, badly</em>) Uh, yeah. One room please. Double bed, please.</p>
<p><strong>Desk clerk:</strong> Alrighty. Credit card?</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Cash alright?</p>
<p><strong>Desk clerk:</strong> Yep, fine with me. No problem. That's sixty dollars, please.</p>
<p>(<em>A rustling noise, presumably Tony removing bills from a bag. There's the jingle of keys being placed on a desk.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Desk clerk:</strong> Room 7, just down the edge of the lot. Good night gentlemen.</p>
<p>(<em>The distortion returns, this time with the sound of tires on gravel as a prominent part of the mix. A male voice's whispering is audible but unintelligible.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Zealous caller:</strong> The Lord told me to do it.</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Zealous caller:</strong> He is righteous and fearful in all things, and next to him I am a meek lamb, a servant whipped into submission, branded with the fire, a cow in the McDonalds slaughterhouse, nearly ready for processing.</p>

<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Well, I wouldn't count on it. Heaven is a myth made up by Disney to sell direct-to-DVD sequels. John Milton was a hack, and a sexual predator to boot.

<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Understand what? Understand that you've been tormenting us, trapping us in some hellscape of your own design?</p>
<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Understand more than that. Understand that you are part of a vast and churning machine. A people engine. The fuel that stokes the fire. The United States? Western Civilization? Civilization itself? Knowledge? Writing? Pfff! What a putrid, junky laugh. Pornography. Any system of organizing humanity, I'm riding out of town!

<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Visigoths 45:12 — And I beheld a brilliant fire that burned like stars. And I saw that it was the whole land, and it was in the land. And the land was the terrible and powerful LORD, and the LORD was your jailer!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I don't want to go there, I don't.</p>

<p><strong>DJ Slimy:</strong> Can't!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Shit!</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6223.02:</strong> Following the positive identification of two of the individuals in the prior audio log as Anthony Guiterrez and Paul Sockwin, the following memorandum was issued by the Director of Site 37 Media Archives, Barbara Pangborn.</p>
<p><iframe allowtransparency="true" class="html-block-iframe" frameborder="0" src="/scp-6223/html/1b91117e1dde0d453c6eb85e93012c3526e0d69e-122184799162473514"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Pangborn:</strong> Look, I know there's been a lot of debate as to the contents of the recovered flash drive. It's certainly disturbing, yes, but it's true some might consider there to be no clear evidence of true anomalous phenomena. I've certainly received one or two papers to that effect. Yes, this could be some kind of rogue DJ having a crisis of faith, broadcasting some kind of blasphemous radio play. But the truth is, we have no evidence to suggest whether or not this was a one off thing, certainly no way to confirm whether any of the on air personalities at KBGN actually…well…it's complicated. We have plenty of otherwise non- anomalous media that could be faked with special effects, true. But we categorize them anyway. We keep them aside until research conclusively determines the facts. And we have some facts. Anthony Guiterrez and Paul Sockwin were real, at any rate, and they are missing. And the station is still half in a hot-spring in East Africa. Those are empirical, and they are connected. So, yes, we're keeping SCP-6223 in the database until we can absolutely nail down some details about that station. If CBS decides to play ball on <a href="/scp-3373">SCP-3373</a>, regarding what they know about DJ Slimy, we might have an -EX. Right now, no.</p>
<p>(<em>A sigh, exhausted.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pangborn:</strong> And, at any rate, I might as well come clean. I'm recommending we upgrade SCP-6223 to Euclid, effective immediately. I had a couple of boys come down from the Department of Memetics, and, um, well, we're getting some strange results. It's dangerous to do tests with, so cavalierly. There's too many unanswered questions, too much unknown. I'm gonna appoint Dr. Greyeyes to Acting Director, effective immediately. I can't do this job properly anymore.
