<p>SCP-1142</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1142</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1142 is to be contained in a standard non-humanoid holding cell at Site-12. An automated recording system is to monitor SCP-1142 at all times. Two Level 2 members of technical staff are to inspect any recordings made on a daily basis and, in case of a transmission having been picked up, are to provide this transmission to the current translation operative for conversion from its original German into English. A full report is then to be submitted to the current Level 4 project lead as per the protocols for interreality relations. The battery SCP-1142 carries is to be checked on the first of every month for signs of deterioration. SCP-1142's propulsion systems have been disabled to simplify containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1142 is a Goliath tracked mine (original designation <em>Leichter Ladungsträger Goliath (Sd.Kfz. 303b)</em>) as used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. SCP-1142 shows no signs of aging and although originally designed to carry an explosive charge, contains a heavily modified Kw.E.a Wehrmacht radio receiver within its housing. The modified components are of a design and complexity inconsistent with the level of German technology during the middle of the twentieth century. SCP-1142 relies on a gasoline engine for propulsion and carries an early model thermal battery for the operation of the receiver.</p>
<p>At irregular intervals, transmissions in German have been recorded from SCP-1142. In all cases, contact has been made by an individual referring to himself as Brigadeführer ████ ███████ (designated SCP-1142-1). Historical research has verified his existence, though records show him to have been killed during Allied military action at █████ on ██/██/19██. Analysis of transmissions recorded have yielded several critical points of divergence from our timeline. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several individuals not currently known to have held offices within the Wehrmacht occupying key positions within that body</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Large-scale deaths among German civilians from an unknown pathogen with symptoms resembling acute necrotizing fasciitis</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A sinkhole with a diameter of approximately sixteen kilometers appearing in the Lublin province of Poland in late 19██</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reports of mass destruction of German settlements by unknown forces</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allied powers isolating the European continent, with troop action being focused on containment of [REDACTED]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Development of reality gating technology in 19██</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, SCP-1142-1 claims to be broadcasting from ██████████, Austria in the year 19██. In light of this and the aforementioned divergences, transmissions received through SCP-1142 have been deemed to originate from an alternate reality iteration designated Dm-AX/15487-A. Additional classification as intertemporal is pending. Recorded transmissions from SCP-1142 indicate Dm-AX/15487-A is experiencing or has experienced a ZK-Class Reality Failure scenario.</p>
<p>At this time, communications are restricted to receiving and recording the signal broadcast by SCP-1142-1 from Dm-AX/15487-A; attempts to initiate contact with or send a signal to Dm-AX/15487-A have proven ineffectual. Following the events of Foundation communication with <a href="scp-1322.html">SCP-1322-A</a>, further research into initiating contact with SCP-1142-1 or responding to its transmissions has been suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1142-A-01:</strong> <em>Recovery and preliminary containment notes</em></p>
<p>SCP-1142 was discovered in a barn on the outskirts of Fürstenzell, Germany on ██/██/20██. German authorities, alerted by the owner found SCP-1142 idling and, after recognizing its original purpose, brought in the Kampfmittelräumdienst (KRD) to defuse it. A covert contact within that service alerted local Foundation agents when she found SCP-1142 showed no signs of age and did in fact not contain an explosive charge. A recovery team then managed to extract it from the German authorities and transported it to Site-12.</p>
