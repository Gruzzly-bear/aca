<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-8686 appearances, Foundation Web-Crawlers are to monitor for any listings of the anomaly on resale or auction websites. If a listing is found, efforts are to be made to remove it. Purchasing the copy is the preferred option, though taking down the listing is a valid alternative.</p>
<p>In the event that a copy of SCP-8686 is purchased, MTF Upsilon-33 ("Rushing Critics"), is to obtain the SCP-8686 instance, and administer B-Class amnestics to the exposed individuals. Agents are to maintain the belief that SCP-8686 is no more than a memory of an existing play, as established by the memetic properties of the anomaly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8686 is an anomalous theatre experience known as "The Best Days Of Our Lives". SCP-8686 is attributed to "<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8478">Pseudogenesis Productions</a>", alternatively known as GOI-478. The first page contains information on those involved in the production of SCP-8686.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Instances will appear on various auction websites, including eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist, priced five to ten dollars.</p>
<p>The cover contains a memetic effect, compelling someone to open the playbill, but opening it will invariably cause the subject to be affected by more of SCP-8686's memetics and cognitohazardous effects. The various memetics that make up SCP-8686 seem to be able to exert power on the environment around the subject for the duration of the performance, manifesting furniture and entities collectively known as SCP-8686-A.</p>
<p>SCP-8686's story is in three acts, each corresponding to a unique heuristic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> effect in the subject. Amnestic testing has shown that the show cannot be removed from the memory of any subjects.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first act elicits euphoric emotions towards the SCP-8686-A instance representing the viewer's romantic partner within SCP-8686.</li>
<li>The second act induces paranoia in the viewer, specifically regarding perceived potential flaws or character faults. The viewer is inevitably unable to determine the root cause of their conflict.</li>
<li>The third act forces the viewer to confront their flaws, resulting in a major conflict between the viewer and the SCP-8686-A instance representing their partner. This conflict inevitably leads to a moment of self-realization.</li>
</ul>
<p>An SCP-8686 performance will always follow the same act structure, and is always set within the same location, a cottage home. While the narrative varies between instances, the subject is never able to leave the set.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8686.1:</strong> Experiment Log</p>
<div class="log_div">
<div class="log_text">
<p><strong>Preface:</strong> D-2231, a Class-D personnel, was given an instance of SCP-8686. The show was recorded as to understand the true nature of SCP-8686 performances. Only portions of the recording were recoverable, separated by glitches. It is believed a portion of each act was captured.</p>
<hr/>
<p>(<em>The environment begins to shift into the cottage set of SCP-8686 as Act One opens. D-2231 is standing in the front door, holding a bag of groceries.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Woah— Oh. Did I go to the store?</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 walks through the halls, before coming face to face with an instance of SCP-8686-A. D-2231 shifts awkwardly.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> … Carol? They took you in too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Dear, are you feeling alright? Oh, you got the groceries! Did you make sure to pick up some eggs? We're out.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I—</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 looks at the bag, nodding to SCP-8686-A.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Yeah. It looks like I did.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Are you hungry, then? I could go for an omelet, and I know how much you like them.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 pauses for a moment, staring at the instance of SCP-8686-A. There is a pause, before tears can be seen in the footage.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I missed you. So much.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> It's okay now. It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> You said you would never leave me, and here we are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> I remember when I said that. You came home and I was drunk on the couch.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 chuckles and gets closer to SCP-8686-A, hugging it.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I missed you. So much, Carol.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231's chuckles turn slowly into sobs, hugging the instance closer.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> I missed you too, Ash.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 looks down at SCP-8686-A while in an embrace, tears flowing. SCP-8686-A wipes away some of her tears, smiling warmly.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I couldn't ask for anyone better.</p>
<p>(<em>They kiss.</em>)</p>
</div>

<div class="log_text">
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> You said you wouldn't do that anymore.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 takes a sip from a green glass bottle.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Seriously? I quit. I quit drinking for you.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Let's just enjoy the moment. Want a sip?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A makes a disgusted face at D-2231.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> You'd better be wasted.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I actually think I'm rather insightful. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Ash. I've been sober for five months now. Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A clenches its jaw, brushing its hair to the side and glaring at D-2231.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> I'm going to get some fresh air. Feel free to join me when you're <em>thinking</em> again.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Carol, I don't see the problem. I'm not a drunkard like you were—</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A glares at D-2231 as tears form.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Every day, you made me feel bad for drinking. It was a fucking problem, yes, I needed help, but you didn't have to say what you did. You told me I was going to die from it, that I was gonna end up in a fucking gutter.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A's lip quivers as they begin to cry.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> Why in Hell would you say that to me, and why in the love of Christ would you keep drinking— No, why are you <em>still</em> drinking?</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Carol, sweetheart, you just don't get—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> No, don't try to talk your way out of this.</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 visibly sinks lower into her chair, taking a sip from her drink.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> And put down the bottle. I just want you to practice what you preach. Please.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Okay. Okay, I promise that I'll quit. I'm sorry. I love you, and I'm going to go sleep off my drinks.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A nods, as D-2231 stands up and the scene shifts into a bedroom.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 takes a flask, frowning as she downs the contents. Her body trembles.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Last one… Last one. I promise.</p>
</div>

<div class="log_text">
<p>(<em>D-2231 looks to the front door, where SCP-8686-A stands. She has tear-stained eyes and is shaking.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I'm sorry, I don't want you to leave— please darling, come back.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A looks back, sniffling as tears flow from its eyes.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> I feel like I don't even know you. You won't quit. You won't go to rehab. You won't go to therapy. It's like you don't even want to change.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> I love you though, so much, more than anything else in this stupid small world. Please. Don't leave me alone. I don't want to be alone, you're the only thing that keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> I can't do this anymore. You're hurting yourself with your addiction, and then you turn around and hurt me. You—</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A's voice trembles, choking up.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8686-A:</strong> You can say you love me all you want, but every time I see you drink it reminds me of a past I had to crawl out of alone. And you have the gall to throw that back at me, after <em>everything</em> you know I've been through? I'm done.</p>
<p><strong>D-2231:</strong> Carol, honey—</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-8686-A walks out of the cottage, slamming the door shut.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>D-2231 sits in the house, making her way onto the couch.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>She curls up into a ball, covering herself in a blanket and mumbling nothings to herself to try and calm down. The only remaining noises in the recording are D-2231's sobs, and the dull buzz of the stage lights. After ten minutes of crying, she falls asleep.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>The show ends.</em>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the experiment, D-2231 requested Foundation psychiatric services to aid her in mitigating her alcoholism. The request was granted, and D-2231 showed exceptional progress in her recovery.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to identify SCP-8686-A from D-2231's recorded performance. Despite D-2231's insistence, they have never been in a relationship or married to any individuals named 'Carol'. As such, SCP-8686-A's existence as a real individual is pending further investigation.</p>
