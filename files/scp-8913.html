<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Site-333, c. 1989, prior to burning down in 1992.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8913</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-8913 only affects Site-333's interior, no direct containment procedures are necessary. All personnel stationed at Site-333 are to be briefed on SCP-8913 and must report any instances of the anomaly taking place in their presence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8913 is an auditory anomaly manifesting at Site-333. Affected personnel report hearing a sound, similar to that of a pre-recorded laugh track used in various popular sitcoms, at seemingly random moments and locations. The source of the anomaly is yet to be traced.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8913.1:</strong> The following is an abridged log of recorded SCP-8913 instances and attempts to intentionally manifest the anomaly.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>23/01/1991:</strong> Dr. Rutherford cuts his finger while examining documents; SCP-8913 is heard in his office for approximately five seconds. The anomaly was reported shortly afterward, and SCP-8913 was classified.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>24/01/1991:</strong> D-1221 is instructed to cut his right index finger with a sheet of paper in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8913 fails to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>24/01/1991:</strong> D-1221 is instructed to cut his left index finger with a sheet of paper in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8913 fails to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>24/01/1991:</strong> D-1221 expels flatulence. SCP-8913 is heard for approximately 5 seconds within the testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>24/01/1991:</strong> D-1221 is ordered to slip on a banana peel in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8913 fails to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>24/01/1991:</strong> D-1221 is ordered to slip on a banana peel in a controlled environment. D-1221 refuses to comply and is subdued by Guard Newby. After issuing a beating to D-1221, Newby backs away from him and slips on the banana peel. SCP-8913 is heard for approximately 7 seconds within the testing chamber.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>25/02/1991.</strong> Dr. Haaland is informed that his residence has been destroyed by a kitchen fire. SCP-8913 is heard throughout the personnel offices for 15 seconds, alongside loud clapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>01/03/1991.</strong> Researcher Quinn is informed of his termination due to unrelated protocol violations. SCP-8913 is heard in the entirety of Site-333, alongside loud clapping and cheering for 20 seconds.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Addendum 8913.2:</strong> Following various noise and disruption complaints caused by SCP-8913, Site-333 administration voted on attempting to decommission the anomaly. The ensuing vote resulted in a 5-2-2 score in favor of decommissioning SCP-8913. Attached below is an abridged log of attempted measures taken.
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> Site-333 open mic comedy night.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning Conspectus:</strong> SCP-8913 reacts to humorous events, perhaps giving it more of what it wants will sate it and it will go away.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> <strong><span style="color: green">APPROVED</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-8913 failed to manifest once throughout the 4 hours of the event. Decommissioning attempt failed.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> Kill the entire D-class population of Site-333.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning Conspectus:</strong> SCP-8913 is known to enjoy the suffering of others. By inflicting suffering, we may appease it and cause it to demanifest.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> <strong><span style="color: red">DENIED</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Researcher Carlos was admonished for this suggestion. SCP-8913 was heard throughout the Site when Carlos was informed he would be docked a month of pay for his behavior.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8913.3:</strong> On 30/06/1991, Vincent Bohart was scheduled to visit Site-333 and take over from Director Nolan Goode. As he arrived, it was noted that SCP-8913 began to be audible throughout the Site. Attached below is an interview carried out with Bohart following his arrival and discovery of interaction with SCP-8913.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> V. Bohart</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> N. Goode, Site-333 Director</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The interview began outside of Site-333 approximately 15 minutes after Bohart's arrival and discovery of interaction with SCP-8913.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Hello, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Hey, Nolan. Your Site is laughing at me.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Yup. I see you discovered our Site's little, uh, problem.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Problem? Here I was thinking that it was just some cruel prank on me.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> No, we wouldn't do that to you.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> That's good to hear at least. So what is this, some sort of anomaly? And what's with the recorder? Don't tell me you're going to interview me.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> I just want to record everything we do for posterity. As for it being an anomaly, yes. Here, let me show you the documentation.</p>
<p><em>[There is a brief silence as Bohart reviews SCP-8913's documentation.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Well I'll be damned. Okay. So you have a canned laugh anomaly affecting your Site. But why does it go off when I enter the building?</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Maybe you're just naturally funny.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> <em>[Bohart laughs.]</em> You think so?</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Maybe. Or maybe the things that happen to you are funny too.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Well, funny things do happen to me. And I think I'm pretty funny too.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Fair enough. Why don't we go talk inside? It's almost lunchtime.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> I don't want the mean laughter SCP to laugh at me just for existing though.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Oh, stop it. We've dealt with it for months, surely a few hours of it won't hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Fine. Does the cafeteria have saltwater taffy?</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> It does, yes.</p>
<p><em>[Bohart and Goode approach the Site. The slight creaking sound of the doors opening is audible after Goode inputs his security code. SCP-8913 is heard as Bohart enters, with loud clapping, cheering, and whooping.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> <em>[Yelling over SCP-8913]</em> Yes, yes, very funny. I love an audience! How are we tonight, Atlantic City?</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> <em>[Yelling over SCP-8913]</em> Come on, this way.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Wow, this place is nice. You have a whole cafeteria here?</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Uh, I think that's pretty standard. What do you normally do for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> I just grab stuff from the breakroom fridge <em>[chuckles].</em> It's a great thing about working with the anomalous, plenty of reasons an employee's lunch could go missing.</p>
<p><em>[Bohart begins walking backwards, looking at the opposite direction.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Vince, look out behind y—</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Whoa!</p>
<p><em>[Bohart slips and falls on the recently cleaned floor, landing on top of the wet floor sign.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> You okay there?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8913 becomes uproarious in volume, reaching 180 dB throughout the site.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> About as good as someone who just fell could be…</p>
<p><em>[Bohart attempts to stand but slips on the wet ground again. His left shoe slips off and hits him in the groin.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Let me help you up.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8913's laughter appears to become labored, with various previously laughing voices beginning to cough.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> <em>[Gasping]</em> I uh, I don't want to get up and fall again.</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Come on now. Don't be like that.</p>
<p><em>[Goode helps Bohart to his feet, but his glasses fall from his face and hit the ground. One of the lenses is cracked.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Great. Just fucking fantastic.</p>
<p><em>[Bohart bends over to pick up his glasses and puts them back on.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> There you are. Alright, let's go get you an icepack from the cafeteria.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8913's laughter has been largely reduced to coughing and wheezing and lowering in volume.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Let me just get my shoe. Fucking laughing Site.</p>
<p><em>[Bohart's glasses drop from his face again, and he accidentally steps on them. The glasses are broken beyond repair.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8913's volume has become minimal, with very few voices still wheezing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> I uh… I'm sorry Vince. At least the Foundation has good optometrists, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> I guess. Especially now that I'm getting a promotion, right?</p>
<p><em>[Bohart bends over to pick up his glasses and shoe. As he fully leans over, he expels flatulence.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8913 produces a final, hacking cough, then ceases.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> Oops. Excuse me.</p>
<p><em>[There is a ten-second silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Vincent, I think we just successfully decommissioned 8913.</p>
<p><strong>Bohart:</strong> We?! What do you mean we?!</p>
<p><strong>Goode:</strong> Okay, don't get mad at me, but…</p>
<p><em>[Goode turns off his recording device.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-8913 has failed to manifest in Site-333 following this event. Director Goode was commended for utilizing Bohart's accident-prone nature to the benefit of the Site and Dir. Bohart was awarded a free meal voucher redeemable in the Site's cafeteria. The anomaly's documentation is currently pending reclassification to Decommissioned.</p>
