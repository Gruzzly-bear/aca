<p>SCP-5013, 20m past outer boundary.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5013</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter surrounding SCP-5013 at a distance of 1 km is to be patrolled by 20 armed guards in rotating shifts, quartered at Site-5013. Civilians approaching this zone are to be diverted. All internal exploration and research on SCP-5013 should be conducted by D-class personnel. No Foundation personnel are permitted entry to SCP-5013 without Level 4 staff approval.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (05/05/2019):</strong> Following Incident 5013-1, all individuals exposed to SCP-5013's effects are categorised as ATEN-class memetic hazards, and require immediate quarantine and neutralisation. Perimeter security duties have been allocated to the newly established MTF Theta-1 ("Locke and Key"). All entities emerging from SCP-5013 are to be terminated on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5013 is an anomalous region approximately 10km<sup>2</sup> in size, located at coordinates [REDACTED], in southern Yunnan Province, China. The area contains wild forest, the remains of terraced fields and a village with 43 buildings, located at the approximate center of the zone. The last evidence of human habitation within SCP-5013 is dated to the 1920s.</p>
<p>SCP-5013 is covered in constant fog. While this has an unremarkable chemical composition, it has been observed to exhibit cognitohazardous properties, with the potential to induce confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, and feelings of déjà vu or jamais vu. These increase in intensity relative to proximity to the center of SCP-5013.</p>
<p>The amnestic effect of SCP-5013 is likely responsible for its other cognitohazardous properties. This effect primarily acts on memories of affected individuals under active recall while within SCP-5013. This has a secondary effect of causing disorientation, and making exit of SCP-5013 difficult. While protective gear is able to mitigate the effects of exposure, the intensity of SCP-5013 upon entry to the village is severe enough to prevent exit entirely, and personnel who enter this zone are unable to be retrieved. Mnestic drugs have been unable to prevent the effects of SCP-5013.</p>
<p>Hallucinations within the buildings of SCP-5013 generally reflect other indoor environments. These phenomena have not been observed to repeat. Whilst the content of these hallucinations generally reflects real-world, non-anomalous locations, clear identification of any of these locales has proven difficult. It is unclear whether this is a consistent property between hallucinations or an expected result of the cognitohazardous effects of SCP-5013. Poor identification of these locations in interviews with relevant civilians was initially thought to simply reflect their non-existence, but experimentation has noted that locals were more likely to report difficulty recalling a similar location, rather than non-recognition (when compared to subjects presented with fabricated control locations). Further experimentation into this phenomenon is ongoing. A brief list of reported examples is listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A dacha of East German construction, converted into storage space and filled with tools and a Trabant car in poor condition.</li>
<li>A Mesoamerican ruined pyramid, not corresponding to any discovered structure.</li>
<li>A mid-20th century house built in the <a href="/scp-3919">Czech Functionalist style</a>.</li>
<li>A home in a submerged Nubian village, c. 1970.</li>
<li>An abandoned Greek Orthodox church on a hill overlooking the city of Trabzon, Turkey.</li>
<li>An empty, partially constructed building in the Argentine city of <a href="/scp-2303">Ciudad Encrujiada</a>, with design suggestive of a convention center/exhibition space.</li>
<li>A room of the Forbidden City in Beijing, not matched to any existing structure. <a href="/wrong-proposal">A stack of papers bearing Foundation insignia is visible on a table.</a></li>
<li>The bridge of an unknown <em>Gazelle</em>-class cruiser of the Imperial German Navy, wrecked on a tropical island in shallow water.</li>
<li>A cave in a desert climate, containing a 20-meter high statue of the Buddha.</li>
<li>An Iranian coffee-house interior <a href="/scp-3501">of 17th century design.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>No persons have been observed in these hallucinations at any time.</p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 01/04/2019</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> First manned incursion following drone-based exploration, which mapped the area and collected soil, water and air samples, with no anomalous properties detected. One member of D-class personnel (D-724) was equipped with a two-way radio, video and audio recording equipment, a gas mask, a head-mounted lamp and 1 day of rations, with instructions to proceed to the central village within SCP-5013 and report their experiences.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> D-724, do you understand the mission? You are to walk directly down this path, straight ahead to the village. Report everything you see. We will give you instructions on when to return.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Yeah, I heard you at the briefing. What's so special about this place, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> That's your job to find out. There's no sign of anything hostile in there, and all the samples we've taken are safe, but be careful. Don't touch anything without our permission.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Sure, I bet it's totally fine, that's why you're sending me instead of one of you guys. Why did you even give me a mask, then?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> It's a standard precaution. You're free to return to your previous work detail if you don't like what's happening.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Okay, okay, I'm going.</p>
<p><em>D-724 enters SCP-5013.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Strange fog for this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> Keep going and tell us if you experience anything unusual.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Nothing yet. I see some trees, pools of water, there's a wooden fence on my right, what can I tell you?</p>
<p><em>[D-724 continues walking down the path in silence for 12 minutes. Apart from the presence of fog, no anomalous activity is apparent.]</em></p>

<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> That's your objective. Keep going and this will be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> You didn't tell me about any village.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> 724, we went over this in the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> This isn't a game, 724. It's in your interest to stay alert and do your job properly.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> What the hell are you talking about? What job?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> 724, you need to… hmm. Okay. Just proceed to the village and report on what you see.</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Uh, if you say so.</p>
<p><em>[D-724 enters the village. Camera movements are consistent with distress and agitation.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> Are you all right, 724?</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> What - what's going on? Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> Take a breath, 724. Do you see something unusual?</p>
<p><strong>D-724:</strong> Who - who are - 这是什么?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[D-724 begins touching the gas mask and radio headset in confusion, then begins to remove them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> D-724, stop that immediately!</p>
<p><em>D-724 does not respond and becomes increasingly agitated. He discards the gas mask and communications equipment, with the camera landing on the ground. He runs down the village street, out of view.</em></p>

<p><strong>E2:</strong> You mean we're better at being expendable in a skip that makes you go crazy. Fucking hell.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> You've been selected for this mission because you're skilled generalists with cognitohazard experience. Captain Nguyen has authority to abort if your assessment on the ground requires it.</p>

<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> Confirmed, no abnormal readings on our end. Are you clear to proceed?</p>
<p><strong>E1:</strong> We can proceed. I've seen worse coghazes on TV.</p>
<p><strong>E3:</strong> What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</p>

<p><strong>E3:</strong> Yeah, it looks different - ugh, and that buzzing?</p>
<p><strong>E1:</strong> You don't see it? Looks like we got our coghaz. Control, can you give us a visual assessment?</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL:</strong> I'm seeing an empty room with some plants and rubbish. Computer scan isn't picking up anything unusual. I can get back to you with a full anomaly pattern search in about thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>E1:</strong> Okay. I see someone's bedroom, looks like a city somewhere in Europe, style nineteen- thirties maybe? Looking out the windows on that wall - I see a castle, two bridges, nighttime outside. No people around, but I hear someone yelling. German? Okay, it's stopped. Zhou? Zimmer?</p>
<p><strong>E2:</strong> I'm with Control on this one. Nothing here for me.</p>
<p><strong>E3:</strong> Uh, I'm looking at some jungle - I thought it was just normal, but the plants look different to what we've seen around here, and there's a bit more light - there's this buzzing, doesn't stop. Sounds like a lot of bugs.</p>

<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> Forget it. Look, Chris, I'm pretty on edge right now. I don't want to bite your head off, but someone has to answer for the Captain and Zimmer having their brains scrambled by a coghaz. How could you do this to us?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> I - I'm not sure - okay, I'm not going to make excuses, but you know there are things I need to get clearance for to tell you. I'm going to recommend an inquiry, and I'm willing to take responsibility, but the medics have only had a day to look over Nguyen and Zimmerman. They still have a fighting chance, our mnestic treatments are a lot better than they were in the nineties.</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> I'd find that more reassuring if you'd let me see them.</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> That's out of my hands, but I think they're off-site now.</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Let's get this over with, then. What did you need to ask?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> We're trying to figure out why you weren't affected by the anomaly. We've got one working theory - but anyway. You <em>weren't</em> affected, right? From the reports when you got back to the Site and reviewing the footage, nobody noticed anything, but anything we might have missed?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> No. I walked through that whole damn place and didn't have any visions, didn't forget my name, uh, but there was - can we go off the record for this? … guess not. Just don't dissect my brain or anything. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm misplacing small things. My phone, my watch, being a few days off on the date - but I've had a rough couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> That's fair. I don't think I can make anything of that. You'll need a medical, still.</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><em>[ANDERSON is silent for 90 seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> You don't have anything else for me?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> Hmm? Sorry. I just - never mind. What's your opinion on… on amnestics?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> I've taken my fair share. I know the last time was about two years back? Can't tell you what for. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> Sounds about right. I've consulted the dispensing records and you've been on amnestics every… a lot of times… since you joined up. You must have been on a rough detail before I met you.</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> I wouldn't know. <em>(laughs dryly)</em></p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> Well. The point is, the, um, Captain… Captain Nguyen… yes. He never took them. Right? You knew that?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Yes, now you mention it. It was a moral kind of thing, like feeling obliged to remember what he's done. I thought it was pretty stupid, but I respected that, in a way. You - you think I have some kind of immunity? That he didn't?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> Immunity? Yes. Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> And Zimmer, he probably had a few, newbie, seen some things he wasn't cleared for, but not as many as an old lady like me. Sound about right?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> Zimmer?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> You know, Corporal Zimmerman. You're not going off on me too, are you, Chris?</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Earth to Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> I - who's that? Anderson?</p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Chris, if this is a joke, it's not fucking funny.</p>
<p><strong>ANDERSON:</strong> I - I - I - <em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHOU:</strong> Oh, shit.</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION</span></h4>
<p>Due to the exponential increase in ED-K-Class events, instability in the documentation for SCP-5013 is anticipated. Instability in other documentation dated beyond June 2019 is also a possibility. All personnel with clearance should take appropriate cognitohazard precautions. While the vector of transmission of the phenomenon is unknown, all personnel who experience potential cognitohazardous effects should enact immediate quarantine procedures and alert site security staff.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the <a href="/scp-3848">ED-K-Class Scenario</a>, all pertinent information should be acted on immediately.</p>
<p>— Director, RAISA</p>
