<p>The following is an interview conducted between M-SCP General Alexander and POI: 5782-567-A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Ascertain a simple personality profile of POI: 5782-567-A</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> POI: 5782-567-A</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> M-SCP General Alexander<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> The M-SCP requested an interview request of POI: 5782-567-A to SCP-(5.782×10⁵⁴)-567. The request was granted per negotiations that lasted approximately 179 years.</p>
<p>This interview took place in the throne room of the Midnight Palace on the planet of Gaugamela-VI in UNIVERSE-3☋1⪳1⾝4⚚2⛼⧣.</p>
<p>M-SCP General Alexander brought two guards, M-SCP operative Parmenion (v. ⳝ⊣⌺∈⫻ⷄ) and M-SCP operative Cassander (v. ⩠ⴚⴆ☥⪐ⶎ).</p>
<p>The throne room contained approximately 150 guardsmen. The guardsmen were dressed in purple alloyed thaumaturgic hexanium dotted with turquoise pearlescent beads. They constantly performed kinetogylphs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> using their hands and fingers in order to maintain a Class-M shield around POI: 5782-567-A.</p>
<p>Surrounding the throne of POI: 5782-567-A were alternate versions of the historical figure "The Oracle of Delphi" prostrating to the throne. Floating to the right and left sides of POI: 5782-567-A were two particularly infamous commanders, Class-VI reality bender Parmenion (v. Ⅼ⊎ⲽ⧑Ⲥ⃕☄⠝) and Anomalous Entity ⱗ also known as “Cassander” (v. 5◇7┕⥋⿀⩺).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log, 5:59 am, March 5th, Universal Year: Nineteen Septillion, Two Hundred Fifty Million&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: To whom do I owe the pleasure of meeting?</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: Good day to you, Emperor Alexander. I am a representative of the Multiversal SCP Foundation. I have come today to parlay with you regarding a few topics of which both you and I may find worthwhile.<br/>
<strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: Before anything else, speak your name.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: My given name is Alexander of Argead. I don’t mean to mock you but you have probably met some of us in your conquests.</p>
<p><strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: Haha! No, it's rather sensible of your Foundation to send me to talk with me. And don’t speak around it, you know we will soon fight against you. Despite the outcome of our battle already known, I will make sure that you survive.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: Already known?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: Of course. I will be the victor. I have destroyed dozens of Foundations and will continue to do so for all of time. They are truly the guardians of humanity, certainly one of the hardest foes to best. It is that legacy and respect for why I even meet with you now.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: Thank you for the kind words. I suppose it may be useless of me to ask, but is there any possibility that you stop your aggression on other realities?</p>
<p><strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: …Are you really Alexander? (<em>he snaps his fingers and above him appears about 50 bodies floating wearing white. They have varied physical features, ages, genders, and are all blindfolded.</em>) I collect them, you know. All Alexanders from all across space and time. They fail to best me, and right above you is proof. They always fight, and commendably, that is our way.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: It seems there is still much for you to discover then.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: How dare you! I am a conqueror, a Titan, peerless among all Alexanders. I am not one to submit, unlike you who kowtowed before SCP. Why? They can disappear with one glance of my eye! Parmenion! Make this insect kneel before but do not kill, I need to add him to my collection.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: (<em>grumbles</em>) You are naive, Emperor. You do not know even a drop of reality. (<em>M-SCP General Alexander lifts his arm and points his thumb downwards. Class-VI reality bender Parmenion [v. Ⅼ⊎ⲽ⧑Ⲥ⃕☄⠝ combusts</em>] You think my niceties are something of a weakness!?</p>
<p><strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: Hah! In the endless expanse, is there any meaning for such things? The path of the sword could be the path of falsehood. But if that path leads me to glory, so shall I follow. And if the path of acquiescence leads to eternal happiness, I would rather split my skull than walk that road.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: You think you are all-powerful?</p>
<p><strong>POI: 5782-567-A</strong>: Perhaps I am. Perhaps, I do continue struggling, killing, conquering till the end of everything. Perhaps I die before that. Either case, I will never forsake the honor of <em>battle</em>.</p>
<p><strong>M-SCP General Alexander</strong>: What a fool…Parmenion, Cassander, we are leaving. (<em>M-SCP personnel activate their personal interdimensional transporter</em>)</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 6:07 am, March 5th, Universal Year: Nineteen Septillion, Two Hundred Fifty Million&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Result of Mission</strong>: Referencing this log, Station Beta has recommended that SCP-(5.782×10⁵⁴)-567 be irreversibly contained.</p>
