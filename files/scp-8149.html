<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8149 is to remain in its original location in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. A 20m perimeter is to be maintained around the object under the front of a conservation zone managed by the National Trust.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8149 is an ordinary wooden bench stained dark brown, measuring approximately 1.8 m in length. The bench overlooks a verdant valley of rolling hills and scattered woodlands in North Yorkshire, UK. Affixed to the upper center of the bench’s backrest is a brass plaque engraving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Billy Sherling<br/>
1953–2020<br/>
A heart this world does not deserve</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a person sits on SCP-8149 and looks out over the valley for a continuous period exceeding two minutes, a spontaneous appearance of SCP-8149-A will occur. SCP-8149-A is a middle–aged Caucasian male, approximately 1.75 m in height, with graying hair and weathered features, dressed in mid-20th-century rural attire. SCP-8149-A introduces itself as “Old Bill.” A large Saint Bernard dog (SCP-8149-B), stated to be “Francis,” emerges to lie beside the individual sitting down.</p>
<p>SCP-8149-A exhibits extensive conversational capabilities and speaks on the Subject’s primary emotional or psychological concern. Interaction duration varies but typically lasts between twenty and forty minutes. Subjects consistently report significant emotional relief and reduced symptoms of depression or anxiety following the session.</p>
<p>Following a session in which the Subject attains a self-reported resolution or relief from their concern, SCP-8149-A/B will not manifest again for that subject. Cessation appears permanent for that individual. Subjects who have not yet experienced relief continue to interact with SCP-8149-A/B upon each visit until resolution occurs.</p>
<p>SCP-8149-A’s appearance is restricted solely to the immediate vicinity of the bench. It vanishes instantly if the Subject moves more than 1 m from their seated position. SCP-8149-B remains passively present and does not interact directly, but emits calming vocalizations when SCP-8149-A speaks. No other anomalous properties have been observed.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8149.1:</strong> Discovery</p>
<p>The following report was submitted by Senior Researcher Dr. Alistair Rowe to Site-40 administration on 13 March 2023 while on medical leave. Dr. Rowe had been placed on temporary leave following a period of sustained depressive symptoms.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>On 02/01/2023, while on approved medical leave, I located a wooden bench along an unmapped trail in rural North Yorkshire. The bench overlooks a valley approximately 6.5 km from the nearest marked path.</p>
<p>During the initial visit, I encountered an unidentified older male subject accompanied by a Saint Bernard dog. The subject exhibited familiarity with personal details without prior disclosure and appeared on multiple subsequent visits without detectable approach.</p>
<p>The bench features a brass plaque reading:<br/>
"Billy Sherling (1953–2020)"</p>
<p>Public records confirm the existence of the late Professor William Harold Sherling, who is a retired academic. No records of municipal funding, installation, or maintenance for the bench or plaque have been located.</p>
<p>Between 02/01/2023 and 09/03/2023, I returned to the site on ten occasions. The subject reappeared during each visit. I self-report a marked reduction in depressive symptoms over this period. No pharmacological intervention occurred during this interval.</p>
<p>I have transcribed dialogue reconstructed from an audio recording made unintentionally by my personal field recorder. I have submitted the files for analysis.</p>
<p>- Dr. A. Rowe</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8149.2:</strong> SCP-8149-A/B Encounters</p>
<p>This transcription was reconstructed from an audio recording made unintentionally by Dr. Rowe’s personal field recorder. SCP-8149-A manifests at approximately 2 minutes and 17 seconds after the recording begins.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Wind rustling through tall grass. Birdsong in the distance. The sound of footsteps on gravel. Dr. Rowe exhales as he sits on the bench.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Approximately two minutes of silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Nice view, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Jesus—uh, sorry, I didn’t see you there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Didn’t mean to sneak up on you. Just passing through. Hope I’m not intruding.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> No, I just—uh… weren’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Dr. Rowe scans the area.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You weren’t there a second ago.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Been sitting here a long time, friend. Maybe you just needed a moment before you saw me.</p>
<p><strong>[Audible sound of soft panting. Sound of a tail thumping the dirt once.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> That your dog?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Aye. Francis. He’s old and full of complaints, but he’s good company. Bit gassy in the car, though.</p>
<p><strong>[Dog snorts audibly. Dr. Rowe chuckles under his breath.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Saint Bernard, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Good eye. Don’t see many of 'em anymore, not in towns. He doesn’t care for crowds. Likes the wind out here. So do I.</p>
<p><strong>[Short pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe</strong>: You from around here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You could say that. I spend most days close. Keeps me honest.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>[Four seconds of silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You said “friend.” Do we… know each other?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Not yet. But I’ve seen you out here before. Walking the trails. Always looked like you were working something out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You do seem familiar. That's odd.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Hah. Maybe you've saw me around.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Wind picks up slightly. Leaves rustle.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I didn’t come here to talk.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I figured. Most don’t. Still—here you are.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Wind increases slightly in volume. Leaves rustling.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Right. So what, you just… hang around here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> When the weather's kind. Used to be a teacher, long time ago. Literature. Poetry, mostly. The old kind that scared off the impatient ones.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Sounds exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Oh, it was. But sometimes, someone’d read something and go quiet after. You learn to listen for that quiet. That’s when the real thinking starts.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence lasting approximately seven seconds. Distant birdcall.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You don’t have to say anything. Not yet. Just thought I’d sit a while. Keep the silence company.</p>
<p><strong>[Dog pants. Distant bark echoes across the valley.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> We’ll leave you to it, then. Francis' giving me the look. He says it’s time we head off. He gets moody if he misses lunch. We’ll chat again. We’ll be around. No rush.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Wait—what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Just Bill. Old Bill to most.</p>
<p><strong>[Audible movement as SCP-8149-A stands. Footsteps recede.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Seize life, friend. Until next time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> What—what the hell does that mean?—</p>

<p><strong>[Early morning. Wind moving through tall grass. A lighter flicks, followed by the scrape of a match. Inhalation. A brief cough. A sip from a metal container. Bench creaks under shifting weight.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Footsteps approach slowly on the gravel path. A low grunt as someone else sits.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That whiskey, or coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Shit—uh… Jesus, you scared me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Sorry. Didn’t mean to sneak up on you. Francis wanted a walk. He likes the cold.</p>
<p><strong>[Low tail thump. Dog sniffs loudly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> He always this friendly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> He’s got a nose for good people. And snacks. You holding?</p>
<p><strong>[Brief laugh from Dr. Rowe.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Just nicotine and self-pity.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Ah, a classic combo. Mind if we sit?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You’re already sitting.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Fair point.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence for four seconds. Distant birdsong. The cigarette sizzles faintly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …You know, I've said this last time but… You genuinely do feel familiar. I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Well, we’ve met. That counts for something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> No, I mean—before that. Something about your voice. Or the way you talk. It’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I get that a lot. Maybe I just remind you of someone kind.</p>
<p><strong>[Francis snorts.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Francis, huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s right. He’ll lean into you if he likes you. Don’t push him or he’ll sulk for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Got it. He’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Good ballast. He keeps me from floating off when my head’s too loud.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Rustling leaves nearby. Wind increases slightly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I realized, last time, I never asked your name.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Alistair. Dr. Alistair Rowe.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> A pleasure, Dr. Alistair.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You can just call me Alistair. The “Doctor” part doesn’t really mean much out here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Suits me fine. And you can just call me Bill. Most do.</p>
<p><strong>[Francis pants quietly. Tail thumps once more.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> He always this calm?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Depends on the company. He knows when to make noise and when to just be. I’m still learning.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Rowe snorts. Distant barking from another part of the valley.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You ever get tired of coming out here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> No. It’s never the same place twice, really. It's not when your head’s different each time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I get that.</p>
<p><strong>[Cigarette flicks to the ground. Crunch underfoot.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You don’t say much at first, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Not really. I’m better with silence.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Me too. Nothing wrong with quiet. It’s where the good stuff grows.</p>
<p><strong>[Francis shifts. Two soft pats against fur.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> He’s giving me the look again. Francis says it’s about time to head back. He’s ready for his dinner, and I’ve got some thinking to do myself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> What’s he eat?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Whatever I don’t. Today? Chicken stew and maybe a slice of bread if I’m feeling generous. He’ll guilt me into dessert, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Spoiled.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Isn’t that the goal?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8149-A stands. Low vocalization from dog, followed by the sound of it rising.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You ever want company again, you know where to find us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Thanks, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Seize life, Alistair. Until next time.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You planning to open a pub out here, or just getting an early start?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Breakfast of champions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You look like hell, Alistair.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Thanks, Bill. Real morale booster.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Meant with love, kid. Even the strongest trees lean when the storm’s bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Short exhale of breath.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Bill, can I— can I talk to you about something?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Course you can. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>[Dog tail thumps once against the ground.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> It’s just… I don’t really talk about this stuff. Not to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You don’t have to say anything you don’t want to. Take it one at a time. I've sat here long enough to know all kinds of stories.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Rowe chuckles under his breath.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> It’s stupid, really. I mean, look at me. Full-grown man. Educated. Job most people would kill for. And here I am… hiding whiskey bottles in the grass at what, nine in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Pain doesn’t check your credentials, friend. It don’t care who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> It’s like… I’m so tired all the time. Tired, but not sleepy. Everything just feels heavier. And when I’m alone, it just gets loud. It’s stupid. There’s no reason for it. I have everything I’m supposed to want.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> A heavy heart doesn’t ask for reasons. It just asks for a little kindness… And sometimes the first bit has to come from yourself.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence for several seconds.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Why does it feel like you know exactly what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> 'Cause I’ve sat on that bench too, once. Different town, different sky. Same gut inside.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You ever feel like the world moves on without you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Everyday. But you’re not falling behind, lad. You’re growing roots while the river rushes by. The world will always move fast… but the good things, the real things, they wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> That’s… kind of beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Truth usually is. It’s just ugly getting there.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Rowe wipes his hand across his mouth.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Bill… have you ever thought it’s weird?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> What, me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> No, not you. Well—kinda. This whole thing. You. Francis. This place. It feels like I’m dreaming. But it’s not… bad. It's just… trippy, I guess. Is that the word?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Sometimes the soul remembers things the mind can’t yet explain. And sometimes, maybe, you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>[Long silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I don’t even know what’s wrong with me. I’m not even sure there’s anything to fix.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Maybe there isn’t. Maybe you’re not broken. Maybe you’re just tired. And tired is a thing you can heal from.</p>
<p><strong>[Dog stands suddenly, tail wagging a few times.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Looks like my boy’s telling me it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> He’s got good timing.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> It's work, mostly. And… life, I guess. I work with some of the smartest people you can imagine. Literal geniuses. And half the time I’m just standing there thinking, What the hell am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Impostor syndrome, huh?</p>
<p><strong>[Short exhalation accompanied by low-volume laughter.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Yeah. It's funny. I spent years chasing this life. Degrees, late nights, all that crap. I thought if I made it there, it’d mean I made it somewhere.</p>
<p>But sometimes… it just feels hollow. I don't feel contented at all. I feel… lost.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> friend, sometimes we chase dreams so hard, we don’t notice when they stop fitting us.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you failed, Alistair. It just means you’ve grown.</p>
<p><strong>[Few seconds of silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Bill… can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Always.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe</strong>: Why does it feel like you already know what I’m gonna say before I say it?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8149-A chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Maybe it’s just that pain recognizes pain. Maybe it’s because I’ve seen more storms than most.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Or maybe… it’s because this isn’t normal.</p>
<p><strong>[A brief pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I mean… this place. You. Francis. It’s too quiet. It’s like… it’s like the rest of the world doesn’t even exist out here. And every time I walk away, I feel like I’m leaving something I’m not supposed to understand yet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> There’s a reason you work with such brilliant minds, Alistair.<br/>
You’re one of them. And sometimes the smartest people are the ones who can see what’s right in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You’re… not really here, are you?</p>
<p><strong>[Wind intensity increases.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I’m here where it matters. Not every kind of real needs blood and bone.</p>
<p>[Brief silence.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Are you dead?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s not the important part, friend. The important part is: I’m here. I’m listening. I’m staying, as long as you need.</p>
<p><strong>[Extended silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Okay. I don’t know how to do this, Bill. Living, I mean. Some days it feels like I’m just… breathing out of habit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s enough, some days. You don’t have to soar every morning. I'm proud of you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>[Short silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You’re not a failure because you hurt. You’re not broken because you struggle. You are surviving something enormous, Alistair. That makes you extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>[A long breath from Dr. Rowe.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You sound like you’ve said that before.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Maybe I have. Maybe I needed to hear it myself once, too.</p>
<p><strong>[Dog stands, tail wagging lightly. It noses SCP-8149-A's hand.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Looks like my boy’s got dinner on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> He’s got priorities, huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Smartest one of us all. You take your time, Alistair. No rush. Healing isn’t a race. It’s a garden. You plant the seeds, and you wait. And you learn to be patient with yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Thanks, Bill. For… all of it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Seize life, Alistair. Until next time.</p>

<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Approaching steps on gravel.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Morning, Alistair.</p>
<p>[A brief pause.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Well, would you look at you. You’re walking like the weight’s a little less today.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I guess it is. It's been… better. Not perfect. But better.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s all anyone can ask for. Sit, tell me everything.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Rowe chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I, uh, started writing again. Just stupid little stuff. Journaling, mostly. Helps to get the noise out of my head. And I finally called my sister back. She about cried when I spoke.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Families are good at waiting. And forgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Yeah. She said it didn’t matter how long it took. She was just happy I was still here.</p>
<p><strong>[A low-volume, subdued laugh]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s love, plain and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I’m starting to get it. And I stopped drinking. [grins sheepishly] Mostly. Slipped once or twice, but… you were right. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about sticking with it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Progress, not perfection. Always.</p>
<p><strong>[A long pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You know… from our last discussion, I’ve been thinking a lot about this place. About you. About Francis.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Dangerous habit, thinking too much. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I can't help it. It’s my job. I'm curious about your story, Bill. You… you're here because you never left, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You stayed because?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Francis… and a few other things.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I was tired, Alistair. I'd lost people I loved. Watched the world change faster than I could keep up. And when Francis went… it felt like the last thread snapped. I came here… our favorite place and I just… let go.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You mean…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I died here. Quietly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You don’t seem angry about it.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8149-A chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> What’s there to be angry about? Life is a loan, not a possession. We all give it back eventually. I just… handed mine in a little early.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> And you stayed. Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> I thought I was finished and I had nothing left to give. But something held me here. Maybe it was regret. Maybe it was love. Maybe it was mercy. Maybe I stayed because someone else would need a place to sit down someday. Someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>[The breeze stirs the leaves.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You helped me when you didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Maybe helping you helped me too. Maybe that's what saves us, in the end. Not being remembered. Not being important. Just… being there for someone when they need it.</p>
<p><strong>[Sounds of thumping. SCP-8149-A chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> Looks like my boy’s telling me it’s supper time.</p>
<p><strong>[A brief pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> You'll be okay, kid. I’ve seen it in you from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Thank you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8149-A:</strong> No thanks needed. You’re doing the hard part. I’m just the old man with a dog.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> …Bill?</p>
<p><strong>[Soft rustle of fabric as he sits on the bench. A distant birdcall. Wind through trees.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> You really gone this time, huh?</p>
<p><strong>[Clink as he lifts and sips from a cup.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> I was gonna tell you… I finally slept through the night. First time in months. And I booked that trip to see my sister. She’s got a cat now. Not a dog, but it’s something.</p>
<p><strong>[A quiet chuckle.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rowe:</strong> Seize life.</p>
<p><strong>[Long pause.]</strong></p>
