<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4123 is contained in a standard secure containment room in Site-137.</p>
<p>Aside from standard containment teams, a team of volunteers from the Department of Anomalous Ambassadors has been assembled with the purpose of playing a game with SCP-4123 once a day. Team members are expected to have a Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) of 15, be knowledgeable about board games and sports, and have at least minimal survival skills. Members are not expected to partake in the containment efforts every game, but it is recommended to participate whenever possible. Any and all SCP-4123 volunteers may consult Agent Gene (the current supervisor of the SCP-4123 containment team) to join.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4123 denotes a dark brown attache case with two cartoonish white gloves that float directly in front of the case. The gloves are sapient, and will animatedly move around to express thoughts.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> They will frequently manifest various objects from within the briefcase, which they will then use to organize games with nearby persons. However, the case appears non-anomalous when opened by a human and will always contain a third inanimate white glove. SCP-4123 has never retrieved the third glove for unknown reasons and vehemently denies its existence.</p>
<p>SCP-4123 will float to the nearest individuals to ask them to play its games, and is capable of teleportation if no individuals are nearby. It will continually poke them on the forehead until they participate in the game. The longest that someone has gone without participating in a game is three months of continual poking, after which they were sent to the site psychologist for forehead-poking related mental trauma. An x-ray later revealed a harmless small dent in their skull in the location that they were poked.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-4123 was discovered by three Foundation staff at a containment strategy meeting. The following transcript was recorded.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> -and that is why this will increase containment effectiveness by 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Thank you. Is there anything else on the agenda today?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 manifests in the room. Everyone turns to look at it.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Um… What is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> Did this escape from the disembodied salesman containment?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 holds up one finger of its right hand, and pulls a chess knight out of the briefcase with its left. The right hand then snaps its fingers as SCP-4123 approaches Agent Torres, handing him the chess piece.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> What is this? Is this like some kind of random surprise test for agents?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> No, games are strictly banned at all our tests. They have a <em>history</em> of distracting the examiners.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Torres reaches out and grabs the chess piece. Exterior footage of the room displays all contents of the room being sucked into 4123’s briefcase.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Interior footage of the room displays that the room has changed: there are black and white squares all over the walls, the window that previously overlooked the Manhattan skyline now overlooks a medieval castle and the table in the middle of the room now has a chessboard on top of it. The three staff are seated across an entity resembling a large man with a horse head.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The large man with a horse head neighs and points at the pieces on the board.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> Oh, this is chess! Let me play, I'm great at chess.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Are you sure? I have never seen you play.</p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis</strong> I was the top player of my chess club in third grade.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Logistician Pavlis moves a pawn. After a few seconds of contemplation, the equine figure eats the pawn. SCP-4123 hold up a sign with the words “<strong>7 POINTS!!!</strong>”.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> I…what?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene and Agent Torres look at each other for a moment then both give an exasperated sigh. Pavlis stares in shock.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> I think we need to eat the pieces.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The equine entity neighs. Agent Gene and Agent Torres each grab a chess piece and put it in their mouths. Logistician Pavlis refuses to eat a piece out of principle.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Thish ishn't ash bad ash I thought. It tastes like chocolate.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Torres immediately spits out the chess piece and begins panting rapidly. Analysis later showed the chess piece to be made entirely out of capsaicin.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 awards zero points to Agent Torres, ten points to Agent Gene, and a yellow penalty card to Logistician Pavlis. It then manifests a small trumpet out of the case and blows a victory tune. The camera shakes again, signifying a return to the baseline meeting room. Agent Gene and Logistician Pavlis are standing, confused. Agent Torres is still panting rapidly.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>SCP-4123 was moved into containment following this event.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1: Game Logs</strong><br/>
After being acquired by the Foundation, it was noted that the content of the games organized could be influenced by handing items to SCP-4123. This log is intended to record the most notable items presented and the resulting games:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<td>Item Presented</td>
<td>Game</td>
<td>Observations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A birthday cake</td>
<td>A large birthday cake was created and a variety of cake-measuring instruments were provided. Participants were encouraged to use the instruments to guess the size of the cake, and the participant which guessed closest was declared the winner. Participants were explicitly banned from using their own measurement tools, citing that it would provide an unfair cake-measuring advantage.</td>
<td>Participants in this game were very hesitant to touch the cake, as they feared it might be poisonous. However, the provided measuring implements indicated that the cake was simultaneously nutritious and delicious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A ping pong ball</td>
<td>A tabletop tennis match with three color-coded balls that signified that each had to be scored by a different player. Scoring a ball of the wrong color caused the player's nose to temporarily physically change to the color of the ball. Scoring a ball of the correct color also caused the player's nose to change to that color. It was unclear whether the color change is a penalty or a reward.</td>
<td>The participants of this game were colorblind, and were unable to effectively play the game as a result. SCP-4123 expressed regret and changed the game to a normal table tennis match. It appeared to be depressed as a result of its original game not being played, but the participants stated that they had fun despite not playing the intended game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A bag of dust</td>
<td>The participants were judged by how large of a bite they could take out of a pile of dust while <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> by Queen played in the background. Notably, singing the song results in a penalization card by SCP-4123.</td>
<td>At the start of the game, participants were instructed by researchers to not eat the dust due to possible negative health effects. However, the participants responded "Don't stop me now, cause I'm having a good time." They were stopped by the researchers and lost SCP-4123's game by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A copy of Dance Dance Revolution</td>
<td>SCP-4123 brought the participants to an extradimensional space where they were instructed to perform a dance-off. Inflatable balloon arrows would fly towards the participants, which they were instructed to dodge.</td>
<td>It was discovered that SCP-4123 has an extreme distaste for <em>La Macarena,</em> as it would incessantly poke the participants if they attempted the dance. This did not stop participants from performing <em>La Macarena.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A calligraphy set stained with green paint</td>
<td>Three rounds of paintball. Any time a participant was struck with a ball, they were only allowed to reenter the game if they recited a poem about their feelings of the game.</td>
<td>The majority of players expressed significant enjoyment of the game in their poems. SCP-4123 clapped after every poem, despite snapping being proper poetry etiquette.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Addendum-2: Game 423</strong><br/>
On October 18th 2024, Agent Gene entered SCP-4123's containment chamber one hour before the scheduled play session.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene enters. The anomaly is floating on one corner, playing a tune by rapping its knuckles on the wall.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Hey there, 4123.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 spins around slowly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Brought you something. <em>&lt;Agent Gene produces a deck of cards from one of their pockets.&gt;</em> See, I've played a lot of your games, nearly every day, and I realized something. You never play. You're always moderating or watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 is motionless&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> So I thought to myself, why not include you in a play session? It could be fun.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene sits on the floor and SCP-4123 approaches them.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> I assume you know how to play Slap.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 lowers itself to Agent Gene's level, leaving the case on the floor and taking half of the cards.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Let's start, then!</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 immediately lightly slaps Agent Gene's face with the cards. Agent Gene stops for a moment, stares at SCP-4123, then sighs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene</strong> Alright, I guess you don't know how to play.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene teaches SCP-4123 how to play Slap. It initially appears hesitant to slap the cards, but eventually starts to play the game at the same speed as Agent Gene.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene and SCP-4123 play for an hour until the scheduled time for the enactment of SCP-4123's procedures comes. The containment team slowly filters in, watching respectfully as Agent Gene and SCP-4123 play for another three minutes before Logistician Pavlis joins in. Slowly, the other three present members of the team join, playing and laughing for another hour.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> C'mon Pavlis, take your turn already.</p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> Hold on, I gotta respond to this text-</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 proceeds to poke Logistian Pavlis until he puts his phone away. The other participants agreed that Pavlis was being rude.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> Fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> And… I win!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> Oh, come on! I was so close!</p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis:</strong> Well, maybe next round. <em>&lt;They look at SCP-4123&gt;</em> Do you want to play another? <em>&lt;SCP-4123 seems unresponsive.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> Uh, hello? 4123?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 grabs its briefcase, opens it and takes out a medal. The two gloves slowly glide towards Agent Gene, placing the medal around their neck. Sounds of cheering can be heard coming from the third glove inside the briefcase.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Gene:</strong> Thank you?</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-4123 goes back to its briefcase, closing it. The cheering abruptly stops. Then it grabs the briefcase and retreats to a corner of the room.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Logistician Pavlis</strong> And now, what do we do? Is the 4123 game session over or…?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Torres:</strong> It sure seems so.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Gene seems to be deep in thought, looking at the medal they received. The rest of the group leaves the room. After six minutes, Agent Gene leaves too.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>SCP-4123 has not organized any games following this event, even when prompted by personnel. However, it is a willing participant of any games organized by Foundation staff, with "Slap" appearing to be its favorite game. It remains in a corner of its containment room playing "rock, paper, scissors" with itself during its free time.</p>
<p>The medal received by Agent Gene had the following text engraved in it: "winner of my first game". Agent Gene has been allowed to keep it.</p>
