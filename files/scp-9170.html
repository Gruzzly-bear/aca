<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area where SCP-9170 is located has been acquired by the Foundation under the cover of a military training ground. This has been designated as Site-BH/35.</p>
<p>Site-BH/35 is secured with 2 metre high wire fencing topped with barbed wire that runs the length of the perimeter. A 3 metre gap for security patrols has been left followed by a second identical wire fence which runs parallel to the first. This is designed to be sufficient in keeping members of the public out, while not standing out as more excessive security than a typical Ministry of Defence site located close to a civilian area.</p>
<p>Any facility staff or D-Class personnel should be subject to enhanced screening before being assigned to Site-BH/35. These should be repeated on a daily and monthly basis as required - see addendum 9170-A for an up to date list of what should be covered during these checks. Class-B and Class-I amnestics should be kept in stock and should be administered in line with protocol and under the clearance of the site director or a containment specialist. Exceptions should be made to security personnel and researchers not permitted to enter SCP-9170 as standard screening required for employment at the relative clearance levels has been risk assessed to be sufficient in these cases.</p>
<p>Personnel are to only wear the shoes and overalls provided when entering SCP-9170 and any items or equipment taken inside must have first been cleared by a containment specialist. Digital recording equipment such as cameras are prohibited by default.</p>
<p>Currently no effects of SCP-9170 have been observed outside of SCP-9170 itself, however, ongoing monitoring is required both inside SCP-9170 and the area around it in line with addendum 9170-B.</p>

<h1 id="toc0"><span>WARNING</span></h1>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>While SCP-9170 is not classified as an infohazard, it is recommended that the following description and addenda are only read by personnel not (re)entering SCP-9170</span></h3>
<p>This recommendation can be overruled by any on site staff with Level 3 clearance or above on a need to know basis</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9170 is a two story, Craftsman-style house built in the 1920s, located in the South West of England. Local maps and signage are consistent in the address being recorded as No. 17 Gorse Avenue. The other 34 houses on Gorse Avenue are similar in style and further details have been omitted from this report due to their non-anomalous nature. They are currently used to house staff, and to store equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>SCP-9170 appears to have no anomalous preservation properties and requires standard external upkeep as would be required for a building of this era and location.</p>
<p>Entry into SCP-9170 by cleared persons, through both personal info checks and the use of amnestics, should only be permitted on days cleared by the site director. Where possible, personnel entering SCP-9170 should not be familiar with the contents of this document as entry to the house is a critical risk should any occupant become aware of the number “17” in relation or significance to themselves. In the event of triggering SCP-9170 with an accurate mental or verbal connection between the occupant and the number “17”, all sapient occupants will suffer instantaneous death simultaneously. All autopsies on recovered corpses have shown the cause of death to be cerebral anoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain). Any other internal or external trauma has been explainable either by existing conditions prior to entering SCP-9170, or injuries sustained during collapse post death.</p>
<p>While SCP-9170 poses no current risk when not interacted with, testing required to document comprehensive safety procedures to allow exploration, with the aim to establish any potential increase in the area of effect due to structural degradation, has been deemed necessary. It is still unknown what is causing/limiting the area of effect of the termination.</p>
<p>The Foundation first became aware of SCP-9170 from local police and newspaper reports from 1971 - 1986 detailing an unusually high, and slowly increasing, number of unexplained deaths at the property. Due to the non-violent nature of the deaths, the house was only ever subject to local speculation and rudimentary investigation, and never received national mainstream attention. By 1986/3/25 all properties on the road had been acquired by the Foundation and the area was converted to Site-BH/35.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re:Re:Re: Preparations for next year</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Site Director,</p>
<p>I have escalated your suggestions, questions, and the majority of your demands where applicable and have received an unequivocal refusal to any and all requests for D-Class personnel to be requisitioned for use during the year 2017 citing:<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>"There are no plausible advancements in understanding or containment regarding SCP-9170 that would be significant enough to warrant the intentional loss of life at the scale required for testing to take place next year."</em></p>
</div>
<br/>
Therefore, you are not only prohibited from authorising or engaging in any supplementary testing from 2016-12-30 to 2018-01-02, but contact with SCP-9170 should be kept to the strict minimum required to maintain structural integrity and containment.
<p>I trust this answer will suffice and will not require any additional follow up conversations.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Piper, C (Ethics Committee Liaison)</p>

<h4 id="toc4"><span>[Summary]</span></h4>
<p>This is a record of the events leading up to the unfortunate death of Dr. Neeta Booker.</p>
<h4 id="toc5"><span>[Timeline]</span></h4>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wed 1995/03/22<br/>
<strong>6:45am</strong> - Dr. Booker leaves her Site-BH/34 residence of 23 Gorse Avenue<br/>
<strong>6:48am</strong> - Dr. Booker signs in to start her shift<br/>
<strong>7:01am</strong> - Dr. Booker hands in completed pre-work questionnaire with the date and time written correctly and as logged here<br/>
<strong>7:05am</strong> - Dr. Booker is provided with a 20mg dose of Class-B amnestics<br/>
<strong>7:06am</strong> - Dr. Booker takes the 20mg dose of Class-B amnestics<br/>
<strong>7:25am</strong> - Dr. Booker arrives at the front door of SCP-9170 and is questioned by security on what the current time is. Dr. Booker’s response is recorded as being “Too early as usual Chaz! Around 6:30 or 7 probably?”<br/>
<strong>7:26:45am</strong> - Dr. Booker is permitted entry into SCP-9170<br/>
<strong>7:27:01am</strong> - Dr. Booker enters SCP-9170 and instantly collapses<br/>
<strong>7:29am</strong> - After retrieval and examination by on site medical staff Dr. Booker is pronounced dead (Update: This has now been confirmed as being from cerebral anoxia)<br/>
<strong>7:36am</strong> - Site Director Pinewood is informed and suspends interaction with SCP-9170 while an investigation led by Dr. Moore takes place into what control failed<br/>
<strong>9:27am</strong> - Dr. Moore submits her initial report that no “17” or “17” adjacent flags had been found on Dr. Booker’s personal file, employment records, or previous pre-work questionnaires<br/>
<strong>10:30am</strong> - A voluntary team of 4 security and 2 research personnel are briefed on the incident and are tasked with searching 23 Gorse Ave. at 11:00am for any references to “17”<br/>
<strong>2:22pm</strong> - The team provide Dr. Moore with an envelope containing an extract of The Gazette of India dated Sat 1995/03/11 and critically, dated Phalguna 20, 1916. The 6 volunteers are provided 20mg each of Class-B amnestics and are returned to their previous duties<br/>
<strong>3:22pm</strong> - Dr. Moore submits her final report concluding that the cause of SCP-9170 being triggered was the knowledge Dr. Booker had of the date being March 22, 1995, which using the Indian National Calendar is Chaitra 1, 1917</p>
<h4 id="toc6"><span>[Further actions]</span></h4>
<p>On Dr. Moore’s recommendations, addendum 9170-A has been updated to include:<br/>
* Additional citizenships<br/>
* Current religion<br/>
* Religious upbringing<br/>
* Cultural upbringing</p>

<div class="title">Footnotes</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Results of these background checks (date, time, DOB) must be logged but any incompatible values have been shown to be effectively countered by the sufficient use of Class-B or Class-I amnestics.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. While age should be checked, the Ethics Committee has explicitly ruled that working under the assumption that someone of 17 years of age would trigger SCP-9170 is sufficient and that testing this <em>“could yield no possible useful results.”</em></div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. This recommendation was from an interning research assistant who pointed out his personal association between a gardening book retrieved from SCP-9170 on worms and his appreciation of the work of Team 17. (Update: This has proved better foresight than initially anticipated with the release and popularity of "Mickey 17").</div>
