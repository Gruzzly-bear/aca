<div class="scp-image-caption show"><tt>Fig. 1.1:</tt> Object recovered from the on-site apartment of Dir. Nike Greaves. Reflective surface rendered non-functional after the appearance of SCP-8804. Engraved on the inside of its frame are the words, "<strong><tt>THE PANTOMIME</tt></strong>".</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-8804 is a molecular genetic replication of Nike Grieves, Director of Sciences at Site-19. It is functionally alive, with a steady heartbeat and breath. To date, it has made no attempts at movement or speech and displays no higher brain functions.</p>
<p>SCP-8804 was discovered on the night of July 29, 2012, prone on the floor of Grieves’ personal quarters at Site-19. The exact cause of its manifestation is presently unknown, but it is believed to be an isolated incident.</p>
<p>At the time of acquisition, the entity appeared as Grieves did on the night of the 29th, wearing loose-fitting clothing and housing an implanted identification chip in its right thigh and left bicep. Genetic samples from both SCP-8804 and Grieves, including skin, hair, and fluids were identical. A small laceration on the left palm, which Grieves had suffered while working the week prior, also manifested on the entity.</p>
<p>Prior to SCP-8804’s discovery, Grieves recorded the following video on his standard-issue mobile device.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[Video Start]</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Grieves sits in the dark, illuminated by his mobile phone screen. He rubs his eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> Okay. Well. I’m recording this at… does that say three?</p>
<p><em>[Grieves glances to the side of the recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> Okay, three in the morning. It’s, um, July 29. I’m sitting on my bed, in my apartment at Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> I just had the weirdest dream. I’m recording this so I don’t forget because it gave me just… the strangest feeling.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves rubs his face with one hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> It was like those dreams I used to have when I was a kid. Aldith, uh, my psychologist, knows. If he ever sees this. He knows.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> Those dreams, yeah. I’d almost forgotten about them, it’s been so long. Anyway, I guess I should explain the dream. I was back in my childhood bedroom. I wake up, for some reason. There’s a noise, or I have to pee. I don’t know. I’m maybe five or six. My bedroom door’s open, and how my house is set up if you walk from my bedroom straight down the hallway, you get to my mom’s room. In the dream, I sit up in bed and I look down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> My mom had this connected bathroom, and I can see that the bathroom light is on, and I hear a noise. I think it’s the shower. I get out of bed, real slow. I don’t know why I’m moving so slow.</p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> I start to walk down the hall, towards the light. I can kind of see steam in the air, from the shower. I walk, trance-like, down the hall, sort of transfixed on the sound. I can’t do anything else except walk along this track.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves leans back and disappears into the darkness of the room. He takes a sip from a glass on the nightstand and returns to the light from the phone.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> When I get to my mom’s room, I turn to the bathroom. And I can see movement from behind the door. The steam’s really heavy now. Thick. I reach forward very, very slow. Grab the doorknob, twist it. Push it open.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves grows quiet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> I step inside, and there’s no one there. The shower’s running but it's empty. God, it’s so vivid. I remember being confused, and I look around for my mom. She should be here, she should be here, I keep thinking. Then I look in the mirror, above the sink.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves stares absently for several seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> My face… it’s all… I can’t remember it exactly, but it’s wrong. I can’t recognize my reflection. Then there’s this wave of nausea and my legs just give out completely. I fall hard, backward. When I hit the floor I remember seeing something standing above me. Just this sort of shape with a head and shoulders. I can’t describe it any other way. It’s not my mom.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves puts his head in his hand and exhales.]</em></p>
<p><strong>GRIEVES:</strong> Anyway. Hope this can be of some help in our next session, Aldith. I’ll try to get some sleep now.</p>
<p><em>[Grieves fumbles for a moment before ending the recording.]</em></p>
<p><em><strong>[Video End]</strong></em></p>

<hr/>
<p>Following this, Grieves slept an additional four hours before being awoken by an unrelated phone call by Site personnel. Grieves describes waking up to his phone ringing and, upon rolling over to answer it, noticed SCP-8804 lying prone at the foot of the bed. Grieves claims he was paralyzed momentarily from the shock of discovering the entity, which he thought to be an intruder. Upon waiting and seeing no movement, he called Site Security per standard protocol.</p>
<p>Agents arrived shortly after, escorting Grieves out and securing the room. SCP-8804 was noticed to be visually identical to Grieves and suspected anomalous in origin. It made no effort to respond to verbal commands by Agents, and it did not resist detention.</p>
<p>SCP-8804 was escorted to a secure cell in Humanoid Containment, where it was then interviewed. Recording is as follows.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>[Begin Log]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER (INT):</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> Do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> Do you know who you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> Is your name Nike Grieves?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> <em>(To attendants)</em> Picking up anything? Nothing on cognitives? Make sure it’s tight enough around its forehead. Yes, like that. <em>(To SCP-8804)</em> Can you feel this?</p>
<p><em>[Interviewer taps SCP-8804’s right hand with a pen. No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> <em>(To attendants)</em> What about life signs? Solid? Really? Run a cognition scan again. <em>(To SCP-8804)</em> We’re running our equipment now to figure out what you are. If you can hear me, this won’t hurt. Trust me.</p>
<p><em>[CRV machine cycles one full rotation. SCP-8804 scores 0.776 on a Veber Cognitive Scale, well below the threshold for sentience. SCP-8804 gives no reaction to the electrical pulses of the CRV machine’s scan.]</em></p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> <em>(To attendant)</em> I’m ordering another barrage of tests this afternoon. We’ll run Hume and Radio, along with whatever Containment deems necessary and humane. I can’t believe these results, though. This must be the lowest score we’ve got on record. I don’t even know if it qualifies for Ethics protections. Shut this equipment down, generate a file. Send a request to get it downstairs, while you’re at it. I need to get the Director on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>INT:</strong> And God, put a blanket over it or something. It's unsettling.</p>
<p><strong><em>[End Log]</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-8804 was determined, after a full round of preliminary testing, to not only be physically and mentally inert, but also devoid of dominant or residual spirituality. As per Ethics Code 99 E.C.C. section 807 (1999), definition of a life form, anomalous objects found to be devoid of spirituality (in conjunction with subsentient results in relevant testing) may be waived of Ethics Committee protections. SCP-8804 was thus deemed property of the SCP Foundation, and its use was left to the full discretion of containment and research staff.</p>
<p>An autopsy of the item was ordered by Director Grieves, who noted a personal interest in the continued research of SCP-8804. The surgery was conducted, and no internal abnormalities were found. SCP-8804 was confirmed to be a perfect genetic replica of Grieves. Internally, the item possessed evidence of concerning genetic mutations. This prompted a follow-up surgery on Grieves, which found these mutations to be present in him as well. Grieves was placed on a long-term treatment plan, with a high likelihood of a full recovery owing to the illness's early discovery.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of SCP-8804’s autopsy, the item showed signs of enhanced regeneration, rapidly healing from the incisions of the surgical robots and completely recovering from the extensive damage in roughly eight hours. The item ceased regeneration once returning to its baseline appearance, making no sign of healing the various damage present upon its initial discovery.</p>
<p>After personal insistence from Director Grieves, and considering the item’s status as a non-protected humanoid, a practical use of SCP-8804 was devised. Over the course of several years, SCP-8804 was acquired by the Department of Medicine at Site-03 and became an asset of the Department’s medical science division. Initially, the object was primarily used as a test dummy for Grieves’ own condition, but soon its use expanded to include patients in various Foundation hospitals.</p>
<p>Owing to SCP-8804’s identicality to a living human subject paired with its enhanced regeneration, the item could be subjected to experimental surgeries or treatments which could be found helpful in determining a proper course of action for a patient.</p>
<p>The item could endure repeated rounds of testing that would be taxing or even fatal for an average human subject, even involving anomalous diseases that would be impossible to research otherwise. Full regeneration would typically occur one to three days after use, but could occasionally be longer if damage was significantly comprehensive.</p>
<p>SCP-8804 quickly became indispensable in the treatment of high-value patients whose survival was deemed a critical priority for the Foundation at large and led to the recovery of numerous Level-4 and -5 personnel who would have otherwise been considered terminally ill. SCP-8804’s use was deemed more humane as a test subject than the traditional sedated humans, and its operation was expanded.</p>
<p>Samples of SCP-8804 were excised and transported internationally to high-value Sites, where testing could be conducted on them in place of humans. In rare cases, portions of SCP-8804 were directly transplanted onto patients in life-threatening circumstances.</p>
<p>Several years after the discovery of SCP-8804, Nike Grieves passed away from complications resulting from various internal mutations believed to have been acquired passively from years of working in proximity to poorly understood phenomena. Below is an excerpt from Grieves’ Last Will and Testament.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p>And on the topic of anomalous assets, I have nothing more to say; all the relevant information has been disclosed to their intended recipients, and procedure forbids me from repeating it here without proper precautions. There remains, however, the issue of SCP-8804, since it is well-known that I’ve developed a particular attachment to the thing.</p>
<p>I have been told of the object’s great help to medical research throughout this organization’s recent past. I’ve spoken to many who have been saved from the tissue samples, blood, and organs of my other self, or of the surgeries tested and trialed on it. I myself have managed to extend my life a few more years thanks to the early warnings of its first autopsy, and the various strategies attempted on it before being used on me.</p>
<p>Even though my condition continues to sap me, I remain ever thankful for the countless hours of dedication given by the wonderful doctors and scientists in this Foundation, and my heart goes out to the thousands of others we could not save. That is why it is my last wish as Director before my inevitable passing that we continue to use SCP-8804 to the best of our ability in the pursuit of medical research. We’ve done great work, but there’s much we’ve yet to discover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a courtesy notice concerning recent developments regarding SCP-8804’s current containment and utilization strategies. The Ethics Committee has concluded its investigation into the usage of SCP-8804 in Foundation hospitals as a reusable test subject for high-priority patients. Following the recent spike in surgical complications leading to the death or dismemberment of patients, the Committee has discovered the majority of errors to be derivatives of practices trained on SCP-8804.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of SCP-8804 was conducted, comparing SCP-8804’s biology to thousands of other genetic makeups in and outside the organization to determine the object’s usefulness as a tool of medicine.</p>
<p>It was determined that the genetic makeup of the initial subject (Director Nike Greaves) had been heavily compromised by several anomalous substances injected into his body habitually during his career as a Foundation administrator. SCP-8804 thus replicated itself to match these deficiencies, which remained undetected for many years due in part to Director Greaves’ personal investment in the SCP-8804 project.</p>
<p>We would like to remind staff that the unauthorized use of anomalous substances is a Class-IV offense and is prohibited on the grounds of termination of employment or the reduction of employee protections.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this time if the anomalous substances used by Director Greaves contributed to his illness and death, or if the defections it caused in SCP-8804 were the sole reason for the spike in recent medical failings. What is known is that SCP-8804 can no longer, in good conscience, be used as a source of medical training or experimentation. The risks of a compromised subject being used as a baseline for surgeries and treatments is in violation of Ethics Code 67 E.C.C. section 555 (2011), protections for patients in Foundation facilities. Thus, SCP-8804 is to be removed immediately from active use and shall be relocated to a bio-anomalous waste facility.</p>
<p>Several members of surgical teams at Site-03 have since emerged with concerns regarding SCP-8804, claiming operations on the object cause significant distress in select individuals, citing feelings of judgment and mockery from the object. This has resulted in the oversight of health and safety procedures and the general misuse of SCP-8804. A formal investigation found these allegations baseless, and the object's documentation remains unchanged. No disciplinary measures against offending staff were deemed necessary considering the object's imminent relocation to deep storage.</p>
<p>SCP-8804 research and containment staff will be reassigned in the coming days. Senior staff will be expected to attend a Q&amp;A session with patients who have undergone SCP-8804-trained surgeries or treatments.</p>

<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> You sure we can be in here? I mean—</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> It’s fine. My card gets us access.</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> But what if someone shows up? Like, a janitor or something?</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> They won’t. No one ever comes down here.</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Trust me. I’ve done this half a dozen times. No one ever checks.</p>
<p><em>[Containment cell door closed. Steffen approaches SCP-8804. It is dressed in a standard issue grey jumpsuit, secured by its wrists and ankles to a steel chair.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> What is it? Is it alive?</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Technically. It doesn’t move or talk or anything.</p>
<p><em>[The two stare at SCP-8804 in silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Watch this.</p>
<p><em>[Lyett unholsters his standard-issue taser and fires it at SCP-8804. SCP-8804 immediately begins convulsing from the electrical charge but does not make any motion to defend itself or otherwise react in any way.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Just relax. See? It doesn’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> What is wrong with you? You’re sick, David. You know that?</p>
<p><em>[Lyett laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Yeah, whatever man. Feels good to use this thing. Since I got it they haven’t let me try it out on someone yet. You ever shot a taser?</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> What? No… why do you…</p>
<p><em>[Lyett forces the taser into Steffen’s hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Give it a try. It feels great. Go on, point it right there and pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> What the hell is wrong with you? Someone’s going to catch us, or notice someone’s fucked with it and they’ll check the cameras—</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> No, they won’t. I already told you, no one’s coming in here. The thing regenerates damage, so there’ll be no evidence. And the camera footage is going to be redacted anyway. I know someone who can do that for us. They’ll need an administrator to even view the footage, and we both know those assholes wouldn’t waste their time on something like this. It’s safe, Steffen. Just give it a try.</p>
<p><em>[Steffen hesitates, then fires the taser. It strikes SCP-8804 in the stomach, and prompts a round of convulsions.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Pretty good, huh?</p>
<p><em>[Lyett pulls the taser from Steffan’s hand and reholsters it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> Can it… you know. Can it feel anything?</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Fuck if I know. They did surgeries on this thing for years, amputations and shit, no anesthetics. The admins didn’t seem to care, why should I?</p>
<p><em>[The two watch as SCP-8804 continues to spasm intermittently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> We should get out of here. I gotta get upstairs, my break’s almost up.</p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> Yeah, me too. Do we just—</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Yeah, just leave it. It’ll be fine.</p>

Identified as Maintenance Advisor Eugiene Wilson, PID-F9K2LM, Security Agent Angelo Alagar, PID-R3W7PX, Computer Service Technician Sean Sherwood, PID-G5L9TY, and Security Agent David Lyett, PID-T4Z8CY. Containment cell door closed. The room is in disarray. Cans of beer and soda lie scattered about the room. A layer of dried blood coats the walls and floor. SCP-8804 shows signs of severe injury. Its chest and neck are riddled with bullet holes, and its clothes are stained a dark red. Some wounds show signs of partial regeneration. Many continue to bleed freely.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The men enter, laughing. Sherwood holds an unmarked bottle and takes a drink. Alagar sits in one of the folding chairs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> Oh shit. It hasn’t healed from last time?</p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>LYERR:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Might be using it too much?</p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> Yeah. Maybe. I think it’s supposed to take a while.</p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> It doesn’t matter. Meat’s meat. Give me that thing.</p>
<p><em>[Wilson gives Lyett a small concealed blade. Lyett approaches SCP-8804, grabbing it by the wrist. He places it on the table, finger outstretched.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Man, that’s fucked.</p>
<p><em>[Agalar laughs.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Lyett turns to them, smiling.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> I saw it in a movie.</p>
<p><em>[Lyett saws at SCP-8804’s index finger. Sherwood stumbles back and retches, but Lyett continues. Eventually, the finger is severed. Lyett uses the knife’s blade to push it around the table. Sherwood continues to dry heave.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LYETT:</strong> Wasn’t so hard.</p>
<p><em>[A cell phone rings in Alagar’s pocket. He answers it, turning away from the group. He speaks softly, and then hangs up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> My fucking… my fucking supervisor is scheduling me overtime again. They still haven’t fixed the fucking air conditioning in the hangar. Pisses me off. Give me that.</p>
<p><em>[Alagar takes the knife and approaches SCP-8804. He stabs it repeatedly in its chest and arms, grunting as he does. He buries it into SCP-8804, pushing his full hand and wrist into its stomach. He wrenches it free, spilling a trail of gore onto the table and floor. His hand is stained red and dripping.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> Pisses me off.</p>
<p><em>[He kicks SCP-8804, sending it falling backward out of the chair. Wilson takes the thermos from Sherwood and drinks, sitting down in a folding chair. Sherwood approaches the now-prone SCP-8804, stepping on its hand. Bones crunch.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> Oh, that feels weird.</p>
<p><em>[Sherwood laughs. Alagar kicks SCP-8804 in the ribs. Alagar gives Lyett the knife, and the men take turns kicking and slicing at parts of SCP-8804. Lyett slices through SCP-8804’s femoral artery. Blood sprays, coating his clothes. Wilson finishes the thermos and throws it to the corner of the room. An alarm on his wristwatch buzzes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Alright. Time to go.</p>
<p><em>[He stands up and reaches for Lyett.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Let’s go, we got to change before we get back on shift.</p>
<p><em>[Lyett continues to slash at SCP-8804, but is pulled off by Wilson and Sherwood.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> Give it a rest, huh?</p>
<p><em>[Containment door opened. Lyett leaves the knife embedded in SCP-8804’s thigh as the four men shuffle out of the room. Containment door closed. A slight wheezing is heard through SCP-8804’s damaged trachea, and its disfigured chest is seen rising and falling.]</em></p>

<p><em>[Containment door opened. One individual enters. Identified as Assistant Thermodynamist Rosam Steffen, PID-F9K2LM. Containment door closed.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 sits in the middle of the room. The table and chairs have been pushed to the side of the room. They are covered in dried blood. Blood and brain matter coats the floor and walls, even reaching the ceiling. SCP-8804’s hands are bound and its arms are lifted, tied to a hanging light fixture. SCP-8804’s clothes have been torn off and added to a pile of trash and empty cans. The entity’s wounds have been continually reopened so as to prevent its regeneration, and blood drips steadily down in lines on its body. Shards of glass are embedded in its skin, and a boxcutter remains lodged in the right bicep. Its eyes are missing. Its teeth have been shattered, and comprehensive damage has been done to its mouth. Its hair has been burned off. Bone is visible through gashes in its chest, and blood exits in bursts with each heartbeat. Its fingers are mostly gone, and the skin on the wrists is raw and bleeding from the rope. The groin is mutilated beyond recognition. One leg is missing at the kneecap. The other foot has been smashed by a blunt object. A needle has been inserted into the neck, and it whistles with each breath the entity takes.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A box of power tools rests beside SCP-8804, along with a propane torch and a bucket of hydrochloric acid. Steffan is holding a baseball bat.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Steffan approaches, stepping around the puddles of blood and biological matter on the floor. He jabs the bat at SCP-8804, watching it sway from the impact. He watches it for a moment. Then, he lifts the bat and swings it sharply at SCP-8804’s head. It strikes squarely on the left cheek, tearing the flesh and breaking the neck. SCP-8804 sways, distorting the lighting in the room.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Steffan swings the bat again, this time splintering the skull. He does this five more times. Eventually, the neck sustains enough damage for the head to separate from the body. It falls to the floor. Steffan turns from SCP-8804 and vomits. Shaking, he drops the bat and stumbles backward. Containment door opened. Containment door closed.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The light fixture holding SCP-8804 snaps from the ceiling and the entity crumples to a heap on the floor. The room is plunged into darkness.]</em></p>

<p><em><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Motion detected. Containment lights activate. SCP-8804 lies, broken, on the containment cell floor. Its severed head lies several meters from the rest of its body. Slowly, in one gentle motion, it sweeps a torn and bloody arm outward and grips the handle of the baseball bat left by Steffen. It drags it inward, hiding it within the folds of its injuries and the trash scattered around it. SCP-8804 returns to an inert state.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Containment lights deactivate.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Containment cell door opened. Lights activate. Two individuals enter. Identified as Maintenance Advisor Eugiene Wilson, PID-F9K2LM, and Security Agent Angelo Alagar, PID-R3W7PX.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Alagar holds a nondescript bottle. Wilson turns to the hallway, looks down both directions, then shuts and locks the door. Alagar takes a drink.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Woah, look at this. Who do you think…?</p>
<p><em>[Wilson examines the severed head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Could it have been…</p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> Wasn’t me. Maybe David? We haven’t been in here all week, though.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> Could it have been someone else? Does someone else know about this spot?</p>
<p><em>[Alagar takes another drink. Wilson begins to sweat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> Hey man, relax. We’re fine. No one else knows about this place. It must’ve been Sean when we were gone.</p>
<p><em>[Wilson continues staring at the crumpled SCP-8804. He begins to shake.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> Here, try some.</p>
<p><em>[He hands Wilson the bottle, then grabs his shoulder.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> Come take a look at this.</p>
<p><em>[The two walk to the side of the room where an arrangement of power tools lay spread on a table.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> David got these from the armory, which has power tools for some reason. Maybe they’re military?</p>
<p><em>[He grabs one and pulls the trigger. The drill bit spins noisily.]</em></p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong> I guess the MTFs need to fix pipes too. Stealth plumbing. Huh.</p>
<p><em>[Alagar laughs. Wilson begins testing out various tools. Neither notice SCP-8804 rise soundlessly from the floor behind them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALAGAR:</strong> I want to try this one.</p>
<p><em>[He reaches for a slim electric saw on the far end of the table. Wilson turns his head at the wet noise produced by SCP-8804 shifting its weight on its mangled feet. Before he turns fully, SCP-8804 brings the baseball bat down on the back of Wilson’s head. Alagar spins, eyes wide, and tries to wield the electric saw in self-defense. He moves too slow, and SCP-8804 swings the bat at Alagar’s hands. They break his bones and Alagar drops the saw, screaming. SCP-8804 brings the bat down on his head hard enough to splinter the wood. The force of the impact also shatters SCP-8804’s already damaged arm. It drops the broken bat, its arm hanging loosely at its side. After a moment, the muscle fibers of the damaged arm reattach themselves.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Behind it, Wilson twitches on the floor. SCP-8804 turns but walks past him. It bends down, picking up its severed head off the floor. It places it on its neck and holds it there. SCP-8804’s regeneration does not mend the damage. The head rests at an odd angle and then falls, splattering. SCP-8804 tilts its body down at Wilson, producing an irregular, breathless sound from its open trachea. It coughs a trickle of fluid, then lifts its arms in a circular motion. Gracefully, it arcs its body over the prone Wilson so that its open neck wound floats above his head. Blood begins to pour freely, covering Wilson and soaking his clothes. SCP-8804 remains in this position as the blood coats and then pools. Eventually, Wilson asphyxiates. SCP-8804 arcs back into an upright position with great control, balancing on the remains of its feet. It holds its arms out, exposing its body to the cell's video camera, then bows.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 bends down and pulls a security clearance card from Wilson’s blood-soaked belt. It limps to the containment cell door and attempts to use the card to exit. Blood has been smeared across the magnetic strip, and the door fails to recognize the card. SCP-8804 tries again, with no success. It lets the card fall from its hand, then begins to pound on the door with a closed fist. Wheezing is heard, and a high-pitched wail escapes from SCP-8804’s neck. With no warning, the containment cell door opens. SCP-8804 leans against the doorframe, then it stumbles out of the containment cell, leaving a thick trail of blood.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Moments later, an alarm sounds as the containment system registers the absence of SCP-8804 from its chamber. A priority four containment breach is sounded. Site-19 enters lockdown. All staff begin evacuation to their designated safe rooms.]</em></p>

<p><em><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Computer Service Technician Sean Sherwood, PID-G5L9TY, runs through the halls of Site-19 Sublevel 11. He is heading for his workstation. The evacuation alarm deafens the hallway microphones. Sherwood rounds a corner and enters the room at the end of the hallway. It’s the technical closet for this sector. His belongings lie scattered on the floor, as are dozens of printed photographs. He gathers them in his arms, tries to shovel them into a nearby pack. The alarm continues to blare and he raises one hand to cover his left ear, continuing to pack his bag with his right. Satisfied, he turns to leave. SCP-8804 is standing in the doorway.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sherwood stumbles backward, blubbering. The pack falls, spilling the photographs. They are detailed images of his and others’ mutilation of SCP-8804 over the previous months.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 approaches Sherwood slowly. Blood continually drips down its chest, arms, and legs, pooling on the floor. A vivid trail is seen leading far behind it. It looms over Sherwood, breathing heavily. Sherwood shuts his eyes and raises his arms above his head, whimpering.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[Inaudible]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> …What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[Inaudible]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> Please don't—I'm sorry, I didn't think—I would have never—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 lifts an index finger to the space above its neck, then holds its other arm at a right angle, pointing to a wall-mounted computer terminal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SHERWOOD:</strong> I don't… Okay.</p>
<p><em>[Sherwood rises and approaches a nearby terminal. He enters his credentials, granting him access to Site-19’s general communication channel. SCP-8804 clears its trachea of blood and viscera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[Inaudible]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 reaches out toward Sherwood, who flinches. It places a bloody thumb on his forehead, then retracts it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8804:</strong> <em>[Inaudible]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 lifts its arms high, arching them and splattering blood on the walls and floor. It pivots harshly, keeping its balance, and moves aside, sweeping a palm toward the hallway. Sherwood slips past, running out of sight. SCP-8804 moves to the terminal, blocking the sight of the screen from the camera. Blood from its hands drips down the machine.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a moment, SCP-8804 steps back. It twirls, eventually settling on the camera. It holds itself at an odd angle, its weight impossibly supported on twisted legs, arms outstretched in grace. After a moment it relaxes, bowing. It turns and limps out of the room.]</em></p>

<p><em><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Assistant Thermodynamist Rosam Steffen, PID-F9K2LM, sits on the floor of a personnel safehouse. The door is sealed, and he is alone. He rocks back and forth absently, mumbling. The breach alarm blares from beyond the door, muffled by the steel locks. He stands and washes his face in the safehouse’s sink. As he dries, he looks at himself in the mirror above.]</em></p>
<p><em>[There is a knock at the door. Steffen turns and approaches the door. He peers through a small slit in the metal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> David? Jesus, David. Is that you?</p>
<p><em>[Steffen places a hand to the locking mechanism, hesitates, then wrenches it open. The door slides on its track. SCP-8804 is standing in the opening, holding the severed head of Security Agent David Lyett, PID-T4Z8CY. SCP-8804’s physiology is greatly degraded. Behind it is a trail of skin, blood, and other organic matter which has ceased regeneration entirely. SCP-8804’s body is mostly skeletal and has lengthened considerably. Its headless shoulders nearly scrape against the ceiling. Its clothes are scarlet rags, draped unceremoniously across its gaunt frame.]</em></p>
<p><em>[It steps into the safehouse, nearing the camera. Its bones are revealed to be composed entirely of a deep purple, soporific sludge which causes them to continuously expand and contract, stretching upward, outward, and inward at once. The sight sends Seffan stumbling back. He screams.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 attempts to place the head atop its oozing neck, balancing it precariously. It then lifts the head and throws it at Steffen’s feet with great force, destroying it. SCP-8804 attempts to lift its arms, but its bones are degrading rapidly and it cannot hold its form.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> I—I let you out! It was me! The others, what they did. And after I—I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 approaches Steffen, extending a nearly aqueous arm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEFFEN:</strong> The door—that was me! Please, don’t…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804 grabs Steffen and pulls him close, lifting him off the floor. SCP-8804's material sloughs to the floor, pooling in a deep purple sludge. The material moves outward, covering the floor and rising up the walls.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804’s mass soon envelops the entirety of the room, having lost all semblance of form. It is utterly total. The room is dark, and within the darkness the body of SCP-8804 melts and reforms, becoming an anonymous black-purple silhouette. SCP-8804 peers into Steffen with a reformed, hollow face. As it stares, the surface of its form begins to smooth over, losing its ripples and instabilities. It grows so still as to become reflective. Steffen sees himself looking back. SCP-8804 laughs from somewhere within and beyond, then it cries, then it screams. It begins to take shape, forming human features. Its skin gains texture and its limbs solidify. Then it hesitates.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8804’s gaze settles onto the mirror above the sink. Its skin ripples once more, and then the matter halts its evolution. It lowers Steffen and approaches the mirror, dragging its half-human form along the floor. It pulls itself up to the sink. It is completely invisible when viewed through the mirror. It reaches out as if to brush the mirror’s surface, but its arm does not meet resistance. It continues this forward motion, letting its head and body follow into the mirror. It slips inside, fish-like. Then it vanishes. The safehouse returns to normal. Steffen lies huddled on the floor, breathing heavily.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Slowly he rises and approaches the mirror. He gazes upon his reflection and finds it is <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7804" target="_blank">foreign to him.</a>]</em></p>
