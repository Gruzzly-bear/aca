<p><strong>SCP-4973 (D-10000), formerly Gordon K. Markovitch.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4973 is contained inside an Incorporeal Entity Vacuum Chamber under constant watch by members of MTF Mu-13 ("Ghostbusters"). Outside the entrance to SCP-4973's containment unit are four Harrington-Hollow Neutralizer Wards situated at the edges of the doorway to prevent SCP-4973 from escaping. The interiors of both the ceiling and the floor have also been lined with nPDNs for security measures.</p>
<p>The Department of Spectral Phenomena are to research methods of amnesticization and site-wide dispersal rituals for phantasmic entities, as SCP-4973 and others like it pose a serious threat to Foundation secrecy.</p>
<p>MTF Sigma-5 ("'; DROP TABLE taskforces —") is to routinely check the SCiPNET Database for any signs of informational breaches or if it was used through anomalous means.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4973 refers to the spirit of D-10000, a D-Class known in life as Gordon Kardivachlus Markovitch<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Prior to SCP-4973's aggressive state, SCP-4973 was originally classified as an "inactive" or dormant phantasmic entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, but quickly became aware of its surroundings and has breached containment numerous times in the past. SCP-4973, through some way, has managed to access the SCiPNET Database Terminal. This has caused SCP-4973 to learn about the numerous anomalous entities and phenomena documented within the database and the identities of the research, security, and administrative staff within Site-30 and its location.</p>
<p>SCP-4973 has been responsible for a total of twelve containment breaches, and has assisted in the suicides of at least six personnel.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> After Foundation acquisition and immediate Class D induction, D-10000 was the subject of 25 controlled experiments involving various anomalous entities and phenomena. Among these experiments included repeated exposure to <a href="/scp-158">SCP-158</a>. D-10000 perished during an experiment with SCP-████; the remains of D-10000 were later taken away to undergo <a href="/scp-2419">processing</a> in a waste disposal refinery nearby. Three months after, personnel reported anomalous activity within the site. Such anomalous phenomena reported has consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexplained noises emerging from the private domiciles of research staff and agents.</li>
<li>An immediate decrease in temperature when approaching the D-Class Block.</li>
<li>Disappearing items and objects belonging to personnel when alone in a room.</li>
<li>Hallucinations of a figure covered in blood and wearing a D-Class jumpsuit, appearing on mirrors or reflective surfaces.</li>
<li>Feelings of dread and being "watched and followed" by an unseen presence among staff.</li>
<li>A dark silhouette running away from view when observing the far end of a hallway.</li>
<li><a href="/scp-2111">Various server errors occurring within the database terminal.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these issues were taken into account, most were largely ignored by Site-30's directorial board, citing that these incidents were due to the increasing amount of mental strain and pressure of working under the Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4973 (D-10000)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Lorraine Casper</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Hello SCP-4973. How are you today?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4973 does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Gordon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> No. Not doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> You have to comply. I just want to know why you did it. How did you access the terminals? How-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> Nah. You're keeping me 'round 'cause you know what I know. And that I know a lotta shit on your goddamn organization, even on <em>you, Lori.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Threatening me or my superiors will not do you anything good. You killed a lot of my colleagues when you were still loose, Gordon.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4973 appears visibly angry. Dr. Casper is later reminded to not aggravate the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> "Gordon"? You trying to appeal to my humanity, doc? There's nothing human left in me anymore. Hell, there's nothing "human" in your job either. C'mon, You fed men, women, and children to these things for Chrissake! And I thought I was a monster for killing a woman!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> You murdered your wife for getting mad at you over dinner. Furthermore, what I do and what my organization does is none of your business.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4973 visibly scoffs at Dr. Casper and begins to rub the bridge of its nose.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> I want to know how you got those files. Those files needed clearance. You don't have an ID and I doubt you have a password in your head.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> And why the fuck would I tell you? I don't have to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> You risk termination if you won't comply. If you think this won't stop us from letting you die a second time, then you're sadly mistaken.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4973 remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Good. Now, how did you access the terminal?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> I- I just- y'know, waved my hand across it. It freaked out for a second and then it just- stopped being all fucked. I could just move my fingers around the air and the tabs would just roll up. Easy as that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> So you could just- what, manipulate the database? How did you even know you could even do that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> Beats me. It felt like some attraction. Like magnets from afar getting closer and closer. I dunno, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> And what about your attempts to breach the containment of all the dangerous anomalies we had contained?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> Huh? Wait, what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> You used the ID cards of Dr. Yurkov and Dr. Orson to release them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> That wasn't me. Wait, you thought that was me who did all that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> I don't know any doctor named Orson or Yurkov. I just grabbed the dirt on anyone and anything I could. I don't- hold on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> Oh- Oh! Ohhhhhh… I get it now! I- Oh, this is so rich. <em>(SCP-4973 starts laughing at Dr. Casper.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> What? What are you laughing about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> God, this whole time, you and your ghost-hunting crew never knew?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> It would make things easier for the both of us if you just-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4973:</strong> Nah. I don't think I will. All this time and you never realized it. God, that look on your face when you find out its been right under your noses this whole time.</p>

<p><em>The following is a transcript of a phone conversation between Dr. Casper to Director Riverson of Site-30.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Hi Eric. It's uh me, Lorraine. You're probably wondering why I called you on your personal line instead of the- the uh… work one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Lorraine? What are you doing calling me on this line? And where the hell are you? You've been gone for a week!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> That's uh… that's because I don't think we're safe inside the site. Hell, I don't think we're safe anywhere in any site at all and I can't take any chances with the work phones in case someone's listening in. Can't take the risk.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Casper clears her throat.)</em> I- uh… I think we might be compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Wh- What? What are you-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Yeah, I know. It's bad. Real bad. Uh… I think it's got something to do with 4973 during the interview. The last one I did with him. He said something about- about something being under our noses. Then he told me that he never did any of the breaches. He denied it all except for trying to hack into the database. We still aren't any closer to figuring out how he managed to do that. But that's besides the point.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Casper can be heard sighing on the other line.)</em></p>
<p>I believe that 497- Gordon was telling the truth, that he never committed any of the breaches. We checked the records too. During his tenure as a Class D, he never encountered Yurkov or Orson in any of the tests. Hell, Orson wasn't even employed until 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Great, but what does that have to do with-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> The breaches? Well, I think that might be because of other spectral forces at work that have it out for us the same way Gordon does.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Wait, you don't mean-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Yes, yes, yes. That's right: Site-30 is infested with the souls of dead Class D's.</p>
<p><em>(There is silence on both lines for a short period of time.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Are you… serious? How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> I did a sweep of the site using what the department has available to detect them. The study of spectral entities is still a new study in the anomalous, but we do know that these things leak out a certain type of energy all the time everywhere they go. It's what people commonly refer to as "ectoplasm". It's some kind of energy that comes off of them. Like when a spider or a snake molts its skin. It's waste, is what I'm trying to say. We found a lot of that residue inside the site, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> How come you only knew about this now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Because dormant spectral entities leak so very little of this essence, that it's undetectable to our equipment. We can't pick any of it up. If they're not aware of what's going on or what's happening, their "bodies" don't emit it in large enough quantities for us to find them.</p>
<p>But Eric, it's not just that. We thought we found the culprit when we bagged Gordon, but we never stopped to think and realize that maybe it wasn't him. We got distracted, and we let the others roam free. Over time, they remembered what happened to them.</p>
<p>There's some good news to this though: We've identified the active ones roaming our facility. Five of them to be exact, and we managed to grab one of them and contain it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> …and the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> That- uh- well, there's probably- no, definitely more inactive ones roaming inside the site. They just haven't woken up yet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Jesus Christ, Lorraine. Alright, uh… you're in charge of site containment effective immediately. There's dozens of these things like 4973 just waiting to emerge and I don't think it's going to go well for any of us if the others realize that every containment breach caused by "human error" is the fault of a poltergeist.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Yes, I know. My team's setting up more work on the equipment to detect them more efficiently. We're drafting up more contingencies for all of this. But Eric…?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> I don't think this is just limited to our site. I think every single facility in the Foundation that has ever used a D-Class in their experiments is also affected by this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> But that's-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> All of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Riverson:</strong> Oh dear God. This is fucked.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Casper:</strong> Sure is. We'll keep in touch, Eric.</p>

Depending on the severity of the trauma received prior to death, phantasmic entities will not remember their previous life before and will often suffer from extreme memory-loss. During this stage, these entities will try to recollect and remember their previous lives in an attempt to reconcile with whatever discourse that has prevented them from moving on. This process may take months, years, and even decades depending on the mental trauma that was inflicted upon the spectral figure before its passing.</div>
