<p>SCP-7761 is the designation for the company owned by the organization GOI-7761, otherwise known as… Allman Financial Solutions Financial Solutions, LLC<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.

Now, pinning down the <em>actual</em> sprawl of this thing would need <em>many</em> Lambda-15s, but for anything more complicated than counting suits through a sniper scope, there's just me.</p>
<p>Current knowledge about 7761 is dense but nowhere near the density required to properly contain and understand its anomalous nature, origins, point of existence, fuckin' anything<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>. All we have to go on right now is transcripts and communiques snagged from the airwaves via our radio-rippers and scanners. Let's add one of those radio rebel call transcripts below.</p>
<div class="text">
<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong>Transcript of SCP-7761 Debt Enforcement Tactics, Captured October 23rd, 1991.</strong></span></h4>
<p>Transcript of intercepted Robocall aimed at one U.S. citizen Adriana Callera. It should be noted that Adriana had completed a five year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of trace amounts of crack cocaine and was currently on probation. Annotation from Elena: she goes to prison for half a decade for seven milligrams she most definitely sat on for her junkie husband-I've seen Robert do three lines with his morning coffee!"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robocaller:</strong> Wazzup, ADRIANA CALLERA, where's your partner in crime?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> Uh, what? <em>Laughs nervously.</em> Okay, okay, very funny. Who's this? Who put you up to this? Was it that dumb bitch Jennifer from the parole board hearing?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> Nah, it's your friends at [Anderson affiliated record company]. We got a hold of the demo tape you've been shopping around behind your hubby's back and we just want to say we think you're rad!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> I…uh…thanks, I guess. Wait, what do you mean "behind his back?" He's…he's been alright with me doing…doing my thing…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> Especially this awesome track from Side B, titled "I'm a snitch bitch who's about to out my husband's drug dealing operation for a lighter sentence?"<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> <em>Get the fuck out of here with that shit!</em> I didn't…there isn't a…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>&lt;Track titled "I'm a snitch bitch who's about to out my husband's drug dealing operation" with a voice forensically indistinguishable from Adriana's singing lyrics implicating her spouse in a street level drug trafficking syndicate in the area.&gt;</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em><strong>Elena's Annotations:</strong> Yup, the piece of shit really was dealing after his wife took a charge for him. I got a copy of her demo tape, listened to it in full. A lot of gems, but nothing about Adriana ratting out her punk-bitch husband was on it. Her police interrogation footage alludes to two men in business suits stalking her and three hours of missing time. Not hard to connect those dots. Poor thing.&gt;</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> That's… that's not me…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> Oh, it's not? That's gnarly. We believe you. Would he? In the slammer? Would his friends? Would his family?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> What do you want? Money? Is he into one of you? We don't have any money! We used it to pay the credit cards down to zero!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> No debts at all-that is <em>tight</em>! We're not debt collectors, though!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> What are you?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> We see a lot of promise in you-it's just a shame no one will loan you any money. That's why we've matched you with an up-and-coming dealer only seven bus stops away from here who has that magic combination of family money, smarts, and a certain sexy Axis 2 personality disorder beginning with the letter 'A'. The only thing he's lacking-in addition to a driver's license and any empathy-is an army of brave and/or desperate dudes and dudettes to traffic his drug package! We think you'd make an excellent match, and have told him you're on your way to take on a consignment of his product-and no money down, although he might come after you if you don't give him good ROI by the end of the month! All that and a bag of chips!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Adriana:</strong> I <em>just</em> got out… <em>you can't</em>… <em>why are you doing this to me!</em> I <em>just got out!</em><br/>
<strong>Robocaller:</strong> Cowabunga, baby! Nothing makes money faster than owing it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suggested Action: Follow up Adriana, see if she was ever allowed to escape. If these freaks have the ability to control even metaphorical debt, the debt between people, then they need to be put in check, if not just <em>put down</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>. We <em>cannot</em> let this continue, even if this new agreement falls apart.</p>
</div>
<p>So far our new comrades haven't seemed to grant us enough of a view into their files for us to even make a guess as to the grasp of 7761 in the global financial sector, but estimates indicate that if 7761 were to spontaneously cease operations, a global economic collapse could be imminent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>. Thank fuck, the powers that be finally trusting me with a juicy one<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>. Included in this documentation will be transcripts and research paperwork indicating the knowledge and powers of SCP-7761 and its constituent elements as they become relevant.</p>
<p>Shit. A meeting. I'll continue this after. These fucking merger meetings drive me insane, and I gotta deal with it.</p>

Afternoon, or morning, Eddie. I'm writing you for a bit of an obvious reason. There's something we need to discuss. It's urgent. I'm getting together a consortium of related businessmen in order to communicate to each other the desperate need we have to resolve it.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The way things are cannot continue. That is a simple fact. What The Boss has done to us is simply an irrefutable fact- he's made us all bitches. He- or whatever he is- has bent us over the railing and is fucking us in the ass like faggots. We all know who I'm talking about.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
What I prpose is this. All of us, at once, cease and any all payments to AFSFS. I know for a fact that will cut of at least 15 mil in raw profit. Then, when he's on his knees, we negotiate, and bend <em>him</em> over the railing. Who's with me?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fucking scumbags can't help but resort to misogynist metaphors. Scumbags.</p>
<p>What a fool. It's unclear whether the Finance Brodollarsigns were aware of the anomalous abilities of The Boss, but shortly after this email was sent, any members of the chain who expressed positive opinions were found dead from various office place incidents. Staples through the eye. Staple removers jammed through cocks. Pens jammed through the eye socket. This adds up to a simple idea, and one I need to run through later in the documentation- that SCP-7761 is able to implant sentient office supplies in the supply chain of other businesses. While these deaths were ruled as suicides (with the shares being vested to the owner's children, go figure) it should be noted the peculiarity of the deaths. However this is done, it needs to be halted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p>And now we have the form break. I swear to fuck they shoulda just let us stay with the old format, but whatever. Fuck, I need to get home. Tomorrow I'll start on the Anomalous Qualities sections. I'll be back for the next section my loves. I hope the merger going through tomorrow keeps yall at my back and under my wing. Ta-ta.</p>

<p><strong>Anomalous Qualities:</strong></p>
<p>The primary anomalous element of SCP-7761 that requires the most coverage is debt, moreover, the knowledge of debt it grants its primary gestalt/drone/king/queen, an entity we know only as the Boss<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup>.

Included in this documentation will be transcripts and research papers indicating the knowledge and powers of SCP-7761 and its constituent elements as they become relevant. Along with this, transcripts of attempted incursions from both Foundation MTFs and some subtler attempts by a PTOLEMY team will be displayed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> Both teams are currently undergoing interspersion procedures to become MTF-Alpha-17, "Officer Supplies," to continue attempts at containment. Well. Not containment anymore. Protecting those in the area.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Any other qualities it possesses are related to its continued existence and maintenance of financial activities on the global market. This includes the physical, noospheric, and memetic structure of the office itself<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-18" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-18')">18</a></sup>, the workers within the office, the Boss, and the financial structures they influence. To civilians, AFSFS markets itself as the ultimate debt collectors/restructurers/managers<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-19" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-19')">19</a></sup>. To those "in the know," which is a majority of the populace with an internet connection and TOR browser ever since 4959, they advertise themselves as the end-all-be-all company for controlling your enemies<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-20" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-20')">20</a></sup>. The way they do this is simple— total control and knowledge of all debt of any kind, formal or informal. Included below is an excerpt of Graver's excellent piece on this subject, <em>Debt</em>. And just put it in the doc below, uh specifically page 4, third paragraph down.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="toc5"><span><strong>Excerpt of Donald Graver's <em>Debt — A Tool, A History, a Defiance, Anomalous</em></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Debt is life, the conjoined-sibling of hope, and which got absorbed into who depends on whether you're holding the stick or getting struck by it. Anyone with a fifth grade education is shown the pornography of debt: indentured servitude, sharecropping, even slavery is predicated on the notion that some people incur debt just by drawing breath on this earth. What is less obvious is how this pornography distracts from the way debt enslaves us all in a pyramid scheme of hope running downhill and resources pouring up, where the hope gets increasingly theoretical the further down you get. Feudalism was premised on a service-for-security exchange where everyone was yoked to their roles by obligations to the daddy above them. Our very notion of the social contract ultimately dips into the rhetoric of our debt to society to explain why we obey the law. From accepting debt for life, to debt for society, we come to the post-modern era of debt for…if we told you, then you'd know. Nobody really knows how in deep they are. Our economic infrastructure is simply too vast. One bank going out of business could lead to a million standing in bread-lines. A pyramid no longer suffices to depict the debt relationships that structure our reality. If it is not the state holding the reins, then who? Those out of the loop will claim 'the free market'. To those acquainted with Anderson Final Solutions Financial Solutions, it is a Beast in Oakleys. And if he told you, then you'd know.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the pack and snort a lot of crack… Hey David. That pallet came today! They get the shipment quick. I hope you enjoy, baby. Plus all my rats are doing well. Stilton, Geronimo, Algernon… I wanna bring them to this shit. I don't know if I'll ever get approved for an emotional support rat. Ir<em>rat</em>gardless, we persist<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-21" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-21')">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>(EDITING BOOKMARK)</p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Qualities: Continued</strong></p>
<p>I know Rhonda hates it when I <strong>bold</strong> the words but I just can't help myself, heh.</p>
<p>The largest anomalous aspect of 7761 is 7761-O, the office constituting the physical address and space of AFSFS. The address for this space is.. currently hidden in the garbage paperwork, but I will reconvene tomorrow. The building itself is approximately five floors in height, composed of average brickwork and architectural design form the outside. Trust me, it's boring as hell. The interior of the office is as-of-yet unmapped and is believed to extend underground a nearly infinite amount<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-22" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-22')">22</a></sup>. Ground scans indicate a structure similar in shape and size to the aboveground building extending down at least fifteen miles. It is theorized this acts as a storage area for information and capital. I still think we should get the Mole Rats in there, but no one ever listens to me<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-23" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-23')">23</a></sup>. The office itself appears to be sapient, sentient at the least, due to the activity observed during "closing time," or when the employees of the business "retire" for the night. Surveillance has captured footage of the interior structure of 7761-O, appearing to show an infinite void of shifting paper<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-24" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-24')">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The secondary manifestation of the anomaly is its employees, 7761-E. We've identified fifty distinct instances so far, each with its desk and daily routines. And I don't mean routine like "eat breakfast, go to work, come home, jerk off, sleep". I mean routine like <em>subroutine</em>. Each week has one of several possible variants, but each of these variants can be documented and timed to the <em>millisecond</em>. And no matter which week it is, the day always starts with them making coffee at six am. I actually used it to set my new digital watch. You know the fuckin' weirdest thing? Some of them even carry on affairs! Like we saw two of the drones having a romantic drink on the roof of the office on the fifteenth of every month. Really makes me wonder whether drones is the right word for 'em…whoops, skipped a line in my notes. <em>Ahem</em>, it has been confirmed that their bodies are made almost entirely of office supplies, excepting for a human brain and spinal cord…oh fuck me, did I not transcribe the recording the first time? I gotta watch the thing all over again? I do <em>not</em> have enough Scottish brain bleach<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-25" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-25')">25</a></sup> in me for this shit. Pause recording.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm back. This is where it gets gross, so if you need a break I'd suggest doing it now. I'm pulling up the autopsy footage a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-and here we go.</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
<p>7761-E instances are composed almost entirely of office supplies<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-26" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-26')">26</a></sup>. The one part of their bodies that is still human is their brain stem, which is encased in what appears to be papier-mache with Great Depression-era newspapers<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-27" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-27')">27</a></sup>. The majority of the body is composed almost entirely of silicone and plastic in various forms- a stapler and paperclip chain in place of kidneys, warped tubes of fiber-optic cable for a digestive system. Certain human organs are kept- eyes, heart, hands, anything useful for business. The skin is preserved via some sort of anomalous methods- it remains taunt and lifelike despite a majority of the blood tracing from the heart to the brain and hands. The heart is kept alive using the copyright of the Boss's handiwork- origami cranes created from hundred-dollar bills implanted in the ventricles. yuck, yuck, yuck! As the autopsy progressed, the cranes began to ambulate. As the brain was exposed, the scalpel slicing through the mache shell, a flock of paper cranes emerged, spattering brain matter across the doctors…</p>
<p>Good lords!</p>
<p><em>The sound of someone vomiting on the recorder.</em></p>
<p>And uh… 7761-E instances have continued to elude any subsequent attempts at capture<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-28" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-28')">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I am going to take a break and… pick this up later.</p>
<p>Good night, David.</p>
<p>I think, when I'm feeling better, it's time for some surveillance.</p>
<p>Fucking monstrous…</p>

<strong>Cartwright:</strong> What? She infiltrated the anomaly by <em>herself</em>? <em>Off the books</em>?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Drexler:</strong>Yep. Far as I could tell, it was a combination of a lack of resources for surveillance and a personal desire to see what she was reporting on. Back then, of course, all we had was our <em>awful</em> cassette and lo-fi DVD sound. It was a struggle to get accurate pictures of anything even partially memetic or illusory or pataphysical or just plain fucking anom.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Drexler:</strong> That was when it started. When she stopped talking about her rats I went and visited her house. The rats were dead. Most of them, at least.</p>

<strong>Drexler:</strong> <em>A long, drawn-out sigh.</em> What the fuck do you think, Cart? With the Convergence, the cohesion of our unit has been awful. Especially because we got some political-compromise dullard that didn't understand the barest bits of memetic occlusion and amnestic separation… extremely exhausting to deal with. On the other extreme, our incoming GOC counterparts were perfect in almost every regard…other than <em>their barely concealed hatred</em> for us and being bigoted weirdos besides-and no, I don't mean the 'a type green killed my mom' kind of bigotry, either. We had no idea what to expect-there hadn't been an occult org convergence on this scale since, well, the <em>Founding</em>, so we all contextualized it as one big ol' corporate merger and tried to adapt and overcome.

<p>I am loathe to compliment a gibbering bastard like him, but we shall simplify it with the idea that has an aesthetically satisfying face with beautifully masculine features, see addendum that ass. He was smoking a cigarette, and just staring at my room. When I looked at him he didn't react at all. Just kept smoking<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-33" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-33')">33</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ok, addendum, that ass, he's like every cigarette ad, but six foot five and with jeans that are just tight enough-if you know, you know, and if I told you, then you'd know.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Observations From Field Surveillance of SCP-7761.</strong></p>
<p>The afternoons are the most boring parts of the day. The only thing evident, excepting various kinds of deliveries throughout the day, all of which are signed for by 7761:B, is a large amount of financial business. Covert surveillance on the building's internet connection shows a median of 1,200 financial transactions per hour, going out to every corner of the US, and even more utilizing other methods on an international scale.</p>
<p>The anomalous activity occurs most often in the early morning and evenings. That is when the employees manifest. It seems that every closet space, at least those on the level I can see fully, work as… some sort of storage space? In the morning, around 5 to 6 AM, the lights in the building flicker, and I can see employees slowly walk out of the closets. One at a time, one each every five minutes, each at the same time. The instances then go about normal morning routines- getting food from various small kitchens, yoga, meditation. As far as I can tell, each employee has the same outfit and general style of clothing every day, with the only changes being the coloration of the clothing.</p>
<p>This seems to be the only form of sentience these instances have. On rare occasions, an instance appears to "break through," as it were- their shirt is covered in text, usually blood-red or dull green, in the form of the word help.</p>
<p>This leads to my foremost hypothesis- 7761:E instances are not limbs of the company itself, but rather some kind of hivemind or brain capturing by the building itself. A kind of financial prison system. More research has to be done, but I'm going to snap a few pics with a long-range lens, and send the photos off for identification. My bet is that anyone in this company has some sort of debt-related issue in their life. The reason I believe this comes from a fair amount of research into the surrounding area through interviews with the locals- might have thrown my cover, but journalists look into a lot of damn strange things. AFSFS is known for debt-debt consolidation, debt recovery, debt restructuring. Rumor is that the mayor of the town is in deep to them.</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>I need to get some sleep. Will report back.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-17"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-17')">17</a>. Your precious GOF's finances are inextricably bound to assets on our books. We personally compromised your MTF's leadership in esoteric pension plans we float. At any moment, we could turn your force composition into a fucking bread riot.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-18"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-18')">18</a>. How's that for vertical integration, bitches?</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-19"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-19')">19</a>.

Everyone's in the know. It's just what kind of know. Nobody's in my kind of know, because if we told you, you'd know.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-21"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-21')">21</a>. Funny.</div>

Actually it's perfectly finite, but your analysts got a tip about a quarterback on the Giants suffering a depressive episode, bet the farm trying to be millionaires, the quarterback magically had a spiritual epiphany, and five shmucks found out they were sold and owned by yours truly. Hope you like red herrings.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-23"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-23')">23</a>. I beg to differ.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-24"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-24')">24</a>. Okay, that one's actually infinite. As you're soon to find out, that's not paper. I'll give you a hint: that sheen isn't laminate-it's sweat.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-25"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-25')">25</a>. Glenfiddich. She's drinking Glenfiddich.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-26"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-26')">26</a>. Oh they're a lot more than that.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-27"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-27')">27</a>. Oh that's subject to frequent update. I can event tell you the exact years: 1637, 1797, 1819, 37-Jesus, didn't that fuck up me up good, 57, 84, 1901, 07, 29, and 1937. See you 2025!</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-28"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-28')">28</a>. I'll tell you how they do it, too. They have receipts with your staff's names on them.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-29"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-29')">29</a>. Did you know many of the finance staff at GOC are card carrying members of Opus Dei? Did you know they're entirely straight (or their closets are made of telekill)? Did you know their secretaries show up to work on Mondays with expensive jewelry they didn't have that Friday? Did you know they are either blond or grey? Did you know the entire PTOLEMY unit has equivalent or superior CVs than I've got? Did you know they smell like cigar smoke? Did you know they call each other f* for listening to Madonna? Did you know Robert Drexler was dining with GOC headhunters in the months before the merger was announced? Did you know European meth is the shit? God damn.</div>
