<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4820 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment module at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Site-17</span> <a href="/the-drooling-path">Armed Bio-Containment Area-14</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Up to 5 liters of blood may be withdrawn from SCP-4820 in any given 24-hour period. Withdrawal of larger amounts, or the harvesting of any of SCP-4820's organs, must be approved by at least one Level 4 Personnel.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-4820 need not be supplied with food, and refuses any offered to it.</span> SCP-4820 has requested access to cooking implements, various spices, and a selection of sauces. These requests have been granted on a probationary basis, and may be revoked as a disciplinary measure if the need arises. Consumption of food prepared by SCP-4820 is discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4820 is an adult Filipino man, apparently 40-50 years of age. The object is able to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue. These capabilities possess no known limit; SCP-4820 can even regrow appendages that have been completely severed<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Regeneration time increases with the severity of the injury in question and the extent of the damage; minor incisions heal almost instantaneously, but extracted internal organs take several hours to regenerate. SCP-4820 does not appear to feel pain, and often fails to notice when it is injured.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown how SCP-4820 fuels this rapid regeneration; it requires no more food or water than a standard human.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4820-2:</strong> Transcript of an interview between Researcher Carlson and SCP-4820, shortly after its initial containment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-4820.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Is that what you are going to call me now?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Yes. It's just the protocol, nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Guess I'm not getting out of here any time soon, am I?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> I'm afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Oh well. At least this place has people to talk to. Not like that blasted pebble of an island.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> It was certainly a hostile environment. But you still survived on it for almost twelve years. Care to explain how?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Well, at first I prayed for escape, like any right-minded shipwreck survivor would. That was all I really wanted at first; I knew how to distill water, and there was a little cave where I could get out of the sun.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> What changed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> I got hungry! [SCP-4820 laughs] Escape got a whole lot less important after that.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> So what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> I would have tried to catch some fish or something, but all I had to work with was a knife, some rocks, and one set of clothes. I thought about taking my chances in the water, but decided I'd still be better off starving in a cave than trying to swim all the way back home in open water. So I crawled down to the very back of that little cave, where it was nice and dark and cool, and prayed for something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> And that's when you developed your anomalous properties?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Yes. I passed out back there - because I was exhausted - and then when I woke up I noticed all my cuts and bruises were gone. I got hurt pretty bad when the ship went down but now all that had healed. And it wasn't just those; all my scars were gone, too. Even my calluses had disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> What did you do when you realized this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> I thought I was having a sunstroke. I would've cut myself to make sure if I'd had something sharp, but I'd dropped my knife somewhere, so I just picked a hand and bit down. Watched it heal right back up.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Then what did you do?</p>
<p>[SCP-4820 smiles]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> What any sailor does when he's stranded on a barren island with only one food source.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;end log&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 4820-3:</strong> List of materials recovered from ████████ with SCP-4820.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 metal survival knife, rusted and dulled to the point of uselessness</li>
<li>2 knives carved from a human tibia</li>
<li>2 shirts and 2 pairs of pants, consisting of human skin sewn together with sinew and hair</li>
<li>1 needle, carved from an unidentified human bone</li>
<li>1 set of chess pieces; the "white" side is carved from various fingerbones, while the "black" side is carved from toes</li>
<li>A crude shelter constructed of human skin and a single large piece of driftwood</li>
<li>Approximately 4,000 identical human teeth, piled neatly outside a cave entrance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum 4820-4:</strong> Transcript of a second interview conducted with SCP-4820, the day following its recovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Good morning, SCP-4820.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Hello, doctor. What's new?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> I'm here to ask you some questions about the time you spent on the island.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> We've recovered the materials you, ah, made. How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Simple enough. I still had my knife at the beginning, so I was able to do some carving. First I made a new one out of bone, because metal doesn't typically last too long around all that salt water.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Then I made a net, because I was hoping to add some variety to my diet.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> We didn't find a net on the island.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Of course not. Once I finally made one that would hold together, it didn't do me any good. I hadn't noticed until then, but all the animals avoided that island like the plague. The birds wouldn't even fly over it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Best I can figure, they could feel there was something wrong. Something…off. I felt it too, sometimes. Maybe it was whatever sick genie gave me this gift. <a href="http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/survival">Whatever lived in that cave.</a></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> There was an entity in the cave?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Maybe not an entity, but a presence at least. Something very old. Something very different from you and me. Spooked me if I thought about it too much, but it saved my life that night, so I didn't complain. Still didn't sleep in the cave after that, though.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> But you did leave a pile of teeth outside it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Had to keep track of the days somehow, right? I've always had really loose teeth. Must be genetic or something, or I wouldn't anymore<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. So, in the absence of any real writing materials, I decided I'd use them to keep track of the days. I ripped one out every day at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> But why did you decide to pile them outside the cave?</p>
<p>[SCP-4820 appears confused.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Not really sure. Guess I figured a little offering couldn't hurt. [SCP-4820 chuckles nervously]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;end log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4820-5:</strong> Exploration of island and cave.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="island.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4820/island.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The island where SCP-4820 was stranded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The unnamed island has a land area of slightly less than one square kilometer at low tide, and only a few hundred square meters at high tide. It is not inhabited by any animals or edible plants. Its only notable terrain feature is an irregular cave entrance approximately 1 meter high and 1.5 meters wide, located near the highest point of the terrain and opening to the south. The entrance allows passage into an elliptical cave, roughly 2 meters wide at its widest point, 2.3 meters high at its highest, and 3 meters deep. Thorough inspection of the cave revealed no anomalous qualities, although personnel did report a “funny feeling”.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4820-6:</strong> Portion of the third interview with SCP-4820, conducted 2 weeks after initial containment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Hello again, SCP-4820.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Hey, doc. Say, do you guys have any tomato sauce?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> I can file a request for some if you like.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Please. I taste better with seasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Yes, well, that's actually why I'm here. To discuss your refusal to accept rations.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> What about it?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> Well, we expected that you'd be eager to, uh, inject some more variety into your diet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> That's what the sauce is for.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Carlson:</strong> But why do you still insist on consuming your, uh, self?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4820:</strong> Doctor, have you ever spent twelve years completely alone? Don't answer that, I know you haven't. When a man's alone for that long, he has to latch onto something, an anchor, if you will, so he doesn't go completely nuts. Some men write books. Some play chess. Me? I had this. [SCP-4820 breaks its right index finger, then watches as it heals.] Infinite healing. Not immortality, though. I still had to eat. My flesh always grew back, but if I didn't eat I would starve. So I ate the only food I had, myself. How many times did I consume myself, recycle the nutrients back into more flesh before eating it again? It was a cycle. A perfect circle, even. I had become the entire food chain. I had become <em>everything</em>. So that's what I latched on to. That circle. It became holy to me. Sacred. And that hasn't changed just because I'm off the island. I think I experienced God out there, in a way. How it felt to be God, eternally eating and being eaten, the beginning and end of everything. And it was a good feeling.</p>
