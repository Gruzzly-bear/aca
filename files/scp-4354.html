<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation web crawlers are to search for and take down any mention of SCP-4354 instances. All persons affected by SCP-4354 instances are to be sought out and apprehended under the pretence of going through immediate tattoo removal therapy due to a production mistake in the ink used by SCP-4354-A. Apprehended individuals are to be contained in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell until after the conclusion of the Superbia-Event, at which point they are to be amnesticized and released.</p>
<p>SCP-4354-A is currently uncontained, but reports of activities matching the behaviour of SCP-4354-A are to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4354 is the collective designation given to a series of anomalous tattoos, currently on the body of fourteen subjects in containment and an unknown number still uncontained. Two months after acquisition by an individual, SCP-4354 instances develop the abilities to change shape and move through skin cells. The specific way these abilities manifest is unique for all instances and dependant on the subject of the tattoo.</p>
<p>3 months after a subject has been tattooed with an instance of SCP-4354, they will undergo a Superbia Event. A Superbia Event is the complete transfiguration of the affected flesh into the likeness of the respective SCP-4354 instance, which will proceed to expel itself from the body of the subject, typically leaving behind large avulsion. There have, however, also been unique Superbia Events which only partially adhere to this description or not at all.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On 2018/07/21, videos depicting the anomalous effects of SCP-4354 instances started to appear on the social media platform Twitter. A disinformation campaign was immediately put into action and the first containment procedures were devised and executed but could not prevent the initial spread of information about SCP-4354. This led to a rise in popularity for SCP-4354-A and the creation of a significant number of SCP-4354 instances.</p>
<p>During interrogation, all subjects unanimously report acquiring their instance at a tattoo parlour named "Pride Parlor" in Berlin, Germany. The business was previously owned by SCP-4354-A, a person of unknown identity, responsible for the creation of all SCP-4354 instances according to interrogated subjects. When Foundation forces arrived at the address the building was empty and SCP-4354-A could not be found. Despite all interrogated subjects supposedly meeting SCP-4354-A face to face, and being fully conscious while receiving their instance, none of them could comment on any specifics regarding SCP-4354-A, except for repeated insistence on their skilful handling of the tattoo gun and pleasant appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4354.1:</strong> Overview of SCP-4354 instances currently in containment<br/>
Below is a table with a selection of examples for SCP-4354 instances currently in containment.</p>
