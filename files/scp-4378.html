<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4378 is contained inside a 5 liter stainless steel mixing bowl. The bowl is enclosed within the former kitchen of the United States White House with access via a single outward swinging door. This door is to be kept locked at all times. All movement and sound within 20 meters of the object is to be kept to a minimum; under no circumstances is it to be disturbed.</p>
<p>An X-Class cognitohazard is placed within the immediate vicinity of the kitchen door leading to SCP-4378, preventing White House personnel from either perceiving or approaching it.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-4378 within its containment bowl following removal by Secretary of State ████████ █████</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4378 is a single uncooked De Cecco-brand lasagna noodle. Disturbing SCP-4378<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> causes physical objects within its range of effect to be transferred to what is theorized to be another dimension <em>[Designated SCP-4378-A.]</em> The range of this effect is proportional to the amount of disturbance. The relational growth rate of the object's anomalous properties is unknown, though it is estimated to be <span class="math-inline">$x * 10^\alpha$</span> (with <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> being the theoretical number of disturbed electrons and <span class="math-inline">$\alpha$</span> being the Fine-Structure Constant.)</p>
<p>Entities transferred to SCP-4378-A are irrecoverable <em>[Designated SCP-4378-#, numerically by chronological order of disappearance.]</em> Responses can be sent by manipulating cooked noodles<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> within 5 meters of SCP-4378.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Extensive communication with subjects has been conducted. It is not understood how subjects continue to exist within SCP-4378-A, as subjects seem to lose all concept of self while still retaining their names. A Model M130 Remote Communication Bot has been used in attempts to communicate with the subjects, they have proven unsuccessful. A sentient interviewer is required in order to communicate with subjects within SCP-4378-A.</p>
<p>Subjects have been incapable of describing SCP-4378-A in any coherent manner, however it is possible to send recording equipment to SCP-4378-A for brief periods of time. After approximately 10 minutes and 17 seconds, the equipment is ejected from SCP-4378-A, retaining any recorded data. SCP-4378-A appears to be a brightly lit void loosely filled with dried pasta, primarily spaghetti noodles.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Noodles have been observed spontaneously manifesting within the void during recordings, but the location or cause of their creation is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Communication with subjects sent through SCP-4378-A has been limited, usually only given in a simplified stream of consciousness that has proven difficult to understand, exacerbated by the required method of communication. When sent to SCP-4378-A subjects seem incapable of understanding how they are communicating with researchers and that they were once human, but retain their name. <em>[See Interview Log SCP-4378-#]</em></p>
<p>SCP-4378 was discovered immediately following the sudden disappearance of Secretary of State ████████ █████. <em>[Designated SCP-4378-1]</em> SCP-4378-1 was observed spontaneously disappearing on security footage recorded on ██/██/████ taken from the White House kitchen. The brief video shows SCP-4378-1 opening an upper cabinet, taking hold and opening a De Cecco Lasagna Noodle box, removing SCP-4378 from the box. SCP-4378-1 then spontaneously disappeared causing SCP-4378 to fall, landing in the stainless steel mixing bowl of which SCP-4378 is now contained. It is unknown why SCP-4378-1 did not disappear when the box containing SCP-4378 was disturbed but it is speculated that SCP-4378's anomalous properties did not manifest until it was removed from its container.</p>

<td>Pending further review, I would also like to add the observation that gravity did not seem to cause SCP-4378 to manifest its anomalous properties. When SCP-4378-1 dropped SCP-4378 into the bowl, nothing happened. This is reason to believe that SCP-4378 only reacts when disturbed by a force outside of astronomical constants. Possibly only a sentient outside force, but that would have incredible implications considering Incident R-4378-M2. But that is something I am going to consider another time. There are already enough unknowns about this damned piece of flour, egg, and water.</td>

</div>
<p>For approximately a week following SCP-4378-1's disappearance, various noodles found throughout the White House were discovered arranged in messages. The recorded instances of these are as followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A single piece of spaghetti found at the bottom of President █████ ███████'s bowl arranged in cursive writing spelling out "hello?" The president noticed this as a coincidence and pointed it out to his wife, to which they both remarked at the "chances of that happening."</li>
<li>A bowl of alphabet soup given to President █████ ███████'s daughter. The daughter pointed out to her father that the soup seemed to be randomly rearranging into various words including: nothing, ████[nickname for SCP-4378-1], ergo sum, and life.</li>
<li>A bowl of leftover linguine found on top of the mini-fridge of the Chief of Staff's office in the West Wing. The linguine was left out for approximately 2 days, allowing it to dry. All linguine was found arranged into the word "thirst." It is speculated that this happened while the linguine was still pliable and then dried out.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Further testing has proceeded to better understand SCP-4378's anomalous properties as well as attempting to discover a way to retrieve subjects back from SCP-4378-A. All current attempts have been unsuccessful.</p>

<em>Subject: Preparations for Earthquake</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
In regards to the earthquake advisory put forth by the US Geological Survey. Evacuation of all government buildings have been ordered and should be complete within the hour.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Secret Service officials should be accompanying you to Safe House 5 at 11:30 AM. Vice President █████ ████████ will join you along with your families. The US Geological Survey estimates the earthquake and any aftershocks should cease after 3:30 PM, after which you will be escorted back to the White House. However, if the White House has been damaged we will observe the Hoover Standard until the all-clear is given.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It is not expected that this will be a catastrophic earthquake and will likely only require the minimum of precautions. Regardless, I have been told by Agent York that the Secret Service is prepared for all possibilities.</p>

<p><em>Compiler Note: Recorded following Incident R-4378-M2</em></p>
<p><strong>Host: Morris Jones</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Footage of police officer sprinting with automatic weapon</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice of unidentified civilian man:</strong> It all happened incredibly quickly. Uh, after the quake. I really don't know, man.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Footage of police cars surrounding the White House</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Fear grips Capitol Hill following today's earthquake, registered as a 5.9. Confusion and concern tonight on NewsChannel 8.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[NewsChannel 8 broadcast opening plays]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Good evening everyone, I'm Morris Jones. In the wake of today's 5.9 scale earthquake, the President and the entire cabinet has gone missing without explanation. Multiple reports from eye witnesses have indicated the White House collapsing at one point, but secret service members have contradicted this claim. Current reports also indicate that the White House still stands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Footage of eyewitness interview]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Woman holding small child standing in front of the white house frantically gesturing at the building as she speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> I feel like I'm insane. The whole thing was gone for at least 10 minutes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> after the quake. I'm here visiting with my family and we all saw it. There's just no way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Interviewer looks visibly confused.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So you're saying the White House had… collapsed at one point?</p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> Sure. Maybe. I never saw it actually collapse. It wasn't there any more, though, for goddamned sure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Cut to interview of Secret Service official]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Secret Service official wearing sunglasses, standing in lawn of the White House.</em></p>
<p><strong>Official:</strong> Nothing of the sort occurred. As you can see, the White House still stands. The President and his cabinet are currently interned in a safe location and will be giving a full statement within the hour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Cut back to studio]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Despite claims by officials, it has been just over an hour since that interview and no statement has been put out by the President. Concern over the President's safety has escalated as no word from any member of the cabinet has come from the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> We will have more as the story develops.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Memo from Dr. Lark to Mobile Task Force Eta-7</strong></p>
<div class="page">
<p>Meiersdorff, we have a Class J incident on our hands. Round up the team and head to Washington DC immediately. You are to locate the safe house connected to the White House, I have been told that it is found through a hidden door in the White House Kitchen.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
And be careful of any aftershocks. A 190EI Bot has already been sent to the object and should negate any risks, but be careful.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> We do not know the full capacity of 4378's effects. It is possible that an event could still occur even while 4378's stabilized.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
If the President is located, bring him to the staging location and perform the Leifman Protocol. If he is not located, return to the staging location for further instructions.<br/>

<p><strong>TFE-7 Larper:</strong> Roger, Command, it is nothing. Shipper read precautions on prep sheet but not description of object. Over.</p>
<p><em>Pause as TFE-7 Shipper presumably speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>TFE-7 Larper:</strong> What do you mean the precautions is all that matters? How are you going to know what the damn thing looks like if you don't read the description?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Shipper, return to base. This is not acceptable. Larper, continue extraction attempt. No risk of immediate danger known but keep eyes open. Over.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Lark enters Executive Residence dining room and approaches bowl containing Alphabet Soup. Standard SCP-4378-# Interview Protocol is followed.

Alphabet soup ceases rapid movement and rearranges once again.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4378-7:</strong> "Spreading, need to stop"</p>
