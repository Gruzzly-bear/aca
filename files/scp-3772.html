<p><strong>Item #</strong>: SCP-3772</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: As SCP-3772 is considered dormant, and can be easily disregarded as non-anomalous, containment focuses on suppression of discussion surrounding its method of distribution. Contacts in all major media-sharing platforms are working alongside the Foundation to assist with pre-emptive removal of media meeting SCP-3772's parameters, under the guide of content-protection rules.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-3772 is a phenomenon whereby internet content meeting certain criteria will convert to a video or infographic relating to the death of Faith Bassen in 2020. This conversion only affects end-user machines, and does not alter the media for others who have not triggered the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Testing has identified the following as the primary parameters to convert media:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content is not owned/created by the user who posted it.</li>
<li>A caption of or within the content alludes to a desire to discover the content's creator, whether or not said desire can be judged to be genuine (For instance, "OMG who did this??? So talented 😍").</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary factors which are not required but seem to increase the likelihood of SCP-3772 occurring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist/creator signatures and watermarks have been removed from the content.</li>
<li>The account posting the content has posted other media which matches the primary parameters.</li>
<li>The machine viewing the content is on US geopolitical territory. This factor increases exponentially as the machine approaches the census-designated place of Comfort, Texas<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most commonly, SCP-3772 manifests as a static image of Faith Bassen with captioning providing details of her disappearance and the discovery of her body, with a strong focus on the lack of an official investigation by the local police force. When manifesting in video form, this information will commonly give way to phone camera recordings of Faith, with the names and faces of others appearing in the footage digitally censored. This footage is interspersed with graphic and provocative descriptions of her injuries, threats towards the perpetrators and the repeated line "FAITH BASSEN WAS MURDERED", which doubled as a hashtag for the movement to press the local police force to investigate the death.</p>
<p>The first known instance of SCP-3772 came to the Foundation's attention on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2020, two months after the death of Ms. Bassen. After confirmation of anomalous nature, initial containment focused on suppression of discussion and investigation of SCP-3772's trigger parameters. While this was successful in most cases, the prevalence of instances in the vicinity of Comfort, Texas, lead to strong local awareness of the case. As SCP-3772 was assumed by the public of Comfort to be the product of non-anomalous activity, priority was given to continued suppression of media attention outside this area.</p>
<p>In January 2021, the Unusual Incidents Unit took over management of the investigation at the Foundation's request. With their input, the suspects in the Faith Bassen case were successfully identified and brought to accelerated trial between May and July 2021. Following this, the incident rate of SCP-3772 manifestations dropped almost completely.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Chatlogs</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of existing archived chatlogs for GoI-5869 ("Gamers Against Weed") show a number of conversations related to this issue, primarily involving the users warysue and tiedyeduck in a sidechat labelled <em>#wip</em>. As chatlogs are only available from the laptop of a member of the GoI who had little interaction with warysue, the majority of these conversations are contextless or incomplete.</p>

<strong>warysue</strong>: and gcm .<br/>
<strong>bluntfiend</strong>: Ok, listen up.<br/>
<strong>bones</strong>: I'm going to preemptively ask that you move this conversation to PMs. Warysue, while I understand your pain, it would serve you well to give benefit of the doubt in this context.<br/>
<strong>bluntfiend</strong>: Never mind, bones is on it.<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: noted, and Fuck that<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: gaycopmp4: lemme know on the discord if you've<br/>

&lt;- <strong>warysue</strong> left<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: Look, I'm not saying the idea is fundamentally bad, but the execution you're discussing is just crass.<br/>
<strong>gaycopmp4</strong>: she's gone<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: yeah<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: :/<br/>
<strong>bones</strong>: She is grieving a close friend. Her behavior may be more extreme for a time, but remember that she is working through a trauma. I believe you know what that feels like.<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: We all do, bones.<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: This is gonna be a clusterfuck, isn't it?</p>

<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: I just wanna say I'm sorry.<br/>
<strong>lesbian_gengar</strong>: talk to gaycop about this she's better with computer stuff<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: I came in too strong the other day - I want to help, I just think you're going about it the wrong way.<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: that's a shitty apology<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: Come on.<br/>
<strong>kkrule</strong>: uh sorry i didnt know you were fighting<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: no you Come On . I'm going about it Exactly the way Faith would have wanted it.<br/>
<strong>harmpit</strong>: ccol cool ill tdo that but fi she says no ii can comc bank to you righu<br/>
<strong>kkrule</strong>: i thought he wanted to do over watch or something<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: Exactly what she would have wanted? I've seen your demo posters. The places you're intending these to end up, she'll end up in the hands of people who'll make her a target for ridicule.<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: 1 . I know there's Awful People out there that's why Faith is fucking dead and 2 . I thin<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: 2. I think there's more people out there who'll listen and tweet<br/>
<strong>kkrule</strong>: god im really sorry waysue<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: it's ok kkrule just Ssh<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: Is that worth it, though? Her face getting used for awful jokes, becoming synonymous with all the other dead trans girls they fucking meme about. She's not gonna come back.<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: I can't believe you'd fuck<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: fucking say that , of course its Worth It to catch whoever did it<br/>
<strong>harmpit</strong>: i ccant beleieve youd fcuck haaaaaa<br/>
<strong>bones</strong>: Inappropriate in the context, harmpit.<br/>
<strong>tiedyeduck</strong>: You really think it'll achieve that? Even if the cops do start an investigation, it's been weeks and she was found on a riverbank, there's no evidence to examine. Maybe if they'd done a proper autopsy they'd have something to work on, but they couldn't.<br/>
<strong>kkrule</strong>: yeah not cool harmpit come on<br/>

<strong>harmpit</strong>: perison bwloe triple rdaar<br/>
<strong>polaricecraps</strong>: and we've already DONE shit like this we got those guys caught when 4chambers was killed and she was like barely a member<br/>
<strong>lesbian_gengar</strong>: hey whoah let's not throw shade at the dead<br/>
<strong>bluntfiend</strong>: Lest the dead dab back.<br/>
<strong>kkrule</strong>: dabs aren't a good meme anymore now<br/>
<strong>polaricecraps</strong>: like if it'd been an exception cos it was Dove I'd have understood man but you're telling me we can hijack the fuckin hashtag tearjerk market for someone who said like four lines max in main but we can't leverage that same shit to defend ourselves from the nazi fucks trying to kick our damn door down<br/>
<strong>bones</strong>: Op order, drop this now. Lesbian_gengar has it right, speaking ill of the dead is in very bad taste. 4chambers may not have participated to your knowledge, but I can inform you she was very much a member of our community.<br/>

<strong>kkrule</strong>: i know you don't feel that way wary but the men who did it got caught and they're in jail now so it did make a difference<br/>
<strong>lesbian_gengar</strong>: don't, kk<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: only two of them . Other guy walked away Scott Free . And they only got twenty years, w chance for parole in fucking "024<br/>
<strong>warysue</strong>: *2024<br/>
<strong>bluntfiend</strong>: You can rest easy knowing you did all you could, wary. It's tough, but you went above and beyond and got a result, even if it's not the one you hoped for.<br/>
<strong>lesbian_gengar</strong>: christ just let it rest it's ok for stuff to be shit sometimes<br/>
