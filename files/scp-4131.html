<p>Recreation of a member of the <em>Anomalocaris</em> genus, which SCP-4131 belongs to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4131 is stored in a temperature controlled 10m<sup>3</sup> tank of water at Site-201 Sector 3. Tank walls are constructed to withstand high impact explosive blasts, with an additional layer surrounding the tank in the event of a breach. Communication with SCP-4131 will be performed using a computer monitor built into the tank, which will display messages sent by interviewers.</p>
<p>At the request of SCP-4131, an observation room has been built next to the tank, with a window that allows the organism to view interviewers. All interviewers must be trained in handling psionic phenomena. Personnel interacting with the anomaly must maintain the guise of the Foundation being an organization dedicated to hunting trilobites, with SCP-4131 being an operative for them. Materials and paraphernalia pertaining to trilobites are strictly forbidden within the observation room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4131 is an organism belonging to the extinct <em>Anomalocaris</em> genus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> with a collection of ranged explosive weaponry replacing the head. The organism is 1.6m long, abnormally larger than the majority of fossilized and living <em>Anomalocaris</em> specimens, and has sections of its body replaced with metallic counterparts. This primarily includes portions of the carapace, though several fins have been replaced as well.</p>
<p>The head is composed of two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>One third of the head is constructed of the same material as the carapace with a metal grid built into it, presumably for reinforcement. Stylized iconography of anomalocaridids and trilobites broken into pieces is carved into it, though significant weathering has rendered many details indiscernible. Three barrels are present, only one of which is functional and capable of firing explosives made of carapace material.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two thirds is entirely constructed from metal. A symbol of a claw similar to those of theropod dinosaurs in a circle is painted in white onto its surface. Four barrels are present, which can fire projectiles analogous in design to weapons used by humans, such as torpedoes, naval mines, and missiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>How the organism generates ammunition is unknown.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of sensory organs, SCP-4131 has displayed full awareness of its surroundings. The organism does not require a food source; how it obtains energy is unknown. SCP-4131 displays sapience and can communicate through telepathic methods, sending messages interpreted by humans as speech in their native language. Due to the organism's tendency to ramble on subjects when spoken to, along with its intense hatred of trilobites, interviewers have had difficulty communicating with them.</p>
<p>The anomaly was initially discovered by two amateur fossil hunters by Etobicoke Creek<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> on 18-September-2015. Shortly after being unearthed, SCP-4131 shouted various expletives about the "segmented shitheads," thanked the fossil hunters for freeing it from its "shackles," and proceeded to use rocket propelled grenades to eject itself into the river. Both persons were severely injured by the blasts.</p>
<p>Reports of explosions and voices swearing about trilobites in Lake Ontario surfaced over the following days, prompting Foundation investigation. Mobile Task Force Nu-3 ("Limnophobia")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and <a href="/task-forces#phi-2">Mobile Task Force Phi-2 ("Clever Girls")</a> were dispatched, quickly encountering the organism through the dispersal of trilobite-shaped monitoring buoys. Upon encountering SCP-4131 on 25-September-2015, the task forces announced themselves as a "trilobite extermination agency" that was looking to recruit the anomaly. SCP-4131 willingly entered containment soon after.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-4131</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Annabel Xiulan</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Good morning, SCP-4131. This is Annabel Xiulan, senior trilobite executor.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> You found trilobites to kill?</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Sorry, but no.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Aww.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> We'll let you know if we find any. Anyways, may I ask some questions about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Questions are great. Questions mean I can tell you about how good it is to shoot those carapaced assholes so please ask them.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Alright. First, why do you want to kill trilobites?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> What? You can see the evil in their eyes! Every inch hates! Wants to see you burn! Why are you even asking this?</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> We were checking to see if you are loyal.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Oh okay. I was worried you'd be like my friend who tried eating one because they didn't realize they're evil and had the trilobastards take his head and… Poor guy.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Now, how many weapons do you have?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Tore down his farm, too. Oh right. Let's see, I've got missiles, torpedoes, spears, spikes that go really fast, mines, normal guns, normal guns but with lava, something that scares me a lot, the <em>secret maneuver</em>, my own head—</p>
<p><em>SCP-4131 abruptly spins around and fires a set of torpedoes in the tank walls.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> What was that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> (<em>whispering</em>) Triloghosts.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> …I see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Oh right I got distracted, there was… Come on, me… There was…</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> We can come back to that later. Could you tell me how you got these weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> …there's no other weapons I can remember but I do remember way back with one of my pals, and they were like "hey do you want to shoot those inbred tri-lobers" and I wanted to shoot those inbred tri-lobers so I joined our expeditionary force, where we took back some villages and had fun and blew things up and it was great…</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> It's good you did well in your military, but that isn't what I asked about. Anything about getting the weapons you could tell?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> …but of course it went wrong when other pals thought we should attack the Lord and of <em>course</em> we thought it was smart because they were so tiny like the other trilobites and we could win easily! Hahaha, then everyone but me got thrown out of the ocean and the Lord slammed me into a volcano.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Are you paying attention to me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Worked out though because I got a good sleep in a cozy rock, uhhh, sleep-place-thing until those guys with the claws dug me out. They wanted me to shoot some <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-317">dome-headed people</a> but they aren't trilobites so it sounded dumb.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> (<em>sighs</em>) Could you elaborate on the people with the claws?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Yeah they had big teeth, bunch of feathers, long tails, pretty long in general. They were fast on land too.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> They kept telling me the trilobites went extinct but I know they're crafty fiends — <em>they faked it</em> — and they kept telling me it wasn't the case. It was annoying but hey they fixed up my head and gave me new guns and I shot more trilobites than I ever had before! Whole mountains of them went kaboom! Not even a Lord left! Claw guys thought it was silly but they repaired me so I liked them. Shame the big bomb took them out, though.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulana:</strong> Shame indeed, sounds like they could've helped the cause. Now, can you tell me about how you got your weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Uhhh, that was— wait.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Wait?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Wait.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> …are you a trilobite?</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> I'm not a trilobite.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> You ask a lot. Like a trilobite.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> But you wanted me to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Are you a spy? How many trilobites are stacked in your flesh suit? <em>How did you get in this agency?</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Again, I'm not multiple trilobites in a skin suit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Uhhh, didn't think you'd actually ask that. Uhhh, oh, yes, take your metal squid.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> My what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Your pen and scare it into getting ink on your, uhm, paper, that's what it is, right? Right?</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Yes, paper.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Write "trilobites eat crap" on it.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Xiulan writes the phrase onto their notepad, turning it to face SCP-4131.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Yes that's good. I trust you now.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> (<em>slowly nods</em>) Was there any reason why you wanted me to write that phrase?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Some trilobites eat crap. They ate mine once. It was gross.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> I see. Now, can I ask one last question?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Were you born with your weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Xiulan:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4131:</strong> Well, I couldn't blast trilobites if I wasn't.</p>
