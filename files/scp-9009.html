<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> To prevent internal turmoil and confusion, documentation related to SCP-9009 has been sealed under flag WILDFIRE SEPTEMBER TANGO. The Foundation Intelligence Agency will maintain an index of known SCP-9009 instances. Once confirmed, instances of SCP-9009 are to be logged and tracked.</p>
<p>Current estimates place the population of SCP-9009 in the conservative range of 10 to 200 thousand, with instances deeply and prolifically embedded in almost every government, corporation, and organization on Earth. As a result, containment is not focused on strategic deintegration, but on bureaucratic reinforcement; SCP-9009 instances are to maintain their positions, with Foundation interference only permitted in the event that an instance inadvertently publicizes its anomalous nature.</p>
<p>Ecological management and control of SCP-9009 is under the purview of a joint committee consisting of professionals from a number of Foundation departments, including the BioEco<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Department, Sociology Institute, Intelligence Agency, and Public Information Bureau.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9009 is a species of ambulatory humanoids also known as <em>Homo albescens</em>, uniformly characterized by social and phenotypical mimicry of Caucasian males of European descent. This is accompanied by a passive perceptual masking effect (likely memetic in nature) that causes others to perceive instances as human, and to overlook or disregard instances' abnormal behaviors and mannerisms. Easily identifiable characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically resembling a middle-aged or older male.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Occupations in sedentary, corporate, and/or "white-collar" jobs.</li>
<li>Preference for common bland foods (baked potatoes, green bean casserole, etc.).</li>
<li>Mostly coherent yet atypical speech patterns, often marked by excessive verbosity, incongruous statements and inappropriate word choice.</li>
<li>Unusual (but not entirely inexplicable) behaviors in public situations.</li>

<p>SCP-9009 is indigenous to Western Europe; however, over the past five centuries, it has also formed stable breeding populations in North America, Oceania, and many other regions. See <strong>Ecology</strong> for further information.</p>
<p>Though the existence of SCP-9009 has been known to the Foundation since its inception, due to the species' dramatic population explosion from 1975 to 2023, control of the global SCP-9009 population has been designated an Ekhi-Class priority. As a result, the Caucasian Regulation and Conservation Registry (CRaCR) has been commissioned to manage SCP-9009 and direct them in serving the Foundation's interests.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Early Documentation:</strong> Records of SCP-9009 have been recovered from numerous archaeological sites across Europe and the Middle East, ranging from the neolithic period to late antiquity. Early Linear B testimonies refer to SCP-9009 originating from the island of Patmos, Greece.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published <em>Systema Naturae</em>, one of the earliest modern biological and cryptobiological classification works. In the fourth edition of the text, Linnaeus described the following five human species:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Homo sapiens</em> — baseline humans.</li>
<li><em>Homo monstrosus</em> — "monstrous" or abnormal humans, possibly referring to <a href="scp-1000.html">SCP-1000</a>.</li>
<li><em>Homo troglodytes</em> — likely referencing anomalous humanoid entities.</li>
<li><em>Homo fata</em> — referring to <a href="scp-4000.html">native entities</a> of <strong><span style="color: green">the woodland with a thousand names</span></strong>.</li>
<li><em>Homo cryoformus</em> — SCP-9009.</li>

However, due to limited resources and manpower, little was done in the way of pursuing research or containment at the time.</p>

<strong>Administrator F████ W██████, 1908 — Treatise on the Glaciopithecus</strong>
<div class="admin">
<p>The Tundranoid species is a fascinating one. Discovered in the periglacial zones of greater Eurasia, these creatures were first mistaken for pale, malformed monkeys, or a colossal breed of Arctic rat. Closer study revealed them to be something stranger altogether: a type of man, lacking any complex thought or awareness, yet exhibiting a singular talent for appearing as though they belong in charge.</p>
<p>Their speech is often a stilted imitation of authority, yet few dare question it. Their gaze is void but unwavering. Their suits grow from their skin, yet are always pressed. And when confronted with disobedience, they emit a kind of guttural groan that commands deference. This effect cannot be explained by pheromones alone. It is something deeper. Perhaps a sort of psychosocial camouflage.</p>

<p>Preserved SCP-9009 brain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Anatomy and Physiology:</strong> Extensive research has been done on SCP-9009 instances' anatomy, as their bodies are typically well-preserved upon death. Although outwardly humanoid, the internal physiology of SCP-9009 differs wildly from the mammalian baseline. Instances display nonstandard circulatory, nervous, and lymphatic systems. Deviations are often insectoid in morphology, with the notable presence of a hard-shelled exoskeleton mimicking the appearance of various styles of formal wear, double-lidded compound pupils,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and a circulatory and nervous system closely resembling that of the <em>Lasius niger</em>, or common garden ant.</p>
<p>The neuroanatomy of SCP-9009 instances is currently poorly understood. The brain lacks any cerebral folds, possibly due to the low surface area and smooth texture of the frontal and temporal lobes. Natural lesions are typically found covering the brain which periodically leech an unknown blue liquid, currently theorized to act as a retardant against neural plasticity.</p>
<p><strong>Ecology:</strong> SCP-9009's current ecological niche is that of a symbiotic or commensal partner to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> When in its adult form, an SCP-9009 instance will covertly enter an organization controlled by humans; if it succeeds, it will assume a leadership position, relying on its charisma to maintain its status. In circles where SCP-9009 are able to successfully integrate, they have been known to accrue vast quantities of wealth, which, according to leading theories, "percolates" down to <em>H. sapiens</em>, enriching them in the long run. In return, the humans working under a particular instance provide it with food, shelter, income, and valuable psychospheric input data for its elaborate mating displays.</p>
<p>To avoid detection by <em>H. sapiens</em> and prevent input data pollution, the vast majority of SCP-9009 instances occupy positions that minimize close contact with other humans or SCP-9009 instances, which is facilitated by their characteristic wealth. However, in contrast to their otherwise solitary nature, four times per year, a gathering of multiple SCP-9009 instances will congregate in a particular location, often alongside baseline <em>H. sapiens</em>. Observed gatherings have ranged in size from three to 535 individuals, and usually take the form of a formal meeting, such as a corporate boardroom meeting, a legal trial, a church sermon, or a legislative session. SCP-9009 instances will participate as normal, attempting to mask their idiosyncratic behaviors, stalling the meeting until all <em>H. sapiens</em> leave.</p>
<p>Once this occurs, the SCP-9009 instances will have sex.</p>
<p>SCP-9009 mating rituals were once believed to last a short amount of time, as individuals in SCP-9009 gatherings were observed to finish mating with their chosen partner(s) within fifteen minutes of all <em>H. sapiens</em> leaving. However, while actual insemination of SCP-9009 instances occurs very quickly, the SCP-9009 mating ritual spans hours or potentially days.</p>
<p>Current leading theories posit that quarterly SCP-9009 congregations are a form of <em>lekking</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> to facilitate sexual selection. SCP-9009 instances are highly selective in their mates, and prefer to mate with individuals who are particularly skilled in human mimicry. This is why instances congregate in uncharacteristically public meetings, as this gives them an opportunity to prove to others that they can convincingly present as a human, indicating that the individual has high reproductive fitness.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Life Cycle:</strong> Leading Foundation sexologists hypothesize that SCP-9009 instances are hermaphroditic. No evidence of gonchoric sexual dimorphism has been observed in captive instances. Thorough observation of the SCP-9009 mating process evidences that SCP-9009 mating pairs engage in a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing">penis-fencing</a> almost identical to the behavior of <em>Pseudobiceros hancockanus</em>, usually misidentified by civilian observers as frotting, or other alternative forms of sexual contact. Insemination subsequently occurs through traumatic insertion into the epidermis. It is notable that inseminated instances of SCP-9009 will continue to attempt penis-fencing until the conclusion of the mating event, ergo, mating events are likely to result in high degree of genetic exchange and fertility regardless of an instance's sexual fitness.</p>
<p>SCP-9009 instances will seek out suitable nesting locations within two weeks of insemination.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> Once a nesting location has been chosen, instances will secrete a █████████ substance ██████ ███ ██ ███ ██ ████ █ ████ ███ █████ ██.</p>

<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Given SCP-9009's demonstrably lower intelligence relative to humans (including lack of self-awareness and primary reasoning skills), advanced mimicry capabilities, and rapid reproduction rates, it has been determined by CRaCR that SCP-9009 presents a suitable candidate for Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE.

<p>The 2000 United States presidential election was a turning point for the Foundation's involvement in national politics. In order to prevent containment breach of <a href="scp-4444.html">SCP-4444</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>, a number of political disinformation campaigns and media manipulation efforts were implemented to ensure Dr. Lachlan Cairns (inhabiting the comatose body of George W. Bush) would win the electoral race.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> The result of this was a victory for Dr. Cairns as Bush, and a cessation of activity by SCP-4444.</p>
<p>As it was expected that the late Bush's body would decompose within one or two months, a δ-thaumaturgic ritual was enacted to ensure that Dr. Cairns could continue to carry out the functions of President. For the next four years, the position of US president was held by a Foundation official. This allowed for the strengthening of ties between the US government and the Foundation, and the procurement of extensive funds and previously unattainable political capital.</p>
<p>In 2001, the <a href="scp-8963.html">September 11 attacks</a> by agents of Al-Qaeda<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> and the subsequent Manhattan Dimensional Collapse sparked nationwide panic about security and homeland defense. Following the crisis, Dr. Cairns (still animating the body of President Bush) leveraged the crisis to authorize sweeping changes under executive privilege. With backing from the Bush administration, the Foundation influenced a number of key legislative efforts, including numerous provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act — passed to strengthen domestic security and bolster Foundation surveillance efforts.</p>

In-line with extant containment procedures, Bowe was released back into the wild, though not before approving several favorable procurement contracts that allowed Foundation front companies access to billions of dollars of American defense spending.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of the overwhelming success of Operation TICONDEROGA BLUESTATE and subsequent initiatives, O5 Command convened on 2002-██-██ to debate the possibility of using anomalies for political ventures beyond standard containment. SCP-9009 in particular was identified as a potential item of interest as a medium of political engineering.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>BY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL.</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>EVIDENT</strong>: That the anomalous, in its countless and ineffable manifestations, both ontological and epistemological, continues to permeate the sinews of global governance; that its ungoverned presence challenges the very balance upon which civilization itself rests; and that, conversely, while such forces have been relegated to the shadowed precincts of containment and observation, they now present an unparalleled vector for the recalibration of geopolitical paradigms.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interpretation Committee translation:</strong> Anomalies have been around forever and mess with society, but they're now a tool we can use.</em></p>
<p><strong>DECIDED</strong>: That the Foundation, premier custodian of the unknown and unknowable, shall, with all necessary caution, assume a more elevated posture; embracing a proactive praxis towards anomaly integration, in order to facilitate sociopolitical dynamics through clandestine action.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interpretation Committee translation:</strong> The Foundation will go from looking at anomalies to using them to influence politics.</em></p>
<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>: That henceforth, anomalies — be they constructs of human creation, entities which possess paranatural properties, or phenomena beyond the laws of physics — will be assimilated into a stratified framework of influence operations; and that this influence will be leveraged in the pursuit of diplomatic sway, economic anchorage, and nuanced action; all this will be done in the interest yet precluding the supervision of the hoi polloi.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interpretation Committee translation:</strong> The Council will use some anomalies going forward to secretly further the Foundation's goals.</em></p>
<p><strong>THEREFORE</strong>: The Council authorizes the establishment of protocols, clandestine in both form and execution, to interpose anomalous assets within the stage of global power as instruments of coercion, persuasion, deterrence, or inducement; enabling an interlacing between the anomalous and the mundane; whereby such interventions shall remain forever impervious to the perception of those under our establishment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interpretation Committee translation:</strong> The Council knows best.</em></p>
</div>
<p>As a result of this decision, CRaCR's flagship program — Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE — was authorized.</p>

<p>Among the most unique attributes of <em>Solarus reflectus maximus</em> is their ability to generate consensus from sheer inertia. Ask one a question and you receive three memoranda, none of which answer the inquiry but all of which are stamped and initialed by ten others. Attempts to correct or remove them tend to disappear into committee. They are a stone wall against change; the sublime incarnation of systemic strength.</p>
<p>Herein lies the true power of the Palliderms. I have often mused of what could happen if their influence extended beyond our humble walls. What if the apes were not merely tools of continuity, but arbiters of stability? Already, we have discovered them to infiltrate diplomatic missions, financial oversight committees, even upper political echelons. In one instance, an ape was mistakenly appointed Captain Regent of the petty republic of San Marino: all after silently attending a luncheon. No one questioned it; the populace simply assumed he had always been in office.</p>
<p>This, I believe, is the beginning of something greater. This world has, for years, been plagued by disorder, hamstrung by contradiction. But what if, instead, the world moved forward under the stewardship of those no one resists or questions? Perhaps, with the right direction, they could be more than seat-warmers.</p>

</div>
<p>During the early years of the Bush administration, Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE entered its first functional maturity phase. With the post-9/11 geopolitical scheme increasingly predicated on deference to perceived authority, CRaCR analysts identified an unprecedented window for real-time testing. Early investigations revealed thousands of SCP-9009 instances already embedded in corporations, organizations, and federal departments across the United States, creating a ripe opportunity for research.</p>
<p>Operation PHANTOM LIMB was initiated in the summer of 2003, engineered as a joint Foundation-American military campaign in Iraq, aimed at dismantling remnants of Ba'athist rule and Iraqi military cells of the Chaos Insurgency. However, the operation's ultimate goal was to field-test SCP-9009 integration within the United States military hierarchy, including the Department of Defense, influential neoconservative think tanks such as PNAC, and private defense contractors including KBR and Blackwater. SCP-9009 instances displayed excellent bureaucratic sturdiness, with operational tempo slowing to the point of total organizational gridlock by 2004.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Excerpt from Foundation Intelligence Agency GoI Threat Briefing, 2003</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:85%;">Emblem of the Chaos Insurgency.</span></p>
<p>It is evident that no Group of Interest currently poses a greater threat to the interests of the Foundation and normalcy at large than the radical anomalous terrorist organization calling itself the Chaos Insurgency. Diametrically opposed to the existence of the Veil, captured personnel invariably express irrational and persistent hatred for our Foundation and the way of life we defend. Attached is a brief summary of major suspected Chaos Insurgency operations of the late 20th and 21st century, with substantive HUMINT and SIGINT evidence gathered in corroboration.</p>
<ul>
<li>1,235 confirmed raids on Foundation Sites internationally since 1973.</li>
<li>56 recorded public executions of Foundation intelligence personnel.</li>
<li>The murder of Diana, Princess of Wales using a multidimensional spectral automorphic apparition<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> on August 31, 1997.</li>
<li>The ritual sacrifice and consumption of 213,335 golden retriever puppies.</li>
<li>The collision of American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 with 1 WTC and 2 WTC on September 11, 2001.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the opinion of the Foundation Intelligence Agency that the Chaos Insurgency stands antithetical to the principles of democracy, liberalism, and freedom that the Foundation defends and continues to defend worldwide. Foundation operations into CI-controlled territory are projected to meet with high levels of civilian cooperation and support.</p>
</div>
<p>Following President Bush's re-election, Dr. Cairns had accumulated a significant quantity of physical and psychological stress due to prolonged occupation and repeated application of the ritual. CRaCR evaluated options for retaining executive control, while allowing Dr. Cairns to discreetly return to his prior role at the Foundation as Site-19 Personnel Director. Despite initial consideration, it was determined that SCP-9009 was not ready for deployment to the presidential position, and that a human body double was necessary to carry out the functions of President for the 2005-2008 term. Upon George W. Bush's body being exited by Dr. Cairns, it immediately disintegrated into a pile of thaumoactive ash.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup> For the next four years, Agent Rance Fubbard held the position of President, due to his uncanny resemblance to George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Facing a lack of qualified alternatives, Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE turned towards the SCP-9009 project as a sustainable means of ensuring the SCP Foundation's continued control over the position of the President of the United States.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Alright, as Chairman of the Caucasian Regulation and Conservation Registry, I call this meeting of CRaCR Command to order at 1930 hours EST.</p>
<p><em>[Sounds of shuffling paper.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> I'm sure we've all read the briefings, so I'll cut straight to— yes, Dr. Peterson? You have your hand raised?</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> Aren't we going to say grace first?</p>
<p><strong>[LD] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> I didn't know you were Christian.</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> I'm not. Just because I think Christian cultural values are the best path forward for western society doesn't actually mean I necessarily have to believe in God, much less—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>[clears throat]</em> I think it'd be best if we moved on.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> All of us here have already worked extensively with the SCP-9009 project. We're all familiar with these creatures, their mannerisms, predilections, behavior, and life cycle. All that remains for us is to take the natural next step. Gentlemen, by this time next year, the President of the United States of America will be an Alabaster Ape.</p>
<p><strong>[LD] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> I've, ah, actually been meaning to bring up some, ah, some professional concerns with this project—</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> To be blunt, this entire operation is a stupidly massive security risk. Puppeteering Bush was bad enough, but, God, do you have any idea the level of operational complexity we're considering here? Thousands of personnel operating in <em>Washington D.C.</em>, in contact with the press day and night— there's simply no way to guarantee operational secrecy—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll find that we have your concerns well in hand. If you'd direct your attention to page 77 of the dossier?</p>
<div class="greentext">

</div>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Last year, the Public Information Bureau ran a simulated information breach with heavily modified versions of GYPSUM MAYONNAISE documentation. We ran the gamut at every level of exposure, the media, foreign intelligence services, hell, even the internet. You're looking at the results.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> Good god. If the O5s find out, you could be shot for this, Yarvin.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Who do you think approved the exercise in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>[LD] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> What does— what do the three parentheses mean?</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> Maybe some kind of, some kind of technical documentation? Cryptography, maybe a key—</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> Amateurs. It means they think the Jews did it.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Peterson is correct. Most of our targets dismissed the leaks out of hand. The intelligence agencies thought it was foreign counterintelligence. Journalists laughed our operatives out of the room. The few that followed through? Cranks, conspiracy theorists, nutjobs, they went off chasing shadows, leaping at every disinformation scheme we threw their way. In the end? Nobody sniffed us out.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> Let's speak plainly here, Yarvin.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> You're proposing the usage of anti-semitic conspiracy theories, baseless, racist garbage, as a disinformation measure for Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE. You're planning to empower these messages, hell, even spread them yourself—</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, I mean, ethically speaking—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Why not? It's been standard Foundation practice since the thirties!</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>Excuse me?</em></p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Look. You all knew what GYPSUM MAYONNAISE entailed before you walked in through that door. All of you <em>chose</em> to be here. If any of you are too chickenshit to <em>follow through</em> and <em>do what has to be done</em> for the greater good of the Foundation, feel free to leave. Door's open.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Don't fucking look at me like that, Korringer. You and I both know you've done worse for the cause.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> <em>Fuck you</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Looks like we're all still on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> Well. Your disgusting little disinfo campiagn aside, there's another big problem I think you're missing with regards to this dumpster fire of a plan.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> If you haven't already noticed, Yarvin, McCain isn't exactly leading in the polls right now.</p>
<p><strong>[LD] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> Uhm, yes. That. How are SCP-9009 instances meant to replace people of color?</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> More liberal bullshit. Just call them—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Not the time, Peterson. But yes, I understand your concern. Recent pushes for diversity in government, coupled with certain long-running demographic trends, have, unfortunately, resulted in more and more non-caucasians taking positions of leadership in government and industry. This, of course, runs contrary to the interests of the Foundation on several levels — which is why Dr. Peterson is here with us today.</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> The Sociology Institute is already in the process of drafting several long-term initiatives to secure, contain, and ultimately neutralize the liberal agenda. We must secure the existence—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>Ahem</em>, yes, thank you. We all look forwards to seeing the results of your work.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> That still doesn't solve our immediate problem. How are we going to use SCP-9009 to replace <em>him</em>? These things are good at what they do, I've seen the studies, but they're not shapeshifters. If America wakes up tomorrow and Obama is suddenly the color of skim milk people are going to <em>notice</em>, memetic camo or not.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> I was hoping our friends from BioEco might be able to help us with that. Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> I'm going to be blunt. Plastic surgery isn't going to work. I don't know what you were expecting. You realize these things have exoskeletons, right?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> Perhaps some kind of… body paint?</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> Jesus Christ. No. These things <em>molt</em>. It's not a big exposure risk, cause they usually do it out of sight and eat the leftovers, but that means we'd basically have to reapply the spray every single month.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> That'd be a goddamned fiasco to spin. A president getting a spray-tan <em>in office</em>? Total media circus.</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> I agree. Too risky, from an exposure perspective.</p>
<p><em>[Sounds of shuffling paper.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Hold on. I'm re-reading the bio report right now, paragraph four under life cycle. These things are born with <em>brown exoskeletons</em>.</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> Your point?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> My <em>point</em>, is that SCP-9009 is clearly capable of producing melanin. Couldn't we, I don't know, find a way to make a strain of these things that just… have a little more melanin than usual?</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> Good god.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> That isn't a no.</p>
<p><em>[Sounds of shuffling paper.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> It's — it's technically possible. <em>Technically.</em> They breed fast enough that artificial selection would probably see workable results within a couple hundred generations. So — four to five years, under optimal conditions. But you'd need, good god, you'd need <em>tens of thousands</em> of instances. An underground lab the size of West Virginia. Millions of dollars worth of mayonnaise. The infrastructure alone—</p>
<p><em>[Overlapping voices.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> Absolutely ridiculous, the most ludicrous proposal I've seen since—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Jirkwood:</strong> You can't actually be thinking—</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> Impossible, simply impossible—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>Impossible?</em> Impossible is a word used by lesser men. We are the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Gentlemen, the path is clear. We are going to <em>breed</em> SCP-9009. Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands. Mountains of Mayo Monkeys. Forests of Frost Giants. Seas of Suitwalkers. We are going to breed as many White People as we possibly can.</p>

<p><strong>REFINEMENT CENTER</strong><br/>
The primary purpose of the VANILLOS facility is to produce SCP-9009 instances suitable to function as figures holding positions of bureaucratic power, whether through insertion into the public or as substitutes for existing public figures. This is the purpose of the Refinement Center, in which SCP-9009 instances are surgically altered to emulate the appearance of select public figures, and trained to replicate their behavior.</p>
<p>Due to the limited capacity of the Refinement Center, local universities' business fraternities may be used as overflow. Concerns to veil integrity in this case are minimal, due to the similarities between behavior of business fraternity members and that of insufficiently-trained SCP-9009 instances.</p>
<p>SCP-9009 instances that enter the Refinement Center are largely taken from the Training Center; see below. As such, while most of them are suitable for conversion into public figures, the occasional defective units (approx. 50%) are sent to the Remediation Facility.</p>

<p><strong>TRAINING CENTER</strong><br/>
The Training Center is the second-largest facility in VANILLOS, and serves the purpose of acclimating SCP-9009 instances to leadership in human society before they are assigned to specific roles in the Refinement Center. The vast majority of the tasks given to instances in the Training Center are under the supervision of the Foundation's Coconut.aic, drastically decreasing the need for human technicians, which would require both large salaries and extensive security clearance.</p>
<p>Tasks given to SCP-9009 instances test the human skills developed in the Spatio-Navigational Center. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mock meetings given to instances; typically as either recorded videos to mimic video conferences, or as virtual-reality or hologram projections of humans. Meetings are largely designed to test instances' patience, and are engineered to last for several hours without pause.</li>
<li>Tactful Messaging Tests, in which instances are trained to send emails based on textual prompts.</li>
<li>The Final Test, in which an SCP-9009 instance is to, by its own accord, claim and convincingly prove to Coconut.aic that it is the leader (CEO, President, etc.) of the simulated workplace in which it has been placed. Upon completing this test, the SCP-9009 instance is automatically promoted to the Refinement Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, approximately 10% of instances are able to reach and complete the Final Test to the satisfaction of Coconut.aic, and are subsequently sent to the Refinement Center. The remainder are dispatched to the Remediation Facility.</p>

<p><strong>SPATIO-NAVIGATIONAL CENTER</strong><br/>
The Spatio-Navigational Center is the largest facility in VANILLOS, and is the initial testing area for newly-created SCP-9009 instances, intended to acclimatize them to human-made environments. All areas of the Spatio-Navigational Center are constantly monitored by HR.aic for SCP-9009 instances possessing confident posture, charismatic facial expressions, palatable facial structure, and high skin albedo. Instances matching these characteristics are automatically promoted to the Training Center.</p>
<p>To accommodate the large number of SCP-9009 instances within it, the Spatio-Navigational Center has been artificially inflated in size via introduction to <a href="scp-184.html">SCP-184</a>. Three-dimensional maps of the complex suggest that its internal volume is ten times larger than what one would expect from measuring its exterior. This has the pragmatic side effect of augmenting the facility's geometry to resemble a colossal, three-dimensional labyrinth composed of offices, cubicle spaces, break rooms, lounge areas, and other corporate environments.</p>
<p>Feeding is accomplished with Nordomorph Nutrient Paste, a proprietary, protein-rich blend of macro- and micronutrients optimized for SCP-9009 health. This substance is deposited in troughs at unpredictable times throughout the day and is accompanied with email notification noises to condition instances to associate the sound of an email notification with food.</p>
<p>During the time spent in the Spatio-Navigation Facility, instances also learn human skills, including bipedal locomotion; interacting with doors, cabinets, and elevators; tool use and fine motor skills; and eating solid food. More importantly than flawless execution of these skills is the outward appearance of competency while performing — an instance that confidently exhibits incorrect demonstration is more favorably assessed by HR.aic than one that diffidently displays the same behavior correctly.</p>
<p>In the end, approximately 5% of SCP-9009 instances are of sufficient quality to be promoted to the Training Center. The remaining 95% are sent to the Remediation Facility.</p>

<p><strong>CULTIVATION FACILITY</strong><br/>
SCP-9009 instances are incubated in modified Blank-Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHRs) salvaged from <a href="scp-2000.html">SCP-2000</a>, enabling the facility to produce several thousand viable instances per day.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> Each BZHR is capable of assembling a fully-grown SCP-9009 instance in six hours.</p>
<p>However, due to the inability of BZHRs to replicate SCP-9009 biology from scratch, they first require a premature SCP-9009 egg to "jump-start" the process with viable DNA. As such, SCP-9009 eggs must be procured using augmented SCP-9009 natural breeding procedures. To facilitate this, several particularly successful SCP-9009 instances have been designated as breeding stock. These instances' hormones have been altered to enable them to produce large quantities of premature eggs. To maintain genetic diversity, new instances are regularly captured and introduced to inseminate VANILLOS breeding stock.</p>
<p>Currently, the SCP-9009 instance with the highest fecundity is SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON 'Elon Musk'. At any given moment, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON contains between 500 and 1000 eggs in various stages of development. While its head, legs, and exoskeleton have remained the same size as they were prior to its tenure as VANILLOS breeding stock, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON's egg load has stretched out its body cavity to nearly twenty meters in length and four meters in diameter. As such, it is to be continuously washed with moisturizing cream by VANILLOS employees to keep its skin pliable, so it does not rip or tear. Personnel are encouraged to converse with the entity about technology, economics, and politics whilst doing this, as this is known to relax its cloacal sphincter, increasing the rate of egg deposition.</p>

<p><strong>REMEDIATION FACILITY</strong><br/>
Due to the fact that the vast majority (~99.91%) of created SCP-9009 instances are not of sufficient quality for use as public figures or breeding stock, they must somehow be safely and efficiently removed, a job performed by the on-site Remediation Facility. Due to information security concerns, instances are not to be released outside of YAKUB; due to space and sanitary concerns, they cannot be hosted within VANILLOS for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>As such, all surplus instances are to be fed into the facility's 1000-ton industrial macerator.</p>
<p>Once an SCP-9009 instance passes through the macerator, the resulting slurry is then fed into a pressurized pipe, which then pumps it to an automated processing facility. From here, the raw SCP-9009 slurry is pasteurized, filtered, and fortified with nutrients to form Nordomorph Nutrient Paste, that other instances consume.</p>

This state-of-the-art quantum generator harnesses energy from <a href="scp-037.html">SCP-037</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup> in an efficient and controlled manner. The primary suspension globule is enclosed in eighteen concentric, rotating rings that stabilize SCP-037's intense radiation output.</p>
<p>While safety concerns have been raised about using such a potent energy source, VANILLOS engineers have confirmed that not only is the Thermo-Ionic Core completely renewable, but has a far lower casualty rate than mundane sources of power; the only deaths so far have been from handling mishaps. With the enormous power output of the Thermo-Ionic Core, constant power can be supplied to the energy-intensive facilities of the VANILLOS engine, including the numerous BZHR units, hundreds of kilometers of cutting-edge plumbing, and the 1 kiloton macerator.</p>

<p>On 2014-03-12, following 816 days and 1,255 successive generations of continuous selective breeding, the VANILLOS Engine produced seven operational instances of SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV. The instances' reliable public mannerisms, relatively predictable speech patterns, and high melanin content expanded the technical capabilities of the YAKUB Directorate, and accelerated the timetable of Operation GYPSUM MAYONNAISE.</p>
<p>On 2014-08-28 at 13:00, YAKUB personnel embedded within the United States Secret Service temporarily neutralized sitting President Barack Obama, deploying SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV to take his place in a meeting with John F.

Due to scheduling constraints, at this time .OREO-UCAV's exoskeleton had not yet hardened to the standard dark blue or black hue of a mature SCP-9009 instance, resulting in minor media controversy. However, Foundation analysts concluded that .OREO-UCAV's overall behavior fell well within GYPSUM MAYONNAISE margins.</p>

<p>During the remainder of its tenure, SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV was primarily used to advance the foreign policy agenda of the Foundation, utilizing the US military and intelligence apparatus to combat the ever-growing threat of the Chaos Insurgency. Sustained aerial campaigns and strategic deployment of counter-terrorist forces enabled the Foundation to destroy Insurgency forces in Yemen, Syria, and Libya, with pro-Insurgency dictators toppled to cripple the terrorist group's paramilitary network. By 2016, the Insurgency's operational capacity in the Middle East reduced by 47%.</p>

</div>
<p>In the final quarter of SCP-9009.OREO-UCAV's presidential term, YAKUB Chairman Curtis Yarvin requested that YAKUB take advantage of the flexibility afforded by an entirely new presidential candidate and design one precision-engineered exclusively to further Foundation interests. To ensure that such a candidate would succeed in the election against an opponent with less favorable views but greater popularity, Mr. Yarvin drafted a joint plan with the Memetics Department, Public Information Bureau, and Intelligence Agency to systematically alter the result of the 2016 US presidential election. This plan was ratified by the heads and directorate boards of all three departments, and by the YAKUB Directorate, with steps preemptively taken to initiate it.</p>
<p>However, in a 12-1 vote, the O5 Council decided against any and all tampering with 2016 US presidential electoral votes. This decision was made to preserve the sanctity of the American democratic institution such that it may survive even if the Foundation is to collapse. Despite Mr. Yarvin's insistence, O5 Command vetoed the project proposal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, YAKUB was still encouraged to introduce a candidate into the 2016 presidential election, provided that they did so through legal and ethical means. As such, the YAKUB Directorate engineered the following candidate, fine-tuned to reflect the desires of the American people:</p>

<p>Greetings, Trump Handler! We've had to oversee a number of, let's just say, <em>unique</em> cases over here at Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, ever since the Foundation facilitated a peaceful <em>and</em> voluntary transfer of leadership! And perhaps none is more <em>unique</em> than SCP-9009.HAPPY-ACCIDENT, though you can call him 'Donny' or 'Trumpie' when the YAKUB Directorate isn't around (they really keep us on our toes!).</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, here are a few things you should know when watching .HAPPY-ACCIDENT on-the-clock!</p>
<hr/>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="trump-poop.webp" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9009/trump-poop.webp"/>

</div>
<p>SCP-9009.HAPPY-ACCIDENT, like <em>all</em> Yogurt Apes, has a complex set of unique and subtle facial expressions he uses to indicate how he feels! In the event that he makes a face like the one you see here, you must act quick! First of all, discreetly approach him under guise of informing him of an urgent national security concern. This way, you can whisk him away with minimal interruption from his many fans. Lead him toward a secluded area (e.g. behind a curtain, under a stairwell, or inside a vehicle) and allow him to <em>do his business</em>. Be warned, the smell is quite strong!</p>

<p>.HAPPY-ACCIDENT is strongly food-motivated, and can be feisty when he wants something to eat! While this can be an issue, it's also something you can use in a pinch to keep him away from harm. In one case, we were able to lure him away from an inopportune mating event with a 1.1-kilometer-long trail of bacon grease!

<p>While we at Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, in an ideal world, would want <em>all</em> critters to have their own unique personalities, we have to admit that, occasionally, .HAPPY-ACCIDENT forgets to do his job! Thankfully, we have an in-house solution exactly for situations like these: a simulated training ground where Donny can interact with politicians freely, <em>without</em> the potential negative side effects of chewing on their limbs!

<li>Multiple unpalatable yet necessary foreign actions by the Foundation were successfully carried out with minimal scrutiny, as both sides of the political aisle were successfully distracted — "conservative"-identifying population blocs were drawn to the scapegoats created by .HAPPY-ACCIDENT, while "liberal"-identifying blocs were drawn to .HAPPY-ACCIDENT's latest outbursts.</li>
<li>Most crucially, immigrations restrictions have drastically improved the Foundation's ability to monitor checkpoints for clandestine Chaos Insurgency assets.</li>

<p>While .HAPPY-ACCIDENT's first term has, thus far, been highly successful, several YAKUB Directorate members have noted concerns with .HAPPY-ACCIDENT's memetic effects on the American populace, such as an increase in bigotry, a reduction in trade, a lukewarm response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and, perhaps most concerning of all, a growing distrust of American democracy. However, Mr. Yarvin maintains that these losses are not only minor in comparison to the gains precipitated by .HAPPY-ACCIDENT, but have several understated benefits of their own.</p>
<p>With the 2020 presidential election approaching in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, CRaCR Command's executive cabinet suffered an unprecedented schism with regards to continued operation of .HAPPY-ACCIDENT. The pro-.HAPPY-ACCIDENT faction, headed by Chairman C. Yarvin, pointed to the manifold benefits the Foundation had accrued during the administration of .HAPPY-ACCIDENT, advocating for a Foundation-sponsored second term, whereas the anti-.HAPPY-ACCIDENT faction, headed by Dr. N. Taylor, dissented, citing the mismanagement of COVID pandemic response and general uptick in social unrest as growing threats to the primary missions of the Foundation.</p>
<p>The decision was ultimately deferred upward to O5 Command, who issued the following statement:</p>

<p>SCP-9009.WET-CARDBOARD "Joseph R. Biden," former deputy of .OREO-UCAV, was chosen as YAKUB's premier presidential nominee, as a more moderate alternative to the incautious aggression of the .HAPPY-ACCIDENT presidency. .WET-CARDBOARD was inserted into the presidential race as the Democratic nominee, running against .HAPPY-ACCIDENT. Once again, the executive decision was made to avoid interfering with election results, in order to facilitate the democratic process.</p>
<p>Inconveniently, .WET-CARDBOARD had been retired since 2017, due to accrued cognitive decay. Specialized teams were dispatched to the Site-98 storage morgue to restore the instance using <a href="scp-427.html">SCP-427</a>. However, due to unforseen interactions between SCP-427 and SCP-9009 biology, .WET-CARDBOARD retained significantly decreased cognitive faculties following revival.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-24" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-24')">24</a></sup> Despite this impairment, .WET-CARDBOARD secured the presidency in 2020 November, defeating .HAPPY-ACCIDENT.</p>

<p>.WET-CARDBOARD's platform was characteristic of SCP-9009 instances: middling, noncommittal, and ultimately futile; providing a refreshing return to the balance of normalcy. The instance was responsible for enacting numerous relief programs for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 1,400 USD stimulus checks to citizens, 300 USD weekly relief for the unemployed, and a 17 billion USD thank-you donation to SynCore Pharmaceuticals Inc. .WET-CARDBOARD additionally oversaw the successful restoration of the nation's GDP, with the aggregate statistics successfully distracting public opinion from increasing income disparity. Pandemic quarantine restrictions were ultimately lifted by the end of the year due to waning popular interest and a measured absence of consequences on the stock market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an initiative began to create a forked model of SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON "Elon Musk," due to the instance's high fecundity and superior genetics (See <strong>Cultivation Facility</strong>). After the design was finalized and a cover story engineered, SCP-9009.ROCKET-SURGEON.v1 was released to the public with 150 billion USD in assets and funds,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-25" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-25')">25</a></sup> catapulting the instance to the rank of richest hominid alive. However, it quickly became evident that further development was necessary, after .ROCKET-SURGEON.v1 expired in a tragic and unforseen accident.</p>

<p>In August of 2021, evidence surfaced that the SCP Foundation's doctrine of worldwide containment was, in part, contributing to <a href="scp-6500.html">SCP-6500</a> — a Finis-class event resulting in the mass extinction of anomalous phenomena worldwide. Several internal publishers independently found that the event was being severely exacerbated by the mass proliferation of SCP-9009, due to the species' passive release of dethaumahexane from instances' anuses, as well as their ecological niche as invasive opportunivores.</p>
<p>However, officials from the Sociology Institute stressed the importance of caution in response, citing the lack of scientific consensus supporting Foundation containment as a primary cause of SCP-6500. Ultimately, in November, O5 Command voted to preserve the tradition of containment, with goals set to reduce the anomalous extinction rate by 2030. By Q1 of 2022, the baseline anomalous extinction rate was three times that of pre-industrial levels. Inspectors from YAKUB determined that this was within acceptable margins.</p>
<p>Due to this careful vigilance being percieved as criminal institutional negligence, the Global Occult Coalition's Council of 108 convened on Feburary 17th, 2022 to discuss the escalation of global hostilities with the SCP Foundation. In response, the O5 Council authorized the YAKUB Directorate to proceed with Operation FALLING DAGGER.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="--accentColor: rgb(0, 85, 189);">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Operation FALLING DAGGER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>YAKUB Sub-Project #1937</strong></p>
<p>Due to the impending aggressive action by the GOC towards the Foundation, one of YAKUB's primary agendas was to strategically integrate SCP-9009 instances into the GOC's core leadership organs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Council of 108,</strong> consisting of secret organizations around the world, comprises the legislative body of the GOC and has parliamentary oversight over the agency's functions. However, only five member organizations of the Council of 108 possess absolute veto power: The Illuminati, Knights Templar, ICSUT, Church of Satan, and Silicon Nornir. SCP-9009 instances were covertly inserted successfully into the diplomatic and leadership bodies of these organizations; as such, these organizations' representation in the GOC Assembly was handled entirely by SCP-9009. This allowed for all resolutions to be halted unless compliant with the directive of YAKUB.</li>
<li>The Undersecretariat, more commonly known as <strong>High Command,</strong> possesses executive power over the entire agency, yet is ultimately dependent on a small number of key administrators. The Council of 108 impeached the existing bureaucrats in these positions, before appointing SCP-9009 instances to all of them.</li>
<li>The <strong>International Court for the Paranormal</strong> determines and interprets what is lawful according to its International Paralaw Codex. A Foundation-sponsored external review determined that the Codex was flawed in numerous facets; as such, it was revised by the Council of 108 to align more closely with the GOC's missions of Survival, Concealment, and Protection. YAKUB confirmed new, forward-thinking justices, following the previous ICP justices' deaths, retirements, or imprisonments.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the 2023 Assembly of the GOC, the Council of 108 resolved to pursue more progressive immigration policies into European free ports. Over the next quarter, over 730,000 SCP-9009 instances were naturalized into European states, accounting for 92% of immigration quotas across the continent.</p>

<p>However, forensic pathologists at Site-11 determined that on the Engineer's person were at least 26 dead-man's switches, each rigged to launch a cyberattack on critical Foundation data backups running on easily exploited legacy software. Before RAISA cybersecurity specialists could respond to the breach, at least 1.5 TB of data was leaked, including confidential information on the YAKUB Project and associated SCP-9009 documentation. Despite the best efforts of the Public Information Bureau implementing Cover Story 173a ("speculative creative fiction"), the leaks were able to spread widely enough among conspiracy theorist circles that mass amnesticization was considered infeasible.</p>
<p>Immediately following the initial notifications of attack, a Foundation-wide emergency was instated, warning all personnel of a potential LV-1 'Partial Lifted Veil' scenario, and an emergency session of O5 Command was convened to discuss the possible activation of the Ganymede Protocol, as well as activating Foundation first-strike nuclear submarines.</p>

Fun fact: There's a species of fly that parasitizes livestock. The government breeds male flies, irradiates them to make them sterile, and releases them into the wild to "mate" with females to decimate their population.</p>
<p>Now what do you think the government's trying to do with white people?</p>
<ol>
<li>Breed sterile insects that look like us (consider how testosterone has been declining for decades; also, X-ray TSA scanners).</li>
<li>Make them charismatic chads so females gravitate towards them.</li>
<li>They fuck, but can't produce children.</li>
<li>White people go extinct.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't understand it either. We're currently <em>the</em> most effective project in Foundation history. Why on <em>Earth</em> would they cancel it? Do NOT let this leave the YAKUB email server under any circumstances, but I'm beginning to believe there might be compromised assets in the Council. My better judgement says it's the Insurgency, but we have made a <em>lot</em> of enemies over the past few years.</p>

<p>What we should be looking for is sudden, unusual dissent in Council members' voting patterns. First of all, we can exclude all the ones who voted to keep the Program, which rules out One, Two, Seven, and Ten. We can also rule out Three, Nine, Twelve, and Thirteen, because even though they voted against us, they've been doing it consistently.</p>
<p>This leaves Four, Five, Six, Eight, and Eleven. With how much support he's given us in the past, I think Eight's dissent is the most suspicious.</p>
<p>I'll try to access their voting records; you do the number crunching.</p>

<p>Okay, I've crunched the numbers, and I think I've found something bizarre.</p>
<p>I ran a bunch of statistical tests on their voting records — T-tests, Chi-squared; even tried a few K-means clustering algorithms to identify any suspicious voting blocs.</p>
<p>However, I'm going to double-check my work again, because if I've found what I think I've found (and it's not just a Python bug), it demonstrates that the whole Council might not only <em>be</em> compromised, but <em>has been</em> compromised for <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>Okay, I double-checked One, Two, Three, Seven, Nine, Ten, Twelve, and Thirteen, the ones we know <em>aren't</em> compromised. Their voting habits are exactly what we would expect. Non-uniform, correlated and thus indicative of voting blocs, and consistent with their respective ideological leanings. Here's a graph of their voting distributions:</p>

<p>Mr. Yarvin,</p>
<p>I'd like you to join me in my office. You should know where to find me.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br/>
Eight</p>
</div>
<p>At 1200 GMT on 2024-██-██, Chairman Yarvin presented at O5-8's office chambers. The following was recorded by his Foundation-assigned hidden body microphone.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>[Creaking noises.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><em>[A switch clicks across the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>[UNKNOWN]:</strong> Welcome, Curtis.</p>
<p><em>[Hurried breathing from Yarvin.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Are you—</p>
<p><strong>[UNKNOWN]:</strong> O5-8?</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Let's skip the pleasantries. I'm a busy man. Follow me.</p>
<p><em>[Two sets of footsteps. A door creaks. The footsteps echo.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> I assure you, I'll get out of your hair as soon as—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I know what you are here for.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> The—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> My decision is final.</p>
<p><em>[O5-8 yawns.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I have no desire to hear your arguments. Rather, I brought you here to stop you from causing more damage than you have already done.</p>
<p><em>[Hurried breathing from Yarvin.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> We in the Council are aware of everything you have been doing. Your recent actions have demonstrated that you possess an allegiance to your own interests, superseding those of the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> While I do not mean to contradict your authority, at least, on the surface, the statistics seem to suggest that my work might have been highly profitable for the Foundation.</p>
<p><em>[O5-8 sharply inhales.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Do not treat me like a child. I allowed you to meet with me, not so I could be convinced of your delusional fantasies, but as a gesture of good faith. An opportunity for me to put myself at risk, to show that, nonetheless, as you implied, I still place trust in you and your ability to be useful to the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I know what you plan to do. It will not work. This tunnel stretches for five kilometers, with a blast door every nought-point-five kilometers, and if my heart is to stop, or if I am to press any one of the ten hidden buttons on my person, all of said doors will fall, and the resulting airtight chambers will fill with concentrated cyanonitriline incapacitation gas.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Please believe me, I had no intention of—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Do not martyr yourself. In the darkness of this tunnel I have stationed ten personnel armed with sniper rifles. Any action of which I do not approve will be met with your immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> But the importance of the YAKUB Project—</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> What is a "YAKUB Project"?</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Your attempt at my life will be in vain, and your body will rot in this six-kilometer tunnel. If that is all, then—</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> What do you mean by "What is a 'YAKUB Project'"?</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I mean exactly what I say.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Did you not vote to <em>cancel</em> the YAKUB Project?</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I did not. I voted to maintain the YAKUB Project. Now, once your body is disposed of by—</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> But, just two weeks ago, someone claiming to be 'O5-8' voted to cancel the YAKUB Project.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> That is correct. I did vote to cancel the YAKUB Project. Regardless—</p>
<p><em>[Yarvin's breathing slows, then abruptly halts.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> I— I have a game. A game for you.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I am skilled at a wide array of games.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> I call this one, 'O5 Council'.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> I surmise that I will likely excel at such a game, given my position.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Do you want to play?</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Okay. Here are the rules. You start the game by opening your mobile device, and composing an email to <tt><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">confucius.cockroach@yakub.scp.int</span></tt>.</p>
<p><em>[O5-8 taps his fingers on a hard surface.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> It is done. What is next?</p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Enter the root password to your SCiPNET account, and hit SEND.</p>

<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> If you mean to imply that I expected <em>more</em> than five to—</p>

<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> I've seen 9009 instances <em>peel off their own skin and eat it</em>. This is <em>terrifying</em>, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>[SI] Dr. Peterson:</strong> I always <em>knew</em> something was up with the Council—</p>

<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> That's it, I'm selling all my Foundation front stock.</p>

<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> EVERYONE! Just. Shut up. For a moment.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Yarvin:</strong> Before, I continue further, I want to make one thing clear: nothing I say here leaves these walls. All logs of this meeting are to be scrubbed from official records. If you need to leave, or you decide you aren't up for what happens next, take a standard amnestic regimen. As far as the records are concerned you were accidentally exposed to a Berryman-Langford.</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> You're all acting like children. Shut up and let me talk.</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> Shut up? More than a <em>third</em> of the O5 Council is made out of what are effectively wild animals. If <em>this</em> gets leaked, we're <em>toast</em> — no, the whole <em>Foundation</em> is toast.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Have you people forgotten what we've been doing for the better part of a decade?</p>
<p><strong>[FIA] Mr. Korringer:</strong> What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> All of you have grievances with the Council, myself included. They've demonstrated time and time again that they're unwilling to adapt to the current rapidly-changing geopolitical landscape. In the name of "stability" and "normalcy" they put every decision behind opaque red tape.</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> We are the world's foremost experts on SCP-9009 behavior. We've fine-tuned and manipulated them into <em>replacing the President of the United States</em>, for fuck's sake. <em>Nobody</em> on this goddamn planet knows anywhere <em>close</em> to what <em>we</em> know about these creatures.</p>
<p><strong>[BIO] Dr. Taylor:</strong> What, exactly, are you implying here?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> For fuck's sake, do I really need to spell it out for you people?</p>
<p><strong>[PIB] Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Five members of the Council are now under our command.</p>

<p>With incongruous voices within and outside CRaCR Command no longer obstructing the YAKUB Program, Chairman Curtis Yarvin put forward the proposal to return SCP-9009.HAPPY-ACCIDENT to the Presidency; this was confirmed by O5 Command by a 7-6 vote. MTF Beta-5 "Babysitters" was dispatched to .HAPPY-ACCIDENT's private storage facility in Palm Beach, Florida to retrieve the instance from cold storage and begin his campaign season. .HAPPY-ACCIDENT expressed emphatic discontent with this, projectile-vomiting sulfuric acid at the agents and, once they breached the perimeter, charging them 950 USD per night to stay on the resort premises. After several hours of attempted restrainment, Beta-5 agents successfully coaxed the instance back into the presidential race with a Baskin-Robbins 2600-calorie Chocolate Oreo Shake.</p>

<p><em>[Mr. Yarvin stops typing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Who are <em>you</em> to <em>lecture me</em> about the Foundation's interests?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> It's kind of funny. I doubted myself at first, too, you know? Asked the same questions as you, wrung my hands over the same petty little scruples.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>Petty?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> The "Oath". The "Code of Conduct." The "Ethics Committee." All of these, these fucking fig leaves we use to cover what we <em>actually do</em>. What we've <em>been</em> doing for two hundred and fifty fucking years. I ask you again, who the <em>fuck</em> are you to lecture <em>me</em> about "the Foundation's interests?"</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> W-we're supposed to— we're meant to protect people. From the monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Did you know we funded the KKK in the fifties? Saw the ledgers myself. Fifteen million dollars worth of rifles and bullets requisitioned from Allied armories after the Second World War, ten million dollars of discretionary funding, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>What?</em> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> In that particular circumstance? Because Southern Fifthists didn't segregate their congregations.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> But in a larger sense? Because it was <em>convenient.</em> Because they were <em>useful.</em> Because <em>they lived in the light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> This? All this? This is what it's <em>always</em> been about. Them in their teeming billions, scraping in the fucking dirt. Begging for it, longing for it. For the right to <em>grovel.</em> <em>They need us, Taylor</em>. They <em>want</em> us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> God.</p>
<p><em>[Rapid breathing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> My daughter had a friend at school. More of an acquaintance, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> This morning the school made an announcement. That she had taken her own life.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Yarvin frowns.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> She had said she was terrified. Terrified they'd take away her medication. Terrified they'd force her back 'into the closet.' Terrified that with the amount of pain they'd inflict upon her, the only logical choice was to end her own life.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Yarvin scratches his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> She did this because of the current administration — the one <em>we</em> created.</p>
<p><em>[…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>We</em> did this, Curtis.</p>
<p><em>[…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Are you really expecting me to cry over some fucking faggot offing himself? Grow the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>Fuck</em> you, Yarvin.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> <em>Fuck</em> you. You may be right. You may be right about what the Foundation was meant for. You're here, after all, alone on your throne of shit, no one left to stop you. But there's one thing you're missing. You've <em>been</em> missing this entire time.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> And what's that supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> You're <em>just not good enough</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> Sure, you're in charge. You've put those fucking animals everywhere, at the head of every government and every company that matters, you're purging everyone whose mustering even the slightest bit of resistance, you're <em>winning</em>. I'll give you that. You're winning. But you're <em>just not good enough.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Watch your fucking mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> You see it too, don't you? The cracks are already forming. What's inflation up to? Unemployment? Life expectancy's been dropping since COVID and hasn't recovered since. Every month there's a new headline, another war, another crisis, another <em>failure</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Taylor:</strong> You can cling to your little pile of shit, but you're no <em>ruler</em>, Yarvin, you're just another fucking insect. Soon, there'll be one too many. One toe over the line. Maybe a 9009 will cause it. Maybe not. Maybe your own fucking bug-breeder will be the starting point. You took the heart of a dying star and used it to <em>make insects fuck.</em> You really think that's something that's going to go without <em>consequence?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Is there a point to this tantrum?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Never mind, don't bother answering that.</p>

<p>I will not be at the helm of this organization forever. There will come, in little time, a day where the world is protected by those who are the children of my children, yet are complete strangers to me. This is of great concern to me; how can humanity live in a sane and normal world when aberrations threaten us to our very core?</p>
<p>It is now clear to me: the Glaciopithecus present the perfect vessel to continue my vision. They are not mere blithering snow monkeys, as previously thought; no, these are men, and they are ripe with the potential to continue the vision of normalcy for generations to come. No one shall ever question their legitimacy, for they exude the aspect of he who is legitimate. No agitators can stir trouble with them supervising this organization. The recently commissioned Overseer Council may serve exactly this purpose: when uncertainty is all around, the apes will keep our organization in a state of equilibrium.</p>
<p>It is with great anticipation that I leave the future of society in the hands of better men than I.</p>

<p>Subject: Bad News</p>
<p>Mr. Yarvin,</p>
<p>We've found it. We've <em>finally</em> found it. My team dug through tens of meters of rubble and a collapsed shaft into the Memetics Department's secure data backups store. We were fearing the worst — that the archives wouldn't have survived the facility's implosion — but once we entered, lo and behold, every single hard drive in the facility was intact. I guess if we can count on the Foundation for one thing, it's keeping shit locked up.</p>
<p>Now, here's the bad news:</p>
<p>They did tests for everything — subliminal messages, kinetoglyphs, visual cognitohazards, before-and-after CRV discrepancies, Telekill alloy, EVE emissions, Akiva emissions, Hume emissions, autopsies, vivisections, MRI scans, CT scans, PET scans, god, I could go on for hours. Hell, they even attempted to look for novel memetic attack vectors, the last of which was discovered in <em>nineteen-fucking-eighty</em>. And, after a decade and a half of research, after ten PhDs, after millions and millions of man-hours of work, all put into this problem that could save us uncountable sums of money in amnestics and disinformation efforts, do you want to know what they found?</p>
<p>SCP-9009 is not memetic.</p>

<p>Subject: Urgent problems with GYPSUM MAYONNAISE</p>
<p>Flags: GYPSUM-MAYONNAISE, FALLING-DAGGER, WILDFIRE-SEPTEMBER-TANGO</p>
<p>Chairman,</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the Noospherics Department and the Public Information Bureau, global psychospheric integrity, as of 2030, has deteriorated by more than 45%. While we're still unable to come up with a precise model of how this will affect SCP-9009 behavior, the research team is in unanimous agreement that it's going to be bad, to say the least.</p>
<p>Without clean input data from the global psychosphere, SCP-9009 instances will be forced to draw more and more on each other's output to model human behavior and maintain social conformity. Trials done with as little as 16 instances in psychospherically-isolated sites have demonstrated total behavorial collapse in as little as six weeks following a cessation of viable human data collection. Given the overwhelmingly high current concentrations of SCP-9009 instances in positions of global leadership, we project total collapse of existing civilizational structures within the next sixty months.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it is the consensus of the Noospherics Department that the Foundation has found itself in an escalating AK-class "End of the World" scenario, and that the Ganymede Protocol should be implemented posthaste.</p>
<p>Urgently yours,</p>

<p>OpenAI suffers record losses following the release of GPT-6, which was widely panned for its unusually slow response times, frequent outages, and regression of output quality. Due to the pivotal role of OpenAI's models in maintaining internal Foundation IT systems, a covert raid of OpenAI's datacenters by Mu-4 'Debuggers' was authorized to identify and eliminate the cause of the sudden degradation.</p>
<p>Upon raiding OpenAI's San Jose campus, Mu-4 discovered an as-of-yet undiscovered facility dug underneath the on-site datacenter. Within this facility, Mu-4 discovered roughly 10,000 SCP-9009 instances, all direct offspring of SCP-9009.PIZZAGLUE-STRAWBERRY 'Sam Altman'. All instances were found chained to desks and equipped with keyboards.</p>
<p>This facility was subsequently shuttered, the instances relocated to Foundation facilities, and SCP-9009.PIZZAGLUE-STRAWBERRY moved to YAKUB Program custody, as its unusually high fecundity made it ideal breeding stock.</p>

<p><em>[Footsteps, followed by loud thump.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Hmmm. Unresponsive.</p>
<p><em>[Rapid thumping.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>Totally</em> unresponsive.</p>
<p><em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Two decades. Shepherding these, these fucking animals. Two <em>fucking</em> decades.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> God, it's quiet.</p>
<p><em>[Rustling cloth.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> It wasn't, wasn't supposed to end like this. Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> I had it all laid out. Every last fucking detail. It was all <em>perfect</em>. We were <em>taking</em> the world back. <em>Our</em> world back. Like Tolkien said. The men of the west, besieged at their darkest hour.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Then me, enter stage right. Riding over the hills like Gandalf. Pressing Anduril into Aragorn's hands. Giving them back their right to <em>hate</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> They <em>wanted</em> it. God they <em>wanted</em> it so badly, we didn't even have to push! Cho was <em>right</em>. SCP-9009 isn't memetic. It never was. SCP-9009 was an <em>excuse</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> All the fucking cockroaches.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> I would do it again if I could. A thousand times over.</p>
<p><em>[Deep breathing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> This— this isn't the end. No. We have bunkers, we have resources, iodine pills and cloning vats. Billions will die. But millions will live. And the Foundation will be there to pick them up again. To strike while the iron is hot.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>I</em> will be there.</p>
<p><em>[Deep breathing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> <em>I</em> am the fucking Foundation.</p>
<p><em>[Rustling cloth. Uneven footsteps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yarvin:</strong> Huh. They're standing back up.</p>
