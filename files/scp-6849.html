<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The former Anderson Robotics Facility in Fayette County, West Virginia, which once housed SCP-6849, has been stripped of all important material and sealed. The location has been listed in local guides as an abandoned technology facility containing hazardous material which should be appropriately avoided. Any suspicious activities reported at the location must be forwarded to Mobile Task Force Gamma-13 (“Asimov’s Lawbringers”). All relevant documents and material from the facility have been relocated to Site-78 for storage.</p>
<p>SCP-6849-4 is housed in a medium-security humanoid containment cell at Site-58. An upright piano has been provided in the cell for entertainment, though usage is restricted during night hours. Depending on recent behavior, SCP-6849-4 may be allowed to play the piano located in the site lounge during formal events. Any suspected contact with SCP-6849-6 is to be brought to the attention of the item's Head Researcher.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-6849-11 is contained in a low-security humanoid containment cell at Site-58. Due to longtime cooperation, SCP-6849-11 is allowed advanced privileges, including free roaming of select site grounds,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> limited internet access, and visits to SCP-6849-4’s cell during day hours. Any suspected contact with SCP-6849-6 is to be brought to the attention of the item's Head Researcher.</p>
<p>Both SCP-6849-4 and SCP-6849-11 are scheduled for weekly sessions with an assigned Foundation Psychiatrist. Any changes in mood, disposition, or statements deemed alarming are to be brought to the attention of the Head Researcher for review.</p>
<p>Any suspected sighting of SCP-6849-6 worldwide is to be investigated by MTF Gamma-13. Any newly captured or defected members of GoI-014 (<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/serpent-s-hand-hub" target="_blank">The Serpent’s Hand</a>) believed to have had contact with SCP-6849-6 are to be questioned regarding the subject's possible whereabouts.</p>
<p>The corpses of the remaining eight SCP-6849 instances<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> are to be kept in Site-58’s cold storage wing. Requests by SCP-6849-4 and SCP-6849-11 for formal burial have been denied.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6849 refers to eleven entities,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> created by GoI-1115 (<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anderson-robotics-hub" target="_blank">Anderson Robotics</a>) at the group’s former facility in Fayette County, West Virginia. In an operation referred to in company files as “Project Aniborg”. The project was active from March of 2005 to November of 2008. GoI-1115 has since shown little interest in recovering project materials in Foundation possession. Questioning of captured employees has backed up the company's attitude towards the project as a failed experiment, and further demonstrated their indifference. It is unclear if similar projects are planned by the company, though it is thought unlikely.</p>
<p>Project Aniborg involved the transfer of internal body systems from selected animals into a humanoid robotic body. The central nervous system, respiratory system, and digestive system were removed and incorporated into a robotic exoskeleton via a process known to have involved varying degrees of anomalous cybernetic technology, and possibly a small degree of thaumaturgy. The exoskeleton's features were modeled after their original animal forms, but modified for upright mobility and human-like motion. Eleven successful procedures were conducted, and are listed in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-6849-4 and SCP-6849-11</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Head Researcher Dr. Charley Lucian</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>SCP-6849-4 and SCP-6849-11 have both been called in for a scheduled interview and questioning.</em></p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> You've been through this before, you guys know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Your names.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> Tigerlily.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> Prometheus.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> I of course have to ask-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> <em>(Sighs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Yeah, I know… Have either of you, since your previous questioning, had any contact with entity SCP-6849-6, also known as Kutter?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Right. Now this interview is more of a broad one. The higher ups, they want a big log with some general questions about what you are and what you've been through. Probably just to use as an FAQ-type thing in the document.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> My name is Tigerlily, I'm roughly twelve years old-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> More than that in cat-years.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> I suppose so. I was born into a litter with four siblings. We were acquired by Anderson Robotics and converted into… this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> I'm Prometheus. I was a dog, now I'm a robot-dog who likes flame-painted skateboards and classical music.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Do either of you remember your lives before? Tigerlily, I know you were probably too young.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> I remember… a big window. People were walking by in front of it. The short ones loved to stop and look at us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Standard pet store display?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> Yes. Had to be.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> At least you were in a shop…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> <em>Prometheus</em>, you were older when they found you. What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> A lot of alleyways. A cold winter or two. I ate a few too many old burgers out of trash cans. Then one day a van comes by and throws me in the back with a bunch of other mutts they found.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> Other mutts?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> I don't know how many, but they poked and prodded all of us to see if we were fit for what they were planning. Me and Jazzie made the cut.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> And what happened after you passed their test?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> They restrained my legs and head, then shaved me. They put pads on me to monitor my systems, and finally they put me under.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lucian:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> I woke up… and I was… I…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-11:</strong> For the first time in my life, I could <em>think</em>…</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> Terror… is the word.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Recovered GoI-1115 Documents Regarding SCP-6849</p>
<p>Project Aniborg's subjects served as prototypes for a new animal conversion service by Anderson Robotics. The service involved transferring a customer's animal companion into a cybernetic body, giving them human-like mobility and thought. This would be done to enhance companionship, with the owner choosing to set their companion's new intelligence depending on their desired purpose. A recovered document listed three such conversion options:<br/></p>

Hundreds of other documents were recovered from the facility after its capture. Though most were of a technical and research nature, the journal of Facility Manager Matt Stephenson was recovered. The journal provided an overview of the project, and a personal look into the subjects and events at the site leading up to Incident 6849-A01. It has been transcribed below as Document 6849-J89.<br/>

They finally finished the new place, took long enough. They gave me a tour of our new playground, and I don't believe I could have asked for anything better. That said, Dr. Contos was adamant the site be remote. I suppose the other side of the country is remote enough. The closest town is Beards Fork, down the road. Only about a hundred people, low enough we can work without anyone getting too close to what we're doing.</p>
<p>I haven't been to the town shop yet, the company is supposed to send us supplies, but I'll be a butt if I can't get a fresh burger from the store.</p>
<p><strong>March 18th, 2005</strong><br/>
I said goodbye to Jessica today. I told her I'd see her again in a month, but to her that must feel like forever. I've never been gone this long.</p>
<p>Before I left, she gave me her necklace, the one I got her for our first anniversary. The others might make fun of me for walking around with a little golden cross around my neck, but to have her and the Lord with me, it's a price I'm always willing to pay.</p>
<p>They always ask how a praying man like me could do what I've done, or do what we're about to do. God made our bodies to be improved upon. And God made the world's creatures so we could do the same to them.</p>
<p><strong>March 27th, 2005</strong><br/>
Most of the R&amp;D team has arrived, and so has our first shipment. Four <em>Rattus norvegicus domestica</em>, or standard lab rats, labeled 1-1 through 1-4.</p>
<p>The team got right to work examining them. Pumping them with a few small jolts, and seeing how they could best graft their flesh to new circuits. It may be a long time before we even have a working prototype. But I'm patient, and I've made it very clear to Dr. Contos what we need.</p>
<p><strong>April 21st, 2005</strong><br/>
The first batch are gone. One-by-one they gave out, I suppose it was too much for them. We learned everything we could, and stored them when we were done. Until the company's ice box gets here, they'll be in the freezer. Let's hope I don't pull out a dead rat the next time I go for a coke.</p>

<p><strong>June 9th, 2005</strong><br/>
Third batch is gone, but we've gained some promising leads. Johnny was able to replace the eyes in 3-4 with new ones, and they worked too. Of course then the infection set in. I'll have the team keep closer to cleanliness standards around here, we've grown a bit too sloppy.</p>

Successful leg transplant on 10-2. They're simple, and 10-2 has had some trouble getting used to them, but I think the time has come to move to bigger things.</p>
<p><strong>October 7th, 2005</strong><br/>
Matthew got 11-9's brain to control one of the prototype arms for a few minutes before it expired. We may be able to try a full procedure soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>November 21st, 2005</strong><br/>
Subject 13-1, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 13-2, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 13-5, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 13-7, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 13-8, Procedure attempted, gained full motor control for 14 seconds before expiring.</p>
<p>We're close.</p>
<p><strong>November 23rd, 2005</strong><br/>
Batch 14 arrived. Four standard lab rats, three <em>Rattus norvegicus</em>. Street rats. They didn't say where they got them, but they probably think if they shake things up a little we'll bring them a better result, like we're a beaker that needs to be tapped.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>December 2nd, 2005</strong><br/>
Subject 14-2, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 14-3, Procedure attempted, gained partial motor control for 4 seconds before expiring. Subject 14-4, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 14-5, Procedure attempted, gained full motor control for nine minutes before expiring.</p>
<p>One of the street rats. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>December 10th, 2005</strong><br/>
Subject 14-6, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 14-7, procedure attempted, gained full motor control. Time elapsed: 27 hours. None of us have slept.</p>
<p>I named him Adam.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 1st, 2006</strong><br/>
He knows how to say <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>. I taught him how to say <em>please</em> as well. To think that three months ago I received him in a box, nibbling on a carrot cube.</p>
<p>Dr. Contos and Mr. Dillard visited three days ago. To say they were impressed by our prototype is an understatement. Though Contos was a tad upset by my use of biblical passages to help Adam practice his speaking.</p>
<p>We just received ten more street rats today, they think the specially bred specimens might have something about them that lowers their success rate. Looking at the results, who am I to argue?</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 19th, 2006</strong><br/>
I named the new one Magnus, Adam has been showing him around, teaching him the basics. Jessica always wanted children, but I'd always been too long away from home. I've been thinking about what I want once this project is done. Settling down at home, making a family, It doesn't sound bad. Besides, how many men get the chance to practice their parenting skills on a couple mice?</p>
<p>The workers came in to start converting the old break room into a nursery. They brought with them two armed guards, and it appears they won't be leaving. Silva even proposed installing a kill-switch if they become a problem, I vetoed it immediately. To think any of these creatures would ever want to harm us. Even if they could.</p>
<p><strong>March 20th, 2006</strong><br/>
A batch of dogs. I told them it was too early to start working with bigger animals, but they opened the back of their van to show me the barkers in their cages. Strays from Pittsburgh, they said.</p>
<p>We examined each of them to see if they were fit to work with. Only the husky and the poodle were approved. The men from the company took the rest and drove off to do lord knows what. Well, that's their own cross to bear, we have ours here.</p>
<p><strong>April 4th, 2006</strong><br/>
I let the team name them this time. The husky was named Prometheus (was 'Anderson' not good enough?) The poodle was named Jazzie. Already they seem to be catching onto things faster than either Adam or Magnus.</p>
<p>Speaking of, Magnus read to us 'The Cat in the Hat' last night. We all clapped for him, and if he could smile, I bet he would've. To think we took a mouse off the street and taught it to read. This is the reason I work.</p>
<p><strong>April 14th, 2006</strong><br/>
The van came by again. This time seven cats off the streets of Pittsburgh. Three of them were approved.</p>
<p><strong>May 10th, 2006</strong><br/>
Subject 17-1, Procedure attempted, expired. Subject 17-2, Procedure attempted, gained full motor control for 91 seconds before expiring. Subject 17-3, Procedure attempted, success.</p>
<p><strong>May 13th, 2006</strong><br/>
Jazzie has been showing Lily around, they've gotten along well for a cat and a dog. She tried to bite Adam once, animal instincts? Or just being playful?</p>
<p>Prometheus asked me if he could go outside today. I said I'd ask the company to construct a fence to make it safe. He seemed disappointed.</p>
<p>I'll start playing some music during the day to calm them down. Maybe they'll like Beethoven.</p>

They dropped off our supplies today, and a dog with it. They left without saying a word.</p>
<p>A German Shephard, dirty, with a faded collar that said <em>Cutter</em>. He scooched away when one of us approached his cage.</p>

Happy late Christmas present. A litter of five kittens from a pet shop in Charleston.</p>
<p>Cutter says he wants to write his name with a "K" from now on. When I told him that wasn't the proper spelling, he did that odd thing with his jaw. Like his brain is telling him to growl, even without lips.</p>
<p><strong>January 5th, 2007</strong><br/>
Striker, Maximus, Jasper, Rosie-Fluff, and Tigerlily. A long naming session between us, and probably the last we'll have for a while. I told Contos to either send more staff or stop sending us more animals. It seems we'll be focusing on the subjects we have.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 9th, 2007</strong><br/>
They're all from the same litter, you'd think they would be somewhat similar. But Striker and Maximus run around together, causing chaos. All while their brother Jasper is finishing his chores to the letter.</p>
<p>The two girls, Rosie-Fluff and Tigerlily, are an odd case. Every time I walk past, they have their heads buried in books. Tigerlily in some Dr. Seuss tale, and Rosie-Fluff in a magazine one of us accidentally left lying around. Her and Cutter especially love to talk.</p>
<p>Speaking of Cutter, he and Prometheus have grown close. I've found them several times discussing their memories on the city streets, before they came here. I suppose it was inevitable they'd bond over such an experience.</p>
<p><strong>April 23rd, 2007</strong><br/>
Jazzie and Lily. They've been close ever since they met, and lately they've spent every free moment together. This morning I saw them both sitting against the wall, Jazzie had Lily's hand in his mouth. I knew it was a fake-bite, the type dogs do for fun (maybe more in this case?). But one of the security men had his hand on his gun until I motioned him away.</p>
<p>Rosie-Fluff was watching him, though. Simple curiosity, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>June 5th, 2007</strong><br/>
Rosie-Fluff asked me about the security men and their guns. I told her not to ask anyone about that again. I'll tell them to keep a closer eye on her. I already had a bad feeling when she giggled after I told her the story of Abel's death.</p>
<p>Speaking of bad feelings, Cutter. Every time we let them outside he's strolling near the fence, looking it up and down, sniffing every nook. I could tell him to stop, but would that only make it worse?</p>
<p>I'm not stupid, he feels like a caged animal. He <em>is</em> a caged animal. I only hope that once this is done, we can find a better place for him.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 29th, 2008</strong><br/>
Happy leap day. Nothing of note to tell. Adam and Magnus are like brothers. Having been with us the longest, they're by far our most obedient and well-adjusted subjects. I can only hope their example takes to the others.</p>
<p>Jazzie and Lily are never apart, do we have ourselves a Romeo and Juliet? A star-crossed dog and cat? Speaking of dogs, Prometheus spends a tad too much time in front of the TV, but he's taken well to the music I introduced to him. He said he wanted to learn to sound like Beethoven. I should request the transfer of a keyboard soon. I can think of no better way to open our public demonstration than a dog playing the piano.</p>
<p>Cutter? Well, he's Cutter. He's scored the highest so far in the math and puzzle tests, but he's begun to neglect his chores. I worry for him.</p>
<p>Of the five kitten siblings, I don't think I've seen a more dysfunctional family. Striker and Maximus have been reprimanded for bullying Jasper twice, I even heard Striker call him his "Abel" in a fit of anger. Rosie-Fluff can almost compete with Cutter on the puzzles, but she's shown a particular interest in the Old Testament literature I let her read, especially the ones with violence. Tigerlily makes up for it, however. Never met a more curious little cat, passionate to learn. I've even started allowing her to assist in some of our work.</p>
<p>Truly, all walks of life growing within these walls. But for better or worse?</p>
<p><strong>April 1st, 2008</strong><br/>
Maximus put a whoopie-cushion under my chair when I sat down for breakfast this morning. Lord knows where he got it.</p>
<p>Staff morale isn't what it was. Once all the testing and research is done, it simply feels like we're raising a group of dysfunctional children. Peter quipped that we were working for "Anderson Daycare", and the name is catching on.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>June 2nd, 2008</strong><br/>
Maximus and Striker tried pulling one of their jokes on Cutter. He responded with a metal-fist to Striker's face.</p>
<p>We put all three of them in the cage for a few days. When they came out, there was no more violence. No, not from fear. They respect him now. I have a feeling Cutter is what you could call their "Alpha".</p>
<p>That is something I cannot allow.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>September 15th, 2008</strong><br/>
He's the smartest out of all of them, I know that. Despite our efforts, his sway with the others is growing. He got his taste of power after the incident with Striker, and he's leaning into it. Not like I can just throw him in the cage, that would make him a martyr. But I also don't like leaving him to his own devices. I suppose I can't exactly complain, we wanted to take animals and make them think like people. They definitely think like people now. I can only hope they'll see the light.</p>
<p>As much as I urge everyone under me to do their part in keeping everything under control, the problem only grows. They're tired of disciplining what are supposed to be our research subjects, they're tired of being a 24/7 daycare.</p>
<p>I'm sending Dr. Contos a request. Behavioral specialists, more security, and to transfer Cutter somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>September 23rd, 2008</strong><br/>
The security arrived, armed to the teeth. When I asked for more, I meant a few men with pistols. Now we have a closet full of rifles and bullets. Already, I'm feeling something bad.</p>
<p>To no surprise, the other requests were denied. If Cutter becomes a bigger problem… Well, I hope we won't have to use the guns.</p>
<p><strong>October 15th, 2008</strong><br/>
They're going to him now instead of us. Jazzie and Rosie-Fluff disagreed on who was supposed to have the copy of Hamlet for the day. With the staff brushing them off more and more, it's no wonder they went to Cutter instead to solve it.</p>
<p>I pray for them, for us. But I feel like I'm losing control.</p>
<p><strong>October 27th, 2008</strong><br/>
The company would never allow this, but I felt like I had no other choice. I called them all in, and gave each of them a bible. I asked them to read some of it before they went to bed, and in it they would finally find something to put their faith in. Something else they could follow.</p>
<p>I can only hope to bring them something before the angry letter from Contos arrives. He wouldn't give me what I needed, so I gave them what they needed.</p>
<p>Lord, please guide them. Show them the light, and bring peace to this place.</p>
<p><strong>November 1st, 2008</strong><br/>
I heard Rosie-Fluff call him their "Moses".</p>
<p>Only Adam, Magnus, and Jasper have shown themselves above his spell. But the others have alienated them over it.</p>
<p>I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>November 10th, 2008</strong><br/>
Adam and Jasper confronted Cutter in the hallway. He punched and kicked them both until security drew their guns at him. It was only luck that I was there to stop them.</p>
<p>He's in the cage for the next week. How did I lose control of all this?</p>
<p><strong>November 21th, 2008</strong><br/>
Adam died yesterday. Cutter stabbed him to death with a shiv.</p>
<p>He's in the cage now. Tomorrow we're going to take him into the mountains and terminate him.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Cutter, but you brought this on yourself.</p>
<p><em>As did you. Apology accepted. -Kutter</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Incident 6849-A01</p>
<p>On November 22nd, 2008, a revolt took place at the Facility under the instigation of SCP-6849-6. All personnel were killed and the subjects gained control of the facility. Portions of the revolt were recorded on the Facility's surveillance system, and later recovered by MTF Gamma-13.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transcribed Scene from Facility Security Records</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Note: The Facility's surveillance system only recorded from a single monitor, which constantly switched between different cameras throughout the Facility.</em></p>
<p>[BEGIN RECORDING]</p>
<p><em>(Camera pans past a supply closet. The door appears damaged, and sits wide open. Several guns and loose magazines are scattered inside. One subject, believed to be SCP-6849-10, walks past holding a rifle. The camera pans just enough to see the upper part of SCP-6849-2, lying dead on the ground. Heavy damage covers his face and chest.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Recording switches to a break-room. SCP-6849-9 and a scientist are hiding under a table. The corpse of a security officer is lying against the wall. SCP-6849-7 steps into frame, grabbing and flipping the table away. The scientist attempts to run, but is shot by SCP-6849-7, who appears to laugh. SCP-6849-8 appears alongside him, and both approach SCP-6849-9, who backs up to a wall. They yell and scream at each other.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> SCP-6849-7 and -8 lift their weapons and fire on SCP-6849-9. SCP-6849-9 falls against the wall, emitting sparks.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Recording switches to Matt Stephenson's office. Stephenson is crawling towards his desk, he is bleeding from several bullet wounds in his legs. SCP-6849-6 is standing over him. As this was the only camera with sound equipment, their dialogue was recorded.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> -ease lord, save me…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> Shut up!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 slams a robotic leg down on Stephenson's foot, Stephenson lets out a cry of pain.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> What- <em>(groan)</em> What did I do to you!? What did I do to have you slaughter me like a dog!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> 'Like a dog'!</p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> I'm- That's not what I meant! Why!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> What are we to you?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> <em>What are we!?</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> You're… you're our greatest creation-</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 kicks Stephenson in the stomach, ushering another cry of pain.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> I'll tell what I was before, before… this.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> You were a dog! A dog we took in, gave you a <em>mind</em>…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> I was a <em>plaything!</em> For a couple humans. One of them… she liked me. Not for me, but for what I was. <em>'Momma's big boy'</em>, she called me in front of her friends. Got me to sit for them, shake for them… I wasn't even a <em>pet</em>, I was something to show off, a <em>toy</em>. Once they left, I didn't exist. I remember the scorn in her eyes when I had to remind her to feed me.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> Look, Cutter…<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> And the <em>other</em> one… never met a more insecure man. Well, <em>you're</em> still a runner up. But he didn't like me. Not. One. Bit. Whenever she disappeared, I became a different type of toy. An object of scorn for a jealous man. One who preferred cigarettes and belts to hunger and neglect.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> I'm sorry!</p>
<p><em>(Stephenson looks down, then back to SCP-6849-6.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> I'm sorry I didn't do more for you…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> You've done enough. I escaped once. Wandered the streets, a better teacher than you. I learned to <em>take</em> what I wanted, to be ready at all times to fight for my life. Then some men tossed me in the back of a van, and I came here. You're right, you gave me a mind. And I'll get something else when I escape again.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 steps up to Stephenson.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> I'm not going to be another toy. Not another <em>product</em> for someone else.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 looks up to the camera.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> <em>I am Kutter with a 'K'! Not your new gadget!</em> Once I'm done here, I'm coming for <em>you</em>, Mr. Contos! And the rest of you!</p>
<p><em>(Stephenson weakly grabs the cross around his neck, muttering.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Stephenson:</strong> <em>Jessica… Jessica…</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 turns to Stephenson and raises his weapon to his head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> Thank you. For everything.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 shoots Stephenson in the head, killing him. After a few seconds of silence, he bends down, pulling Stephenson's cross up and over his head. Looking at it for a moment, he places it around his own neck. SCP-6849-6 then walks around to Stephenson's desk. Sitting down in the seat, he looks over various papers on the desk. Finding Stephenson's journal, he begins to examine it. SCP-6849-4 steps into the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> We did it. They're all gone.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> Thank you, Prometheus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-4:</strong> What now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> Now… we're our own masters. Call everyone into the conference room, I have some ideas about our next move.</p>

<p>On December 14th, some of the nine remaining subjects began to raid the small nearby neighborhood of Beards Fork, West Virginia. The subjects caused moderate property damage, and several civilians were hospitalized due to injuries while attempting to fight the subjects. No civilian casualties occurred, though it became apparent the local police force was ill-equipped for the situation.</p>

<p>When it became apparent the local police were incapable of handling the situation, the town's mayor requested assistance from the governor. However, by this time the events in Beards Fork had come under Foundation attention. On 12/16/2008, a small team from Mobile Task Force Gamma-13 ("Asimov's Lawbringers") were sent to capture or neutralize the subjects, under the guise of National Guard troops.</p>

<p>SCP-6849-10's corpse was recovered an hour later by Foundation Agents. Witnesses to the event were subsequently questioned, and amnesticized after their recordings were retrieved.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong> Facility Raid</p>
<p>MTF Gamma-13 continued to follow the car out of the town. Due to SCP-6849-7 and -8's presumed inexperience operating a vehicle, their driving was haphazard and chaotic. Gamma-13 elected not to capture them, and instead have the subjects lead them back to their intended destination. The strategy was successful, as the team were led back to the former Facility.</p>

<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 is sitting in Matt Stephenson's former office. The room is noticeably more decrepit, with trash littering the floor. In the middle of the room is a stain of blood where Stephenson was killed. SCP-6849-6 appears to be reading a document when SCP-6849-7 and -8 storm into the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-7:</strong> Kutter!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-8:</strong> They're back! We tried to fight them! But- but Rose-Thorn-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> What? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-7:</strong> They shot at us! They killed Rose-Thorn so we had to run!</p>

<p><em>(SCP-6849-6 gets up and walks out of the room, pushing through SCP-6849-7 and -8. The pair look to each other, then follow him out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-6:</strong> Everyone! Grab your weapons! Lock the doors outside!</p>
<p><em>(Recording switches to the break room. SCP-6849-3 and SCP-6849-5 are sitting in a seat, rubbing their metal noses together. They perk up, presumably at SCP-6849-6's yelling. They grab their weapons and run out of the room.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Recording switches to the laboratory. SCP-6849-11 is standing and looking out the window, either out of range of or ignoring SCP-6849-6's yelling. She's holding Matt Stephenson's journal in her hand. SCP-6849-7 and -8 appear behind her. They look at each other, and SCP-6849-8 approaches her, getting her attention. The three talk for several seconds. SCP-6849-11 appears distressed, she drops the journal and buries her face in her hands. SCP-6849-8 grabs her and hugs her, SCP-6849-7 joins them both. SCP-6849-7 and -8 then let go of her, picking up their weapons and leaving. SCP-6849-11 picks up her own nearby weapon, looking at it. Setting the weapon down, she turns back around and looks out the window.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Recording switches to the outdoor entrance. SCP-6849-4 is in the parking lot with a skateboard, stepping onto and attempting to ride it. Looking up, he sees MTF Gamma-13 and their jeep coming towards him from down the road. Dropping the skateboard, he runs inside as Gamma-13 begins shooting at him.)</em></p>

<p><strong>J:</strong> Danny!</p>
<p><em>(J grabs and pulls D behind a nearby car, where the team takes shelter from another barrage of bullets. J briefly raises his head to locate the hostile. He sees SCP-6849-7 standing on the roof.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-7:</strong> That's for my sister!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-7 continues to yell as he peppers the car with more bullets. J looks to the others, C is preforming first aid on D, who is bleeding from several bullet wounds.)</em></p>

<p><strong>D:</strong> <em>(Hyperventilating)</em> I… can't…</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Don't talk!</p>
<p><em>(C applies more bandages to D as B picks up the transceiver, requesting medical assistance. During a brief lapse in gunfire, J takes his rifle. Pointing it to the roof, he sees SCP-6849-8 has joined -7, along with a third figure, identified as SCP-6849-6, who turns and leaves upon sighting him. J takes a shot at them, but misses. He dives back under cover as more gunfire erupts.)</em></p>

<p><strong>J:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6849-8:</strong> <em>Striker!</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-6849-8 drops his gun, bending down to SCP-6849-7. J takes another shot, hitting the concrete wall just below SCP-6849-8. Seeing this, SCP-6849-8 picks up -7's corpse and drags it out of sight.)</em></p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> There you go! Get out of here!</p>

<p><strong>C:</strong> He's going into shock!</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Dammit! Alright, B, tell them to expedite that medical team! C, get all our med supplies from the jeep!</p>

<p><strong>J:</strong> Go! I'll cover!</p>

<p><em>(Recording switches to the walled outdoor area. Within the small enclosure, four fresh graves can be seen. They are marked by crude wooden crosses, carved onto each of them are the names "Adam", "Magnus", "Jasper", and "Matt". Several empty graves are also seen, one of them is only partially dug. The camera pans across the enclosure, revealing a jumbled pile of human corpses. All of them are in either Anderson Robotics attire or security uniforms. A group of crows is feeding on them.)</em></p>

C says something to J while shaking his head. J screams something at him, then points to the area behind the car where Operative D is located. He steps away, angrily throwing the medkit box and its used contents across the parking lot. J then sits down against the front of the car, rubbing his face. C moves to the approaching medical technicians, speaking to them. The technician nods, and hands his emergency kit to the technician behind him, who walks away.)</em></p>

Operative J watches the first transport drive away, he sighs, and walks towards the three captured entities. He then breaks into a sprint towards SCP-6849-8. Stopping in front of him, he pulls out a pistol and points it towards SCP-6849-8. SCP-6849-8 shows no reaction, despite -4 and -11's screams.

<p><strong>Addendum 5:</strong> Post-Raid Events</p>
<p>MTF Gamma-13 secured the Facility within hours of the raid, with Operative Danny Connors being the only Foundation casualty. The Facility was scrutinized and searched over the next month. All documents, research data, and other items of importance were transferred to Site-78 for study and storage. The corpses of the Facility's 26 staff members, including that of Manager Matt Stephenson, were recovered for brief analysis, and delivered to respective next-of-kin.</p>
<p>Of the original 11 subjects, 7 were killed or found deceased, 3 were uncontained, and 3 were captured. The three captured subjects were taken to Site-58 and individually interviewed shortly after arrival.</p>

<p>Items 4 and 8 appeared severely distressed during the time I spoke to them. Item 11 on the other hand seemed stable, though closed-off. All of them appeared lacking in emotional development, suggesting their psychology was similar to that of an older child. Knowing this, combined with the series of events they have just endured, their reactions become more clear. Recommending full evaluation by a Foundation Psychologist.</p>

<p>The next morning, SCP-6849-8 was discovered deceased in his temporary holding cell. It was found that during the night, SCP-6849-8 had torn open his own neck and ripped apart his exposed windpipe, suffocating himself. A message written on a crumpled paper was found next to his body:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Im sorry Tigerlily. I wasnt a very good brother. I did a lot bad things. I got Rose thorn and Striker killed by the people with guns. me and Striker killed Jasper becase he was like Able. He always made us mad and everyone liked him more than us. I killed our friends back home becase I wanted to be strong like Kutter said. I don't want to be strong anymore. I want to see Striker and Rose thorn and Jasper and Adam and Magnas and Matt and Peter and Silva and everyone else in heaven and tell them how sorry I am. I want to cry tell them Im sorry for killing them and then they will forgive me. And I will do all of that in heaven becase Matt said everything was perfect there and there they forgive all the bad things everyone does. Dont be sad Tigerlily please dont. Some day you and Promithius will be in heaven too and well all be a happy family again."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>SCP-6849-4 and SCP-6849-11 were put under 24/7 surveillance for approximately a month following this event. Their exoskeletons were later modified to prevent a similar event occurring.</p>
<p>The two surviving subjects underwent psychological evaluation, and subsequently diagnosed with moderate and severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, respectively. SCP-6849-11 in particular also exhibited symptoms of depression. These conditions have so far been minimized by regular therapy and treatments.</p>
<p>SCP-6849-3, SCP-6849-5, and SCP-6849-6 escaped the Facility during the raid and were able to evade capture by Gamma-13. The whereabouts of SCP-6849-3 and -5 were unknown until 2010, when the subject's corpses were discovered, embraced against a tree, approximately five kilometers from the site. Subsequent investigation concluded the subjects had attempted to survive in the wilderness, where their bionic components gradually deteriorated and failed over the next six months, resulting in their deaths.</p>
<p>SCP-6849-6 next appeared in the company of several GoI-014 (The Serpent's Hand) members on 8/4/2009, during a raid on a Foundation transport. How SCP-6849-6 came to be in the Serpent's Hand is unknown, but has since participated in multiple raids on Foundation facilities. According to information gathered from other captured members, SCP-6849-6 is aware of SCP-6849-4 and -11's current containment, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but has so far made no effort to contact either subject.</span> (See: Addendum 6)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 6:</strong> Contact with SCP-6849-6</p>
<p>At approximately midnight, on 12/16/2023, SCP-6849-6 successfully infiltrated Site-58. It is currently unknown what methods SCP-6849-6 employed to do so, but a reevaluation of Site security has since been proposed. Despite the level of access SCP-6849-6 was able to achieve, the subject only visited the containment chambers of SCP-6849-4 and -11. All security footage during the period was erased, with the exception of the interactions in the containment chambers, which have been recorded and transcribed.</p>
