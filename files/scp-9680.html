<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Archived Containment Procedures (preserved during reclassification):</strong> Produce and seed markets are to be monitored for sellers of SCP-9680.

</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9680 are specific packets of 30 different seed varieties from the Méndez Corporation. Species have been found to vary with no clear pattern or majority species, but primarily consist of food or textile crops (wheat, corn, cotton, sugarcane, etc.) SCP-9680 instances appear identical to nonanomalous equivalents sold by Méndez, but exhibit rapid growth patterns when planted. These extend to increased success not only in growth of planted seeds, but in seed production, pollen spread, and fruit production.</p>
<p>SCP-9680 instances have been sold in Northern India for the past three years. Instances have been found in small <em>mandis</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. Analyses by GoI-1469 and Foundation psychokinetic and thaumaturgical experts indicate an anomalous origin of recovered SCP-9680 instances.</p>
<p>Samples of all known varieties of SCP-9680 are currently in test growth chambers mimicking in situ conditions, in permanent Foundation sites located in the Middle East, due to personnel concerns.</p>
<p>The Méndez Corporation has shown no previous signs of anomalous activity as a major agricultural producer for the continental United States founded in, registered, and operating solely in Veil-compliant areas since incorporation. Addition to Foundation Groups of Interest may be considered.</p>
<p>SCP-9680 was first discovered by GoI-1469. Communication regarding SCP-9680's discovery can be found below, originally delivered as a letter that spontaneously manifested in Interim-Site 93's break room.</p>
<p>Given the history of positive collaboration with GoI-1469 and the importance of maintaining this relationship as the Foundation establishes presence in the Indian subcontinent, this letter and its contents were made top priority.</p>

</div>
<p>We have noticed a few problems that it may interest you to look at. We know we are asking something rather soon after you've come here. But as friends, we should help each other, no?</p>
<p>Those in mandis around here have been acting strange. Some farmers sell seeds they would need for future seasons with reckless abandon; come into money they could not have earned legally; grown new types of familiar plants that we have never seen before.</p>
<p>As is expected, we "ran point" as you all say, and collected some of these seeds. They do not taste different, look different, smell different.</p>
<p>Our psychic sweeps show nothing. Our tracers show nothing. Our strongest <em>jadhus</em> can find little more than the smallest of traces of magic. What we can find, it is most certainly nothing we are familiar with.</p>
<p>This scares us. It is our job to know these things. These people rely on us, as we rely on you now.</p>
<p>We do request your assistance in this case, with your technology to detect potential godly or magical influence. In return you will find us more than willing to help you with tasks associated.</p>
<p>You will also find some sweets with this message. Consider them a housewarming gift. Please keep in mind the <em>kaju katli</em> have cashews, for those with allergies. They are the white, diamond shaped ones.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9680.1 - January 1973</strong></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>The sole local Mobile Task Force formed at the time, MTF Epsilon-65 ("Trishula") was dispatched. MTF E-65, at the time, primarily consisted of non-military personnel designed to supplement GoI-1469 forces. Members visited a <em>mandi</em> near a local Nexus, Jalandhar's Depths, for field research. GoI-1469 contacts met Foundation personnel there.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel concerns required a greater than expected GoI-1469 presence.</p>
<div class="jotting">
<p><span style="font-size:110%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Field Personnel:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Operative Santos:</strong> Environmental researcher specializing in counteroffensives against anomalous invasive species.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Operative Wyle:</strong> Field director of MTF Epsilon-65.</p>
<p><strong><em>Jadhughar</em> Malkit Singh</strong>: Senior thaumaturgical expert of GoI-1469, specializing in parabotany, paraecology, and anthropology.</p>
<p><strong><em>Baazighar</em> Jashan Arora</strong>: Junior thaumaturgical expert of GoI-1469.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Recording from Santos' body camera begins as the group walk towards the mandi. They are attempting to cross the street to a large group of tents.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> So! That's where it happens. The magic. Not, well, not actual magic, but the magic of food! Commerce! <em>Food!</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Arora, please behave.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Aw. I just want to show them. Have you two had a real, fresh mango? Or maybe some sugarcane? Sugarcane <em>juice?</em> Singh sahib, we never get anyone as new as them on our trips.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Singh, it's fine. We'd love to, at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Later, then. You're buying.</p>
<p><em>[A car speeds past them as they cross, nearly striking Santos.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> <em>Fuck!</em> Why are there so many people here?</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Why are there birds in the sky?</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Fine, I just— can't they drive <em>normally</em>, please? And the honking. My <em>head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> This is normal. Please just keep your eyes open, people are always in a rush here.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> No shit.</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> There are those who work in the city. They will be in a rush. You will see a lot of intermingling from stall to stall. They will be in a rush. You trade for what you don't have, and usually buy and sell enough to make a small amount of profit if those from the city come to buy from you.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Variable rates? C’mon Singh, why spoil the surprise for us foreigners so soon?</p>
<p><em>[Singh smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> That’s not the case <em>officially,</em> no.</p>
<p><em>[The group arrive. Sellers have their produce spread out on blankets on the floor, in large, haphazard piles. They hawk their wares at passersby.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Seller 1:</strong> <em>(translated from Punjabi)</em> Brother! Three for five rupees! Better deal, you'll never see. Brother!</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Christ.</p>

<p>A portion of the <em>mandi.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Watch your throat, Santos. Very nice and dusty here.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Heard. I’ll try my best not to keel over coughing.</p>
<p><strong>Seller 2:</strong> <em>(translated from Punjabi)</em> Fresh mangos, juicy, sticky, so sweet you'll need to wash your hands soon! Fresh mangos here, get them, eat them now!</p>
<p><em>[Arora briefly leaves the group to head to the seller. After taking a few steps, he rejoins.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> I am told they should be in the back. Closer to the roads, you see. Many will come in wagons, carts, that sort of thing if they expect to be purchasing seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> No little packets to be seen here. Is that usually a bulk purchase?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Yes! Usually farmers, if they need it. Not often though. We usually collect seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> We?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> My family works the fields for a living. Not here. A village. Small one, near Tarn Taran. It's a quaint little thing. An acre at most, maybe? But I worked them too, before I came here and joined the House.</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Where we <em>found</em> Arora, in fact. What a story that one was.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> And for that, <em>Singh-ji</em>, I thank you. I don't think my back could have taken more nights crouching over the rows.</p>
<p><strong>Seller 3:</strong> <em>(translated from Punjabi)</em> Seeds! Better than any seeds you've seen before. So many sacks! Many sacks! All of your choices for the next season, here!</p>
<p><em>[Singh holds up a hand, then gestures for the group to come near him as he moves to the side. Pulling them away from the seed seller, he speaks in a low whisper.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> That is the markings of the seeds we know. You will let Arora and I speak, and us alone. Please stay behind us.</p>
<p><em>[Arora enthusiastically nods, before looking back to Singh. Singh nods, and Arora approaches Wyle and Santos. He pulls them to the side to act as if they are looking at the seller's produce, while they converse in English.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> It's fine if we talk this close?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Should be. There's not many English speakers here! We should just look like a tour guide and his little group, a sad group, but a group.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Can we focus, please?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> So, these seeds. None of us recognize the company. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> I mean, yeah. They're a normal fruit company back in the States, like Bold, Sunny-Dayz, that kind of thing. Make good fruit cups since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> And <em>importantly,</em> boss, they haven't been marked for doing anything particularly noteworthy or Veil-breaking. At least, not since we've been around.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Hm. We have our own producers, own companies. Odd that the Americans are trying to get in on it. We'd say it's fine that they're here, but reports are enough that people seem to be worried. Mostly the small farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> I mean, it makes sense to me. They're big. At a big enough scale, I'd assume it adds up.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Wyle <em>sahib,</em> look at them. There is no scale here. Everyone knows each other, and everyone gets their seeds from each other, and grow their few crops.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> And, like, that makes sense. It's a new market, duh. We're here too, because it's new to us too. No?</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> She's right. I don't understand a bit of this. What have you all even <em>found?</em> At least, what have you found to warrant us coming out here? Not that I mind that, mind you. She might.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Nothing more than the equivalent of some wisps of smoke from a dying fire. Maybe the slightest scrap of a psychic signature. It's sneaky, too bloody sneaky.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> It's how it works. You have the big fish, and the littler fish.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> No, no it isn't! There's <em>so many</em> of these sellers, so many little relationships and friendships and differing preferences of who you buy from that it does not matter. The wealth is so spread out. There <em>are</em> no big fish.</p>
<p><em>[Arora coughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> They try. All they do is try.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Your first brush with a megacorp? I mean, <em>sorry</em>…?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> No need to be, it's not like it's <em>your</em> fault or anything. Just, crops didn't use to be this big. This… strange.</p>
<p><em>[He picks up a mango from a nearby blanket, handles it, and gives it a sniff. At the same time, Singh returns.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Find one you like?</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> No. All unripe. Big, the size of a ripe one, but unripe.</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> Hm. It is season.</p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> I know. It's… gross, really. I can barely eat them. These new seeds have been disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> If you’re done, I have information. Not a lot, but some. Simply a name or two.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> And d’you think that’s enough?</p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> It will have to be. We can perform a minor divination, then notify you of our results.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Nothing about <em>why?</em></p>
<p><em>[Singh shakes his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Singh:</strong> I understand you may expect something different. We of the House apologize.</p>
<p><em>[Arora squeezes the mango, still in his hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> Look around you.</p>
<p><em>[He gestures widely.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Arora:</strong> What could you hope to make from this? A few rupees?</p>

We have a name, a low-level employee, but a name nonetheless. We are told that he has come by in a truck, offered seeds to some local villages. If you'll permit us, we can attempt to locate him. It may take some time. To confirm, Méndez is the correct corporation?
<p>In that case, we have a headquarters location; oddly close to Jalandhar's Depths. You will find it attached.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9680.2 - February 1973</strong></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>The majority of those affected by SCP-9680 are currently stuck in debt to Méndez India. Loans that have been made to pay this debt are frequently predatory, and Foundation and GoI-1469 resources are currently addressing lenders responsible.</p>
<p>Following the above events, Santos and Wyle were dispatched to the Méndez India corporate headquarters, located in a small office building in Jalandhar, 2.5 km from a major entrance of Jalandhar's Depths. Upon entry, they were met by Méndez front desk personnel.</p>
<div class="jotting">
<p><em>[Body cam footage begins with Santos and Wyle entering the front doors. The office resembles a well-lit corporate office, with a desk and a small waiting room. There is no receptionist. It is entirely quiet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> So, uh. Nobody here, or…?</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Just be sure to have your weapons ready. Just in case, y’know. I know we're here for more of a corp negotation, but wouldn't hurt to have some decent trigger fingers right now.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Heard.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Hello? Anybody home?</p>
<p><em>[A few seconds pass. No one responds.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Well, okay. The water cooler's half empty, so there were at least <em>some</em> people here at <em>some</em> point.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I’ve seen weirder, so no assumptions Santos.</p>
<p><em>[There is a loud noise, like water through a pipe. Santos and Wyle turn to the source of the sound, a closed door behind the desk. Wyle gives Santos a nod. Both draw their weapons, standard anti-thaumaturgy sidearms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> <em>Hello?</em> Anyone there? Come out with your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Can we just <em>get this over with,</em> please?</p>
<p><em>[A man stumbles out of the room, hands up. He looks at the two nervously, before putting his hands behind his head. Wyle and Santos point their weapons at him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Hey! Hey! Don't shoot! I work here! I didn't do anything! I work here!</p>
<p><em>[Wyle makes a quick glance at Santos. Santos switches on her sidearm's thaumaturgical radar.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Your name?</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Williams! Bennett Williams! I work for Méndez. We're just getting started, we've barely moved in, it's just me here at the office for now.</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Damn, <em>really?</em> Okay, Bennett. What do you do here?</p>
<p><em>[Williams looks to Wyle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> I coordinate, or at least, am supposed to be <em>one of</em> the people coordinating fulfillment and distribution of our orders! But like I said, it's just me! I started like two weeks ago and they've been <em>promising</em> me it'll be more than just me, but I also handle HR, and I haven't been asked to onboard anyone! They don't even respond to my calls! I don't wanna be here.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Do you have any weapons on you, Williams?</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Weapons!? We just do our work here. Normal, non-criminal work. What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Come around the desk. Slowly, please, keeping your hands up.</p>
<p><em>[Williams does so. Wyle gestures to Santos, who pats him down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> Clean.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Okay. Sit down. Let's talk.</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Okay. What do you wanna know?</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> About your bosses, immediate or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> I dunno 'em. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> How the fuck did you get <em>hired</em>, then?</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> I was studying in Harvard, actually. Well, just graduating. Got offered a job with Méndez, which I never would have taken otherwise. I mean, who gives a shit about <em>agro</em> economics? But! I am never going to pass up all-expenses paid travel. Especially to India! All my classmates talked about how much being here changed them, taught them, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Santos:</strong> But you… live here now? This isn't a temp thing?</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Duh. Didn't pay for that either. Even get a cleaner to come through my place every so often, which is cray! It's just an apartment, nothing like what you'd expect for that kind of service, but still. Yay.</p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> Do you know <em>anything</em> about them?</p>
<p><em>[Williams fidgets.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> I know, well, we're Méndez! The foremost producers of fruit, vegetables, and assorted tubers in the United States! But- but I know what you want, sorry. Still a little shaky from the whole "gun-pointed-at-my-temple" thing. I should have a business card somewhere, wait—</p>
<p><em>[Williams begins to get up. Wyle gestures for him to sit down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Wyle:</strong> I'll get it. Where?</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Rolodex there, top of the desk by the plant. Labeled "Central."</p>

<p><strong>Williams:</strong> <em>If</em> we last the season. Our numbers aren't the best right now. That's why we did this whole thing with these new varietals. Never heard of them, not that I'm all that familiar with plants in the first place, but it's supposed to be a test run here.

<p><strong>Addendum 9680.3 - March 1973</strong></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Following this, GoI-1469 members determined that the located Méndez employee had no knowledge or understanding of the nature of SCP-9680 after psychic evaluation. Other located employees had similar informational gaps.</p>
<p>At this time, the majority of those affected by SCP-9680 refused Foundation assistance in paying back loans, citing distrust of government entities following Indian pushes to change crop rotations to further industrialization.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Given the nature of Méndez's operations, the potential of risk to civilians, and apparent nonanomalous operations, GoI-1469 contacts in the Indian government made inquiries to Méndez India's executives based on the contact information found on the card retrieved.</p>

<hr/>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I am MP Kalyan Singh, member of India's Parliament, covering the legislative area of Greater Jalandhar in which your company currently is registered. As a result, your practices are my purview and concern. As you may know, our district is an agricultural one. Approximately 55% of my constituents rely on farming for their livelihoods, and approximately two-thirds of that rely solely on that source of income.</p>
<p>We have been at risk of significant damage to this sector before, and it came at great cost to farmers and their family, and I urge you to please reconsider.</p>
<p>On that note, I am writing to request further information on the nature of the crops you are currently selling. Producers of seeds are concerned by unfair market practices by your company, and with the quality of the seeds themselves; these are varieties entirely unfamiliar to them, and to me as well. India, and Punjab especially, has had difficult encounters with invasive species before, and we are fearful these may prove to be a similar problem.</p>
<p>A formal request has been lodged at the last session to receive samples of your product for testing, and for a hearing. You will be called for a hearing, as will any other relevant members of your company. Expect formal papers in a few weeks at the latest.</p>
<p>We here welcome a stronger market, but not at the cost of our farmers. Tread lightly.</p>

Mr. Eves wanted me to tell you that the genetic code of our varieties is proprietary under Indian law, as well as in every other major world power's courts of law. As such, reverse-engineering, sequencing, or releasing samples will be impossible, and illegal under the law you uphold.</p>
<p>He also wanted me to let you know that no member of Méndez's C-Suite will be available for hearings. Schedules are packed, and cannot be moved at this moment. Additionally, you will find that request likely will not go anywhere, and he encourages you to spend your time on more fruitful endeavors.</p>
<p>Lastly, he wanted me to recommend you look at your portfolio. You may find a number of new stock options available to you. Ticker is MNDZ.</p>

<p>After this, no response was received from Méndez executives in spite of repeated requests by MP Singh, Foundation personnel, and GoI-1469 contacts. Forced summoning of Mr. Eves or other Méndez executives was suggested, but struck down after deliberation due to risk of potential Veil breach. Concern was especially raised due to lack of knowledge of thaumaturgic capabilities employed by Méndez rendering traditional amnestics useless.</p>

<p>Our investigation of the trucks remains pointless. Just more cogs. More useless seeds that show traces of little more than dog piss and wisps of trace magic. We have taken the liberty to psychically wither what we can and save a few samples, but no more than the bare minimum.</p>

<p>Lead Operative Wyle's statement was made prior to confirmation with Site personnel. Upon checks of test growths of SCP-9680, it was confirmed that nearly all specimens exhibited infection with an unknown fungal pathogen, different to each species.

<p>TARN TARAN - A plague of recent farmer suicides continue, with twenty suicides overnight reported from three villages in Tarn Taran District. All victims are farmers, causing villagers to worry that crops may go unharvested due to the sudden loss of manpower. Most were above the age of 50. Family of a number of the deceased raised concerns regarding long hours, exhaustion, and overwork.<br/>

<div style="opacity: .66">Some also mention potential crop failures, and the News can confirm all had purchased seeds from Méndez India, a branch of the well-known American farming corporation. Méndez India has recently been in the public eye for strong-arm tactics in local agriculture markets. For the victims of these tragedies, authorities have made all crematoriums and burial services fee-free. Local MPs and PM Kumar have expressed sympathies for the deceased. Obituaries that the News has received can be found on the following pages.</div>

<p>Below is the proposed description for SCP-9680-EX.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9680-EX is the designation for over 45 varieties<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> of nonanomalous, genetically modified seeds produced by the Méndez Corporation. These seeds were and are produced anomalously to increase the scale of production, but otherwise carry no anomalous effects.</p>
<p>SCP-9680-EX specimens have been prone to unique combinations of nearly 70 threats, including pathogens, pests, and intolerance to Indian climates.</p>
<p>Farmers planting SCP-9680-EX report the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9680-EX purchasing requiring the selling of heirloom seed storage, resulting in near-total depletion of seed stock</li>
<li>Disruption of seed production of mature specimens</li>
<li>Increased rates of disease, especially cancer, in those exposed to SCP-9680 fields due to increased pesticide usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-9680-EX production is so widespread across the Indian subcontinent that attempts to curtail production or spread prove too great of a risk to Veil integrity. Foundation and GoI-1496 efforts are focused on harm mitigation. In spite of this, <span style="color: blue"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India#Punjabi_Farmers'_Suicides_in_India" target="_blank">current trends continue.</a></span></p>
