<li>Access Key 1 is held by Site-18 Director Iovanius Neer, under permission of O5-11.</li>
<li>Access Key 2 is held by O5-11.</li>

<p><strong>R. Bartleman:</strong> Yeah. You need someone to drive the ship, and there's nobody else in the Foundation willing to test it.</p>
<p><strong>I. Neer:</strong> There are other options; we can - I don’t know - send AIC or something.</p>
<p><strong>R. Bartleman:</strong> Those things are worth more than I'll ever be, Ivy. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>I. Neer:</strong> This isn't the 80's anymore, Richard; the Foundation doesn't just throw bodies around for the sake of experimentation.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-7574 is the group designation for 4 anomalies: 2 created for the purposes of PROJECT STARLAUNCH (-1 and -2), and 2 which are the subject of said project (-3 and -4).</p>
<p>SCP-7574-1 is the DEXTER-MULVANEY Ontokinetic Displacement Engine, a Foundation-constructed device capable of displacing matter to another point within space and time.</p>
<p>After activation of SCP-7574-1, an input screen will indicate requiring a necessitated input of both a specific date (in YYYY format) and a distance away from SCP-7574-1, accompanied by a directional angle. After confirmation by both key-holders and any potential personnel involved, all matter on the launching pad will be instantaneously displaced.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of SCP-7574-1 sending matter outwards rather than receiving it, any usages of the device are to be considered one-way.</p>

<p><strong>R. Bartleman:</strong> One way, I know. I wouldn't start a farm if I was just going to be abandoning it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mulvaney:</strong> Ah. Positives, I guess. Still, most pilots started sweating a lot when I told them what this entailed. Trying to get away from the wife, eh?</p>

<p>SCP-7574-2 is a vestigial vehicle created for the use of SCP-7574-1 involving Foundation personnel, measuring 5m x 5m x 5m, with an outer hull composed of an anomalous silicon, telekill, and beryllium bronze alloy.</p>
<p>SCP-7574-2 is primarily solar-powered, and contains 3 electrical batteries which have been altered using power-enhancing products obtained from GOI-004, "The Factory", as a backup supply of power.</p>
<p>The vehicle also contains a miniature agricultural system which can sustainably feed a single pilot for a minimum of 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Due to durability and longevity, SCP-7574-2 was constructed based on original prototype designs for the purposes of usage with SCP-7574-1, in order to travel to SCP-7574-3.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>STAFF IN QUESTION:</strong> RICHARD "DICK" BARTLEMAN<br/>
<strong>EMPLOYED AS:</strong> MTF Free-Form Agent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and Foundation Pilot.<br/>
<strong>CURRENT LOCATION:</strong> Site-18</p>
<p><strong>REASONS FOR ASSESSMENT:</strong> Fitness for PROJECT STARLAUNCH.</p>
<p><strong>PAST CONCERNS:</strong> Past struggles with survivor’s guilt as a result of field work, and small bouts of depression. A large period of mourning and depression due to the suicide of spouse Dr. Katherine Bartleman (2 years ago), the disappearance of close friend Anton Radu (3 years ago), and the death of father Marcus Bartleman (4 years ago).</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> Richard Bartleman has, throughout his 32-year career working for the Foundation, consistently shown to be adaptable, efficient, and highly capable in the assignments he is given. This performance was, in the past few years, hindered by a series of losses which then impacted his personality and mood severely. These effects were especially clear after the suicide of his wife of 20 years, Katherine Bartleman, the cause of which is unknown but presumed to be of non-anomalous reasons.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Richard Bartleman, Age 53.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, the last 6 months have shown Richard being able to return to his work and continue to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation. The Site-18 Therapy Division reports that their sessions with Richard ceased as of 7 months ago, by the agent's own decision, indicating a return of mental well-being for Richard. Given the extenuated timeframe since the death of his spouse, the Site-18 Human Resources Department is of the belief that Richard Bartleman has, in simplified terms, been able to "move on".</p>
<p>Currently, there are no reasons going against Richard's involvement in PROJECT STARLAUNCH both mentally or, more importantly, physically. His personnel fitness score has thus been updated to indicate such.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONNEL FITNESS SCORE:</strong> 88 / 100, qualifying past the necessary number of 70.</p>
<p><strong>MENTAL STABILITY TEST SCORE:</strong> 44 / 50, qualifying past the necessary number of 40.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Based on assessment score, and a lack of similarly qualified personnel, Richard Bartleman has been deemed fit for usage within PROJECT STARLAUNCH.</p>

<p>SCP-7574-3 is a celestial body of primarily pink coloration, located 1.025 million lightyears away from Earth. Observation using both standard and anomalously altered astronomical tools indicates SCP-7574-3 may have the potential for supporting human life, possessing a subtle thaumaturgically distinct signature indicating a connection with life itself, as well as a perceivably powerful ability to amplify all frequencies of visible light.</p>
<p>In order to test the capabilities of SCP-7574-3 to support humanity in preparation for possible XK End-of-the-World Scenarios, PROJECT STARLAUNCH was created. SCP-7574-1 was constructed with the purpose of displacing SCP-7574-2, manned, to a point within approximately 100 kilometers of SCP-7574-3.</p>

<p><strong>Countdown.AIC:</strong> <tt>6…</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mulvaney:</strong> The date for the launch, it's fucking scrambling. Half the system is scrambling-</p>

<p><em>In an instant, all matter located on the SCP-7574-1 platform vanishes. SCP-7574-1 shuts down as all personnel in the command hub look on with fear and awe. The final number on the date input screen is 0000.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mulvaney:</strong> It… it defaulted.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
After the events of Launch Alpha, it is believed that Richard Bartleman and SCP-7574-2 were displaced to the appropriate distance point but at a time point ~13.7 billion years in the past, or approximately the year identified as 0. As a result, both SCP-7574-2 and its pilot are considered lost.

<p>SCP-7574-4 designates a series of anomalous radio frequencies which have been recorded since their original discovery in 1903 by the Foundation. While the nature of SCP-7574-4 has not been understood by the Foundation for a majority of the organization’s lifespan, the recent failure of Launch Alpha has provided possible context for the frequencies and potential messages received; as such, a collection of notable instances have been collected here.<br/>

This pink light, it's just… it's like you, I think. I don't know. In a terrifying way. In a horrible way. Why couldn't you have stopped me? Why- why did you have to go? Why, you fucking perfect idiot, why?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I'm sorry. For yelling like that. You don't deserve it. You didn't deserve any of what happened to you. That's obvious. Why am I even talking?</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Sometimes, in the strangest way, I can hear your voice out here. In the- the pink dust, it calls out to me. Speaking, in a strange way, just like you did. Just like everyone who went missing did. A slurry of sounds and feelings, all just… around me. Always.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to keep listening.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I always wondered, in the back of my tactically-trained brain, why we do what we do. I mean, protect humanity, yeah, but… I don't know. If the Foundation was here, they'd probably find a way to hang a curtain over my window and stop me from seeing this light. Cover my ears, stop me from hearing the voices. Cut out my brain, stop me from thinking these thoughts. Then again, they threw me all the way out here. I don't know how much they'd care out here.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I think the ship stopped moving a long, long time ago. I don't even know how long I've been alive anymore. I don't know how much more I want to be alive, but the light keeps me going. It keeps teaching me that it's going to be okay. I'm glad you're here with me, Katherine. You're glowing just like you did before.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>It's clumping up around the ship. We aren't moving anymore. I can barely see outside, with the age of my eyes now, but I can still hear you all. Telling me stories about a better world, a world of thoughts and wonder and a world where you never would have had to end it all like that. I'm just five steps away from that world. Just five short steps and I'll be there.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>It's going to be okay, Katherine. The light completes me, just like you once did, and just like you will when I join you. The sky is parting for me, kitkat. I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be fine. It's all going to be fine.</p>
