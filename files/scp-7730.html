<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation members are to avoid direct verbal communication with known patients of SCP-7730 whenever possible. Embedded agents within civilian hospitals are to be tasked with identifying patients of SCP-7730. All such patients are to be diagnosed with a non-anomalous autoimmune disease, and kept on observation. As the spread of SCP-7730 among the civilian population is difficult to track, full containment of SCP-7730 is impossible. However, as the rate of infection is low, simulations show SCP-7730 is not expected to spread beyond <span style="background-color: black">⸺⸺⸺-</span> total infectees.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7730 is a contagious autoimmune disease spread via an anomalous memetic vector. It is estimated that there are currently approximately 350,000 active infection cases of SCP-7730, the majority of them being civilian. Immune systems affected by SCP-7730 will start attacking various different tissues of the host, with a preference towards specific types of tissue differing from patient to patient. The symptoms of SCP-7730 occur in three major stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Patient is initially infected by SCP-7730, and the patient's immune system is modified to start slowly attacking specific tissues of the host body. At this stage, the symptoms of SCP-7730 may resemble that of various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes or certain types of arthritis.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> After 1 to 3 years on average, the rate at which the patient's tissues deteriorate drastically increases, and the immune system begins to target a wider variety of tissues. Along with this, the patient's tissues also begin regenerating at a much faster rate, keeping the patient alive in a state of elevated pain. This stage lasts for 3 to 7 years.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> The rate at which the patient's tissues regenerate starts to slow down, causing the immune system to slowly destroy the patient's body, resulting in death.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no known case of a patient of SCP-7730 surviving longer than 11 years after the point of infection.</p>
<p>SCP-7730 spreads by mildly altering the voice of the patient to contain auditory memetic information that acts as a vector. The specific ways in which this alteration happens is currently unknown, and altered voices are indistinguishable from baseline vocal variations across the population. When a human is exposed to a sufficiently large amount of this altered voice,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> their nervous system will reconfigure itself to contain the memetic component of SCP-7730, causing them to be infected.</p>
<p>Despite extensive research, there is no known cure for SCP-7730.</p>

<h5 id="toc1"><span>NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION</span></h5>
<hr/>
<p>Ignore the warning above. If you can see this document, I assume you've already been fully briefed about what happened to the SCP-7730 situation. The document you are about to read below is the truth about what SCP-7730 is, or rather, could have been.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands suffer and die from SCP-7730 every day, thinking it's some other, less lethal and non-contagious disease. We could have cured them, we <em>could</em> cure them, but sometimes, these difficult decisions have to be made for the greater good.</p>
<p>Remember, we secure, we contain, and we protect.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation members are to avoid direct verbal communication with known patients of SCP-7730 whenever possible. Foundation agents within civilian hospitals are to be tasked with identifying patients of SCP-7730. All such patients are to be relocated to Foundation-owned medical facilities, and treated with Procedure MT-7730-06.</p>
<p>At least one and no more than three D-class personnel are to be kept infected with SCP-7730 at any time for research purposes. Extensive care is to be taken to avoid SCP-7730 being spread to any research personnel involved.</p>
<p>As the infection rate of SCP-7730 is low, with the current containment procedures, it is estimated that SCP-7730 will be completely eradicated from the civilian population by July 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7730 is a contagious autoimmune disease spread via an anomalous memetic vector. There are currently 5,837 documented currently active infection cases of SCP-7730, the majority of them being civilian. Immune systems affected by SCP-7730 will start attacking various different tissues of the host, with a preference towards specific types of tissue differing from patient to patient. The symptoms of SCP-7730 occur in three major stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Patient is initially infected by SCP-7730, and the patient's immune system is modified to start slowly attacking specific tissues of the host body. At this stage, the symptoms of SCP-7730 may resemble that of various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes or certain types of arthritis.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> After 1 to 3 years on average, the rate at which the patient's tissues deteriorate drastically increases, and the immune system begins to target a wider variety of tissues. Along with this, the patient's tissues also begin regenerating at a much faster rate, keeping the patient alive in a state of elevated pain. This stage lasts for 3 to 7 years.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> The rate at which the patient's tissues regenerate starts to slow down, causing the immune system to slowly destroy the patient's body, resulting in death.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no known case of a patient of SCP-7730 that has not undergone Procedure MT-7730-06 surviving longer than 9 years after the point of infection.</p>
<p>SCP-7730 spreads by mildly altering the voice of the patient to contain auditory memetic information that acts as a vector. The specific ways in which this alteration happens is currently unknown, and altered voices are indistinguishable from baseline vocal variations across the population. When a human is exposed to a sufficiently large amount of this altered voice,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> their nervous system will reconfigure itself to contain the memetic component of SCP-7730, causing them to be infected.</p>
<p>After extensive research, a method to cure SCP-7730 has been developed, known as Procedure MT-7730-06. The procedure involves scanning the patient's neural activity, in order to generate packets of personalized memetic 'anti-information' that are delivered to the patient in parts over time, slowly counteracting the effects of SCP-7730. Despite being costly and labor-intensive, this method has been proven necessary in order to remove SCP-7730 entirely from the civilian population.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2005/10/09:</strong> Due to the recent acquisition of multiple high-risk SCP objects, the funding on SCP-7730 research and treatment has been reduced. Foundation medical facilities MS009, MS032, and MS040 are no longer capable of treating patients with Procedure MT-7730-06.</p>
<p>Civilian patients sent to the aforementioned medical facilities are now to be put on quarantine indefinitely, and treated with non-anomalous medical procedures. When the symptoms reach the second or third stage, the patients are to be treated with painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2006/03/03:</strong> Due to the large-scale reallocation of Foundation budget following the commencement of Project 009428-682, funding on SCP-7730 research and treatment has been halted indefinitely due to it being a low priority task. New containment procedures are being drafted accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2006/04/14:</strong> Due to increasing reports of low morale, especially among recently reassigned research personnel, the Ethics Committee has determined that it is necessary to classify certain information relating to several low-priority SCPs that are not being actively researched in order to help personnel focus on more important tasks at hand.</p>
<p>Following Ethics Committee Ruling 060412-037, all Foundation personnel previously assigned to SCP-7730 research and treatment have been amnesticized, and all information regarding Procedure MT-7730-06 has been classified above Level 4 clearance.</p>
