<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8431 is currently uncontained, but poses no danger to Foundation operations. SCP-8431-A is to be held in a standard anomalous item locker in Site-210, which is to be checked on a weekly basis for any new communication being relayed from SCP-8431.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8431 is a Golden Retriever possessing cybernetic enhancements with the capability to translate its thoughts into ASCII text data, which can then be transferred to SCP-8431-A through an unknown process. This is achieved through a program constructed in Python, though the copy obtained by Foundation agents seems to lack any anomalous aspects, and thus functionality. The enhancements are centred around SCP-8431's shoulders, and cause difficulty walking for extended periods of time. Messages from SCP-8431 do not exceed 256 characters, due to aforementioned technical limitations. Additionally, SCP-8431 is capable of entering the noosphere<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> as a physical location, though it is yet to be determined whether return to baseline reality is possible.</p>
<p>SCP-8431-A is a computer terminal with no visible identification, which receives all communication from SCP-8431. Subsequent to the receival of a message, a previously concealed compartment in the base of SCP-8431-A will open, revealing a USB port, which allows for the sending of messages to SCP-8431. It would appear there is a 24 hour delay between initial message sending and receiving. The object was originally obtained via a raid on the Chaos Insurgency.</p>

<p>Subsequent to these messages, partially intact schematics for SCP-8431's cybernetic components were recovered from the original site of SCP-8431-A's discovery, along with a preserved section of fur belonging to a Golden Retriever, which is believed to originate from SCP-8431. Dr South was made aware of this following a brief inquiry.</p>

<p>| USER-RECEIVER<br/>
Understood. May, according to information we have received, you are located in the noosphere, which is not a physical location. How has this been achieved?</p>
<p>| USER-CANINE-10<br/>
It took them several attempts. There were nine dogs before me. I was the success. They kept stabbing and cutting at me, and then I fell asleep. When I woke up, there was a weight on my shoulders. I think that's why I'm here.</p>
<p>| USER-RECEIVER<br/>
Thank you, May. Do you know where you are within the noosphere?</p>
<p>| USER-CANINE-10<br/>

<p>| USER-CANINE-10<br/>
Why, South, can I sense curiosity here? And a willingness to experience? Do humans truly wish to die?</p>

I do not know.</p>

<p>Dear Site Director Oginatri,</p>
<p>I hope this email finds you in good health and conscience. I have sent this message in an attempt to reconcile my current emotions, which are primarily constituted by pity, for SCP-8431. Kindly, I would ask you to consult the Ethics Committee over this matter, as I do not believe the conditions endured by SCP-8431 to be morally justifiable.

It's warm. Reminds me of when we used to play, at the park. And you would throw the ball, and I would run as fast as I could, to catch it, so you didn't lose it, and so you could keep it and so that you could be proud of me, and throw it again, as I did so<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Junior Researcher Shelian was later reprimanded for using SCP-8431's formal designation, an act which could decrease cooperation by the anomaly.</p>

<p>It is undetermined whether SCP-8431 believed the last message in the above log. However, SCP-8431 remained in communication with Junior Shelian. From this point onward, journeys made by SCP-8431 begin to increase in duration, likely due to issues in health and mobility.</p>

<p>Prior to this log, a council was held by the respective Heads of Departments at Site-210, concerning a proposed increase in security measures to avoid intrusion into the SCP-8431 project. However, due to SCP-8431's irreparable decline in health, it was agreed to maintain security at the current level.</p>
