</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1833</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1833 is to be contained in a standard containment locker, located in <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-77" target="_blank" target="_blank">Site-77</a>'s Safe SCP wing. No personnel other than Class-D personnel are authorized to handle SCP-1833.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1833 is a copy of the 1976 edition ███████ High School yearbook. Its appearance is consistent with other copies of the book, and appears to have normal wear for an object of its age. The yearbook is entitled "<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/remembrance" target="_blank" target="_blank">Reflections of '76</a>". It is hardcover, and contains exactly fifty pages. The book is divided into five sections: a collection of student photographs, photographs from around the school year, club photos, photos from athletic events, and an autograph section.</p>
<p>When SCP-1833 is read by any person who has graduated from high school, the object's anomalous effect will initiate. The individual (hereafter referred to as "the subject") who reads SCP-1833 will perceive it as their own high school yearbook, containing messages left by persons with whom they associated socially during their high school years. Initially, these photographs and messages will be positive, with encouraging comments written in the book's margins, often mentioning events which invoke positive feelings in the subject.</p>
<p>However, after approximately 10 pages are read, the messages will begin to become more negative in tone. Initially, they will recount events that occurred during high school for which the subject feels embarrassment or remorse. They will then begin to mention events from the subject's life that occurred after completing high school, and will make personal attacks on the subject. In addition, the photographs depicted in the book will become more negative, with the persons depicted in the photographs often appearing to be heavily deformed.</p>
<p>After an indeterminate number of pages have been read, ranging from 20-30 pages, photographs of the subject will begin to appear in the book. Initially, these photographs will depict embarrassing events that occurred during the subject's time in high school. However, as the subject progresses through the book, the photos will become more disturbing, with photographs of the subject committing crimes, being mutilated, and being harmed by other persons depicted in SCP-1833 being the most commonly reported images.</p>
