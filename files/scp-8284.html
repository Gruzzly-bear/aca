<p>The hallway that makes up SCP-8284.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8284</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8284 is contained in a former hotel in ████████, ███████████, United States. A metal door has been installed in the hallway leading to SCP-8284, which requires authorization from both the Temporal Anomaly Supervisor and the on-site Research Director to be opened.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Guards are to be stationed in front of the door at all times to prevent unauthorized access. Additional guards are to be stationed at major entrances to the hotel, but only on the inside to avoid attracting attention to the area.</p>
<p>Due to the potential for temporal alterations, documentation pertaining to SCP-8284 shall be automatically archived in an exclusionary database located on-site. This exclusionary equivalent shall be compared to the non-exclusionary version at a minimum of once every twenty-four hours. Any discrepancies or other evidence of a CK-Class restructuring event shall be reported to the on-site Research Director and Temporal Anomaly Supervisor.</p>
<p>As of 5/18/2025, further testing is permanently suspended <strong>[See Incident Report 5/16/2025]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8284 is a hallway in which all doors inside lead to their expected geographical location, but in different years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Room 101 leads to 2015</li>
<li>Room 102 leads to 2005</li>
<li>Room 103 leads to 1995</li>
<li>Room 104 leads to 1985</li>
<li>Room 105 leads to 1975</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-8284's anomalous effect does not extend to further rooms within the 100s, but repeats in rooms 106-130, leading to the same previously stated years. Attempting to exit the rooms through the window will result in subjects exiting the building in the corresponding year.</p>
<p>Entering the rooms through the windows or breaching from above in the present leads to the non-anomalous interior of the space.</p>
<p>The anomalous property of the hallway is not present in any of the years that can be traveled to. While unconfirmed, this has led to speculation that the anomalous property of the hotel appeared sometime between 2015 and the present year. Research into the history of the location prior to containment has found the location opened in 1970, leading to the theory that the anomaly is not capable of sending individuals to any point before its construction.</p>
<p>Each day that passes in the current year passes in the rooms leading to the past. As such, the rooms have been classified as “Non-Static Temporal Gateways”.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The anomalous property of the location was discovered by Foundation Field Agent Philip Martinez, who was staying at the hotel between assignments. Agent Martinez was staying in room 101 and discovered that his TV would only play news and television programs from 2015. Further investigation by the Agent found that the view from the room's window did not match the modern surroundings, including the absence of buildings constructed post-2015. The agent alerted Foundation command, and a larger investigation revealed the anomalous property of the location. During testing, it was found that anomalous rooms in the present are non-anomalous in the past. This was tested by agents exiting through the window and re-entering through the building's front entrance.</p>

<p><strong>Archived Experiment Logs:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DATE: 5/13/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Destination Year: 2015</strong><br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong><br/>
Three researchers, including Research Director Richards and one guard, were inside room 101. Researchers Devans and Jr. Researcher Bard would perform the experiment, while Research Director Richards supervised. The experiment would involve the planting of a small tree roughly thirty feet away from the window. At the same time, a camera and Jr. Researcher Owens would be positioned outside, in the present recording, at the same spot. Researchers Devans and Jr. Researcher Bard accomplished this without issue.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong><br/>
Video documentation shows the tree always being present. Jr. Researcher Owens expressed confusion over being told to film a “regular tree”.<br/>
<strong>Personal Notes of Research Director Richards:</strong><br/>
“It appears that this is a very standard case of time rewriting itself. By planting the tree in the past, it was always there in the present. People who witness the anomaly are not immune to the time-rewriting effects, while people who are inside the anomaly are. We should run a few more experiments. This could be it. I might be able to use this to make up for everything. To be there for him.” - Research Director Richards</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DATE: 5/14/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Destination Year: 2005</strong><br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong><br/>
Three researchers, including Research Director Richards and one guard, were inside room 102. Researcher Houlden and Jr. Researcher Owens were tasked with planting several flowers in the shape of a triangle in a clear area. Jr. Researcher Bard was tasked with standing outside and filming the location in the present day. This was done to test whether having been previously inside the anomaly made individuals immune to the memory alteration effects of time revision.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong><br/>
Video Documentation of the experiment shows the flowers always being present. Jr. Researcher Bard expressed confusion over the choice to test by planting flowers in a spot that already had them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DATE: 5/15/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Destination Years: 2015, 2005, 1995</strong><br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong><br/>
This experiment would involve three active moving parts. Researcher Devans would plant a tree in 1995. Researcher Houlden would interact with that same tree in 2005. Jr. Researchers Bard and Owens would interact with the same tree in 2015. First, Researcher Devans would plant the tree. Then, in 2015, Jr. Researchers Bard and Owens would grab two predetermined branches on the tree. While they are grabbing them and recording the experiment, Researcher Houlden would cut those branches in the past.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong><br/>
Video Documentation of the experiment shows the two junior researchers grabbing branches that were not the ones originally selected. Both claimed to recall those being the branches selected for the experiment, despite other participants who were in previous years recalling otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Investigation into Document Discrepancies:</strong><br/>
On May 17th, 2025, an investigation was launched due to significant discrepancies between the non-exclusionary files for SCP-8284 and its exclusionary archive, including numerous experiments, notes, and security footage files relating to a “Robert Richards”. Foundation records indicate that the individual named “Robert Richards” has never been an employee at the Foundation or any affiliated front business. The archived documentation listed this “Robert Richards” as the research director for the object.</p>
<p>Following the discovery of the aforementioned footage, an investigation into unsolved crimes in [REDACTED] circa 2015 occurred. A news report, which is believed to be about the former director's actions, has been transcribed in the attached file.</p>
<p>The investigation into unsolved crimes in the area identified twenty-nine year old [REDACTED] resident, Marcus Halloway, from the acquired news report. Mr. Halloway was brought in for an interrogation, through which "Robert Richards" was successfully located and brought in for further questioning. While disproven by testing, there was concern that Mr. Richards somehow retained knowledge of the Foundation or his employment. Both of these interviews are included in the attached files.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCIDENT REPORT 5/16/2025:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> Due to the CK-Class Restructuring event caused by this incident, several details have been lost. This report is composed of the security footage that was archived in the exclusionary database before the restructuring event occurred. As a result, individuals involved in this incident do not have any memory of it and, as such, could not provide testimony regarding it.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> On May 16th, 2025, at 10 AM, Research Director Robert Richards is seen entering the facility security office. Footage from inside the office shows him connecting his Foundation-issued laptop to the server for several minutes while making conversation with Security Chief Eugene Mitchell. The conversation pertains to upcoming testing and current security measures for the area. Towards the end of the conversation, Director Richards requests to borrow a handgun for use in an impromptu experiment. Chief Mitchell rejects the request, and Director Richards pulls out a photo from his pocket, causing the Chief to pass out in his chair.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> The Director is seen taking the Beretta 92 from Chief Mitchell's person and putting it inside the inner pocket of his lab coat before vacating the area. After this footage shows the Director going to the containment area for SCP-8284 and using his credentials to enter it. He tells the two guards he will be prepping a room for an upcoming experiment. Inside the hallway, he enters room 101, leading to 2015.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RECOVERED NEWS TRANSCRIPT FROM 5/23/2015</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN FOOTAGE]</strong></p>
<p>“We begin tonight with an update on last week's shooting.”</p>
<p>“In the last hour, new security footage of the event was made public. This footage was taken by a camera from the nearby supermarket. Due to its position, it did not capture the events inside the alley itself.”</p>
<p><em>Footage shows a man in a grey hoodie and jeans walking towards an alley.</em></p>
<p>“In the minutes before the shooting, an individual identified as local teenager Marcus Halloway entered the alley. According to Mr. Halloway, he entered the alley as a shortcut to access a walking trail behind the supermarket, but was accosted by two individuals identified as victims Evan Manson and Jacob Monroe.”</p>
<p>“A minute later, an individual entered the alley and opened fire on Mr. Manson and Mr. Monroe. The individual in the white lab coat has yet to be identified. The emblem emblazoned on his back is believed by investigators to be gang-related.”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>

<p>“Mr. Halloway was the only survivor of the shooting, having run out just as the shooting began. Police speculate the shooting was a gang hit. Unfortunately, none of the security footage seems to show the shooter exiting the alley. His current whereabouts are still unknown.”</p>
<p>“Authorities are again asking for anyone who has potential details on the shooter to come forward.”</p>

<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Please state your name and age for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> I’m Marcus Halloway. I’m currently twenty-nine years old.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Good. I can understand that this may be a bit of a stressful situation for you, Mr. Halloway. I want to assure you that you are not in trouble. You have not done anything wrong. We just have a few questions for you, and answering them truthfully will get this over with quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> Ok.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> First, does the date May 16th, 2015 hold any significance to you?</p>
<p><em>Subject becomes visibly stressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> I swear. I swear it wasn’t me. I had nothing to do with shooting those guys, it was that weird dude in the lab coat.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Mr. Halloway, please calm down. I am not accusing you of killing anyone. I just need to know what happened that day.</p>
<p><em>Subject appears to take multiple deep breaths in an effort to calm down. Despite this, the subject remains visibly uncomfortable for the remainder of the interview.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Mr. Halloway, what happened in that alley is of the utmost importance to us. Please explain what you saw.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> Ok. At the time, I was struggling with substance abuse issues. I arranged to meet with some dealers in the alley. Tried stiffing them, and they pulled their guns on me. Thought I was a goner, but just as they started shooting, the guy in the lab coat shoved me out of the way and took the bullet before beginning to shoot at them.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> What can you recall about the man?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> Not much. I did run into him earlier in the day, though.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> What can you recall about your first encounter with the man?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> He came up to me crying. He rambled about how he was sorry, how he failed me, and how I was gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> What else?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> I don’t remember much else. I ran away from him.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Thats fine. Let's go back to the alley. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> I don’t know. After the shooting began, I ran away.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> If you don’t mind me asking, how did this incident affect you?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> I can’t even begin to describe how this affected me, but whoever that was… they gave me a second chance.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> So you would say that individual's actions changed you for the better?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> Yes. It caused me to rethink what I was doing and start getting help for my problems.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> This may be a bit of a strange question, but does the name Robert Richards mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Halloway:</strong> Yeah. He was a good friend of mine in elementary school and middle school. We sort of drifted apart in high school, though. I can’t remember the last time we spoke. Why do you ask about him?</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Thank you Mr. Halloway. I believe that is all we need. I appreciate your cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Moving on, does the date May 16th, 2015 hold any significance to you?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Richards:</strong> No. Not really. I think I was at college or something during that time. Probably finals week or something.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> Good. Now, does the name Marcus Halloway mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Richards:</strong> Jesus. That is a name I haven't heard in forever.</p>
<p><strong>Director Devans:</strong> You recognize the name?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FINAL STATEMENT BY DIRECTOR DEVANS:</strong></p>
<p>“What Director Richards did was extremely irresponsible. We are fortunate that his actions did not cause permanent damage to the timeline. His actions should have caused a grandfather paradox, but there is no evidence of major temporal disruptions as typically seen from such events. The Temporal Anomalies Department launched an investigation into the potential of the continued existence of the original Director Richards, but so far has found no evidence of him ever leaving that alley. The current theory is that Director Richards was erased due to history rewriting itself and preventing his existence. While history rewrote itself, it made corrections to account for Director Richards' absence. This may be a result of SCP-8284 itself. There still may be more to understand about this anomaly.” - Research Director Michael Devans</p>
