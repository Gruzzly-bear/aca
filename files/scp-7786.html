<h4 id="toc0"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Containment Procedures:</span></span></h4>
<p>Civic awareness of the Hexennacht event is to remain limited to local folklore, with dissemination primarily framed through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust">literary references</a>, presenting it as an urban legend. Civilians who encounter an instance of SCP-7786-A are to be administered Class-A or Class-B amnestics, as appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
<p>The Foundation will coordinate with the German government to establish a restricted zone with a two-kilometer radius around Brocken Mountain, designated Area-122. This containment measure will remain in effect throughout the month of April, prohibiting all civilian access to the mountain during this time. Mobile Task Force Omicron-50, along with all armed security personnel stationed in the area, are authorized and required to neutralize any instances of SCP-7786-A encountered within the exclusion zone.</p>
<p>Due to the predatory nature of SCP-7786-A, Foundation staff operating near the mountain are required to travel in teams of no fewer than two personnel.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc1"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></span></h4>
<p>SCP-7786 is an extradimensional space located near Brocken mountain near Schierke in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The entryway to SCP-7786, designated as "Entry Point Alpha," is positioned along the southern path that leads to the mountaintop.</p>
<div class="image-hover-enlarge scp-image-block block-right" data-feature="image-feature" style="max-width:180px;"><img alt="Map.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7786/Map.jpg"/><br/>
<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-7786 location, and Area-122 extension (Click to Enlarge).</div>
</div>
<p>Access to SCP-7786 is possible only through the performance of specific thaumaturgical rituals, each of which permits the participant(s) a single ingress and egress. (See Addendum-7786-02 for procedural details.)</p>
<p>The internal topography of SCP-7786 constitutes a detailed reconstruction of Brocken Mountain, replicating both its natural features and surrounding environment, including architectural structures present on the summit. The sky within SCP-7786 consistently manifests as a crimson hue, obscured by dense red mist. All structures exhibit significant degradation, including visible decay and erosion. [REDACTED] is situated at the central point of the mountaintop. Aside from SCP-7786-A and SCP-7786-B, SCP-7786 contains no observable fauna.</p>
<p>SCP-7786-A designates a group of hostile humanoid entities of indeterminate number. All known instances of SCP-7786-A display uniform physical characteristics: a height of approximately 2 m, reduced muscular mass, a cranium resembling that of <em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em> (domestic goat), and dense black fur covering the body. Lower extremities exhibit ungulate morphology, while upper extremities terminate in five-fingered hands morphologically similar to those of humans. Each instance possesses a pair of feathered wings with an approximate span of 3 m.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">An image taken from inside SCP-7786 (Click to Enlarge).</div>
</div>
<p>Instances of SCP-7786-A ordinarily remain confined within SCP-7786 for most of the year. During the month of April, however, activity extends beyond the anomaly, allowing ingress and egress. While outside SCP-7786, SCP-7786-A entities engage in solitary nocturnal predation, targeting mammals with a marked preference for isolated human subjects. Prey, hereafter referred to as the Target, is tracked over extended periods until optimal conditions for ambush are achieved. SCP-7786-A then executes an attack with the objective of disabling vital organs. Following incapacitation, the entity transports the remains of the Target into SCP-7786, where partial consumption occurs. Residual remains are stored within the SCP-7786 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for purposes currently unknown.</span></p>
<p>SCP-7786-A instances are susceptible to conventional weaponry and can be terminated through standard engagement protocols. Upon expiration, remains undergo rapid self-immolation via an unidentified mechanism, resulting in complete incineration within several seconds.</p>
<p>SCP-7786-B designates a population of human individuals, all phenotypically Caucasian females, with apparent ages ranging from 20 to 80 years. Genetic analysis of available samples indicates no anomalous deviations from baseline human physiology. Despite this, continued observation has confirmed that instances of SCP-7786-B demonstrate the capacity to perform thaumaturgical effects via incantations and ritual practices.</p>
<p>Unlike SCP-7786-A, which remain within SCP-7786 throughout the year, manifestations of SCP-7786-B occur exclusively during the Hexennacht event, spanning from 30 April to sunrise on 1 May. During this interval, SCP-7786-B congregate at the summit within SCP-7786 and engage in ceremonies believed to be associated with Sarkic traditions. Documented activities have included orgiastic rites<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, sacrificial practices, and the consumption of unidentified meat products, presumed to originate from victims of SCP-7786-A predation.</p>

<p>Artistic representation of the Hexennacht event dates back to 1829 AD</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hexennacht, translated as "Witches' Night," is a folkloric tradition primarily associated with German cultural history. The legend describes annual gatherings of witches on the night of 30 April at the summit of Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz mountain range. The purported purpose of these gatherings is celebratory in nature, marking the transition from winter to spring.</p>
<p>The earliest documented reference to Hexennacht dates to the 15th century, though parallels to similar phenomena can be traced to records as early as the 8th century. During this period, Brocken Mountain acquired notoriety for anomalous atmospheric and optical effects resulting from its elevation and climate conditions. The mountain was also associated with Saxon tribes who practiced pagan rituals, later interpreted as witchcraft by Christian missionaries. In 1589, a major witch trial resulted in 133 women being accused of attending a so-called "Witches’ Sabbath" on Brocken Mountain; all but four were executed by immolation.</p>
<p>The tradition of Hexennacht coincides with Walpurgisnacht, observed in several regions of Central and Northern Europe. Walpurgisnacht is a Christian festival commemorating Saint Walpurga, a Francia-based abbess venerated in Germany for her association with protection against disease and witchcraft.</p>
<p>Foundation archival research suggests that Saint Walpurga may have maintained ties with esoteric groups engaged in occult and astrological practices. Documentation remains fragmentary; however, it is theorized that these associations may not have been adversarial. Rather, these groups may have shared Walpurga’s objectives in suppressing or counteracting practitioners of black Magic.</p>
</div>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<p>The Foundation was first alerted to SCP-7786 following the receipt of a report from the Group of Interest <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/magierakademie-hub" target="_blank">Mages Academy</a> on 27 March 2002. Records indicate that the Academy had been monitoring SCP-7786 activity for an extended period but sought governmental cover, which the Foundation was capable of providing, given Brocken Mountain’s status as a well-known tourist destination. Neutralization was deemed unfeasible at the time.</p>
<p>As a condition of cooperation, the Academy required the Foundation to deliver regular updates concerning the containment status of SCP-7786. In exchange, the Academy agreed to provide relevant intelligence and resources to support containment efforts.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum-7786-02:</strong></p>
<p>To identify the entry point of SCP-7786, a subdermal tracking device was surgically implanted into a captured instance of SCP-7786-A, subsequently designated SCP-7786-A-012. The entity was released for observation, to monitor its return to SCP-7786.</p>
<p>Approximately two hours post-release, the device signal was lost in the vicinity of the eastern mountain pass at the base of Brocken. At the same time, local Hume levels registered a significant reduction, reaching 11.03% near the area. These findings support the working hypothesis that a multidimensional portal is located at the aforementioned site.</p>

<p>To access SCP-7786 it was suggested to use a Latin rite from a copy of "Passing Through Perspective 101" held by the Academy. Next is a copy of Document 12-C page 38 taken from the book.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Passing Through perspective 101, folder C-12.</strong></em></span></p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em><br/>
<em>Mirror dimensions are best thought of as reflections of our world, overlapping it like glass panes laid on top of one another. Where they intersect with our reality, they produce near-perfect replicas of the physical landscape. The differences are subtle at first, but the longer one remains inside, the more apparent the distortions become. These variations depend largely on the amount of energy sustaining the dimension.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Origins</strong></em><br/>
<em>Mirror dimensions may arise in two ways:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Naturally:</strong> Formed by disturbances in local energy fields, often resulting in warped environments where time, sound, or even gravity can behave unpredictably.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Artificially:</strong> Constructed by magicians who expend manna. Creating one usually requires multiple contributors, whether they realize they’re offering their energy or not.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>How to Enter</strong></em><br/>
<em>First, an entrance must be located. These often reveal themselves through strange reflections or surfaces that seem “too deep” to be ordinary. Once located, the following steps apply:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>1. Draw the Sigil</strong>.</em><br/>
<em>Carefully inscribe the designated symbol at the entrance (see Fig. C-12a). Precision matters—minor mistakes can derail the process.</em></p>
<img alt="Symbol.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7786/Symbol.jpg"/><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Fig. C-12a</strong></p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>2. Prepare the Path.</strong></em><br/>
<em>Lay a line of salt extending outward from the circle. Stand inside the circle with an unlit candle in hand. Recite aloud:</em><br/>
<em>“Viam tenebrarum ambulo duce lucis.”</em><br/>
<em>If the candle lights on its own, you’ve succeeded.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>3. Step Across</strong></em><br/>
<em>Walk the salt line to its end. If performed correctly, the transition into the mirror world will occur naturally.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>4. Exiting</strong></em><br/>
<em>To leave, simply retrace your steps along the same salt path in reverse until you return to your starting point.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>When Things Go Wrong</strong></em><br/>
<em>Failure is usually caused by one of three mistakes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The sigil was drawn incorrectly.</em></li>
<li><em>The Latin phrase was mispronounced.</em></li>
<li><em>You lack a soul. (If this is the case, no corrective measure is available.)</em></li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="font-size:90%;"><strong>38</strong></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To evaluate the efficacy of the ritual procedure, Test Subject D-9027 was instructed to perform the designated incantation sequence. The subject was equipped with a short-range communication device and a live-feed camera to assess the operability of electronic equipment within SCP-7786. Upon completion of the ritual, D-9027 successfully gained entry to SCP-7786. Equipment functionality was confirmed, as wireless transmissions remained uninterrupted.</p>
<p>During the subject’s subsequent request to exit SCP-7786, D-9027 was attacked by an instance of SCP-7786-A. The camera feed recorded the device falling to the ground adjacent to the subject, capturing footage of D-9027 supine and attempting to resist the entity. As D-9027 had not been issued any defensive equipment, the instance of SCP-7786-A succeeded in inflicting a fatal throat laceration, resulting in the subject’s termination.</p>
<p>The recording continued to document the entity dragging the remains of D-9027 outside of the camera’s visual range. The feed persisted for approximately seven hours before terminating due to battery depletion.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-7786-03:</strong></p>
<p>In April 2002, two Class-D deployment teams were assigned to install surveillance equipment within SCP-7786.</p>
<p>The first team, consisting of D-06457 and D-03456, entered SCP-7786 on 04/02/2002. Two of the seven designated cameras were successfully installed. During exfiltration, the team encountered two instances of SCP-7786-A. D-03456 was terminated during the engagement, and all contact with D-06457 was subsequently lost as he attempted to return to Entry Point Alpha.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The second team, composed of D-02333 and D-05852, completed the installation of the remaining surveillance cameras. Both subjects returned but sustained significant injuries during the operation. For detailed records, see Site-122 Archives, Exploration Logs, Section E-05, Document 7786-09766-D-002.</p>
<p>The internal environment of SCP-7786 is now under continuous surveillance for both research and containment purposes, with monitoring prioritized during the Hexennacht interval. The primary site of SCP-7786-A ceremonial activity has been identified at the summit of the mountain and is continuously observed by Camera C-4.</p>
<p>All deviations from established behavioral baselines of SCP-7786 entities are to be reported immediately to the Director of Research for evaluation.</p>

<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Containment Procedures:</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>The present research initiative, jointly undertaken by the SCP Foundation Department of Mythology and Folkloristics in cooperation with the Mages Academy, is directed toward the development of a reliable and replicable method for the neutralization or permanent containment of SCP-7786-Ω.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In the interim, Mobile Task Force Omicron-50 (codenamed “Mountain Monks”) has been specifically trained and deployed to enact Procedure Walpurga-301, a containment protocol designed to mitigate the risk of immediate breach until a more permanent solution can be finalized (see Addendum-7786-05 for procedural details). Members of Omicron-50 have undergone supplementary thaumaturgical conditioning and training under the oversight of the Academy.</p>
<p>Additionally, five Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) have been positioned in the vicinity of Brocken Mountain. These units remain inactive under standard conditions to avoid unnecessary destabilization of local reality. They are to be regarded strictly as emergency assets and are not to be activated unless a confirmed containment failure occurs. Routine maintenance, calibration, and stress testing of each SRA are conducted biweekly by on-site engineering staff to ensure operational readiness.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach, immediate notification of O5 Command is imperative. Upon confirmation, an XK-Class scenario and Level 5 containment breach are to be declared. The sequential activation of the SRAs encircling Brocken Mountain will be authorized at that stage, to serve as a last-resort measure intended to prevent an escalation beyond the mountain perimeter. Evacuation protocols for civilian settlements in the vicinity had been established under the cover of emergency weather advisories and geological hazard warnings. Local law enforcement and government officials are to be covertly briefed by Foundation liaisons to assist in the clearance of towns and villages within a 30 km radius of Brocken Mountain.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-7786-Ω is the designation given to a multi-dimensional demonic entity, contained by an unknown means within a cavity connected to a crater as its entrance is located at the center of the mountaintop within inside the SCP-7786 pocket dimension. The diameter of the crater that leads to the cavity is approximately 20 meters, but the cavity's internal dimensions are still unknown. Flames at a constant temperature of 5,000 Kelvin are being continuously emitted out of the cavity through an unknown process. Remarkably, these flames appear to have no effect on SCP-7786’s internal temperature. The Foundation's became aware of SCP-7786-Ω's existence on 01/05/2002 (See Addendum-7786-04 and the Incident Report).</p>
<p>Most of the data concerning SCP-7786-Ω has been gathered from historical manuscripts related to several Germanic tribes, which consistently refer to SCP-7786-Ω as "Wotan." While comprehensive information on SCP-7786-Ω's origin, physical attributes, and full anomalous capabilities remains limited, analysis suggests that SCP-7786-Ω's entry into our reality will trigger an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. This conclusion is supported by SCP-7786-Ω's apparent hostility towards all human life, along with the violent and gruesome nature of events associated with SCP-7786-B.</p>
<p>It is currently believed that SCP-7786-Ω remains in a dormant state when left undisturbed. However, it has come to light that instances of SCP-7786-B are actively attempting to incite its activity (See Addendum-7786-04). This presents an ongoing threat to the potential of a containment breach, necessitating research into effective containment protocols for SCP-7786-Ω.</p>
<p>Previously, a proposal was put forth to station Scranton Reality Anchors around Mountain Brocken and activate them to restore Hume levels in the vicinity to their standard range. Theoretically, this action would lead to the permanent separation of SCP-7786 from our dimension. However, the project was rejected due to the potential risks of inadvertent merging of dimensions or reality distortion within the area. Instead, it has been reserved as a last line of defense to be employed in the event of a breach.</p>

<p><strong>Document-7786-0989:</strong> The following documents have been collected from the memoirs of Priest Heinrich von Schrober, translated from German. It is believed to have been written sometime between 740 and 751 AD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Today, by the divine will of the Almighty, we have successfully purged yet another witch,</em> [corrupted text] <em>her soul from the clutches of sin and delivering our world from</em> [corrupted text]. <em>Regrettably, these sinister adherents persist in their wicked assaults. Peasants and their innocent animals remain prey to them. By nightfall, the eerie cackling of these witches reverberates</em> [corrupted text] <em>abodes, and our precious children vanish into the shadows. To compound our tribulations, the mountain trembles with increasing ferocity, leading us to ponder if</em> [corrupted text] <em>of the Lord's righteous retribution for our inability to expunge this pervasive evil.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Only a few days past, I beseeched Saint Willibald, imploring for assistance, and in his grace, he did reply with a message.</em> [corrupted text] <em>sending unto us an English saint, though I remain uncertain whether the singular presence of such a noble soul shall suffice to alleviate our dire predicament. Our fervent attempts have thus far proven ineffective in combating the malevolent forces aligned</em> [corrupted text] <em>Satan. Yet, any form of aid, no matter how modest, is most earnestly welcomed in our unwavering resolve to stand against these</em> [corrupted text].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Saint Walpurga graced our town in</em> [corrupted text], <em>befitting a saint. In our conversation, I candidly recounted the harrowing experiences we have endured: the sinister witches, the winged demons, and the looming</em> [corrupted text] <em>near our village. To my surprise, she disclosed her intent to ascend the mountain, her singular journey unaccompanied by any other soul. In a moment of weakness, my curiosity overcame me, and I implored the saint to share her purpose on the mountain. I must humbly confess, my Lord, that I allowed my selfish inclinations to override my better judgment, inadvertently prying into her intentions. It was during this exchange that Saint Walpurga revealed the existence of a malevolent entity known as Wotan, an adversary of God, driven by boundless hatred and unrelenting fury. This malevolent force is purportedly the very source of the curse afflicting our land, heralding a dire future filled with destruction and pestilence. Recognizing the urgency of her mission, I promptly withdrew my inquiries, allowing Saint Walpurga to commence her ascent of the mountain. While I remain uncertain of the duration of her absence,</em> [corrupted text] <em>knowledge concerning Wotan now consumes my thoughts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two days have elapsed, and the Saints have yet to return to us. However, we have discerned a notable reduction in the onslaughts from</em> [corrupted text], <em>particularly the little ones, since her revered arrival. The nature of her endeavors atop the mountain remains shrouded in mystery, but it is our fervent hope that her righteous deeds continue to bring relief to our beleaguered community. May the Almighty continue to bless her noble efforts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The name of Wotan has been a burdensome presence in my contemplations ever since the saint imparted</em> [corrupted text]. <em>An insatiable desire to decipher the enigmas enveloping this malevolent being has consumed me, for reasons that remain elusive. In moments of frailty,</em> [corrupted text] <em>revealing to my brethren</em> [corrupted text]. <em>Yet, I held my tongue, adhering to the saint’s explicit directive to uphold silence. The allure of this demonic entity exerts an inexplicable and formidable sway over my spirit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I find myself in a state of terror. Earlier that night, I had retired to my room for slumber. This is the last event I recall before awakening to find myself in the barn near Raymond’s farm I was inscribing strange symbols onto</em> [corrupted text] <em>using the blood</em> [corrupted text] <em>chicken, now torn asunder and lying near me. I have no recollection of how I arrived there, nor any memory of events preceding this. I fear I am falling prey to a malevolent demon. The thought of seeking aid fills me with trepidation, for I fear being branded a heretic, the dire consequence being the stake and fire. Perhaps this is the divine retribution I deserve. Upon the saint’s return, I shall plead for her intercession. O Lord, I beseech Your divine intervention.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A full week</em> [corrupted text] <em>the saint’s departure, and her holy presence has yet to bless us anew. Throughout this period, our tranquil town has been spared the malevolence of witches and demons. The townsfolk find comfort in this respite, yet my soul is besieged by ceaseless torment. I cannot enter the hallowed grounds of the church without sensing the ominous presence of Wotan at my heels, his sinister whispers pervading my senses. He haunts my dreams, tempting me with promises of wealth and unholy power. A paralyzing dread grips my heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As dawn broke today, our awakening was rudely interrupted by the tremors that convulsed the mountain.</em> [corrupted text] <em>earthquake our village has ever endured. A collective exodus from our homes was prompted by this seismic upheaval, children's wails</em> [corrupted text] <em>frantic chorus. Our animals too, vexed by the tremors, succumbed to irrational behavior. The instinct to flee gripped us, only to be thwarted by a crimson radiance emanating from the mountain's summit, its disappearance followed by an unsettling</em> [corrupted text]. <em>No one among us dared to approach</em> [corrupted text].<br/>
<em>Fortuitously, Saint Walpurga returned to us later that afternoon, bearing evident signs of exhaustion, her cloak tattered and worn. Our collective plea for an account of her mission fell upon her ears.</em> <em>However, she offered only the assurance that the curse had been vanquished from</em> [corrupted text], <em>leaving us with her holy benediction as she departed</em> <em>back to the monastery of Heideheim am Hahnenkamm.</em><br/>
<em>While I regret the missed opportunity to seek her</em> [corrupted text], <em>it brings me solace to affirm that, from that day onward,</em> [corrupted text] <em>of Wotan no longer haunts my being. It seems that I may no longer have cause for concern.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum-7786-04:</strong> Incident Report 7786-Ω-0756-D.</p>
<p>At 19:42, the C-4 camera positioned inside SCP-7786 experienced a malfunction of unknown origin, which was shortly after capturing the anticipated movements of SCP-7786-B entities. This malfunction obstructed the recording on the monitors, thereby impeding the documentation of events at that time. Due to the significance of the area to be monitored, assumed to be the meeting point of SCP-7786-B instances, both D-7578 [male, 40 years old] and D-9688 [female, 35 years old] were dispatched to SCP-7786 to rectify the camera issue.</p>
<p>The subjects succeeded in reaching a location close to the C-4 camera. However, acknowledging the heightened risk of detection, both subjects opted to record the event using the cameras attached to their helmets. The dialogue has been translated from German.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>The camera points toward the large gathering of SCP-7786-B instances, up to 100 instances estimated.</p>
<p>Some of the SCP-7786-B instances gather around long wooden tables and eat what appears to be a bunch of human limbs.</p>
<p>(During the audit of the snapshots taken at a later time, it was noticed that most of the dishes, utensils, and cups were made of materials varying between precious stones like <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-604" target="_blank">sapphires, diamonds and gold.</a>)</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Shh, keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> D-7578, do you think you can get to the surveillance camera while they are distracted?</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> There is no way you will convince me to go near any of those things. Can't you see where the damn camera is? Why did you guys put it in an open place like that?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Hey, look at this!</p>
<p>D-7578 raises his head to see what D-9688 is referring to.</p>
<p>A 3-meter-tall humanoid male emerges from a nearby building. The entity possesses six disproportionate arms that appear to be surgically attached to its body.</p>
<p>(It will be referred to as SCP-7786-B2.)</p>
<p>SCP-7786-B2 walks to one of the wooden tables, collects the empty plates, and then returns inside the same building.</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> Well, I guess that was the waiter of this place.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Doctor, let us get out of here, we can't fix your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> No, you two are instructed to stay there longer and keep recording. We need to get more footage of this event.</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> You can't be serious about that. I am getting out of here, and you can't stop me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> D-7578, may I remind you that any disobedience to orders will result in termination upon your return.</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> fine.</p>
<p>Subjects were instructed to stay inside SCP-7786 for more footage.</p>
<p>(12 min of extraneous dialogue skipped.)</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-7786-B gather around the crater and form a circle, then begin to recite in an unknown language.</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> What the hell are they doing?</p>
<p>The crater begins to gradually increase in size, and after one minute, it has reached 70 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>An instance of SCP-7786-A flies over the hole and throws the mutilated carcass of a horse into it.</p>
<p>What appears to be the shadow of a giant being appears inside the hole, and a roar is heard.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Well, maybe this is the right time-</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> Look out, behind you!</p>
<p>An instance of SCP-7786-B appears behind D-9688. D-7578 fires four shots at it.</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire causes the SCP-7786-B instances to disperse from their previous activity, and the crater gradually returns to its normal size.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-7786-B and SCP-7786-A focus their attention on both subjects and attack them relentlessly. Gunshots don't seem to affect SCP-7786-B instances, and both subjects are captured.</p>
<p>Through the D-7578's helmet-mounted camera, an instance of SCP-7786-A can be seen chopping off the limbs of the subject using a machete and finishing with his head.</p>
<p><strong>D-7578:</strong> AAAAAHHHHG-</p>
<p>The body of the subject is thrown into the hole, and then the camera breaks down when it comes into contact with the fire.</p>
<p>D-9688 is dragged by four instances of SCP-7786-B. The helmet-mounted camera of D-9688 falls facing the sky, and the recording continues for another five minutes while a scream from D-9688 can be discerned in the background.</p>
<p>SCP-7786-B2 is shown looking at the camera before stomping on it, cutting the recording.</p>

<p>After losing contact with both Class D subjects, all security teams in Area-122 were put on high alert in case of any potential emergencies. Ten hours later, D-9688 was found near Entry Point Alpha and was apprehended by the stationed agents without showing any resistance. D-9688 was subsequently transported to the Joint Research Center of Area-122 for interrogation. During the transfer through Area-122, the group encountered Karl ██████, a member of the onsite Mages Academy, on their way.</p>
<p>The following log is collected from nearby security surveillance camera footage of the event. The dialogues have been translated from German.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;09:10&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Surveillance footage shows D-9688 escorted by two armed agents towards the interrogation room, passing by several other site staff.</p>
<p>Karl ██████, who was engaged in a conversation with one of the research personnel, notices the group and stares with a suspicious look at D-9688 before approaching the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Ah, excuse me there.</p>
<p><strong>Agent 1:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> If you don't mind me asking, where are you taking her?</p>
<p><strong>Agent 1:</strong> She's being taken to interrogation at Dr. Reinhard's request. Why do you ask, anyway?</p>
<p>D-9688 avoids making eye contact with Karl ██████. Karl pulls a small red cube-shaped object from his pocket, and the object begins emitting a faint light as he slowly moves it closer to D-9688.</p>
<p><strong>Agent 1:</strong> Hey! What do you think you're doing with that?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Wait, I'm just trying to check on something… Maybe we should not-</p>
<p>D-9688's eyes turn black, and she raises her still-cuffed hands toward Karl, generating a shockwave that pushes him several meters back. D-9688 breaks her cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Agent 2:</strong> What in the hell!?</p>
<p>Agent 2 raises his weapon towards, who in turn raises her right arm, producing several unremarkable black tendrils. The tendrils wrap around Agent 2 and forcefully hurl him against Agent 1, propelling both towards a nearby wall.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:15&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The alarm is activated. All unarmed personnel have left the scene, and all security personnel at the site have been directed to respond to the emergency.</p>
<p>Karl attempts to stand up after being thrown to the ground. D-9688 then shifts her attention towards him.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> [unintelligible]</p>
<p>D-9688 points her index finger of her left hand towards Karl ██████, then emits a burst of intense flame from her finger towards him.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> (Fast) <em>Aperi magnum scutum tuum et protege me!</em></p>
<p>Karl ██████ raises both arms in front of him, and a glowing magical circle that resembles a nonagram appears. The circle deflects the fire, preventing Karl from being harmed.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:17&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Additional security personnel arrive behind D-9688 and begin firing at her. D-9688 is struck by several bullets, showing signs of pain, but the bullets fail to disable her.</p>
<p>D-9688 extends more black tendrils from her right arm toward the security teams while continuing her previous action against Karl ██████. As the security personnel attempt to take cover, the tendrils successfully strike four individuals, penetrating their bodies and resulting in their termination.</p>
<p>Twenty instances of SCP-7786-A are detected approaching from the sky, flying toward the remaining security teams who are now trying to engage them.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:21&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Henrik ████████, another member of the Mages Academy arrives at the site.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik ████████:</strong> What the fuck is happening?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> What does it look like is happening to you? Do something quickly!</p>
<p><strong>Henrik ████████:</strong> <em>LAMINA AERIS</em></p>
<p>Henrik makes a quick slashing motion with his hand toward D-9688, resulting in her right arm being severed. The tendrils dissipate as D-9688 screams in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik ████████:</strong> For fuck's sake, Karl, can't I leave you for five minutes without coming back to find you fighting a random witch or something?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> It can't be helped. It's my job. Why do you think the Academy sent me here in the first place? Now stop with your comments and give a hand here.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik ████████:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p>Henrik thrusts his right hand into the ground, causing a protrusion to form towards D-9688. The ground beneath D-9688 begins to reshape itself, transforming into a human hand that grasps D-9688, while she tries to break free from the stone grip.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik ████████:</strong> What are you waiting for? Seal this bitch before she escapes.</p>
<p>Karl retrieves a metallic object resembling a coin from his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>D-9688 manages to break the thumb of the stone grip as she struggles to free herself. Henrik ████████ shows signs of pain without a clear cause.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:26&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Karl approaches D-9688 and strikes her on the forehead with the coin-shaped object, emitting smoke from the object before it merges with D-9688's skin, leaving a symbol similar to the object. D-9688 loses consciousness.</p>
<p>Security personnel successfully neutralized all attacking instances of SCP-7786-A.</p>

<p>D-9688 was successfully subdued by both Karl ██████, and Henrik ████████, and the remaining security teams proceeded to detain D-9688. The final incident report recorded 6 fatalities and 11 injuries, with damages estimated at $25,000 to the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>D-9688 was later brought in for an interview under heavy security, with Karl summoned as an assistant Interviewer and to intervene in case of an emergency.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Alright. We are ready to begin. D-9688, you—</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> You better free me now, you lowly insect, because if you think these chains will bind me forever, then you are—</p>
<p>(D-9688 screams in pain)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Shut up. It is not polite to interrupt someone while they are speaking, and you better answer our questions, or this symbol on your forehead will burn even more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Now, as I was saying, D-9688, you were arrested by our agents after you left SCP-7786, and when you arrived at the research site, it was confirmed that you possessed anomalous capabilities. Can you tell me how you acquired your powers?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Listen to me here, you pig. I am not your slave to call me with letters and numbers. I have a name you rather start calling me with.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> And that will be?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> It's Seldra Varnelit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Really? What if I told you that your name is [REDACTED], sentenced to death for premeditated murder during a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Nah, doc, I can confirm that this girl is no more. The person we are talking to now is one of those ill-fated witches.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> And how is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> I'll take a guess and say: a reincarnation ritual, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> A witch hunter as I see. Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> If you are this "Seldra Varnelit," what prompted you to leave SCP-7786? And why did you not resist the arrest by our agents?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> SCP… What.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> His talking about the mirror world.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> And why would I tell—</p>
<p>(D-9688 screams in pain)</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> … After you fools ruined my sister's ceremony, I decided to take that girl's body and go outside to see who the new inquisitors that are trying to stop us from releasing our lord from his prison. I planned to infiltrate and obtain information from within your ranks. I thought it would be simple enough. But I didn't expect that of all people there would be witch hunters right where I was hoping to go, and you know the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Tell me more about that dimension.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> What am I supposed to tell you? It's the place where we live after being kicked out of our lands. We retreated to the mountains and created a place to live, but it still seems like humans won't stop baiting our tails.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Mountains? So, there is more out there?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Take a guess, Witch Hunter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> A witch hunter. Why does she keep referring to you by that?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Because I am a witch hunter. Or you could say that I hunt black magic witches to be exact. Don't confuse sorcery with the magic we use in the academy.</p>
<p>(D-9688 hits the table with her left hand)</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> You're all just a bunch of hypocrites! Your academy was using the same magic as us, and yet you were pardoned for being the church's loyal dogs while my people were chased, plundered, and burned just because we didn't believe in your worthless beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> I think it's normal when your beliefs are based on worshiping demons, eating children, and all sorts of disgusting fleshy things.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Fool, you made us like this. Wotan was a noble soul who showed bravery and gallantry in wars and sought to gain knowledge about this world's secrets, but thanks to the demonization by that accursed bastard Charlemagne, and that whore Walpurga, our lord was sealed and thrown into the depths of hell. As for us Saxons, we lived in peace with nature in these lands for centuries before you came and ruined everything for us. Now Wotan seeks revenge on those who corrupted him with darkness, and we are just fulfilling our lord's new desires.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> But the people you're talking about have been dead for centuries, and Europe has now moved on from all this stuff. There are no church-controlled governments and ordinary people no longer engage in witch-hunting or anything like that. People don&amp;#39;t know any of this exists.</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> And what about them, (points to Karl) or your so-called Foundation, or the [REDACTED]? You are all but just the inquisition of the new age. Don't tell me that anything has changed or that you have moved on, not after everything that has befallen on us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> How do you know about all of that? This information should only be available to—</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Thanks to the orange rats you keep sending us, we have been able to look into their memories. Memories don't die even if their owner did, and a person's knowledge is one of the gifts our lord has given us.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Speaking of the devil…</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Literally.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> …What will Wotan exactly do if he is to be summoned?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Destruction. Simply you dumb mortal, destruction will come. All your glass cities will collapse in on themselves, and the fires of his wrath will consume every inch of the human world. You, who call yourselves the first line of defense for humanity, will stand by and watch without being able to do anything to stop your destruction. Your civilizations will collapse, and you will be forced to flee and hide away just as you did to us and as you did to those before you. This is justi— FUCK!</p>
<p>(D-9688 screams in pain)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> I don't think so. You don't have any idea of what we are capable of, if your lord was sealed once, then we can seal him again back to the little hole.</p>
<p>(D-9688 starts laughing hysterically)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> What is so funny right now?</p>
<p><strong>D-9688:</strong> Hehe… And you also don't know what I am capable of…</p>
<p>(D-9688 pulls an unknown type of seed from her pants pocket.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Hey! Where did you get this from? The security personnel have already searched you for—</p>
<p>(D-9688 spits on the seed, causing the seed to grow and form a gametophyte that develops into a full plant at an abnormal speed.)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> Oh fuck. Doc, get away!</p>
<p>(D-9688 throws the plant on the ground, and within 20 seconds, the plant grows into a wooden humanoid-shaped entity, approximately 4 meters tall.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Shit, call security NOW!</p>
<p><strong>Control room via radio:</strong> Security is on the way.</p>
<p>(As Dr. Reinhard flees out of the interrogation room, Karl ██████ attempts to fend off the attacking humanoid entity while he slowly steps back, trying to reach the door outside. The entity follows them to the corridor outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> What the hell is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> A wooden golem, it's been a long time since I've seen one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Reinhard:</strong> Didn't you say that she won't be able to use her magic?</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> That's not her magic, that is a magical item, you don't need to be a wizard to use these.</p>
<p>(Surveillance footage from the interrogation room shows D-9688 pulling two black feathers from her pocket. The feathers spontaneously ignite, and D-9688 throws them into the air. Each feather generates a large flame for a few seconds, resulting in the appearance of two instances of SCP-7786-A. One instance attempts to break D-9688's restraints by biting them, while the other licks her forehead, gradually erasing the symbol on her forehead.)</p>
<p>(Security teams arrive at the site and begin to engage with the entity. Although the bullets cause visible damage, the entity remains largely unaffected and continues to obstruct security personnel from accessing the interrogation room.)</p>
<p>(The SCP-7786-A instance succeeds in freeing D-9688, and her severed right arm begins to regenerate.)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> No! Don't let her escape!</p>
<p>(Security personnel deploy fragmentation grenades against the entity, resulting in partial destruction and impairment of its movement, but the entity remains unneutralized.)</p>
<p>(D-9688 proceeds to the northern wall leading to the outside and places her both hands on it, causing the wall to instantaneously dissolve and collapse.)</p>
<p>(Karl ██████ generates a blue magical circle beneath the entity.)</p>
<p><strong>Karl ██████:</strong> <em>ARDE!</em></p>
<p>(The magical circle emits a blue cylindrical flame wave that ascends vertically, causing an explosion that burns the entity and creates a hole in the corridor ceiling.)</p>
<p>(D-9688 emerges through the gap she created in the wall. Nearby surveillance cameras capture D-9688 flying at high speed towards Brocken Mountain.)</p>

<p><strong>Closing report:</strong> D-9688 has not been found since her last sighting during the incident. While it is speculated that she may be inside SCP-7786, her current location remains unknown.</p>
</div>
<p>After sharing the recovered data with the Mages Academy, their research team recommended the utilization of a counter-ritual to temporarily nullify the magic produced by SCP-7786-B during every Hexenacht event. These rituals are presumed to be similar to those practiced from the eighth century. This initiative has been designated as "Procedure Walpurga-301" (refer to Addendum-7786-05 for detailed information).</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-7786-05:</strong></p>
<div class="note">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:170%;"><strong><tt>PROCEDURE WALPURGA-301.</tt></strong></span></p>
<p>The procedure was prepared by the joint research team with the Mages Academy, the mobile task force personnel “Omicron-50 (Mountain Monks)” will implement the procedure annually until more effective containment procedures for SCP-7786-Ω are developed.</p>
<p>Part of the procedure hinges on the collective perception of human consciousness, wherein the participants are believers in an unseen manner, uncertain that the rituals are indeed capable of expelling witches and evil spirits. This necessitates that as many individuals as possible bear witness to the procedure, thereby requiring civilian intervention, all the while keeping the main cover story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The staff who are aware of the procedure should realize that this is not a containment method; it is a distraction so that we can find a better solution. The procedure does not stop SCP-7786-Ω directly; it hinders witches from summoning SCP-7786-Ω to our world. If we miss one day, it could mean the end for us.</em><br/>
<em>We have been allowed to act, and we must take advantage of it.</em><br/>
— <em>Dr. Faust</em></p>

<p>During the implementation of procedure Walpurga-301 on 04/30/2003 "</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Cultural institutions shall serve as a façade for the SCP Foundation, facilitating the promotion of a cultural festival associated with "Walpurgisnacht" within the towns scattered across the province of Saxony-Anhalt.</p>
<p>Various methods, such as offering gifts, food, and even the employment of cognitohazards, may be employed to encourage the attendance of as many civilians as possible.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> On the night of April 30, coinciding with the "Hexennacht Event," a fire shall be ignited using logs, each one inscribed with a distinct set of pre-identified prayers.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A single Class D individual will be equipped with SCP-███ to render them imperceptible to the general public while executing the remaining rituals.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The designated subject will puncture an adult goat directly in the heart using a knife until it expires while also chanting in Latin: "O Magne Wotane, anima huius animals villas et acquiesce ab ira tua, quaeso, suscipe." Following this, they will extract the goat's heart and consume it.</p>
<p>Participant subjects have consistently reported that the extracted heart appeared black, despite confirming that the goat used in the ritual was in good health.</p>
<p>If the subject resists compliance with the procedure, all available means, including physical coercion, must be employed to ensure adherence.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Upon the subject's successful consumption of the goat's heart, they must dispose of the remaining carcass into the fire and immediately leave the location.</p>
</div>
<p>Up to this date, Protocol Walpurga-301 has proven to be effective in countering the rituals performed by SCP-7786-B entities, with no incidents regarding a containment failure occurring, and research into better methods for containing SCP-7786-Ω is still ongoing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum-7786-06:</strong> On 12/04/2███, members of the mobile task force Omicron-50 successfully neutralized an instance designated as SCP-7786-A-052. After the body of the instance was burned, security personnel found a livestock identification tag in the burnt remains. The serial number of the tag was later confirmed to match one of the goat tags used in Procedure Walpurga-301 in 2███. Further research into the matter is required.</p>
