            <h1>SCP-7913</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7913</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its size and location, SCP-7913 is contained and monitored <em>in situ</em> at Area-508. Area-508 consists of SCP-7913 and the neighboring police station, which have been surrounded by reinforced and bombproofed<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> concrete. This was done under the public front of a factory compound for a private organization.</p>
<p>The police station next to SCP-7913 has been repurposed into a holding area for D-Class personnel to be used for procedure 12-Norquay. Currently, the recurrence of activation events necessitates no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">5</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">20</span> 40 D-Class personnel available onsite at any given time.</p>
<p>Activation Events are to be suppressed through Procedure 12-Norquay, which is to be carried out as follows: a D-Class staff member who has not yet participated in Procedure 12-Norquay will immediately be led through SCP-7913-A.</p>
<p>Lethal force has been authorized against any personnel who willingly or unintentionally interfere with Procedure 12-Norquay or attempt to damage SCP-7913.</p>
<p>Though it requires significantly less urgent attention than SCP-7913 or SCP-7913-A, SCP-7913-B is to be continually monitored for new arrivals, and the pathway from the door is to be kept clear.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7913 refers to the contents of a warehouse in the █████████ neighborhood of St. Paul, MN. Through remote-controlled drone observation, the following facts have been determined about SCP-7913:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a large and complicated electronic weapon that comprises 93% of the warehouse's interior.</li>
<li>There is no visible power source; electric power is maintained through unknown, presumably anomalous means.</li>
<li>SCP-7913's largest component, a black sphere, is an explosive charge that contains the equivalent of [REDACTED] exatons of TNT<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> compressed into a 20-meter radius.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further research has been hindered by the fact that SCP-7913 will start an activation event if a human subject enters the warehouse, a drone makes physical contact with any part of the device, or any attempts are made to hack into SCP-7913's mainframe. As such, the origin, creator, and age<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> of SCP-7913 remain unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-7913-A is a 197 cm x 80 cm door attached to the southern wall of SCP-7913-A's warehouse. There is no exterior handle. A symbol of a black turtle's silhouette has been painted on it. There is an LED marquee and a loudspeaker above the door.</p>
<p>SCP-7913-A only opens during an activation event. It leads to a plain white room<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> that is extradimensional in origin.</p>
<p>At seemingly random intervals (and when provoked by external means), SCP-7913 and SCP-7913-A will enter an activation event, which consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motors and other machinery audibly begin operation within SCP-7913 for approximately ten seconds.</li>
<li>SCP-7913-A opens.</li>
<li>The loudspeaker above SCP-7913-A begins emitting a 100 dB klaxon.</li>
<li>The marquee displays a 60-second countdown next to the flashing phrase <tt><strong>"!! GET IN !! (pls)"</strong></tt>
<ul>
<li>Note: Once the countdown begins, certain actions during the activation event can cause the countdown to decrease. This is noted by a sudden beep and the marquee briefly displaying <tt><strong>"&gt;_&lt; PENALTY &gt;_&lt;"</strong></tt> before returning to the countdown screen. The following actions have been proven to incur a "penalty:"
<ul>
<li>A human subject entering the warehouse.</li>
<li>Attempts to remotely hinder SCP-7913's operation.</li>
<li>A human subject who has previously undergone Procedure 12-Norquay entering SCP-7913-A.</li>
<li>Attempts to tamper with the marquee or speaker.</li>
<li>Rude gestures or insults toward SCP-7913 or SCP-7913-A.</li>
<li>Multiple human subjects entering SCP-7913-A.</li>
<li>A valid human subject for Procedure 12-Norquay attempts to leave SCP-7913-A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the 20-second mark, the core of SCP-7913 begins vibrating.</li>
<li>At the 0-second mark, one of two things occur:
<ul>
<li>If conditions for Procedure 12-Norquay have been met, the door closes, the alarm stops, SCP-7913 powers down, and the marquee displays <tt><strong>"^_^ GR8 JOB A++ &lt;3"</strong></tt> before switching off.</li>
<li>If conditions for Procedure 12-Norquay have not been met, something within SCP-7913's core will begin screeching while the Marquee briefly displays <tt><strong>"D: OH NOOOOO ;_; &lt;/3"</strong></tt>. This was briefly observed during an activation event on 12/19/22, which was aborted by the 12-Norquay participant being forcibly thrown into SCP-7913-A. As a result, the shrieking noise ended and the previous "positive" results were enacted, save for the marquee displaying <tt><strong>"0_0 !! 3 CLOSE 5 COMFORT !! ^_^;;"</strong></tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has not been empirically determined what would happen if the countdown were allowed to reach zero without remedy, but from SCP-7913's explosive yield, it can be deduced that any action taken beyond this point would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>SCP-7913-B is an identical door to SCP-7913-A located on the warehouse's north side. It has no involvement with activation events or Procedure 12-Norquay. However, past participants from Procedure 12-Norquay will occasionally exit from this door with no memory of what took place between their procedure and their exit. This usually happens between three to six months after their entry of SCP-7913-A.</p>
<p>SCP-7913-B recovery has taken place with only 12% of participants.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: SCP-7913</p>
<p>Council,</p>
<p>You have told me previously to give SCP-7913's containment procedures two years' worth of a chance to prove their sustainability. It has <em>been</em> two years, and I not only can I confirm that not only are they unsustainable, but they're suicide.</p>
<p>Yes, SCP-7913 is in the middle of a major city. No, there are not enough resources to discreetly have it shot into space. I get that. But we <em>need</em> something better, and I'm tired of being stonewalled about this.</p>
<p>As recently as yesterday, there was a streak of 58 activation events in the span of an hour. That's just short of one per minute. It's as if SCP-7913 knows we're putting so much effort in — and every time it pushes our boundaries, we're giving it the go-ahead. I have enclosed other such reports with this email, but honestly, I don't know if there's enough time to read them. I'm too worried about what SCP-7913 might try to do while your eyes are mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Forget worrying about running out of available D-Class. We're going to run out of available <em>humans</em> someday.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Fwd: Re: SCP-7913</p>
<p>Hi, Dr. Dodgson! My name's Dr. Carl Grodin from Site-59, and I'm currently on a plane to Area-508. O5-11 let me know about your predicament with 7913.</p>
<p>I've been going over the data from Procedure 12-Norquay and I've noticed a correlation between the activation events and the magnitude of SCP-7913's explosive charge. I realize that correlation doesn't equal causation, but this isn't anything general; this is a yes-no effect attached to <em>every</em> activation event.</p>
<p>It has to do with the recoveries brought about by 7913-B. Between 3 to 6 months after each activation, if the Norquay subject <em>hasn't</em> been recovered, the magnitude will go up by exactly one petaton of TNT. But if the subject <em>has</em>, that number <em>doesn't</em> increase.</p>
<p>In short, there's something about the unrecovered subjects that's making the bomb bigger.</p>
<p>What that "boom factor" (tentative name until we can think of something more clinical) might be is something I'm still looking into. But having gone over the records of the D-class we've been sending through 7913-A, I have a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Each of the recovered participants has at least one of the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>No history of violence</li>
<li>No criminal record (recruited through Protocol 12)</li>
<li>No history of mental illness</li>
<li>A generally positive outlook on life, as determined by onsite psychiatric analysts</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize that none of this immediately translates to a better containment solution. But I genuinely believe I'm on to something. Because there is a personal quality that could <em>increase</em> the explosive yield of SCP-7913, the absence of which does nothing.</p>
<p>But what if there were a quality that could <em>decrease</em> this magnitude?</p>
<p>To this end, I'd be willing to volunteer in the first available action event, perhaps with a hidden camera. If this is some kind of test of character, then instead of a nonstop stream of death row inmates, why not send someone who actually graduated college?</p>
<p>Besides, I feel like I haven't made myself actually useful once in my six years of Foundation service. This might be a chance to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Wait…</p>

One shelf is completely filled with copies of <a href="scp-5198.html">SCP-5198</a>. Turtle-themed decorations are omnipresent: turtle posters, turtle figurines, et cetera. A large poster over the librarian's desk features a cartoon turtle holding a wooden sign that says</em> <strong>"REMEMBER: TURTLE TOWN IS A <span style="color: red">NO-WUNTZING</span> ZONE!"</strong> <em>with an crossed-out red circle icon over the silhouette of an aardvark.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> What am I doing, now?</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Y'know…? Wuntzing? Wuntzing of the hands <em>and</em> feet, at the same time? I mean, if it's just foot-wuntzing, we can deal with that every now and then, no problem, but, like…</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> I'm sorry, but I have no idea what "wuntzing" is. Could you explain to me —</p>

<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> I'm just… gonna be right back.</p>
<p><em>(He hands the test to Edimpth. She goes over the answers.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> <em>(whispering)</em> …oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> <em>(whispering)</em> Yyyeah. Either we're being fucked with on a level we haven't seen in ages, or —</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Yes, hi, buddy! We can't <em>always</em> talk to you! Sometimes you gotta let the counselors have their together-time!</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> <em>Please stop talking to me like I'm a child.</em></p>
<p><em>(Edimpth approaches Grodin's desk. She grabs a different test worksheet.)</em></p>
<p><em>(She smiles nervously.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Okay! We're gonna let you go to sleep in a few minutes, we just want to do <em>one more</em> test. Just to be sure. Something within your skill level.</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> You said you were watching my life before this, right?</p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Mm-hmm!</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> Then you know I got my doctorate in computer science from MIT, right?</p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> And we're all very proud of you for it! Now, then…</p>
<p><em>(She takes his pencil.)</em></p>
<p>All you have to do is this <em>new</em> test. Don't worry about showing your work for this one. And let's do twenty minutes instead of ten, just to be safe. I'll leave you to it.</p>
<p><em>(She replaces his pencil with a red crayon from her pocket.)</em></p>
<p>Good luck, Carlie!</p>
<p><em>(Grodin grabs the crayon. His hand twitches violently.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Grodin is surrounded by crumpled pieces of blank newsprint. He slowly finishes up a simple diagram of an equilateral triangle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> There.</p>
<p><em>(He hands it to Beckany.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Thanks!</p>
<p><em>(She looks over the diagram. She squints, trying to figure it out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> It's a triangle.</p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Hmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> You told me to draw a triangle. It is a triangle.</p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Are you <em>sure?</em></p>
<p><em>(Grodin sighs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> <em>If this is some kind of situation where you're all extradimensional trickster genies or some shit, then please tell me what constitutes a fucking triangle, and I will draw it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Um… I'll be honest, I don't think another review is gonna help if you don't get it at this point. Maybe we should go back to lines! You were <em>really</em> great with lines.</p>
<p><em>(He weeps quietly.)</em></p>
<p>Aww, I know you're working hard, big guy… I got an idea. Would you like some more raisins?</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> <em>You have fed me nothing but raisins for two and a half weeks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Okay, remember what we said about stating the obvious? We <em>all</em> know the sky is blue. No one's going to tell you "great job" for saying it's blue.</p>

<p><em>(Grodin sits in a bathroom stall. The door has been removed. The three counselors sit on the floor where the door used to be. They stare at Grodin expectantly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Just take your time. We believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> <em>I AM TRYING TO TAKE A SHIT! <strong>GO AWAY!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Carlie, I'm not telling you again about the yelling.</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> At the <em>absolute</em> least, stop staring at me!</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> And we will! …just as soon as you can prove you can poop on your own without wuntzing.</p>
<p><em>(Grodin pounds a fist on the stall wall.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> …fine. Bang your fists around like a monkey. That's <em>really</em> gonna prove you're mature.</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> I CANNOT STOP WUNTZING <em>UNTIL YOU TELL ME <strong>WHAT IT IS.</strong> TELL ME!</em></p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Well, with the way you're acting right now, I don't think you're in much of a place to be telling us what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHAT IT IS EVEN ONCE!</p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Yes, it <em>is</em> wuntz. And it's terrible.</p>
<p><em>(Grodin cries again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> Just tell me what it is… <em>please…</em></p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Let me put it this way: if someone goes up to you and tells you "I don't know how to breathe," what do you even <em>say</em> to that?</p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> Wait, asking that question would mean breathing, so doesn't he already know?</p>
<p><strong>Grodin:</strong> Is it breathing? Is wuntzing breathing? Are you trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Of course not! You need to breathe to live! But if you think you need to <em>wuntz</em> to live, do you know what that's called? An addiction. And that's nothing to —</p>
<p><em>(Grodin involuntarily defecates.)</em></p>
<p>…okay, how many times did he wuntz during that bowel movement?</p>
<p><em>(Edimpth checks her clipboard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> 27.</p>

<p><em>(He sits in front of a pile of construction paper.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> …yeah, I think he's ready too.</p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Good luck.</p>

<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Enjoy your nap, kiddo?</p>
<p><em>(Grodin slowly nods.)</em></p>
<p>Great, great. Okay, here's the plan. Today, we're going to go over something that I think might be more in line with your strengths. We're going to cut a piece of paper. Just… cut anywhere. Don't worry about shapes or anything. Sound like a plan?</p>
<p><em>(Grodin's eyes slowly turn to meet Joeyjoe's.)</em></p>
<p>…sound like a pla —</p>
<p><em>(Grodin shrieks.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The next 68 seconds are spent on Grodin pouncing Joeyjoe and stabbing him in the heart a total of 167 times.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Grodin slowly stands back up. Still holding his scissors, he stares at Edimpth and Beckany. Neither of them are particularly unnerved by his outburst of violence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> So you can't even commit murder without wuntzing?</p>
<p><em>(Grodin lunges for Edimpth.)</em></p>
<p><em>(He stumbles. His glasses fall onto the floor.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The camera shows that Grodin is not only malnourished, but naked and covered in filth. He coughs onto the floor. The coughing progresses into vomiting — but the vomit is an intense stream of thick, molten metal. It sets fire to the surrounding floor.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> Grab the milking harness! Don't let any go to waste!</p>

<p><em>(Joeyjoe squats down to examine him. His chest wounds are slowly regenerating.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edimpth:</strong> Huh. Y'know, that's the third-quickest it took to break someone since we've started.</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> So long as we still get to harvest the ego death in the end, I don't care how long it takes.</p>
<p><em>(He rubs Grodin's hair.)</em></p>
<p>This one was an easy case, though, I'll give you that much, and —</p>
<p><em>(Joeyjoe suddenly notices the glasses.)</em></p>
<p><em>(He grabs them, staring into the camera.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Beckany:</strong> …tell me that's not a hidden camera.</p>
<p><strong>Joeyjoe:</strong> You really think that's gonna stop 'em from feeding the engine? Besides, if they see firsthand what happens when you refuse to come out of your shell, it might do 'em some good in their own lives.</p>
