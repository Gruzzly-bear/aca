            <h1>SCP-2455</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2455</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2455 is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, monitored at all times by a camera connected to an image analysis program. Should an instance of SCP-2455-1 be detected, Site Security is to be notified immediately, and the following procedures enacted as necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the SCP-2455-1 instance is identified as a member of Foundation personnel and classified information is discussed in the presence of SCP-2455, SCP-2455 is to be administered a low-grade amnestic after the manifestation ceases. Internal Affairs is to be notified.</li>
<li>If the SCP-2455-1 instance exhibits behavior analogous to being under the effects of another SCP object, a containment team is to be dispatched to 2455's cell, and the corresponding object secured to preemptively prevent contact from occurring.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2455 is a Caucasian woman of 21 years of age, capable of generating anomalous projections, designated SCP-2455-1. SCP-2455 possesses no anomalous properties outside of a SCP-2455-1 manifestation event, and is noted by staff as indecisive to the point of apathy towards its own containment.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-2455-1 will manifest in the nearest space available. These entities appear identical to SCP-2455, with one visible factor altered, most commonly clothing. Generally SCP-2455-1 instances will be observed wearing a uniform corresponding to an organization SCP-2455 is not currently affiliated with. SCP-2455-1 instances have been confirmed to possess knowledge comparable, if not an exact match, to that of SCP-2455's, in addition to expected information regarding their apparent affiliation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-2455 claims that SCP-2455-1 manifests when it is faced with a 'major decision'. See test logs attached below for analysis on this claim. SCP-2455-1 instances appear with the sole intention of insuring SCP-2455 'picks their future'. SCP-2455 claims the first appearance of SCP-2455-1 occurred shortly before its graduation from ████████ University, as SCP-2455 was attempting to choose which business to apply for employment with. Two instances of SCP-2455-1 manifested, one 'representing' the █████ Corporation, and the other the ██████ store, a local business. Both instances possessed knowledge of the working conditions of both positions,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and attempted to convince SCP-2455 to 'pick them'.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 001 - 04/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject is offered a different colored uniform.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> Trivial decisions do not appear to trigger SCP-2455's effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 002 - 04/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject is asked if it wished to be moved to a different site.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> From SCP-2455's point of view, the two situations were identical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 003 - 04/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject is offered employment with the Foundation.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> Subject was visibly conflicted by this decision, however no manifestation event occurred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I wonder if SCP-2455's effects could tell that we were not genuine with our offer?</em> - Dr Vauge.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 034 - 06/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Unplanned test. As no test conducted so far had resulted in a manifestation event, the research staff were considering doing final tests and declaring SCP-2455 non-anomalous.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing casual street clothes. Upon manifestation, SCP-2455-1 attempted to hide from research staff. When discovered, SCP-2455-1 vanished immediately.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> In the time period between SCP-2455-1 manifesting and its discovery, there was a real chance that SCP-2455 would be administered amnestics and released back into society. This indicates three things: first, that it does not have to be SCP-2455's decision that affects its future, that there has to be a real chance of that future occurring, and that SCP-2455-1 manifestations are not necessarily conductive to that future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 036 - 07/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Dr ████ (currently under watch from Internal Affairs for known sympathies to humanoid anomalies) was asked to interview SCP-2455.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the uniform of a junior researcher, and attempts to convince Dr ████ to employ SCP-2455, citing the precedents of [REDACTED]. SCP-2455-1 ignored SCP-2455.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> This manifestation was aware of classified information, notably the anomalous natures of [REDACTED]. Further questioning revealed that SCP-2455-1 was in possession of knowledge which would be expected of a Foundation employee with level 2 clearance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 041 - 31/██/20██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Unplanned test. SCP-2455 was being moved to another facility.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the same clothing as SCP-2455, however was infected with SCP-███<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> The infected manifestation attempted to attack SCP-2455 to infect it with SCP-███. The escorting guards were able to neutralize the instance as they would a normal SCP-███ victim. Shortly afterwards, a containment breach occurred at Site-██, during which samples of SCP-███ were released. Possibility of using SCP-2455 as an 'early warning' system is deemed worthy of further research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> An SCP-2455-1 instance identical to the one produced by test 036.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr ████ (Necessary to cause this instance of SCP-2455-1 to manifest)</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-2455-1 had been taken to another room so that SCP-2455 would not be involved.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 14/██/20██&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> May I have your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> ██████ █████.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> And the girl you were found with, what is her name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> She's ██████ █████ as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> And the other 2455-1 instances are…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> Idiots.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> The way I am now my future is either with the Foundation or locked up by the Foundation. I don't want to be locked up, but <em>no</em>, ██████ wants to be a baker…</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> If I may ask, what exactly is your relation to SCP-2455?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> She's my starting point. My 'iteration zero'.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> And her relationship to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> I'm her, as a researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> We have no records of you working for us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> Well of course not. I haven't happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> Are you from a possible future?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> I <em>am</em> a possible future. Hers.</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> So, before you manifested, you were…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> Waiting to happen. And here I am!</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> Hmm. Interview concluded for now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> Wait, can't I join now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> If you are what you claim, you know there are procedures that need following. Doubly so for one such as you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> But… you can't! You don't understand, <em>I</em> need to happen now or I never will!</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> SCP-2455's situation is static for now, however there lies a possibility that -</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> That wouldn't be me, it would be one of the others!</p>
<p><strong>Dr ████:</strong> 2455-1 -</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2455-1:</strong> [Subject screams in hysterics.]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> At this point, the overseeing guard aborted the interview. 2455-1 instance immediately vanished.</p>
