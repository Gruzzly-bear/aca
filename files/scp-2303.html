            <h1>SCP-2303</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2303</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2303 is suspended within a specialized polymer-sealed containment unit equipped with six electromagnetic generators to prevent surface contact. Emergency UV lighting systems are installed throughout the chamber in the event SCP-2303 attempts to breach containment.</p>
<p>Resupply is handled via automated injection lines. No personnel are to enter the containment chamber unless under direct approval from SCP-2303's project lead. In such cases, HAZMAT suits with UV shielding and full decontamination cycles are mandatory.</p>
<p>Any attempts at communication are to be reported immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2303 is a mass of CMYK oil-based press ink exhibiting autonomous locomotion and form manipulation. While largely amorphous, SCP-2303 can produce temporary appendages to mimic inanimate objects or simple organisms. These approximations are crude, lacking intricate detail, and destabilize within seconds.</p>
<p>SCP-2303 metabolizes organic matter via surface contact, extracting lipids, water, and pigmentation, which it uses to increase its total volume. Affected material desiccates rapidly; exposure exceeding thirty seconds typically results in total tissue collapse. Remains are not suitable for study after this period, as they will typically disintegrate under slight pressure.</p>
<p>SCP-2303 demonstrates periodic behavior consistent with low-level sentience. Under observation, it has produced symmetrical, rorschach-like inkblot patterns across a given surface. These images typically appear during periods of prolonged inactivity or shortly following changes in the anomaly's environment. Interpretations of these images remain inconclusive. Personnel report vague familiarity with the formations, likening them to faces, fragments of text, or interior spaces they are unable to identify.</p>
<p>Initial discovery occurred on 02/14/2025 in Charleston, West Virginia. A 43-year-old male was admitted to a local hospital with extreme dermal trauma and depigmentation of the upper extremities and face. Subject was unresponsive at time of recovery, and expired less than three hours after admission. Autopsy revealed total lipid depletion and epidermal pigment loss. Affected samples extracted from the subject dissolved upon contact with the air.</p>
<p>Recovery teams investigating the subject's residence noticed a large ink stain on the floor of an office space which was roughly human in outline. A trail of ink led to the subject's bathroom, after which SCP-2303 was discovered, having begun to infiltrate the building's plumbing systems.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2303-1:</strong></p>
<p>Since containment, SCP-2303 has produced the following unprovoked inkblot patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>A distorted humanoid silhouette, the lower body pooled and dispersing.</li>
<li>Interwoven loops terminating in frayed lines, suggestive of unraveling fibers.</li>
<li>A central void surrounded by jagged, erratic spatter, roughly shaped like a seated figure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-incident review of recovered tenant records revealed that the apartment had been rented under the name "E. Callow," a pseudonym used by an author of several unpublished manuscripts. The desk retrieved from his room was found coated internally with dried ink consistent with SCP-2303’s composition. All drawers were sealed shut by hardened residue.</p>
<p>Manuscripts recovered were illegible. Pages exhibited alternating streaks of haphazard revision and unfinished sections. No coherent text remains.</p>
<p>Efforts to confirm the presence of intelligent consciousness within SCP-2303 are ongoing. The entity does not respond to direct questioning but displays notable distress when presented with blank paper.</p>
