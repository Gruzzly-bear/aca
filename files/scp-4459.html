<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A are to be contained separately in two standard containment lockers at Site-81.</span> SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A are to be contained together in a standard-sized wardrobe made from oak or maple. The wardrobe should also be filled with the other non-anomalous clothing items acquired along with SCP-4459. Every 2-3 weeks, the wardrobe is to be opened and aerated for at least 30 minutes, and the items inside should be dusted and checked for damage.
<p>Research involving SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A should be conducted under the supervision of head researcher Dr. Imogene Stewart, and only with permission from site administration. MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" should also be on hand in the event of a containment breach.</p>

<p>SCP-4459 is a Gentleman's Black Silk top hat that shows moderate signs of wear, including notable damage to the crown and brim. SCP-4459 was acquired along with a matching red silk hat box<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> from an estate sale in Madison, WI on June 14, 2017 after local authorities had been called in reference to a domestic dispute involving the item.</p>
<p>The Foundation became involved when the responding law enforcement officer reported that one of the belligerents was dressed like a clown and exhibited paranormal behavior that corresponds with documented behavior of the Clowns associated with <a href="/herman-fuller-hub">Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting.</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" were dispatched to the scene, where they retrieved SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A. The on-scene law enforcement officer underwent amnestic treatment and was issued cover story Epsilon-Delta 12 "False Report: Domestic Incident". The two belligerents were taken into custody and later amnesticized and released after interviews determined that they exhibited no anomalous behavior outside of the influence of SCP-4459.</p>
<p>The anomalous properties of SCP-4459 only become apparent when worn. SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A collectively are host to an esotheric entity identifying as "Fraust". This entity claims that at some point in the past it was imprisoned via anomalous means inside the hat and its corresponding box by the ringmaster of GoI-233.</p>
<p>Any non-anomalous human wearing the hat becomes possessed by this entity and begins to exhibit several anomalous abilities that they would not normally be able to express. These abilities correspond with documented behaviors attributed to the entities known as Clowns that are primarily associated with GoI-233.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A were collected along with numerous items of clothing that are assumed to have belonged to C. H. Wilkerson, the deceased former owner of ████ Tallyho Lane Madison, WI. While most of the clothing collected were of an antiquated design and style, none exhibited anomalous properties. These items were initially slated for disposal, but after a request from the SCP-4459 Head Researcher, these items were retained pursuant to the revised containment procedures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4459 / D-2871</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Imogene Stewart</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>D-class subject use authorized by Site Administration. D-2871 assigned. Due to the unpredictable nature of the subject, interview was conducted in a secure interrogation room, with Dr. Stewart conducting the interview via teleconference.</em></p>
<p><em>D-2871 was placed in a room with SCP-4459<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> on a table in the center of the room. D-2871 was directed to remove SCP-4459 from its case and place it upon their head.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 28/06/17 - 10:18&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Good morning, D-2871. There is a hat in the box on the table. Please put it on.</p>
<p><strong>D-2871:</strong> Yeah yeah, sure. This is much easier than some of the other things y'all have me do.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;D-2871 removes the lid and lifts out SCP-4459.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>D-2871:</strong> Hey, this is kinda nice. A bit old, but whatever.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;D-2871 places SCP-4459 upon its head. A moment or two passed, then several physiological changes were observed to happen all at once. D-2871 is a member of a non-white ethnic group, and their pigmentation was observed to shift across the expected ethnic spectrum to assume an off-white pallor similar to white clown paint. Additionally, D-2871's depilated state was observed to change and hair growth was noted.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> D-2871 would you please describe what you are currently feeling?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> I am sorry, Doctor. Jonathon is no longer available to answer your questions.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;A notable tonal shift is noted, and D-2871's stance and demeanor is observed to be markedly different from documented norms.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Subject shows significant deviation from recorded baseline. SCP-4459, please describe for me what you are currently feeling.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> If I were to choose but a single word, Dr. Stewart, that word would undoubtedly be "loss".</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Why loss?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Have you ever experienced loneliness Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> I believe that most people have.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Then have you also felt the cessation of that loneliness? Experienced the transcendent joy that is communion with an equal, a partner, a lover?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> My personal life is not what we are here to discuss, SCP-4459</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Then I assume that you have. No, Doctor. We are not discussing your personal experiences, but you asked why I felt loss. Without context, the explanation would simply be lost. Not everything can be easily defined by notation and categorized in your report.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Then please answer the question, why loss?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Because without my soul, I am nothing. Without the heart beating in my chest, I am adrift. Without the warmth of their touch, I am alone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> So you lost someone. I can understand tha-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> No Doctor, I am afraid that you cannot. I do not mean to be rude, but it would be impossible for you to understand the depth of loss that I have experienced. You have never been <em>forged</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> I'm not sure what that means. How about you tell me how you became associated with the hat?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> I was put there when <a href="/a-night-at-the-circus">Cahaya and I</a> retired from the Circus.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> [Pause.] I was under the impression that the only way to do that was to be captured by us or if you were killed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> It is never that simple, Doctor. The Circus was hard for some, that is true. But for most of us, it was <em>Family</em>, and the only one any of us ever really had. None of us ever really wanted to leave, but I knew that Cahaya would eventually have to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Cahaya was mortal. Extended by Milk<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, sure. But eventually they would grow old, and I would not. I always knew that falling in love with Cahaya was going to lead to loss, but that was never even once a consideration. It happened, and I have no regrets.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> So you retired. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Yes. Eventually. Cahaya stopped drinking the Milk, and I knew it was time. We requested it, and our request was granted. Cahaya could pass as a normal, but… I could not.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> And the hat let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> It did more than that, Dr. Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;After that exhange, SCP-4459 lapsed into silence and refused to respond to any further questions. Eventually, D-2871 removed the hat and returned it to its box.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>It is my assessment that SCP-4459 does not present much of a threat, and while I would prefer to reclassify it as Safe, I believe that the inherent unpredictability of its Clown nature makes it so that would be ill advised.</em></p>

<p>On July 21, 2017 SCP-4459 breached containment during a routine cleaning of their containment area. D-2101 had been tasked with janitorial duties in that section, and during the completion of their task, put on SCP-4459. After a few moments, SCP-4459 returned all of the clothing to the wardrobe before shifting into an incorporeal state and vanishing up through the ceiling. The hume level fluctuation generated by this shift triggered the containment alert, but site security was unable to prevent SCP-4459 from leaving.</p>
<p>MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" were activated, and they proceeded to attempt to locate and re-contain SCP-4459 which they initially failed to do. During the course of their following investigation, members of Pi-6 returned to Madison, WI in an attempt to track down SCP-4459. Evidence was found that SCP-4459 had been visiting the grave site of C. H. Wilkerson, and several items were retrieved from the scene.</p>

<p>The following documents appear to be several pages torn from a journal.</p>
<div class="page">
<p>and I am not sure what that really meant. I do know that Cahaya is struggling to find a purpose here at the Circus, and I really want to help them find a place. Poodles and Squigly are very supportive of my endeavors to make a home here for Cahaya, and I was <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">surprised that</span> Of course <strong>they</strong> would be supportive. They always considered me a younger sibling, and they wanted the best for me. I do not think they ever expected me to find such comfort in the arms of a human, much less one that was not even "different", but what can you say? All I know is that I want the best for Cahaya, even if that means I ultimately must let them leave.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
April 2nd -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Icky came to me with a suggestion today. She has always been curious about how resistant Cahaya is to the more dangerous side effects of Milk, and she suggested that we try feeding them a less-dilute version than <a href="/scp-1921">the Candy.</a> I am not sure this is the best route to take, but Cahaya seemed really excited about the prospect. "Whatever lets me be closer to you." was all they would say about it. I think that if this is the only way to help Cahaya feel more at home here, then I am all for it.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
April 3rd -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Cahaya got really sick today after trying the brew that Icky made up. She said that it was much stronger than the Candy, but nothing like the stuff that we drink. Tillie brewed it up for us, and Cahaya drank it down right away. I guess the good news is that they are definitely not dead, but they fell asleep and have not woken up yet. Manny said that Cahaya really is just sleeping and I should not worry, but I cannot help but worry! What if</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>there definitely needs to be something done about it. The show is going way better than I originally thought it would. Cahaya has taken to the aerials with a talent I did not expect, and Icky says that Fuller will like having another show for the Big Top. He is always grumbling about getting something new, something exciting. He has gotten meaner about it though, and he has started to press us all harder to do more, be more, be "better", whatever that means. The Fun-Lovers are all restless now, and I can tell that Icky is really nervous about that.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
May 28th -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Cahaya fell today.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
June 1st -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It took a few days, but Cahaya was finally able to get up and walk around. While not as resilient as we are, I was surprised at how little the fall actually hurt them. I keep asking Cahaya to either take it easy or allow Dick to finish the transformation, but they still do not want to accept the full conversion. I think that they are afraid that becoming a Clown would make them different. I tried telling Cahaya that I would love them anyway, but I can tell that they really are worried that they would become something else. I guess I can understand that. Icky says she is not the same person she was before she became a Clown, and it makes sense that Cahaya would be so nervous.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p>January 22nd -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The show is going great! We added a few new tricks to the lineup that we had been working on together, and I am surprised at how well they fit in with the rest of the act. Cahaya has really thrown themselves into the performances, and I think that they really have finally found their place. The look on their face when they are holding on to me makes me feel so safe. It does not matter that falling would not really hurt me, I know that Cahaya will not drop me, and that makes me feel amazing! I am so glad that they are finally at home. I think I am going to get Tillie to make something special.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
February 13th -<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
So much has happened, and I have not really had the time to put it all down. Everything seems to be coming to a head between Fuller and Manny. They are fighting all the time now, and their yelling matches are really beginning to take their toll on the rest of the cast. Those damn Freewheelers are everywhere now, and I cannot even get alone time with Cahaya in the Alley anymore. They are always watching, always leering always just around the corner. Poodles says that we do not have to worry about them, that Icky wont let them touch us, but I am afraid for Cahaya. They are no longer as fragile as they were when they arrived, but they are still not a Clown, no matter how much Icky says they are. I asked Dick about whether or not he thinks that</p>

<p>Over the next several days, MTF Pi-6 maintained an observation post at the cemetery, but SCP-4459 was never apprehended. Over the course of their operation, several more documents were left at the grave site, along with a collection of toys and flowers.</p>

<p>has finally settled down. Whatever happened at the Matinee must have been really bad, because neither Icky or Manny would talk about it. The only thing either of them would say was that Fuller was gone and was Essie's problem now. I am relieved, really. We took some time off from touring, and Icky told us all that we could all decide whether or not we wanted to stay. I do not think anyone left, and Cahaya and I talked a bit about it. I know that they are worried about what things are going to be like without Fuller, but things were ok when Fuller was away before, how is this any different?<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We are touring again! We returned to Prime and we set up outside of a place called Madison, WI. Cahaya says that they used to have family here, and I think that they were actually hoping to see someone that they recognized. They were disappointed when none of them showed up, but I think that it was only because they wanted to show off. The show is really awesome now, and we have even started incorporating several of the other Clowns into the act. Lolly wanted to play around with us too, but I do not think that she has the right temperament for it. She has a really good magic show, but Flying takes a lot of concentration. Especially with a</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine that we have been at this for so long now. Cahaya said that we have been performing together for almost 23 years. It seems like it was only yesterday.<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I do not know what changed, but Manny said it is finally safe for us to go back to Prime again. I overheard him talking to Icky about the Essies again, but this time he seemed to be saying good things about them. I do not think he has ever had anything nice to say about them, but whatever they did he certainly thinks it was a good thing. "At least there's a Prime to return to." Sometimes I am glad that I do not know all the things he does.<br/>

Cahaya fell again today, and this time they did not bounce back as quickly. Lately they have been talking about how slow they feel in the morning. I never thought about them getting older, but- No, I am not going to think about that right now. We have a show to prepare for.<br/>

Cahaya has stopped drinking Milk. We argued about it, but they said it was time. That keeping up with me was becoming too hard. I can tell that they really want to, but even the Milk is not enough anymore. I think that fall effected them more than they expected. I am scared, I do not want to lose them. I think I will go talk to Icky.<br/>

Icky has a plan! She was telling me all about part of how the Matinee works, and she thinks she can replicate some of the things that Fuller</p>

<p>On July 28th, 2017 SCP-4459 manifested at the grave site once again, but did not leave anything behind. MTF Pi-6 were able to surround and apprehend SCP-4459 without incident.</p>
<p>After SCP-4459 was returned to containment, several attempts were made to conduct another interview, but SCP-4459 refused to speak to anyone. Eventually Dr. Stewart was able to convince SCP-4459 to cooperate with a final interview.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4459 / D-2871</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Imogene Stewart</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>D-class subject use authorized by Site Administration. D-2871 assigned.</em></p>
<p><em>Initial attempts at interviewing the subject since re-containment have all failed. I have decided to try one last time, but have decided to assume the risk of interviewing SCP-4459 in a standard interrogation room. I brought along several of the items left at C. H. Wilkerson's grave site in the hope that they will prompt SCP-4459 to speak with me.</em></p>

<p><strong>&lt;D-2871 retrieved SCP-4459 and placed the hat upon its head. For several moments after the expected transformation D-2871 remained motionless, then it looked up at Dr. Stewart&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Good morning, SCP-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> [Interrupting.] Did you read them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> [Startled] The journal entries? Yes I did. I… I think I understand your loss a little better now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> What do you mean? [After several seconds without a response, Dr. Stewart continues.] Look, if you are going to be uncooperative, I will just terminate this-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> The Crown <em>forged</em> us, Dr. Stewart. It made us one person. Cahaya and I… We got to grow old together. I… I never expected to be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> How was it able to do that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> I do not really know, to be honest. Icky said that some of Fuller's magic remained behind in his Top Hat. It was one of the most precious things she owned from back then. She only brought it out to wear on special occasions. Cahaya did not want to take such a gift, they said it was worth more than a Clown and an old performer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> So, it had something to do with the-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> [Interrupting again] You do not understand Doctor. It was not <em>just</em> a Top Hat. It was his <em>Crown</em>. It was part of what sustained the whole Circus. It let him know where all of us were, all the time. Icky used it to help keep us safe. Without it… I do not know. There was a reason the Circus did not visit Prime for a while after we left.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> That really was a costly gift, then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> But it meant so much more to us. It let us be together. I do not think that even Icky knew what would happen, I guess she thought it would just function as a kind of disguise. But when Cahaya put on the Crown, they… became human again. Completely. And I was there with them, inside them, a part of them. For the first time, I truly <em>knew</em> how much Cahaya loved me. At last, we were… one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Ok, I can accept that. What happened after that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> We moved to Wisconsin. Cahaya always loved it there. Icky gave us enough of your money so that we could retire, and we just… got old.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> So what happens when no one is wearing the ha-, um Crown?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> I am not alone anymore Doctor. I had to be sure. I am sorry that I left without permission, but I… I had to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> That must've been hard for you, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> [shrugs] More than you know. Would you let me go back to my box now? I am so tired.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> Ok, thank you for-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Could you give me back our things please? I know you still have all the clothing that you took when you captured me. It… would comfort me. I would like all of our things together… like you found it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> I will see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4459:</strong> Thank you Doctor, I would appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stewart:</strong> You're welcome, Fraust.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>I am going to request that all of the items found from the Wilkerson Estate be collected and the containment procedures revised.</em><br/></p>
