<p>SCP-4150-4.1.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4150</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/on-mount-golgotha-hub">Mobile Task Force Eta-11 (“Savage Beasts”)</a> should be dispatched to the location of any reported SCP-4150 instance and secure its source. Affected individuals should be contained and made to listen in full to the song “Penny Lane” by the Beatles. Low-level amnestics are to be administered to all present.</p>
<p>SCP-4150-1 is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">to be contained in a soundproof standard holding cell</span> neutralised and buried at Site-19. SCP-4150-2 through 4 are to be kept in individual standard lockboxes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4150 is an auditory cognitohazard affecting all intelligent life possessing both functioning ears and functioning eyes. Beings considered clinically deaf or blind are unaffected.</p>
<p>SCP-4150 resembles the 1967 Beatles song “Penny Lane”, but features several lyrical corruptions (see Document 4150-Alpha). Testing has determined that these corruptions are a feature rather than the source of SCP-4150’s anomalous properties.</p>
<p>Individuals who hear SCP-4150 in full feel a powerful urge to reproduce SCP-4150 (vocally or otherwise) and pass its effect to as many other individuals as possible. Spread is typically slow, taking at least three minutes and three seconds (3:03) to fully transfer from one individual to another.</p>
<p>SCP-4150-1 through 4 are objects determined to be the source of SCP-4150 outbreaks. SCP-4150-1, retrieved 11/30/2016 (deceased 05/02/2018) was Mr. Simon █████, the singer for a Beatles tribute band. SCP-4150-2 and SCP-4150-3, retrieved 02/27/2018, are a pair of freestanding stereo speakers. SCP-4150-4 is the mobile phone of Researcher D█████. SCP-4150-4’s internet browser was opened to a radio website (designated SCP-4150-4.1) apparently created by avant-garde movement Are We Cool Yet? The internet domain was seized by the Foundation on 04/12/2018.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report 4150-4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/10/2018</p>
<p><strong>Incident Details:</strong> At approximately 14:37, Researcher D█████ accessed SCP-4150-4.1, using SCP-4150-4, through unknown methods. Security footage shows Researcher D█████ appearing increasingly agitated over the next five to ten minutes. It is suspected that Researcher D█████ was aware that he had been compromised but was unable to resist the compulsion.</p>
<p>At 14:52, Researcher D█████ accessed a security station at Site-19 and subdued a guard using a small Taser unit before broadcasting SCP-4150 through the site tannoy system.</p>
<p>The system was shut down externally at 14:54, before SCP-4150 could be broadcast in full.</p>
<p>At 14:57, Researcher D█████ was shot and killed by guards.</p>
<p>Thirteen (13) staff members were later compromised via a group email D█████ had sent from the security station with SCP-4150 attached as an audio file. All these incidents were contained.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> A total of thirty-three (33) personnel were fully compromised, and a further two hundred and twelve (212) required treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Interview 4150-1.1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4150-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Roth</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, [10:50]&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> SCP-4150-1? My name is Roth. I’d like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> How long are you gonna be keepin’ me in here? I’ve done nothin’ wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> All we’re trying to determine is how you caused this phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> I didn’t cause nothin’! It came to me. Whispered its way into the back of my head, peeled the muscle and bone apart and burrowed its way into my ear.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> The phenomenon was physical?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Yeah. No. Maybe. There weren’t any scar. Any mark. Just the itch like there shoulda been one. Ya know what I’m sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Would you say there was an intelligence behind this? Something malevolent?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> I… I don’t know. It. It sure had a, uh, purpose. A meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Like a message?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Yeah! A message! Like it was trying to tell me somethin’, tryna let the whole world know what was comin’. Because, like, I had an audience. Because I was <em>attuned</em>. So it, like, took my form, took my aspect and angle and like. Bent itself through me like I was a lens and my music, Lennon’s music and McCartney’s music, that was a mould for it to press itself into, refracted through a billion billion lil’… holes…</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> It wears on me nowadays. The way it forced isself into me, it like, frayed me at the edges. And now I’m so tired all the time…</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> How about the concert? What can you tell me about the event?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> I’m so tired. Can’t ya help me, doc?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> I’m not a doctor. I’m just -</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> It’s in me. Spiraled in deep down in the bones. It’s all I see and hear.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> I think we should continue this conversation later -</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> [Into microphone] Requesting extraction immediately.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Deep beneath the blue suburban skies.</p>
<p><em>[Personnel enter the room and sedate SCP-4150-1.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, [10:57]&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Researcher Roth reported an “earworm”. Upon listening to “Penny Lane” in full, this ceased. SCP-4150-1 was strongly suspected to be holding back information.</p>

<p><strong>Interview 4150-1.2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4150-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Roth</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This interview was scheduled after the discovery of SCP-4150-4 and 4.1.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, [09:32]&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Good morning, SCP-4150-1. I hope you’re well rested.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> My name's Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Let’s keep this quick. What does the phrase “Are We Cool Yet?” mean to you?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4150-1 becomes noticeably agitated.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> That isn’t going to work this time, I’m afraid. I’m wearing specialised earplugs.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4150-1 displays sudden frustration and anger.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Any chance you could answer my question?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> You’re all fascist pricks. Stiflin’ art. Try’na take music you don’t like and fuck it. Hide it away where, like, no-one can hear it ‘cept the worms.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> So the phenomenon was man-made.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> No! What kinda hack would – never mind. Music comes from the soul, ya stupid fucks. We just channelled somethin' that was already there. Gave it a way out. That music needs to be heard!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> And you are affiliated with the group known as Are We Cool Yet?, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> We're just one collective. We’re dedicated to bringin' down the institutions, like you, by returnin’ power and awareness to the people. Art is freedom and you fuckers are oppressin' it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> But an anomaly like this poses a substantial threat to "the people", wouldn't you say?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Penny Lane issn'a threat. It’s a warning. I told ya. There’s things out there you won't never be prepared for. And they’re comin’. Foundation or no.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> What sort of things?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Dadadadadadadada.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> Dadadadada.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Very mature.</p>
<p><strong>4150-1:</strong> DADA!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, [09:41]&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Shortly after the conclusion of this interview, it became apparent that SCP-4150-1 had stolen Researcher Roth’s pen, with which he stabbed himself in the neck. Subject died a week later on 05/02/2018. The phrase “PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES” was scrawled on the wall of his cell in blood.</p>

<p>The album cover depicted on SCP-4150-4.1 while SCP-4150 was playing appeared to be based on the artwork for <em>1</em>, a collection of the Beatles' number one chart hits. This implies that there may be an entire album of corrupted songs as yet undiscovered.</p>
<p>In the following transcribed lyrics, differences from the original are underlined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Penny Lane – The Beatles (AWCY Remix)</strong></p>
<p>In Penny Lane there is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">man who’s</span> showing photographs<br/>
Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know<br/>
And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seven</span> people that come and go<br/>
Stop and say hello</p>
<p>On the corner <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are standing</span> with a motorcar<br/>
The little children laugh at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you behind your</span> back<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">And now your tears are drying to black</span> in the pouring rain<br/>
Very strange</p>
<p>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deep</span> beneath the blue suburban skies<br/>
I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">die</span> and meanwhile back in</p>
<p>Penny Lane there is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shadow</span> with an hourglass<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marking seven till the long eternal</span> Queen<br/>
He likes to keep the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">buried</span> engine clean<br/>
It’s a clean machine</p>
<p>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes<br/>
For a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">face</span> and finger pie<br/>
In summer meanwhile back</p>
<p>Behind the shelter in the middle of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an empty space</span><br/>
A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hollow</span> nurse is selling <span style="text-decoration: underline;">children</span> from a tray<br/>
And though she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knows that she’s the seventh</span> in a play<br/>
She <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lies</span> anyway</p>
<p>On Penny Lane the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">human slits</span> another customer<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You’re frozen, baby,</span> waiting for a trim<br/>
And then the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shadows start rushing in from the pouring veins</span><br/>
Very strange<br/>
The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seventh King</span> is in my ears and in my eyes<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crushed beneath the black and fractured skies</span><br/>
I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">die</span> and meanwhile back<br/>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It’s inside me I can’t stop it or we’ll fry</span><br/>
Penny Lane</p>
