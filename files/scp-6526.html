            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6526</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6526 is to remain in a standard anomalous item locker at Site-83. Ingestion of SCP-6526 is strictly forbidden. Failure to adhere to this procedure will result in termination.</p>

<p>SCP-6526</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6526 is a glass bottle containing an apparently infinite amount of a black, slightly carbonated beverage. Despite having an exterior labeled reading "Coca-Cola", chemical analysis of the substance has revealed that it is comprised primarily of ethanol, calculated at 190 proof<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Taste analysis by D-Class during the initial containment of the object has revealed the substance tastes similar to standard Coca-Cola or Pepsi mixed with coconut rum.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-6526 was discovered following an investigation into several public intoxication reports in ███████, Pennsylvania. Foundation agents embedded in the local police force were able to successfully identify the culprit, Dominick Nelson. Nelson's cadaver was found at the entrance to an apartment complex in ███████, and autopsies identified the cause of death to be a subdural hematoma<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. On Nelson's person were a jewelry gift box, unsigned divorce papers, a severely withered journal, a pacifier with traces of human blood, and SCP-6526.</p>
<p><strong>Recovered Journal:</strong><br/>
Foundation agents investigating Nelson's private life found several references to SCP-6526 written in the journal found on his person.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>I went to my first AA meeting today, and my accountability buddy suggested we keep a journal to track our thoughts throughout the days. Says it's a good way to keep track of our mental health through. I think he's full of it but, I want to get better, ya know? For Emily.</p>
<p>Can't believe she's a week old already! Shiela and I celebrated with a photo shoot. Wish I could show the group. Maybe I will if I ever go back there.</p>
<p>I had a sip of that drink again today. More than a sip, honestly. It's like it never runs out, and the smell! But, no. I can't afford to think about it again. Not after I almost dropped Emily.</p>
<p>I'm never drinking again.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>Shiela found the bottle, threatened to divorce me if I don't get my shit together. I told her to let me figure my own shit out. Not sure if that was the alcohol talking or me, but it's too late now.</p>
<p>On top of that, I nearly forgot Emily turned a month old today. Shiela took her from me when I tried to pick her up and give her a kiss, told me my breath smelled like booze. What does she know? Bitch.</p>
<p>I think I deserve to treat myself, given current events. Just one more sip of that Coke and rum. Then I'll start taking this more seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>Emily looked at me and smiled for the first time. She's got just the cutest baby-girl grin I've ever seen in my entire life. Her entire hand is barely big enough to wrap around my pinky finger. I'd give anything for her.</p>
<p>We were talking about sacrifice at the meeting today. Couple of the fellas were going on about selling their cars and PlayStations for booze and I was disgusted. Is this how far down this hole I've gone? I'm not going to let this shit control me anymore.</p>
<p>I just need one more drink, and then I'm off it. For good. Just one more.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Additional Page:</strong><br/>
The following page was discovered folded into one-fourth its original size in the back of the recovered journal.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>I'm sorry, Shiela. I truly am. I never meant to hurt you, or Emily. I hope you know that. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I was drunk, and I'm sorry.</span> I don't have any excuses anymore.</p>
<p>I love you, and I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive me. Don't tell Emily how I went, she's far too young to know. Just tell her daddy went grocery shopping with the big man in the sky.</p>
<p>Love, Dom</p>
