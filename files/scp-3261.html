            <h1>SCP-3261</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3261</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3261-1 and all instances of SCP-3261-2 to be stored in a secure containment locker in the E wing of Site-64. SCP-3261-2 instances are only to be removed from the locker for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3261-1 is a 17-stringed koto made from <em>Paulownia tomentosa</em> wood measuring 182 centimeters in length. The ryūgaku is decorated with a floral pattern, while the ryūzetsu depicts a small village and is engraved with the kanji "樺岡<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>". SCP-3261-2 is the collective designation for 12 pieces of sheet music for koto written in Yamada school notation.</p>
<p>When an instance of SCP-3261-2 is viewed, the viewer will begin to search for SCP-3261-1. The degree of this compulsion varies depending on the instance viewed. Copies of SCP-3261-2 do not preserve this anomalous effect.</p>
<p>When the viewer finds SCP-3261-1, they will begin to use it to play the SCP-3261-2 instance viewed. The SCP-3261-2 instance will be played within an error margin of 0.7%. If play is interrupted, the player will become distressed and attempt to resume by any means possible.</p>
<p>The player and all listeners will begin to perceive a scene dependent on the instance of SCP-3261-2 selected. The player and listeners can interact with people and objects within this scene, collectively designated as SCP-3261-3, although these objects are not visible to non-listeners. When SCP-3261-2 ends, the player and listeners will become unconscious for approximately 15 minutes. Selected SCP-3261-2 instances are listed below:</p>

<tr>
<td>SCP-3261-2a</td>
<td>村人の子守唄 (Villager's Lullaby)</td>
<td>A small village with late Meiji era architecture at dusk. At the beginning of the third line, a man exits a house carrying a wooden bucket. The man collects water from a well in the center of the village. During the seventh line, he re-enters the house.</td>
<td>Thought to be the village depicted on the ryūzetsu of SCP-3261-1. Lyrics are similar to a typical lullaby.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-3261-2c</td>
<td>小瑠璃 (Siberian Blue Robins)</td>
<td>Two young boys watching a pair of Siberian blue robins in a cherry tree. The robins' vocalizations align with the rhythm of the song.</td>
<td>Song consists of three stanzas, each of which is a tanka. Lyrics describe the robins in a manner typical of Japanese poetry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-3261-2d</td>
<td>君が代 (Kimigayo)</td>
<td>The coronation ceremony of Emperor Meiji. No deviations from the original event have been observed.</td>
<td>Song was composed in 1880 and became the national anthem in 1888, although Meiji was coronated in 1868.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-3261-2g</td>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>A village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a at noon. SCP-3261-3g1, a man in 1970s clothing, can be seen frantically searching for an unknown object.</td>
<td>No lyrics. See notes on SCP-3261-2a. Page is partially illegible due to water damage. SCP-3261-3g1 is thought to be searching for SCP-3261-1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-3261-2j</td>
<td>私の親愛なる小春専用 (Dedicated to My Dear Koharu)</td>
<td>A young couple walking through a village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a in the morning.</td>
<td>Lyrics are typical of modern love songs, although analysis of the paper and ink has determined it was composed in the early 1910s. SCP-3261-2j is the longest known instance of SCP-3261-2.</td>

<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> Good morning. What's your name?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> My name's Hidekazu. And yours?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> Keinosuke. It's nice to meet you, Hidekazu.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> It's nice to meet you too, Keinosuke. What's the date?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> January 15th.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> Do you have the year by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> Meiji 44. How could you have lost track?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> I guess the New Year just confuses me a bit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> Me too. I couldn't tell you how many times I've accidentally written 43.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> Well, Keinosuke, where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> Kabaoka.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> It's a nice place.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> I've been to every corner of Karafuto, and I've never once heard of Kabaoka.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> That's strange, you must have simply forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher ███████:</strong> It seems I did. Well, I think we're done here. Thank you for your information, Keinosuke.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3261-3j9:</strong> You're welcome, Hidekazu. I hope to see you again soon.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I'm a citizen of Kabaoka. I don't know shit about Japanese, but I figure that's the name of this place. There's really nothing interesting here. If I could choose anywhere to go, this would be at the very bottom of my list. In fact, I wouldn't even have ended up here if I had just stopped playing that damn koto, then and there. It was just laying there at that curios shop, with a few pieces of paper I couldn't even read. I bought it, played a song, and boom, I'm in some village. The first few times I played it, everything went fine, I got out. But no, this time I had to get stuck here. How did this even happen?</p>
