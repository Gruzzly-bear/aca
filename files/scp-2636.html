<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2636 is a female bipedal mammal-like reptile of an unknown species (henceforth referred to as <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em>), measuring 3.4 meters in height and 135 kilograms in weight. Subject’s skin is smooth and hairless, and is dark red in coloration with a pale grey underbelly. SCP-2636’s primary senses are sight and hearing: the specimen possesses large eyes and ears, with the ears serving the secondary function of removing waste heat from the body. All scent organs are effectively vestigial. SCP-2636’s legs are semi-digitigrade, with three toes and a fleshy foot pad to distribute weight, and the hands are four-fingered with one thumb. The head and back bear flexible spines measuring 5-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>SCP-2636’s digestive system is specialized for a liquid diet, primarily blood, though it is capable of digesting vegetable and fungal matter. As such, the mouth structure of SCP-2636 lacks teeth and a functioning mandible, instead consisting of a muscular, bone-tipped proboscis. Venom sacs are located in the upper thoracic cavity, directly below the collarbone. This venom is a powerful hemorrhagic toxin, capable of liquefying the internal organs of the prey creature. SCP-2636’s respiratory system consists of a series of eight sphincters located in the upper chest and back.</p>
<p>SCP-2636 is believed to be sapient, due to demonstration of self-recognition, mathematical ability, and artistic expression. However, no successful communication with SCP-2636 beyond simple pantomime and pictograms has been accomplished: SCP-2636 is incapable of speaking human languages, and has made no progress in learning written languages. SCP-2636's native form of communication, a series of song-like vocalizations, is not yet understood. SCP-2636 is highly sensitive to sound, with continuous loud noises (in excess of 100db) triggering hemolacria, otorrhagia, and hematidrosis in the subject. Tissue analysis has shown that SCP-2636 is highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and pollutants, and possessing of an immune system incapable of protecting SCP-2636 against many human-carried diseases.</p>
<p>SCP-2636’s blood and other body fluids contain a variant of the <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em> bacterium, termed <em>Mycobacterium leprae potrix</em>. The symptoms of <em>Mycobacterium leprae potrix</em> are both accelerated in progression and more severe than those of <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em>, and the bacteria have proven resistant to leprostatic agents.</p>
<p>SCP-2636-1 is a pre-Columbian temple complex<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> located in [REDACTED], Mexico. The architecture of SCP-2636-1 does not match that of any indigenous peoples in the region: the scale of the complex and artistic depictions within indicate that it was constructed by SCP-2636’s species. The oldest segments of SCP-2636-1<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> have been dated to approximately 12,000 BCE: the most recent constructions<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> have been dated to approximately 7500 BCE.</p>
<p>The central chamber of SCP-2636-1 was built with a significant knowledge of acoustics. An individual standing on the central dais is capable of being heard throughout the central chamber without difficulty. Speaking in a raised voice will allow the individual to be heard outside SCP-2636-1 by means of structures funneling sound through the roof of SCP-2636-1.</p>
<p>This central chamber of SCP-2636-1 is built above a natural cave formation, later expanded by the builders of SCP-2636-1. Chambers within the cave were apparently used for storage, residence, and interment of the dead. A total of 3409 skulls belonging to <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> specimens have been found within the cave system, dated between c. 12,000 BCE and c. 2000 CE. Entry to the central chamber is made only by passing through two antechambers. A one-room stone structure, referred to as the Small Temple, is located outside the primary structure. The purpose of this structure is unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-2636-2 is a mass of mummified animal parts bound together with hide strips, measuring 4.7 meters in height and weighing approximately 500 kilograms. SCP-2636-2 consists primarily of bones, organs, and limbs, with six goat heads forming the top of the pyramid. The age of SCP-2636-2 is unknown, but the animals used in its construction indicate that it was built after European settlement. It is unknown how SCP-2636-2 has maintained a state of preservation in a tropical environment.</p>
<p>UAP-5982-1 through UAP-5982-8 are entities outwardly appearing to be living specimens of SCP-2636-2, bearing no signs of decay and measuring approximately 50 meters in height. It is believed that SCP-2636-2 was envisioned as a representative image of these entities. UAP-5982 specimens have only been observed during Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch.</p>
<p>██/██/2015: SCP-2636a is a deceased fetal female of the same species as SCP-2636. SCP-2636a is genetically identical to SCP-2636, indicating that the pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis. Events surrounding the initial generation of SCP-2636a are designated as Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong> Certain carvings and paintings within SCP-2636-1 have been deemed to provide further context regarding the nature of SCP-2636, and have been arranged in presumed chronological order, as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> in pastoral scenes. Imagery indicates a nocturnal hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with some rudimentary form of fungal agriculture.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></li>
<li><em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> killed in large numbers by humans.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> Human figures are portrayed as squat, grotesque figures, with exaggerated mouths and disproportionately small eyes.</li>
<li>Retreat of <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> below ground and into the remote jungle. Humans displayed as desecrating <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> bodies on the surface. Surviving specimens depicted as injured and sickly.</li>
<li>Construction of SCP-2636-1 and SCP-2636-2 by <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em>.</li>
<li>The passing of the lunar cycle, with attendant symbolism to indicate repetition. A procession of female <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em> stands in front of a dormant SCP-2636-2: all female specimens are pregnant, and making gestures of supplication towards SCP-2636-2.</li>
<li>SCP-2636 positioned in front of SCP-2636-2, hands folded in front of its abdomen. Cutaway view of the abdomen shows developing fetus. SCP-2636-2 has extended an arm to touch SCP-2636’s abdomen. SCP-2636-2 is depicted with a song-halo motif for the first time. This motif is significantly deviated from the typical content and style.</li>
<li>SCP-2636 giving birth to SCP-2636a. Musical motif is a combination of symbols from the depictions of both the pre-human state, the human conflict, and SCP-2636. This is termed the divine motif.</li>
<li>SCP-2636a presented before SCP-2636-2. SCP-2636-2 is once again portrayed with song-halo motif. In addition, SCP-2636-2 is portrayed in an unmummified state, and as animate.</li>
<li>SCP-2636a riding SCP-2636-2, driving forth humans, surrounded by a crowd of <em>Potrix caprarum sapiens</em>. Divine motif shared by all individuals. SCP-2636-1 is airborne.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum-02:</strong> Initial recovery of SCP-2636 occurred between ██/██/2013 and ██/██/2014, after an extensive hunt, ending near [REDACTED] Arizona. The complexity of traps used against recovery agents indicated that SCP-2636 worked with the aid of at least one other individual. This individual or individuals have eluded follow up searches of the region, and no further activity has been noted.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Report 2636-Aleph-Exarch</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/2014</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-151 (Coordinates ██-██.█-██.█)</p>
<p><strong>Event Type:</strong> LK (Localized Crisis)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>At 0222, local time, SCP-2636 enters labor, beginning songlike vocalizations that will last the entirety of the event. These vocalizations match no patterns observed before, and indicate intense pain.</p>
<p>Vocalizations steadily increase in volume as SCP-2636 begins exerting force upon the structure of Site-151, culminating in an outward explosion of force centered around SCP-2636.</p>
<p>Eight instances of UAP-5982 appear at this time, emerging from the ground around Site-151.</p>
<p>SCP-2636 rises into the air, hovering approximately 25 meters off the ground. SCP-2636 develops six wing appendages.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> At this point, SCP-2636’s vocalizations have risen to approximately 140 db, and have been joined by similar vocalizations by all eight instances of UAP-5982.</p>
<p>Vocalizations peak and then begin to recede. UAP-5982 instances each place a hand underneath SCP-2636 and lower it back to the ground. UAP-5982-4 shoots approaching helicopter containing members of MTF Eta-87 out of the air using what appears to be a beam of concentrated light, killing all hands.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the ground, SCP-2636 falls asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Resultant Anomalies and Damages</strong></p>
<p>• Liquefaction of 89% of personnel within Site-151.<br/>
• Deafening and blinding of all surviving personnel.<br/>
• Destruction of 79% of Site-151’s primary structure.<br/>
• Transmutation of all water within Site-151 into blood containing <em>Mycobacterium leprae potrix</em>.<br/>
• Generation of eight incidences of UAP-5982.<br/>
• Generation of SCP-2636a</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Efforts:</strong> Site-151 was retaken by members of Local Task Forces 151-He (“Jared Crump’s Hard-Luck Club”), 151-Yaw (“Pillar Men”), 151-Qoph (“Heavy Metal Queens”), and Mobile Task Force Eta-87 (“Lucky Leftovers”), with the assistance of EWU Squad 7. All instances of UAP-5982 were terminated by 2030, ██/██/2014. Surviving personnel were admitted to intensive treatment at Site-04, Site-78, and Site-115. SCP-2636 and SCP-2636a’s remains were successfully transported to Site-115. SCP-2636 was successfully placed in isolation and administered Omega-3 amnestics without further incident.</p>
<p>Media coverup efforts and the remote location of the incident were sufficient to justify the withholding of additional amnestics to the surrounding population beyond standard waterborne rations.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation Casualties:</strong> 5 administrative staff, 16 research staff, 20 security staff, 11 D-Class personnel, 45 task force personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Items Lost:</strong> SCP-███, SCP-████, SCP-████, E-█████ through E-█████, and E-█████.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum-03:</strong> In light of the destructive nature of SCP-2636a, preventative termination of SCP-2636a was proposed and passed by the Overseer Board, with a vote of 8-5, with approval of the Ethics Committee. SCP-2636a was terminated without further incident.</p>
<p>Analysis of the remains of SCP-2636a indicate that the fetus bore significant physical deformities, and is estimated to have survived no longer than two months after birth. This, combined with SCP-2636a’s method of parthenogenic conception, and the continued mummified and inanimate state of SCP-2636-2, indicates a significant deviation from the events depicted within SCP-2636-1. The consequences, if any, of this deviation are unknown at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-04:</strong> ██/██/2015 – Further physical study of SCP-2636 indicates prior pregnancies.</p>
