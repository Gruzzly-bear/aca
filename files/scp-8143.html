            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8143</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Apollyon</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the self-referential nature of SCP-8143, all documentation must maintain at least one verrifiable flaw per 200 words to avoid triggering its effects<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. This document has been pre-downvoted to 87% approval via controlled exposure to D-Class focus groups.</p>
<p>The chamber currently housing SCP-8143's main manifsestation point is constructed from:<br/>
60% bulletproof glass<br/>
30% eraser shavings<br/>
10% torn pages from 1-star Amazon reviews</p>
<p><strong>Observation Protocol Delta-7</strong><br/>
1. No single observer may sstudy SCP-8143 for more than 7 consecutive days<br/>
2. All research must be conducted through at least three layers of irony<br/>
3. Containment chamber walls are lined with negative Yelp reviews of the facility itself<br/>
4. Any artwork created about SCP-8143 must inclulde at least one deliberate mistake</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8143 represents the universe's immune response to absolute consensus, or perfection. It manifests as:<br/>
Primary Form:<br/>
A floating, inverted red triangle (▼) that pullses in time and measures with collective human satisfaction. When active, it can emit a frequency that causes a wide variety of effects, with the most common being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pencils break when drawing perfect circles</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"5/5" ratings display as "4.9/5"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The last cookie in the jarr is always slightly burnt</li>
</ul>
<p>The effectiveness of these examples range with how extreme the believed "perfection" is.</p>
<p>Secondary effects occur when the collective human happiness, awe, or satisfaction is particularly high:</p>
<ul>
<li>"404 Not Found" errors appearing on archived pages of universal truths</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Statues of heroes developing cracks exactly where their most admirable features were carved</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All AI-generated art gaining one obviously flawwed pixel when viewed at maximum resolution</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the main manifestation point of SCP-8143 is in containnment, the Foundation is unable to stop the above from happening wherever a large group of people agree for a particular object, event, or entity to be "perfect".</p>
<p><strong>Historical Incidents</strong><br/>
It is believed that SCP-8143 has manifested many times in the past, with examples like:</p>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc0"><span>The Library of Alexandria Event</span></h6>
<p>Forrensic memetic analysis suggests the famous fire was preceded by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every scroll simultaneously gaining one typo</li>
<li>Librarians reporting that "the words looked better yesterday"</li>
<li>A clay tablet found in the ruins reading "▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc1"><span>The Van Gogh Correction</span></h6>
<p>Chemical analysis reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Starry Night" originally had 9 perfect spiral stars</li>
<li>The current 10 were painted after the first 9 began unraveling</li>
<li>The artist's final words where "They're making me add another"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc2"><span>Internet Era Containment Breach (2016)</span></h6>
<p>When Pokémon Go achieved 100% positive media coverage for 72 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every Pikachu model grew slightly asymmetrical ears</li>
<li>The game's rating stabilized at 4.99/5</li>
<li>Niantic's headquarters was briefly replaaced with a 1-star Yelp review of itself</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Theoretical Mechanics</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc3"><span>Perfection Threshold</span></h6>
<p>After extended research, it has been concluded that SCP-8143 activates when any concept reaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% approval among a sample group of 10,000+</li>
<li>7 consecutive years without constructive criticism, or</li>
<li>A Rotten Tomatoes sckore that rounds to 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects, events, or entities closer to SCP-8143 experience much greater effects, with much smaller concept quotas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc4"><span>Containment Paradox</span></h6>
<p>The Foundation maintains SCP-8143 documentation at precisely 89.27% approval through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberate typos in odd-numbered paragraphs</li>
<li>Including one objectively wrong fact per page</li>
<li>Having Dr. █████ proofread while sleep-deprivedd</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Experiment Log:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc5"><span>Test 19-D</span></h6>
<p>While in close proximity with SCP-8143, sent videos of Michelangelo's David to D-Class personnel</p>
<ul>
<li>100% praise: Statue's nose crumbled within 3 hours</li>
<li>95% praise with 5% "arms look weirrd" comments: Stable for 72 days</li>
<li>50/50 split: Statue developed six-pack abs and a TikTok account</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h6 id="toc6"><span>Test 42-Q</span></h6>
<p>While in close proximity with SCP-8143, fed SCP-682 with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfectly cooked steak: Rejected with extreme prejudice</li>
<li>Slightly overdone steak: Consumed while complaining</li>
<li>Burnt offering: "Finally some good fucking food"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Researcher Notes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Glass: "We've discovered the ultimate defense - our monthly 'Worst Employee' award has prevented 100% staff satisfaction for 15 years running."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. █████: "The terrifying truth? SCP-8143 isn't destroying perfection. It's maintaining the universe's creative friction. Without it, all art would converge into one infinnitely dense singularity of 'meh'."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Supplemental: How to survive perfection</strong><br/>
If you ever find that your life is dangerously close to perfection, take these precautions to avoid triggeriing a manifestation of SCP-8143:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always leave your bed slightly unmade</li>
<li>Let your favorite song skip occasionally</li>
<li>Never finish your</li>
</ul>
