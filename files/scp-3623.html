<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of writing this document, Foundation was successful in containing 13 instances of SCP-3623 out of at least 200 worldwide<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The population of SCP-3623 is slowly increasing by unknown means.</p>
<p>SCP-3623-1 through -11 are to be contained close to their respective hosts, in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-91. Instances are to be housed separately from their hosts but in close proximity of no more than 3 kilometres. On-site personnel are to be reminded that while instances of SCP-3623 do not have the same needs as their hosts, they should be treated as if they had.</p>
<p>An exception is to be made in case of SCP-3623-12 and -13, whose hosts are currently Foundation employees. Due to their similarity to humans and their state as anomalous entities, Protocol Artwork-VII has been devised and applies for any instance of SCP-3623 that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">infects</span> transfers to Foundation personnel. See Addendum 3623-2 for more information regarding Protocol Artwork-VII.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3623 is an intelligent species of anomalous <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">parasitic</span> symbiotic humanoids, which uses sentient species, usually humans, as their host. The connection between SCP-3623 and its host is psychological and does not require physical contact to form.

<p>Biology of SCP-3623 is identical to human with a few key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only female instances of SCP-3623 exist.</li>
<li>Reproductive systems of SCP-3623 do not function<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>SCP-3623 do not require any nutrition other than energy drained from their hosts but have completely functioning digestive systems.</li>
<li>Stable Hume Field of exactly 0.87 Humes has been observed in all contained instances of SCP-3623 to date and has proved to be the only effective way of identifying instances of SCP-3623 from humans. Instances of SCP-3623 have not been observed to have any reality bending abilities.</li>
<li>SCP-3623 have an extremely long lifespan. To date, no known occurrence of natural death has been observed in SCP-3623<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</li>

<p>Roughly every 72 hours, SCP-3623 will start a "feeding event". In order for SCP-3623 to start feeding, a distance of maximally 5 kilometres from the host has to be established, otherwise, the subject will starve. There is no observable change in behaviour of SCP-3623 and the entities in question do not report feeling any change either<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, however, the host does experience this event as a sudden surge of weariness, sometimes accompanied by headaches. Strength of this surge depends on the time passed since the last feeding event.</p>

<p>An anomalous side effect of this feeding is described as a sudden compulsion to create and engage in activities regarded as artistic, such as writing poems or playing instruments. This can be used as an indicator of the connection between host and SCP-3623 as affected persons may exhibit a change in behaviour. It is to be noted, that this effect only creates artistic compulsion and does not enhance any previous skill. Because of this, instances of SCP-3623 generally prefer people with pre-existing artistic capabilities, when switching hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3623-1:</strong> Transfer Process</p>
<p>Transfer process occurs only when the host of SCP-3623 dies and cannot happen otherwise. In the opposite scenario, where SCP-3623 dies, the host starts developing symptoms of depression and various psychological problems leading to eventual suicide in 93% of cases. During this process, SCP-3623 will experience a great amount of pain and involuntarily undergo an event similar to metamorphosis. SCP-3623 will replace at least 50% of its genome and go through a complete body and personality change. The memory of SCP-3623 is also replaced. It is to be noted that in some cases, SCP-3623 will retain the memory of its nature as an anomalous entity.</p>

<p>Shot begins with a view of an adult blonde woman (SCP-3623-13) kneeling on the floor of a containment unit at Site-91. The woman is showing signs of distress and speaks in agony.</p>
<p>After this, SCP-3623-13 calls out for Researcher ██████, its recently deceased host, pleading for help. This is abruptly cut by a loud scream from the subject and a flash of bright light emitted from the subject's body.</p>
<p>Video is blinded for several seconds before slowly regaining sight of the subject who is now laying on the ground without any movement. The subject looks very different from its original form and now appears as a young woman with red hair, noticeably taller than before. Subject's clothing remains the same, though it doesn't fit the subject's figure anymore.</p>
<p>Subject regains consciousness approximately 15 seconds later, is visibly confused, anxious and expresses signs of amnesia.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue">Most subjects will almost instantly accustom to their new personalities and bodies. Their memory is completely replaced with false memories of their life, similar to the effects of amnestic treatment. Interestingly, SCP-3623 is extremely resilient against any other amnestic effect. It is also to be noted that instances of SCP-3623 and their respective hosts often exhibit a subconscious need to stay close to one another, even when not aware of their psychic link.</span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3623-2:</strong> Protocol Artwork-VII</p>
<div class="collapsible-block">
<div class="collapsible-block-folded"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">[SUBMIT LOGIN CREDENTIALS: LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]</a></div>
<div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none">
<div class="collapsible-block-unfolded-link"><a class="collapsible-block-link" href="javascript:;">[CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED]</a></div>
<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>Protocol Artwork-VII applies to instances of SCP-3623 which are connected to Foundation Personnel (Currently two, SCP-3623-12 and -13). As of writing this, no effective way of breaking the connection between SCP-3623 and its host exists. Termination of host triggers a transfer event and termination of SCP-3623 causes host to develop severe anxiety and depression, eventually leading to suicide.<br/>
Due to this, the fact that instances of SCP-3623 themselves exhibit no dangerous properties and the memory alteration caused during their transfer, it has been decided that SCP-3623-12 and -13 will be given statuses of Foundation employees.</p>
<p><strong>Protocol:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to be kept oblivious of their true nature.</li>
<li>Hosts of respective instances are to be informed of their nature as hosts and are to be given all information regarding the instance of SCP-3623 that connected to them.</li>
<li>All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to have their security clearance edited without their knowledge and are not allowed to leave Site-91.</li>
<li>Should any instance of SCP-3623 realise their true nature, they are to be referred to the document below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Document 3623-VII:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>You are here because you want to know who you are. First of all, I am horribly sorry, no you are not human, no we couldn't tell you. I worked hard and used all my influence and connections in the Ethics Committee to even create Protocol Artwork-VII. Not telling you was a compromise. Why? Well, the Foundation contains anomalies. We do not destroy them, we do not use them and most importantly, we do not work with them. Of course, there are exceptions. And this is one of them.</p>
<p>I don't care if anyone disagrees. What else would you have done? Execute all the SCP-3623 we have because some of them infected the personnel? Keep them locked up and risk the staff killing themselves? If it was on me, I would let this anomaly be, but I also understand that the Foundation doesn't leave anomalies uncontained.</p>
<p>So here you are, SCP-3623. But think about it, do you really feel that different? I recommend you to tell your host. Talking is a key to a successful relationship and if you like it or not, you are in one now. It has worked for me while it did, it should for you.</p>
<p>I apologise for telling you this way. But this arrangement is already very thin. Please think about your next action.</p>
<p>- Dr. Erwick, <span style="color: blue">former</span> Director of Site-91</p>

<p>Listen, Mady… I… This is my last chance to say something. Those years we spent together? I wouldn't change a thing. Hope to see you again someday. Goodbye.</p>
<p>PS: I found another way. You have a chance now.</p>

<p>By the time you are reading this, I am dead. Do not worry about me, I had a good life and I made a conscious decision to pass on.</p>
<p>First of all, I did it because of my dear Mady. I couldn't bear it when I found her bleeding on the floor in her office. She took her life because she couldn't take the things she discovered. Her last will and reasoning I burned alongside her body after I read them. Do not bother searching for it, leave us at peace. This reminds me, do not search for me.</p>
<p>As for you, personnel of Site-91. Move on, do not dwell on the past, I am sure that whoever becomes your new Director will do well. I apologise for leaving in a hurry. I think many of you will understand.</p>
<p>A personal message for the O5 Council, I know that sometimes we didn't exactly agree, SCP-3623 was a tough call. My last wish is that you do not take any action against Protocol Artwork-7. I am not doing this because of an anomaly but out of pure love.</p>
<p>And yes, Madeleine indeed was my muse. It doesn't matter if I tell anyone now. It is the only secret I'll reveal.</p>
<p>Yours truly, Dr. Christopher Erwick, Former Director of Site-91.</p>
