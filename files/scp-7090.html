<p>SCP-7090 endoscopic image capture.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7090</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7090 is to be housed according to standard protocols for potentially radioactive humanoids. Periodic medical examination is permitted for the purpose of data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7090 is a 27 year old human female whose cranial cavity contains an object resembling a miniature star.</p>
<p>The anomaly was discovered when SCP-7090 presented itself to a medical facility suffering symptoms of a mild thalamic stroke. Initial imaging results were assumed to be due to malfunctioning equipment. When further imaging sessions<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-72784-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-72784-1')">1</a></sup> returned abnormal results, physicians began to discuss investigative surgery. By this time, a Foundation plant had become aware of the situation and SCP-7090 was taken into Foundation custody with facility personnel amnesticized as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Foundation's own medical imaging returned similar abnormal results; as such, the decision was made to proceed with surgery. At first, SCP-7090's skull appeared to contain a featureless black void. However, endoscopy revealed a small but intense source of broad-spectrum electromagnetic radiation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-72784-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-72784-2')">2</a></sup>, located slightly toward the front of the cranium. No evidence of this radiation was detectable from outside the cranial cavity, including from outside the surgical aperture.</p>
<p>After subsequent investigations confirmed no further anomalous properties, SCP-7090 was moved to its current containment location for long-term monitoring.</p>

<p><strong><tt>T. Aluko Clinical Notes: SCP-7090</tt></strong></p>
<p><tt>Patient, 27yo female, presented w/unusual cranial imaging, later confirmed w/anomalous endoscopy results showing mostly empty skull w/small light(?) source mid-front of cavity in approx location of thalamus. Pt generally in good health w/slightly elevated BP/PR. Pt displayed modest anxiety and the usual mild distrust — but also sense of relief (uncommon). Pt released and cleared for further surgery.</tt></p>

Multiple theories were initially advanced concerning the radiation source in SCP-7090's skull. However, high-resolution spectroscopy yielded an unexpectedly specific result: the object's spectral signature was identical to that of the Sun.</p>
<p>At this time, another set of important data was in the process of being uncovered. Parallel to initial surgery, Foundation space monitoring facilities had recorded the manifestation and demanifestation of a very small metallic object just within the boundary of Mercury's orbit. The significance of this detection was initially missed, and the discovery given its own status as a minor anomaly. An analysis crawler deep-dive of Foundation databases later flagged this event as having happened at the same time SCP-7090 was being surgically examined. It was then discovered that the manifestation and demanifestation of the object corresponded exactly with the insertion and retraction of the endoscope within SCP-7090's skull.</p>
<p>Multiple experiments were subsequently authorized to investigate SCP-7090 further. A summary of some significant results can be found below.</p>

<p>This was the final experiment in the EXP-7090-06 series. This series yielded two major results:</p>
<p>1.) Objects inserted into SCP-7090's skull emerge at their correct size relative to the inner Solar System, rather than the much larger size expected if they were scaled relative to SCP-7090's skull.<br/>
2.) Emergence location of said objects maps to the theoretical center of their insertion point.</p>

Toward the end of the initial experiment battery, Dr Alexandrinia Zheng - a specialist on anomalous spacetime phenomena - was solicited for assistance with interpreting the results. To this end, an interview was scheduled with Dr Zheng, SCP-7090, and SCP-7090 lead investigator Dr Treasure Aluko.</p>

<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> Okay, Dania. This is my colleague, Dr. Zheng.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> SCP-7090. Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Oh, my name's Dania.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> This is an official interdepartmental record. I'm afraid I have to refer to you by your ID number.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Ah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> I mean no personal offense. It's simply a requirement of our procedures.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> I understand, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Thank you. So, we understand a lot more about you than when you first came here. One recent experiment series has been particularly revealing. You may recall that Dr. Aluko recently put a large number of probes into your head.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> No offense, but that's, like, every other experiment <em>(laughs)</em>. I'm not even awake for most of them.</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> This would be Series Six.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Yes, thank you, Series Six. The surgeons made a lot of small probe entries into your skull to confirm a theory we have about your brain.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-72784-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-72784-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Oh. Okay. What's the theory?</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> That it isn't actually there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Haha!</p>
<p><em>(A pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Wait. Are you… are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> We are completely serious. Your brain, if you even have one, is imperceptible to us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> I see. Um, okay. So… I don't even have a brain?</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> We may just never be able to detect it. Or it may be somewhere outside your skull. We're not sure yet.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Exactly. SCP-7090, d—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> <em>(interrupting)</em> How's that even poss—</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Do you have any knowledge that might be relevant here?</p>
<p><em>(short pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Um… are you asking me if I know where my <em>brain</em> is at?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Essentially, yes. That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Um, well… I guess, no. No. Until I wound up in this place, I just thought it was in my head like, you know… like everyone else.</p>
<p><em>(short pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> I'm never getting out of here, am I?</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> Oh, I w—</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> <em>(simultaneously)</em> Unlikely, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><em>(short pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> Or, at least, not for a long time. Your situation is very… unusual, and we have to keep the safety of the public in mind. You have what appears to be a radiation source within your skull.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-72784-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-72784-5')">5</a></sup> That could be dangerous, for you and everyone around you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><em>(short pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Honestly, I'm kind of okay with it.</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> Well, I'm glad to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> As am I. Though, frankly, also surprised.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> Well, I mean, as soon as I found out my head was all weird, I had a feeling this was, like… that secret government department that covers up all that kinda stuff. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> We, uh…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> It's alright, I know you're probably not allowed to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> We operate under a strict need-to-know basis. That's all I can tell you at this time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> But… honestly, though? I wasn't doing so good before you guys found me. I was kinda… between homes, I guess. I got in some trouble with my family a year-something ago and… and I wasn't really hanging out with the best people, and I mean…</p>
<p><em>(short pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7090:</strong> I mean, I get a bed here. I get a roof here. I get food here, you know? You guys look after me pretty good. You even leave me alone, most of the time.</p>
<p><em>(longer pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>ALUKO:</strong> Dania, we, um…</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG:</strong> I think that's everything we have for you today, SCP-7090. Thank you.</p>
