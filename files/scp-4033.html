            <h1>SCP-4033</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4033</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4033 is currently held at Site-██ in a padlocked glass container. When handling the object, 0.5 centimetre rubber gloves are to be worn at all times. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">No direct contact with SCP-4033 is permitted unless conducting a test.</span> No more tests including SCP-4033 are to be conducted under order from the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4033 is a Cadbury's Crème Egg that cannot be cracked, melted, eaten or damaged in any other way. If a subject touches SCP-4033 through skin contact, the subject will hear a voice. No others have reported hearing the voice, hereby referred to as SCP-4033-1.</p>
<p>SCP-4033-1 has been reported to have a noticeable lisp and resembles a child's TV show mascot. When activated, SCP-4033-1 will say: '<em>Hooray! You want to join in my Easter Egg hunt! I see you've found the first one already, so hurry on! Time is of the essence!</em>'</p>
<p>A painted egg will then appear somewhere in a ten-metre radius of the subject, often found in simple hiding places, such as on a shelf, or behind another object. If a subject collects this egg, another egg (hereby referred to as instances of SCP-4033-2) will appear under the same conditions of the first. If a subject other than the one that initiated the "hunt" touches an instance of SCP-4033-2 or SCP-4033 itself, it will burn their fingers, causing them to instinctively drop it. SCP-4033-1 will then say: '<em>No! You're not part of this hunt! Put that down!</em>'</p>
<p>There are twelve instances of SCP-4033-2 in one "hunt", and subjects are allocated ten minutes to collect all of these instances in order to "win". When the "hunt" is over, all collected instances of SCP-4033-2 will spontaneously disappear.</p>
<p>If the subject "wins" , SCP-4033-1 will say: '<em>Yay! Yay! Yay! You found them all! That means you get the GRAND PRIZE!</em>' The "winning" subject will then fall unconscious. Medical examination of these subjects reveals that their stomachs are anomalously filled with a substance very similar to Cadbury's chocolate. While all winners have become severely ill and reported extreme pain, none have died.</p>
<p>If the subject "loses", SCP-4033-1 will say: '<em>Oh no… You didn't get all the eggs. Oh well, don't worry! You get the runner-up prize!</em>' The subject will then undergo severe brain trauma and physical distress, while still remaining conscious. They will retain basic motor functions and the ability to vocalise, but will die approximately 2 minutes later. Autopsies have revealed these subjects to have a [DATA EXPUNGED] in their brains.</p>
<p>Only one full interview has been successfully carried out with SCP-4033-1; following Incident-4033-A, no more interviews are to be conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Local Agents situated in ██████, █████ were alerted to 3 mortalities in ██████ Hospital, all dead were found to have [EXPUNGED] in their brains. SCP-4033 was found in the house of a local artist, who was found in extreme distress. They were later found to have a substance resembling chocolate in their stomach. Agent ███ touched SCP-4033 and successfully completed the "hunt". Foundation backup arrived on scene and retrieved the Agents and SCP-4033.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4033-A:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4033-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> D-89667</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> D-89667 was ordered to memorise a list of three questions to ask SCP-4033-1.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>D-89667 picks up SCP-4033 with his bare hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> <em>Hooray! You want to join in my Easter Egg hunt! I see you've found the first one already, so hurry on! Time is of the essence!</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> All right. What's your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> <em>Wh-what? That's not important now, you've gotta find the eggs!</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> No, I need to know. Seriously, what's your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> <em>My name? Well, you already know! I'm the Easter Bunny!</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> No, your <em>real</em> name. Like, Bob or something.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> <em>Easter bunny. That… is… my real… name. Right? Yeah… Yeah…</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> Okay, I'll come back to that. What was the second question… Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> <em>Where am I? Why, I'm right behind… you.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4033-1's voice becomes noticeably gruffer, its lisp is gone.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> Hey, where the hell am I?</p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> Yeah, that's what <em>I</em> want to know!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> It-it was you. You did this to me. I <em>know it.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> Hey, no, I didn't do it!</p>
<p><em>D-89667 starts to visibly panic.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> I know you did…</p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> No! No! I know what happens to fucking D-class like me! <em>Don't kill me!</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> You… did it.</p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> No! I didn't! Don't do it! <em>Please!</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> Get the eggs. That's what you do. You bastard…</p>
<p><strong>D-89667:</strong> Okay! Yes! Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> Why… I'm Easter… Hop, hop, hop.</p>
<p><em>D-89667 collects all instances of SCP-4033-2 and subsequently falls unconscious.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> D-89667 was later reprimanded for failure to carry out his orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Incident 4033-A:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4033-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> D-89668</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Shortly after the initial interview, an attempt to further establish the origins of SCP-4033-1 and its physical state was made. D-89668 was ordered to memorise a list of three questions to ask it.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin log&gt;</strong><br/>
<em>D-89668 picks up SCP-4033 with his bare hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> No…</p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> No… I have no name.</p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> Just tell me your name. I know you have one. Please make this easy for me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> You took it from me… and put me here.</p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> Well, no I didn't, but on that note, where are you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> Put me here and left me.</p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> Wait, what did you say? "Put me and left"?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> Are you still there?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4033-1 does not respond for a further minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> Hello? SCP-4033-1?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4033-1:</strong> You want to know? The truth is, I don't know… I'm the Easter Bunny… I got nowhere to hop to.</p>
<p><strong>D-89668:</strong> You don't-</p>
<p><em>The allocated ten minutes to complete the "hunt" expires, and D-89668 falls to the floor in extreme distress. Agents watching over the test drag him away.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> D-89668 died two minutes after. An autopsy on him revealed that he had a [EXPUNGED] in his brain.</p>
