<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9119 is to be contained at Site-47 in a standard Foundation ant farm and provided with adequate sustenance for maintaining functionality.<br/>
Per Site-47 standard containment procedures, testing on SCP-9119 is suspended until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9119 is an anomalous population of <em>Formica polyctena</em>, colloquially known as wood ants. Members of SCP-9119 display atypical behavior where various processes of the colony are used in unproductive or actively detrimental ways. This includes the creation of unnecessary rooms within the colony, the storage of small amounts of food, eggs, and detritus within those rooms, and hyper-aggression toward ants not part of SCP-9119.<br/>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name’s William, but I go by Bill, and I am your new research lead!<br/>
A little bit about myself:<br/>
I was born in Illinois, but I love to travel! I especially like hiking mountains. I actually just got back from a trip in the Rockies!<br/>
I also love ants! Of course, I appreciate all kinds of insects, but there’s something about the way ants work together that I find really cute, almost inspiring.<br/>
With that in mind, I plan to open up SCP-9119 for testing once again. I think there’s still a lot of avenues to explore, and I’m excited to brainstorm new experiments to run with all of you!<br/>
Also, sidenote: I’ve noticed our lab is kind of messy. I know Doctor McShane’s departure was sudden, and that can make things kind of difficult, but I’d love to get things a bit neater. I’ve attached a couple ideas of how we can reorganize.</p>

<p>Hello, Bill,</p>
<p>I appreciate you including me on the email. It’s great to see you off to a good start with the entomology department.<br/>
However, I regret to inform you that testing on SCP-9119 was suspended in accordance with the site’s standard containment procedures and cannot be re-opened without a pressing need for further testing. If you want to learn more, you can find the relevant sections here: <a href="javascript:;">handbook chapter 3</a><br/>
I’d recommend you focus on other SCPs. After losing Brigid, the department should take things slow.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> First week wrap-up!</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hey, everyone!</p>
<p>First off, it’s been a phenomenal first week. Meeting all of you and seeing the work you’re doing has been awesome!<br/>
I want to go over a couple of things, real quick.<br/>
First off, has anyone kept in contact with Brigid? I want to ask her about some missing notes, but I can’t find anything about where she transferred.<br/>
If anyone has her new email address, that would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
Next, I understand things have been rough, and it can be hard getting used to changes in the system, but we need to keep the lab cleaner. We will be handling dangerous insects and hazardous materials, and we can’t do that safely if I have to clear away a cup of pencils or clean up someone’s sticky notes every time I need a table.<br/>
I’m more than happy to discuss changes to the system if you’re not happy with it. My door’s always open!</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Brigid McShane</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hello, Bill,</p>
<p>Some of the questions you have been asking made me realize you weren’t fully briefed on your predecessor's departure.<br/>
You seem to be under the impression Brigid is at another site. This is not the case.<br/>
Brigid did not transfer. She was exposed to a viral cognitohazard. When this was discovered, she self-terminated in accordance with our standard containment procedures.<br/>
The reason you cannot find her notes is because they are in quarantine being evaluated for more cognitohazards.<br/>
I understand this is a lot to take in, and you may be feeling confused, but I trust you will keep this to yourself. As you know, the protocols for losing a researcher recommend discretion, especially when it was self-inflicted.<br/>
The protocols also suggest avoiding starting new projects until everyone has had a chance to recover. With this in mind, I would strongly encourage you to discontinue your efforts to re-open SCP-9119.<br/>
Here’s a link to the handbook, so you can familiarize yourself with the guidelines: <a href="javascript:;">handbook chapter 7</a></p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Concerns</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Since I took over as head researcher of the entomology lab, I’ve observed several events that lead me to believe there is a conspiracy around SCP-9119 and the death of the previous head, Brigid McShane.<br/>
To start with, I was not told Brigid had killed herself until a week after I transferred.<br/>
I only learned this because when I attempted to access her research notes, I found everything on SCP-9119 was missing, supposedly for “informational quarantine” on the orders of Director James.<br/>
Director James has also blocked my attempts to re-open research into SCP-9119, giving no reason beyond “standard containment procedures”.<br/>
And while I don’t want to jump to conclusions, I think the staff of the lab might be intentionally sabotaging my efforts to improve our operating efficiency. This could be an attempt to keep me too busy to look into Brigid or SCP-9119.<br/>
I hope this is enough to show there’s something worth the Ethics Committee's attention. If you agree, I would love to meet with you and figure out where we can go from here.</p>

<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: Oh, you’re the Ethics Committee liaison!</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: I am, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: Amazing! What’s the next step? Do I need to find more evidence, or can we start a case now?</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: Neither. I will not be initiating an investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><em>Clarke sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: I understand you’re new here, but please try to understand. At Site-47, we take our procedures seriously. Everything Director James has done is completely within his power as site director.</p>
<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: Yeah, technically. But he's clearly covering something up. I can’t even access SCP-9119 without a waiver from the director!</p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: The director has the express authority to limit access to certain SCPs-</p>
<p><em>Rodriguez interrupts, clearly agitated.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: Why? Why does SCP-9119 need to be locked up? Why is it so important those ants can build their piles without interference? Why…</p>
<p><em>Rodriguez trails off as Director James enters with two members of site security.</em></p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I told you he wouldn’t cooperate. We need to take action before it gets worse.</p>
<p><em>Clarke nods and steps back. James steps forward and clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Let the record show William Rodriguez is under the effects of a dangerous cognitohazard threatening the operations of this site. Security, please escort him out before he can cause more chaos.</p>
<p><em>Rodriguez backs away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rodriguez</strong>: No. No. This is what happened to Brigid, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: We don't have time for this. Remove him.</p>
<p><em>After a short struggle, Rodriguez is taken into custody and taken to Site-47’s humanoid containment area.</em></p>
<p><em>Several cups were knocked to the floor during the struggle. James and Clarke begin placing them back on the table, carefully putting the correct number of pencils in each one.</em></p>
<p><strong>Clarke</strong>: So clumsy.</p>
