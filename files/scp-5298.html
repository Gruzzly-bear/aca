            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item#:</strong> SCP-5298</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keter</span> Argus</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As per Settlement-841-M reached with the <a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/three-moons-initiative-hub">Three Moons Initiative</a> on 11/14/20, direct containment of any instance of SCP-5298 is not to take place under any circumstances. Containment, and/or the acquisition of additional information regarding locations or the exact number of extant SCP-5298 instances, would constitute a breach of this agreement, and carry the risk of a ÞK-class Extradimensional Diplomatic Breakdown scenario.</p>
<p>As such, this document contains the maximum amount of information regarding SCP-5298 that the Foundation is permitted to access. Unless emergency authorization has been given by the O5 Council, this document is to not be altered in any form.</p>
<p>In addition, efforts to obfuscate SCP-5298's existence from the public are to be handled exclusively by the Three Moons Initiative, without any further interference from the Foundation.</p>
<p>Should SCP-5298's existence come into public knowledge through second- or third-party error, Settlement-841-M is rendered void, SCP-5298 will be reclassified as Keter, and the encrypted prior iteration of this document will be restored.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5298 is a remote-controlled military drone used by the Three Moons Initiative. An estimated ███ SCP-5298 instances are currently operational. The full scope of their combat capabilities are not completely understood, but include 5.7x28mm machine guns (hidden in forearms), finger-mounted electroshock weapons (hidden in fingernails), and neurotoxin-injecting barbs (hidden in teeth).</p>
<p>Each individual SCP-5298 takes the appearance of a child between 5 and 13 years of age, and maintains an individual assumed identity. As such, each drone uses civilian property purchased by Three Moons agents as a staging area, staging up to three instances at a time, and handled by one man and one woman to act as "parents". Said handlers are willing participants, designated "pre-mortem undercover contractors" by the Initiative, and have experience in such fields as robotics, military technology, and method acting.</p>
<p>SCP-5298 work undercover in private and public settings, engaging in as much aggressive and problematic behavior as possible. Conduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoplifting,</li>
<li>temper tantrums,</li>
<li>vandalism,</li>
<li>lying,</li>
<li>bullying of other children,</li>
<li>pulling fire alarms, and</li>
<li>destruction of property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to their destructive capabilities, SCP-5298 will avoid direct physical violence toward civilians and more serious criminal activity.</p>
<p>At nighttime, SCP-5298 engage in their true purpose. Further information about SCP-5298 (including the targets of their extermination efforts) have been restricted by Settlement-841-M.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Foundation agents placed a hidden camera in the bedroom of one SCP-5298 instance in suburban Philadelphia. The following footage was recovered, leading to Settlement-841-M:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/10/20<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 1:42 AM, EST</p>
<p>&lt;begin log&gt;</p>
<p>[SCP-5298-██ feigns sleep. A shadowy mass forms from under its bed, slowly rising]</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED:]</strong> (singing) <em>…nasty ickle Timmy-timms… …sittin' in ya jim-jams…</em></p>
<p>[SCP-5298-██ stirs.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> …I heard a rumor, y'see. You said you weren't afraid of [REDACTED]. And ya figured that meant you could be just as <em>naughty</em> as you pleased, izzat right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> Who's there?!</p>
<p>[A large, bloody potato sack materializes in [REDACTED]'s right hand; a meat hook appears in the other. He looms over SCP-5298-██]</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Don't you worry, Timmy-timms, I'll give you <em>exactly</em> what you deser—</p>
<p><em>(SCP-5298-██'s voice shifts to an adult male, over a speaker; its mouth does not move.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> Target acquired. Engaging.</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> …'scuse me?</p>
<p>[SCP-5298-██ grabs [REDACTED] and electrocutes them. [REDACTED] falls off the bed. The right forearm's machine gun barrel extends from SCP-5298-██'s palm and fires four shots into [REDACTED]'s torso.]</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> <em>Jesus fuck, what is WRONG with you?!</em></p>
<p>[Twelve more shots. Flashing from the barrel indicates that [REDACTED] has an insectoid appearance.]</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> …okay, for the record, this changes nothing. You're <em>still</em> a naught—</p>
<p>[SCP-5298-██ leaps from the bed and crushes [REDACTED]'s head, stomping apart the rest of its flesh.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> Target successfully eliminated; consciousness forwarded to Perdition Committee for interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-5298██2:</strong> <em>Timmy, I swear to God, if you're playing with actual guns in here —</em><br/>
<br/>
[PoI-5298██2, one of its handlers, enters the room and turns on the light. Blood, viscera, and chitin cover the floor.]</p>
<p><strong>PoI-5298██2:</strong> …oh, thank JALAKÅRA. Martha, they finally bagged one!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> <em>(indicating the hidden camera)</em> Mr. ██████, did you install that camera?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-5298██2:</strong> No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5298-██:</strong> Analyzing… Foundation property. Espionage is an act of war, and will be treated as such. We'll be in contact soon.</p>
<p>[SCP-5298-██ shoots the camera, and the feed is cut.]</p>
<p>&lt;end log&gt;</p>
