            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9018</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Containment Class:</strong> Thaumiel</span><br/>
<span style="font-size:100%;"><strong>Threat Class:</strong> Multiversal</span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span><br/>
Facility-0 was built for containment and protection of SCP-9018 from all known existential threats <em>(eschatological, paramilitary, transtemporal, ontokinetic, thaumaturgic, and pataphysical)</em>. Automated protocols were in place to deactivate the containment measures of SCP-9018 once the requirements for <strong>Protocol ONYX BALDUR</strong> were met.</p>
<p>The current status of SCP-9018 and Facility-0 is unknown.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Description:</strong></span><br/>
SCP-9018 refers to an entity originally created and maintained by the <strong>Department of Multiversal Defense</strong> of the True Foundation for the purposes of enacting Protocol ONYX BALDUR. The entity was an autonomous construct with the appearance of a baseline male human, capable of indefinite locomotion and function without additional energy inputs. This entity was the only instance of its kind in the known multiverse. Additionally, SCP-9018 was an <strong>Infinite Variance Sink</strong>, capable of <a href="/scp-7023">collapsing multiversal variants of any object into a single state</a>.</p>
<p>SCP-9018 was capable of speech and higher-level cognition as well as abstract thinking. It has been programmed to stay loyal to the True Foundation and its goals. It was intended to act as the primary method of carrying out Protocol ONYX BALDUR in case of a <strong>Ψ9K-Class "Stasis Continuance" Scenario</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Addendum 9018.1:</strong> Protocol ONYX BALDUR</span></p>
<p>The following document, alongside multiple recordings (see later Addendums) has been found during routine archival maintenance of Foundation servers. As of the current time, SCP-9018's existence is not confirmed in our reality, as it appears to have been created by a previous version of our reality's Foundation.</p>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>PROJECT PROPOSAL: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"ONYX BALDUR"</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Head Department: DoMD</strong></span><br/>
<span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Project Date: 29/02/2074</strong></span><br/>
<span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Proposal Statement:</strong></span><br/>
To create a sentient Infinite Variance Sink capable of abstract conceptual destruction in order to terminate leftover sentience in the local multiverse and accelerate the post-eschatological process, should a "Stasis Continuance" Scenario occur.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUESTED RESOURCES:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Access to information derived from <a href="/scp-3448">Project DAMMERUNG</a>.</li>
<li>Access to information derived from <a href="/project-palisade">Project PALLISADE</a>.</li>
<li>Access to all remaining information about GoI-X01 and <a href="/scp-7023">SCP-7023</a>.</li>
<li>Select specialists from the Departments of Miscommunications, Pataphysics, and Tactical Theology.</li>
<li>[<a href="/deleted">DELETED</a>]</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DETAILS:</span></span><br/>
Using the information from previous Foundation research projects, it should be theoretically feasible to create a conceptual being capable of delivering lethal damage to otherwise immortal or invincible sapient entities. This lethal attack would be delivered through a multiversal variant collapse, i.e., targeting a specific entity in the local multiversal cluster, then collapsing every multiversal variant of said entity into one. Through information gathered from the Rea-Utis per Eigenweapon, it should be possible to create another Infinite Variance Sink under Foundation control.</p>
<p>Combining certain semantic anomalies with data from theological and pataphysical structures, should allow this multiverse variant collapse property to be transferred into a human being.</p>
<p>The main concern of this project is the possible scenario in which the True Foundation fails to complete its indefinite mission, leading to the extinction of humanity, destruction of the planet, end of the universe, etc. If such an event were to occur, there are numerous projects and procedures in place that would ensure a return to the status quo via reality reconstruction, temporal anomalies, or otherwise. There is, however, no mechanism in place that would ensure the newly recreated world would be exactly the same as the previous one.</p>
<p>Forces outside of Foundation control may interfere with this process without our knowledge, unless they are eradicated first. These entities may also attempt to hinder the True Foundation's attempts at restoring the world to a previous state and may render Foundation assets incapable of performing their duties. This would constitute a Ψ9K-Class "Stasis Continuance" Scenario.</p>
<p>This project proposes the creation of a loyal agent capable of terminating any leftover sentience in the local multiverse, should such a scenario occur. In order to ensure a smoother transition into a previous state of reality, this agent would then also ensure the completion of Foundation renewal protocols as necessary.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>STATUS:</strong></span><br/>
<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="color: #004d13"><strong>APPROVED BY THE TRUE COUNCIL</strong></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Addendum 9018.2:</strong> Archival recordings</span></p>
<p>These documents, as well as the following recordings, were discovered during archival maintenance and shortly after made their way to the O5 Council via a direct line from RAISA. The following information has been reconstructed based on the evidence found within the files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 04/12/4152, in a previous iteration of our reality, an XK-Class "End of the World" Scenario occured, causing a massive and irreparable damage to the planet and/or reality as a whole. The origin of this destruction is unknown. 99.9% of True Foundation personnel and assets were lost during the event, causing Protocol ONYX BALDUR to automatically begin an activation cycle.</p>
<p>Defense mechanisms surrounding SCP-9018 at Facility-0 have been disengaged and the containment cell successfuly entered local reality. SCP-9018 was inserted into baseline reality near Antarctica, where its first identified target was located.</p>
<p>Following record is a transcript from SCP-9018's body camera, which was presumably recorded for the purposes of informing future Foundation administrators. This record shows signs of being tampered with by an unknown party as only a select handful of recordings remain from a seemingly larger amount.</p>

<p><em>[The camera feed opens on a dark room, the interior of Facility-0. The Agent moves forward, as his quiet steps echo throughout the otherwise empty building. The Agent's camera approaches the glowing panel in front of the exit. Touching it, the large containment doors of the chamber start turning and opening.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Upon exiting from the facility, the camera view is struck by intense bright light from the outside. The camera lens takes a few seconds to adjust. A wide, discolored and empty desert stretches in all directions around the camera. Upon further inspection, the material seems to be snow. Upon turning around, the exterior of Facility-0 is missing, as the building once again engaged its protective procedures.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Hello, stranger.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[The camera makes a sharp turn to the right, where a feminine humanoid is standing, dressed entirely in dark cloth and wraps except for its face. It appears to be human, with dark eyes and an olive skin tone. The Agent assumes a defensive posture in response.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Wow. No need to resort to violence. You wouldn't kill someone you just met, would you?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">You are… not what I expected. Identify yourself.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">I— I don't think I remember my name. Call me a… <em>Lone Wanderer</em>. That's a cool name, I think.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">You… think?</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">It's a fascinating mystery, really. My name. Want to help me find out?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">I have a mission.</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[The Agent turns to walk away in the southern direction but is stopped by the feminine figure identifying as a Wanderer.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Oh and can I help you with that?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">… Who are you? Everyone here should be dead.</span></strong></p>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Sounds like a noble mission.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[The Agent shruggs.]</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">I suppose.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">How are you going to pull that off?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">By getting rid of things that stand in the way of the reset.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">And… would you like some company?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">Who are you really?</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[The Wanderer moves non-threateningly and makes a few steps across the snow away from the Agent, crossing their arms on their chest.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">I told you. I don't know. Call me anything you like. What is your name?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[The Agent stays silent, seemingly contemplating the situation.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Look, I promise not to get in your way. I just— don't want to be alone again.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">You are not afraid of me.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Are you dangerous?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">…I don't have a name. It's better that way. Names have power.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">I guess we're both just wanderers, then. At least you're interesting.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[The Agent begins to walk away, but as he does so, the steps of another person are heard behind him.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">So, where are we going?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">…South. The first of my targets resides there. Should be one of the easiest to take care off… just let me do all the talking.</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[The two continue to walk up towards a snow dune, as the sound of heavy wind approaches. They climb up the hillside for a few minutes. Once the small peak is behind them, a vast snowy plane appears before them, hidden in thick fog. Distant tall rectangular shapes stand out of the fog; their real scale is impossible to ascertain from the footage. These structures are arranged in perfect rows and show slight signs of deterioration.]</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">Should be here somewhere. Stay behind me, and under any circumstances do not speak to it. This one is probably the most dangerous of them all if we aren't careful.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Who is it?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[Suddenly, the sound of the wind disappears and is replaced by absolute silence. The Agent takes his left index finger and puts it in front of his mouth to gesture silence. As he does so, the fog previously contained in the valley before them spreads out, enveloping the nearby hills and climbing up to the dune, where they are standing. For a few moments, the distant fog reveals the remaining ruins of a great city. Towering skyscrapers can be seen in large rows all the way to the horizon, many half crumbled and deteriorating.]</em></p>
<p><em>[As the fog envelops the camera view, all that is visible are the Agent and their companion. A childish voice is suddenly heard from the right, prompting both of them to turn in that direction.]</em></p>

<p><strong><tt>Mom? Dad?</tt></strong></p>

<p><strong><tt>Long. Where are my parents? Who are you?</tt></strong></p>

<p>Following the first entry, SCP-9018 ventured north, towards the former area of Yellowstone. The journey north took several months, and it is unknown if SCP-9018 made any contact with other entities during this time. The second target was located in a massive underground geothermal cavern, and just like the first recording, this one also features the entity identified as "The Wanderer".</p>

<p><em>[The recording picks up with the Agent descending down a massive opening into the earth. A large cavern in front of him is barely illuminated by the flashlight on his person, and as he walks in, the light seemingly grows weaker. The entrance is coated in a heavy tint of yellow and orange fumes, as toxic gases fill the cavern below. The Agent is not hindered by this and continues his descent down a tilted slope. The craggy cavern floor is often too steep to be used on the way down, causing the Agent to look for another way. The whole process of getting down to the main cavern takes him over an hour and a half.]</em></p>
<p><em>[During the journey, only natural cavern sounds, such as leaking gas and deep rumbling in the earth, can be heard. The Agent doesn't pay any attention to these as he continues down. Once the ground is more even and the ceiling retreats, the cave opens up into a massive underground chamber, only slightly illuminated by hot igneous rock and glowing gas.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Slight movement on the right is detected, as a few rocks fall down the edge of a cliff. The agent approaches that direction and in a few minutes begins to hear voices coming from somewhere deeper in the cave. One voice was harsh and inhuman, almost booming across the cavern. The other belongs to the female from Recording 001.]</em></p>

<p><em>[As the next chamber expands, bubbling hot lakes of mineral water appear to illuminate the cavern partially, but most of the space is shrouded in darkness. Before going further, the Agent is stopped by the presence of a female human, seemingly hiding behind a rocky outcrop. The Wanderer shouts across the room.]</em></p>

Its head is prolonged with many teeth in three rows. On the top of its head are six eyes, looking in every direction in search of prey. The skin on its neck is armored and glowing, as if something hot were underneath. The creature spits out more molten rock on the ground as it speaks in a deep, non-human voice.]</em></p>

<p><em>[A deep laughing gurgle comes from the creature, and the Wanderer looks towards the Agent, who produces a cylindrical-shaped container, spinning it around once and taking out a long pointed spear that doesn't look like it should fit inside the much smaller space. It is a durable metal rod with an ornate knife at the tip. The Wanderer looks confused.]</em></p>

<p><em>[SCP-682's claws swing in the direction of the Agent, who steps aside in a perfectly calculated manner, dodging its blows and striking back with the spear. In three seconds the fight ends, as the spear is thrown out of the Agents hand and embeds itself in 682's skull, causing a massive explosion that shakes the cavern. The creature shrieks and convulses, its body almost pulsating in a rapid motion. The Agent doesn't wait for its death, nor does he take the spear back. As the creature slowly dies, he walks back towards the way he came in and starts slowly climbing up the cavern again.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The ground shakes, and a bit of rock slips from under the Agent's legs, causing him to fall briefly before being caught by the Wanderer, who outstretches her arm and pulls him up. The pair share a moment of acknowledgement before continuing their ascent from the depths of the earth.]</em></p>
<p><em>[After a few minutes, they enter back into a previous cavern, and the dying screams of SCP-682, as well as the tremors, while not weaker, grow more distant.]</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Heh, oh, you really think I lied… Well, I don't know. But I'm starting to think that just like you, I am a fragment of something bigger. I'm obviously not a mere human, but… I did say my identity was a fascinating mystery.</span></strong></p>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">I don't know what you want me to say. I'm not unlike you, but I am not you. All I know is that we were made for this. To wander the world after the story is over. To pick up the pieces or maybe to grind the narrative to a fine dust. I don't know our purpose. I just… can't help but be critical of your methods.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">… I- wasn't always like this. I remember only bits of the person I used to be before they hollowed me out and made me into this- this—</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Grim Reaper?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">Sure. But that makes it sound like I didn't want that… I did.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Why would anyone want this? You're not saving anyone's life. You're not taking revenge or doing anything that would amount to something real. Everyone's story is already over. It's been over for a long time.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">I guess that's not how I saw it. Or how they saw it. They gave me a purpose, and maybe that's all I ever wanted. Like you, I cannot remember that time before I was like this.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Of all the Foundation variants, the True Foundation of this universe were certainly the most arrogant and maniacal. They didn't just think they could play god… they embodied that role with extra effort.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">How do you know that? What do you know about other Foundations in other worlds?</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">I— just know that this Foundation was… crazy? Most Foundations are… control freaks, for lack of a better term. But they have limits. People who keep an eye on them, morals that hold them at bay, and events that shape their actions. Usually, common good is their goal, even if their methods can be evil. This one though… The True Foundation went out of their way to isolate their little corner of the multiverse, to create a sea of sand that would serve as their playground. They raised worlds, and they shaped minds, did all they could to bring forth their paradise. And You are living proof of that.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">You don't approve of it all. I get that. But it was all for something. For a secure and protected life.</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Why am I trying?… How could you ever understand? You are a living killing machine that only exists to finish off the few things that could threaten their paradise. They made you just to make sure that nothing ever changes for them. That they always land on top. No matter what world they find themselves in, you'll be there to ensure that state. You and your <em>True</em> Foundation are—</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">Stagnation?</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">…I was going say severance. Isolation. But yes. Stagnation fits you better.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">So what is your role in this? Are you here to stop me or just try and talk me out of this?</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">…It frustrates me to no end that I have no answer for that question.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">In that case… the next target is in the Middle East. Will you join me on the route, or should I expect you to show up unannounced again?</span></strong></p>

Perfectionism is a disease, they say, and the True Foundation was obsessed with control over every miniscule little detail. This is what made them unique, as everything in the multiverse is. They lacked the understanding that some things will always be outside of their control. Even their death and the end of the world would never stop them from achieving their goals.</span></strong></p>

<p>The last entry included in the tape is recording number 794, which takes place almost 30 years after the last included entry. SCP-9018 appears to have been eliminating targets one by one during this elapsed time, until this recording. Based on the information from this record, it is safe to assume that SCP-9018 was more than successful in his mission. The entry starts once the camera is already inside of the facility.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>[As the recording starts, the Agent is climbing down a ladder inside of a dark room. He doesn't seem to be any different from the last recorded entry. The video follows him for several minutes as he climbs down and later walks through a long, narrow hallway of a Foundation facility. The Agent approaches another ladder and descends it for several minutes onto another floor. The interior of the facility seems to be massive in scale.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Eventually, he reaches a floor, which seems to be at the bottom of the facility. The massive chamber in front of him is lined with rows of dark glass containers, and there is an ever-present low hum of energy. The Agent continues deeper into the building, down a few more corridors, until he finally stops in front of an old, unremarkable metal door. There is an old plaque next to the door, but its contents are unreadable from the video.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The Agent reaches for the door handle but stops as the door is opened from the other side and swung wide open. On the other side is the Wanderer, standing with her hands crossed over her chest.]</em></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">…Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting for you to show up?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>[She steps aside and lets the Agent into the room, which is a small unfurnished square chamber. In the middle of this chamber is a pedestal with a pitch-black cube on it.]</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">What kept you?</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">I had work to do.</span></strong></p>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Some were… Anyway, I got bored waiting for you, so I explored this building. Impressive technology. The Foundation has really outdone themselves with it when they built it. And yet it all pales in comparison to this tiny cube that they found.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #260038">Are you here to stop me?</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">No. I'm here to see what you do. I never wanted to stop you. I'm not even from here. It's your reality, your universe… Your choice.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">This isn't about anyone else. There are only two people in this whole universe capable of perceiving this thing now.

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">Maybe I am. Maybe I'm a part of the Library itself, and maybe I'm just a messenger. Maybe I'm not supposed to know, and maybe that's the beauty. You can't know everything. You can't control everything.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #782210">It's okay. Normally, <a href="/scp-6000">the Library takes care of things at the end</a>… but this world refused that. The Foundation here took it upon themselves to maintain the status quo forever.</span></strong></p>
