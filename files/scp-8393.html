            <h1>SCP-8393</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8393</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8393 are each to be contained at Bio-Site 66, following mortuary-type containment protocols.</p>
<p>Every 40 hours, a pneumatic piston-driven iron spike is to be put through each entity’s skull, heart, and pancreas. If this is not possible, .45 or higher calibre delivered at a range of no less than 3 metres and no more than 4 metres to these points are acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8393 is collectively three humanoid corpses, appearing to be in their late 20s to early 30s. The bodies lack any evidence of blood despite containing a circulatory system, which lends to a blue-pallid complexion; additionally, the structure of each eyeball is completely dominated by an excessively large pupil and vertical pink iris. Dissection reveals that anatomy is otherwise indistinguishable from an ordinary human; DNA analysis asserts the entities are partly but not entirely human.</p>
<p>Each SCP-8393 individual will reanimate exactly 216 hours from the previous point of death. Between mortality and reanimation, each body will gradually repair itself to a manageable level of function. This recovery process will continue beyond reanimation and subsequent repeated expiration.</p>
<p>SCP-8393 was encountered by Site-66 Researcher Seidelman while on personal leave within a civilian-dominated location in the American state of Massachusetts. The entities killed multiple persons before being slain by the researcher and several locals working in unison. See below for the researcher’s personal notes taken during the event.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Below is a direct transcription of handwritten notes kept by Researcher Derek Seidelman during the recovery of SCP-8393. Mr Seidelman believed himself to be in peril for multiple hours, and so kept running commentary of the matter in the event that a containment team would later find his experiences useful.</p>
<p>The contents of Mr Seidelman's notes have been transcribed as accurately as possible, including grammatical errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Journal</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Testmen</span> Testament kept by Derek Seidelman, in [REDACTED], Mass. on May 31 2023. Multiple humanoid entities have appeared around 530 or 6 in the afternoon and already killed at least two locals. Keeping notes in case it’s useful later.</p>
<p>6:34 — think there’s three of them. They look like college kids. Black holes for eyes and paper skin. The blond one’s been watching from under the Pine and Washington crossway light. In the church in case it’s demonic. Henry Em Kate Olivia Jacob Elias Noah Abbi with me.</p>
<p>712 — girl monster knocking on the door asking to be let in. not demonic. holy water rosary bible hymnal censer nix. barred door. No signal, possible electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p>7:29 — henry missing</p>
<p>45 — knocking on door to rectory. Three knocks then three knocks. Em is trying to get Olivia to stop crying. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">paying</span> praying isn’t working, not religious. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENTITIES NOT RELIGIOUS</span></p>

<p>They got Katie. We think they took her to the lake. They left all the blood and her shoes on the windowsill. 857pm</p>
<p>9:30: (different handwriting, reading ‘BAD NIGHT’ in pencil rather than pen. Appears to be the incorrect time, assuming Seidelman’s other notes are accurate.)</p>
<p>913 — Noah found one of Elias’ guns and went after them. Violence. Lights out on the street went out. Almost shot me when I tried to stop him. I think I’ve seen this movie.</p>
<p>957 — 20ish mins ago Jake broke a window, let the girl in. Elias had a 30.06, three in the chest one in the head. Body still twitching, we shoved it downstairs and locked the door. Jake bitten multiple times and prob collarbone broken. Given first aid, quarantined, begged to be tied up, opted to be crammed in dog crate in kitchen. poor kid.</p>
<p>1012— Jake appears still lucid. Blonde one watching from street. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dog missing</span> dog [unintelligible]</p>
<p>1033 — Jake appears to be still human. Elias is a hunter, myself Noah and Em are armed. Olivia’s hiding in a closet. Dogs keeping her company.</p>
<p>11 — fire moving</p>

<p>1130 — Heard a scream, likely Olivia. Em is not well.</p>
<p>1152 — Jake passed out, can’t wake him up. Blood loss? Emily had us say a prayer.</p>
<p>12:11 — Discovered pickup crashed at cross between Riverway and Boulder St, Noah deceased in driver’s seat. Found the blonde entity pinned between the car and a tree, Emily put bullets in its head. No blood. 3 cartridges left. Noah likely died instantly.</p>
<p>12:30 — Lots of gunfire to the north, away from town. Towards lake. Likely Elias. Emily and I are following to try and meet up. Streetlights flickering. Street is empty.</p>
<p>1:03 — <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HAVE NOT</strong></span> found Olivia. Emily quiet but alert a little ahead of me.</p>
<p>1:43 — dog in tree</p>
<p>1:56 — Found Elias stuck to wire fence. Tall one near. Elias alive. broken hand. Staunched bleeding. UPDATE FOUND LEG NO BLOOD</p>
<p>2:10 — Tall one is prowling. The roadflares are keeping us safe. DISLIKE LIGHT</p>
