</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>ITEM #:</strong> SCP-8301</p>
<p><strong>OBJECT CLASS:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> Humanoid incarceration consistent with <em><a href="javascript:;">Standard Containment Practice-10/abxf8</a></em>. Subject maintained under strict psychological supervision following dysfunctional interpersonal volatility.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-8301 is a 24-year-old adult male identified as Adam Scherer, apprehended by Foundation operatives on May 14th, 2025, near an apartment complex in Woodstock, Vermont. SCP-8301 is equipped with a featureless prison uniform and numerous physical restraints. A 14kg metallic sphere—affixed by a chain—is fused to the subject’s left ankle and surrounding bone and nerve tissue. The object shows signs of prolonged wear inconsistent with SCP-8301’s age.</p>
<p>Penetrative scans of SCP-8301 indicate extensive physiological abnormalities. Foreign materials, including metal, cloth, and dense organic matter, have been precisely integrated into the subject's anatomy despite no apparent physical trauma, consistent with hybridized somatic fusion. This transformation appears to have been instantaneous and/or violent; cause and intent remain undetermined.</p>
<p>Malformed multipartite DNA documented in the subject's skeletal, nervous, and muscular systems. Current evidence does not correlate any changes to pre-existing medical conditions. Rather, input from SCP-8301 indicates that its metamorphosis likely manifested externally under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>Upon intake, SCP-8301 was unable to articulate any personal history preceding its discovery—a condition later confirmed as the resultant of ongoing acute retrograde amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM 8301.1:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> SCP-8301 was recovered at 03:00 LT after a reported explosion in a third-floor apartment located at 41 Arbitrage Lane. Subject was discovered 1.2 km from incident, catatonic and visibly distressed. Despite the partial embedding of penitentiary attire into its epidermal layer and external blood, SCP-8301 sustained no injuries.</p>
<p>Subject exited the apartment seconds after the explosion. Building exhibited catastrophic internal damage consistent with a thermic reaction. No accelerants, ignition sources, or explosive residues were identified. Biological fragments were recovered and secured as per standard protocol.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-8301 non-communicative upon retrieval. Attempted questioning resulted in unprovoked and dysregulated episode, ending with subject asking "did [anything] leave the room?"</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM 8301.2:</strong> Upon recovery of SCP-8301, a series of observations were conducted by acting Lead Researcher Alan Mabel to discern subject behavior. Documented reports highlight the following over 72 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject displays repeated aversion to direct leftward or rightward viewing. When prompted, it reported "difficulty" in selecting a single lateral direction.</li>
<li>During rest cycles, SCP-8301 routinely faces towards walls and corners. Surveillance records vocal stimming often repeating phrases such as "wait" and "not right now."</li>
<li>Subject’s left hand repeatedly flexes. Neurological scans confirm non-voluntary behavior.</li>
<li>SCP-8301 frequently complains about the restraints affixed to its body. Attempts to remove items induce nausea and annoyance. Minor floral aroma detected upon physical contact of inorganic material.</li>
<li>Subject exhibits elevated stress when exposed to recordings of soft vocal frequencies (0.8–1.2 kHz range). Peak reactions observed during playback of two unique voice samples.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rs. Mabel:</strong> That's the third time you've reached out like that. Why?</p>
<p><em>[Subject pauses, shifting uncomfortably. After several seconds, its fingers extend slightly into open air.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8301:</strong> I don't know. It felt like something was trying to grab me.</p>
<p><em>[Its hand lowers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8301:</strong> I wasn't sure if I was supposed to grab back.</p>
<p><strong><tt>[END LOG]</tt></strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forensic analysis of chain attached to subject's ankle revealed unidentifiable, foreign cartilage fragments. Onsite biologists later confirmed that the internal mass of SCP-8301's sphere is also distinctly organic, likely originating from a large transmutated osseous cavity unique from the cartilage.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8301:</strong> Them?</p>
<p><em>[No response. SCP-8301 turns away, twitching.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8301:</strong> She was drenched—sobbing. Wanting to know why. And I told her I needed something more…</p>
<p><em>[Subject exhales, grasping at restraints.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8301:</strong> Then it all just blew up.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCHER'S NOTE:</strong> DNA comparison confirms the remains integrated into SCP-8301’s sphere belonged to at least (1) identified human female. Subject had no initial reaction when informed of her identity.</p>
