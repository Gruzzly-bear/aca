<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-4276 collectively regards the following:</p>
<p>SCP-4276-B is a crucible basin with an upper diameter of 26.82m, weighing 42,000kg. At the base of its roof, SCP-4276-B descends into a void extending well beyond its outside parameters.</p>
<p>When matter comes into contact with a threshold of 1.07m inside the pit of SCP-4276-B, it will begin to rapidly deteriorate at varying speeds with no discerned pattern. Should the material be returned from this threshold prior to total annihilation, the process will cease and the subject will suffer all expected effects.</p>
<p>Currently, the deepest recorded depth of the interior of SCP-4276 is 800 meters before the applied recording hardware was rendered defunct.</p>
<p>SCP-4276-A can be observed within SCP-4276-B and in between engagements of protocol NULLARCH. As such, protocol NULLARCH has been devised to diminish SCP-4276-A's spread. There is no known method to extinguish SCP-4276-A.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-4276 was found following the complete destruction of the town of Oblation, North Carolina, USA. The population, prior to SCP-4276, was recorded at two-hundred and thirty-seven, all of which have been expunged from non-Foundation databases.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4276/Triple-Triple-Spiral-triskelion"><img alt="Triple-Triple-Spiral-triskelion" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-4276/Triple-Triple-Spiral-triskelion/medium.jpg"/></a>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Recreation of singular spiraling SCP-4276-A pattern.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-4276-B was located in what was formerly the center of the town, found overflowing with SCP-4276-A. No witnesses, files, or evidence of either the town of Oblation or SCP-4276 was found on the premises. Additionally, a difference in elevation had formed between the inside and outside of the premises of Oblation, forming a 46-meter deep crater around its edges and a 172-meter deep crater at its center. Spiraling patterns were carved into the crater ground, creating a network of the image on the right.</p>
<p>During initial containment efforts, the effects of SCP-4276-A caused extreme difficulty for Foundation personnel in reaching SCP-4276-B, resulting in the annihilation of fourteen agents and two researchers; the three survivors were later terminated.</p>
<p>After several days, a reliable method for reaching SCP-4276-B was discovered, and, once Foundation personnel could reach it, a draft for Protocol NULLARCH was devised by the former lead researcher at the time, Jameson Macrada. Revisions have since been made.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Friedenfänger König</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Lead Researcher Jameson Macrada</p>
<p><strong>Forward:</strong> Regarding Macrada's time with SCP-4276.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Begin Log]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Macrada, sir, I trust you've been notified of the purpose of this interview.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Let's begin, then. Mr. Macrada, if you could identify yourself for the audio recording.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Jameson Macrada, level-4 credentials, lead researcher for 4276.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> And, for how long have you served as the lead researcher for SCP-4276?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Since its discovery, the fourteenth of April, 1992.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> And what is the current date?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> The … sixth of May, I think?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Very well. Mr. Macrada, over the past few weeks, there have been multiple complaints regarding various minor things, but, before that, might we discuss Protocol "NULLARCH"?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> What would you like to know?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> How, precisely, were you able to come up with this Protocol? It seems, to me, antithetical, yet it works all the same.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Well, it was- it struck me, I suppose, how devilish it seemed to me at the time. This great, big geyser, spewing hateful black everywhere. You know how devoted I am.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> No, I don't, actually. How faithful would you say you are, Mr. Macrada?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Very, König my boy! Very much so! In the mornings I wake up and pray to little baby Jesus, and in the night I thank God for everything he's done for me.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Interesting, Mr. Macrada. But, and you just said it now, you said it seemed "devilish"? And, that didn't answer my question either, so I'll cut to the chase: Why did you decide to dump bodies into SCP-4276?</p>
<p><em>[O-Class begins slowly fidgeting its hand it a circular motion]</em></p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Well, you see …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> No, Mr. Macrada, I don't see. Could you enlighten us, please?</p>
<p><em>[König gestures to the audio recording device]</em></p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> It, uh, seemed right, you know? The right way to dispose of the bodies, and maybe even the anomaly itself. Quell down whatever was going on inside that thing so it doesn't affect us here on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> With human bodies? Sir, I would think that those would only serve as kindling.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> I figured that if we packed them tight enough, it would suffocate anything beneath.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Fascinating. And this has undoubtedly worked in our favor.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Well then, if you would be comfortable with changing back to the topic of the recent complaints?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> I would.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Very well. These reports claim that you have been acting rather strange as of late. They describe you as being too quick, volatile, jumpy. Some times when you nearly fell asleep during work.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> I've had a lot on my m-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> -And logs with the site psychiatrist state that you haven't been sleeping well, either. That you only get between two or three hours of sleep, if any at all.</p>
<p><em>[O-Class becomes silent]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Mr. Macrada, could you divulge what, precisely, has been plaguing you?</p>
<p><em>[O-Class remains silent]</em></p>
<p><em>[König pauses, staring at O-Class for several seconds. He breathes in and leans towards O-Class over the table, looking it directly in the eye]</em></p>
<p><em>[König is silent for several seconds]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Jameson, sir, have you been compromised?</p>
<p><em>[O-Class stops fidgeting, looks down, and silently nods its head]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> It, it whispers to me. That same thing, over and over in my mind. I can read it clearly when I close my eyes because it's burned into the darkness: "Chiral Hypocrisy". It tells me to give to it, to prepare things for it.</p>
<p>It won't stop either, it doesn't stop. I can feel it, now, shouting in sigils and grand, deep stretches of nothing that burn my heart and sear my flesh. It wants, it hates, it needs, it says. It's yelling at me, it's furious, demanding.</p>
<p>You must understand, everything I've done, everything that NULLARCH is, was me defying it, denying everything that it, that it silently screams in my nightmares.</p>
<p><em>[O-Class pauses, breathing in and out, letting its head rest on the table]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Mr. Macrada, our time is up. Thank you for participating in this interview.</p>
<p><em>[König gets up, adjusting his outfit, before walking to the doorway]</em></p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> Friedenfänger.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>O-Class:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Very.</p>
<p><em>[König leaves, and two guards walk in]</em></p>
<p><strong>Security Personnel:</strong> Place both your hands behind your head and stand up.</p>
<p><em>[Selected footage abruptly ends as security personnel approaches the O-Class. End log]</em></p>

<p>Following the removal of Jameson Macrada as lead researcher for SCP-4276, the position was transferred to Senior Researcher König for his experience and expertise. However, in light of the memetic influence displayed by SCP-4276, the site director of the facility SCP-4276 is housed in has decided to divide the role of lead researcher between two persons. Senior Researcher Wade Odenkirk has been selected for this role.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>[Senior Researcher Odenkirk is overlooking SCP-4276 from a catwalk as security personnel prepares for another test. König arrives from the left side, holding a clipboard and pen]</em></p>
<p><strong>Odenkirk:</strong> Sure took your time.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, they took some convincing.</p>
<p><strong>Odenkirk:</strong> So we're ready?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> I will give my greenlight if you'll give yours.</p>
<p><strong>Odenkirk:</strong> Alright. <em>[To security personnel below]</em> Bring him in.</p>
<p><em>[Two security personnel leave the room. They return two minutes later with the O-Class present]</em></p>

<p>On 4/8/1992, Senior Researcher Odenkirk temporarily left the facility SCP-4276 is currently housed in, in order to handle matters unrelated to SCP-4276. As research regarding SCP-4276 had stagnated, Odenkirk surmised that Senior Researcher König could handle all minor affairs regarding SCP-4276.</p>
<p>On 5/8/1992, the testing of thaumaturgic items and spells with SCP-4276 was authorized, a truncated list described below.</p>

<p><strong>König:</strong> Very well. Proceed.</p>

<p><strong>König:</strong> This is Senior Researcher Friedenfänger, recording the testing of SCP-4276 and The Avant-Garde Standard of Sorcery. Not the official script of it, but instead merely a reprint. Previous tests related to it have shown very intriguing results, and should this successfully negate the effects of SCP-4276-A, then the process of simply recreating the thaumic passages ingrained into it will prove fruitful.</p>
<p>And then, I may find one, or more, of my questions answered.</p>
<p>Junior Researcher Adams, are we ready to begin?</p>
<p><strong>14:33:</strong> <em>JR. Adams affirms him. König signals to proceed</em></p>
<p><strong>14:35:</strong> <em>The subject is brought to the harness above SCP-4276-B. The camera is turned to view the proceedings. JR. Adams looks to König for confirmation, and he once again signals to continue</em></p>

<p>Following the conclusion of one hundred and twenty tests utilizing thaumaturgic methods, persons, and items, SCP-4276's capacity for the complete annihilation of matter, regardless of any additional thaumaturgic characteristic, has been found to be absolute. Additionally, it seems that SCP-4276-A is similarly incapable of being manipulated through non or thaumaturgic methods. The only stimuli found to cause a change in its activity are O-Class personnel and their relative distance to SCP-4276-A.</p>
<p>Additional information on O-Class entities has also been found amidst a new series of tests, which has provided new insight for the continued secure containment of SCP-4276. O-Class entities will begin to develop symptoms after a period of one-two weeks of being located in the same facility that SCP-4276 is housed in. This occurs regardless of whether the O-Class has come into contact with SCP-4276.</p>
<p>The O-Class will then begin to develop inherently non-human characteristics, most pressingly, the capacity to internally interact with an unknown entity. More details, including detailed notes and descriptions by Senior Researcher König regarding notable traits seen in O-Class personnel and how to identify them, can be found <span style="color: red">here</span>.</p>
<p>Senior Researcher König has also begun another series of tests utilizing non-thaumic anomalous objects that have low value or possess properties of interest to the project, which is to begin on 14/9/1992.</p>
<p>Senior Researcher Carla Confer, previously of Area-55, has been chosen for filling the role of secondary lead researcher for SCP-4276. She arrived on 21/9/1992.</p>

<p><em>[Senior Researcher König is overlooking testing preparations from a top-level catwalk, occasionally taking notes. Senior Researcher Confer enters the chamber from the top floor entrance and walks towards him, clipboard in hand]</em></p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Hey, Doctor King!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> I do not have a doctorate to my name, and that name itself would be König.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Oh, sorry about that. It's just that we work with a lot of doctors, you know?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, Researcher Confer, I know.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Well, it's nice to meet you, … Researcher König, sir.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> We're both of equal rank, Researcher Confer.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Yeah. It's actually my first time acting as lead researcher. And I really wanna do a good job here, really, but there was something I wanted to talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> That being, Researcher Confer?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Well, I wanted to speak with you about these tests, as well as the many other tests you did before I got here.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> They served only to find that the answer to understanding this relic does not lie in magic. My interests, however, still burn the same.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> That's good, um, Researcher König. But the tests, I mean, even these ones, don't you think they're unethical?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> With all due respect, you've sent a number of people down in that pit.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> D-Class are expendable, dangerous criminals - each one a nuisance to society and a deranged delinquent - and we now know that the deeper sections of SCP-4276 deteriorate faster than higher. This will, perhaps, help should a more formidable need arise.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> O … kay. And what we're doing now - cross-testing has been discouraged in every site I've been to.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Such a preference is one that does not account for all situations. Wasn't your previous facility directed by an anomaly "<em>themself</em>"?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> We-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Researcher Confer, if you are bothered by what we are doing here, what kind of authority and responsibility stems from this position, then you are welcome to wait in your office until this is over.</p>

<p>On 06/10/1992, Junior Researcher Adams was interrogated on suspicion of O-Class infection by Senior Researcher Friedenfänger König. Shortly following the conclusion of the interview, O-11 was released by security personnel. The latest height of SCP-4276-A reached nine meters.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Internal log - König and Confer dialogue</span></p>
<p><em>[Log opens inside Senior Researcher König's office. König and Senior Researcher Confer are present]</em></p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Why, König?!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> The signs were all there. It clearly was no longer human and I could not have it bringing this to ruin.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> He was right. He was right - did you even <em>think</em> about an alternative?!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Indeed, I have. But what do you have in mind, <em>fraulein</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Amnestics, surgery, resorting to anomalous methods, anything to help these people instead of …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, Ms. Confer?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Instead of killing them!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> I have not killed anyone. I did not make that artefact, nor did I give it its potent capability. Instead, I have been given an enigma, one which we know painfully little about, and one that could, if used properly, save thousands of lives.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> … How do you figure that?</p>
<p><em>[König stands]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Because. You've seen it, have you not? You arrived here once we had concluded the thaumaturgy trials and found that nothing, nothing, Ms. Confer, would be spared. And you are here now, as we begin "cross-testing" the anomalies that have proven to be not worth the effort. And we <em>destroyed</em> them, Ms. Confer.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, we have tried ten different objects that were seemingly indestructible, and we were returned with only an empty harness. Nothing has yet survived.</p>
<p>What we have is the chance, a great opportunity afforded to us by, frustratingly similarly, an unknown force. If we are to continue and if we are to achieve the best, then we must first establish the boundaries of this gift. We must be aware of any failures in this system beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> A gift?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, Ms. Confer, a gift. We have discovered the vengeful wrath of the cosmos, a power beyond any nuclear bomb or crossbow. And a power such as that, a power to rival Mjöllnir, the Thunderbolt, or the Lance of Longinus, must be well managed in our hands.</p>
<p>Think of the things in the dark, how many beasts without end do you think the Foundation has contained? Many, Ms. Confer. Many. And how many people have died because of them? Dozens, do you think? Hundreds? Or, God forbid, thousands? There are things in this world that need to be expunged, and there are things in this world that, until now, could not be undone.</p>
<p>And so, if twenty people are to die for us to put these things down; if a hundred are to be sent down there so that humanity may reach a brighter day, then the choice is obvious, Ms. Confer, and I will not allow the important work we are doing here to be harmed because of an out of line inhuman anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> That …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes, Ms. Confer?</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> Just … please consider something other than throwing people to d- to die down there.</p>
<p><em>[König is seated once more]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Not people, Ms. Confer, and I am afraid I cannot give my authorization for that. There are many variables we have yet to study, and many of the subjects we have performed upon were moreso wasted due to the actions of your predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>Confer:</strong> We're both equal rank, I have authorization privileges too.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> And to change the procedures of <em>our</em> project requires mutual agreement, which we have not achieved. Now, I would suggest, Researcher Confer, that you find somewhere else to spend your time. I have anomalous <em>object</em> trials to consider.</p>
<p><em>[Confer turns and walks to the door, hesitating for a moment when she reaches it]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Is there something wrong, Researcher Conf-</p>

<p><em>[König and the Site Director are both standing in the Site Director's office. König is discussing the current situation of SCP-4276 trials]</em></p>
<p><em>[König walks over to the Site Director's desk, picking up a framed photograph of a young girl seated on a mall Santa's lap. She is smiling]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> This is very cute. Yours, I would wager?</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> Mhm.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Such a sweet girl, she seems. How is it that you don't speak of her more often, Mr. Velkes? I wouldn't have guessed you were of the kind to be blessed with children.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> That's, well, because …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> She passed away, four years ago now.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Oh, what could have possibly beset such a fine young girl like herself? What kind of cruel injustice is there?</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> There was an incident.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> An incident? What kind of incident?</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> She- I, we …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> What does this have to do with 4276?</p>
<p><em>[König leans forward towards the Site Director]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> It involved an ontokinetic entity, did it not?</p>
<p><em>[The Site Director becomes silent]</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Angelina, age twelve, died as one of multiple in an incident caused by the failed containment of SCP-4162-D, the slot now repurposed. Am I correct?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Well, I'll take your silence as a yes, then. Angelina died not just because of the failure to maintain proper protocol in the containment of the entity, but in the fact that we condoned the inefficient and disastrously unprepared restrainment of a god.</p>
<p>I have taken multiple trips into the Foundation's database; I have found that the number of Secure Containment Protocols consisting of a singular "type-green" entity has risen drastically over the course of the last few decades. And yet, we are to dedicate more and more resources to the containment of these monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> What's your point, König?</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> My point is that we have a simple and efficient solution here in this facility. Containment has so far proven to amount to little more than appeasement, and, if the need arises, indefinite sedation. But this much need, on such a grand scale as this, has strained the Foundation's resources few and thin.</p>
<p>What we have here will eliminate these creatures - it will send them back once more into the night. There will be no hazards of sudden awakening, there will be no potential for Hume-level leakage, and there will be no more failed containment incidents - there will simply be eradication.</p>

<p><strong>18:04:</strong> <em>They reach the midway section of SCP-4276. König once again stops the group, looking at O-12</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> For what it was worth, in your inability to contribute, you were successful in your job, O-Class, and I thank you for that. Which is precisely why this is such a shame indeed.</p>
<p><strong>18:05:</strong> <em>O-12 dialogue removed. Selected König dialogue removed</em></p>
<p><strong>18:07:</strong> <em>They make it to the top of the leveling system on par with SCP-4276-B. Lead Researcher König looks into the camera</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> This is Lead Researcher Friedenfänger, recording for the testing of SCP-4276 and, with great misfortune, O- … 11th, previously, Senior Researcher Carla Confer. Though I knew the chance for sabotage was there, it is shameful that I found myself in that gamble. O-12 was infected an unknown time ago, and as such, all of its considerations, suggestions, and implementations must be considered as thoughts conceived through a compromised psyche.</p>
<p>Its thoughts, such as its desire to see its fellow anomalies and O-Classes given inordinate care and treatment, must be disregarded in this understanding. We, the Foundation, must maintain our autonomy presiding over our subjects, and cannot allow them to control us. We must not yield to let them reign in their horrible night. We must remember that is what divides us - humans and anomalies - and we must not relent.</p>
<p>And so, even with such a heavy heart, we must now begin the testing of O-12 and SCP-4276.</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> Frie-Friedenfänger, please, don't do th-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> I'm afraid I cannot. Were I to let you go, what would you do other than spread your corruption, O-Class?</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> T-then give me amnestics, do some thaumaturgic ritual, anything, please!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> We have not yet had enough O-Class test subjects to determine whether that would work or not, or whether there would be long-term conditions to such treatment.</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> T-then start with me! We ca-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> One test at a time, O-Class. We'll get there.</p>
<p><strong>18:14:</strong> <em>König gestures to the two agents, and they escort O-12 closer toward SCP-4276. They brace as SCP-4276-A rises to 10.4 meters. König follows close behind them</em></p>
<p><strong>18:15:</strong> <em>They stand on the rim of SCP-4276-B, SCP-4276-A semi-fluidly waving upward a safe distance away. O-12 looks into SCP-4276-A</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Macrada told me that he heard whispers. We learned through the others that your kind begins to develop a connection to it. It makes demands of you, even in your sleep, does it not, O-Class?</p>
<p><strong>18:16:</strong> <em>O-12 does not respond, instead looking on into SCP-4276-A with a fixation</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Hmm. What does it whisper to you, O-Class? What does it say? What is it? What does it want?</p>
<p><strong>18:16:</strong> <em>O-12 raises its hand outward towards SCP-4276-A. König gestures for the personnel to allow this</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> What is it telling you right now? What does it say? You must tell m-</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> Chiral Hypocrisy.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> But what does that mean? What does it mean, Carla?</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> I don't want to, no, no!</p>
<p><strong>18:17:</strong> <em>O-12 begins trying to thrash away from SCP-4276-A. König gestures at the security personnel. One grabs O-12's extended arm, which does not move. O-12 struggles against the other agent, abruptly overpowering him and using its other arm to tug at the raised one</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Push it forward.</p>
<p><strong>18:17:</strong> <em>The two agents grab O-12, forcing it forward, as its hand nears SCP-4276-A</em></p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> Chiral Hypocrite.</p>
<p>Oh …</p>
<p>I see, now.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> What does it mean?!</p>
<p><strong>18:18:</strong> <em>König gestures for the agents to proceed. They try to push it forward but are seemingly unable to</em></p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> I get it.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Stop, you two.</p>
<p><strong>18:19:</strong> <em>Both agents stop and back away</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Carla, what is it? You must tell me!</p>
<p><strong>18:19:</strong> <em>O-12 walks forward, completely engulfing its hand in SCP-4276-A. It continues, putting in its forearm all the way to the elbow. It doesn't vocalize whatsoever. After ten seconds, it pulls its arm back out, revealing charred-black skeletal remains</em></p>
<p><strong>18:20:</strong> <em>O-12 raises its hand in front of its face inspecting it, brushing over it with its other hand. It turns the hand over, and begins flexing each of its skeletal fingers</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Speak to me, Carla, what does it say?</p>
<p><strong>18:20:</strong> <em>O-12 once more reaches out towards SCP-4276-A, touching its surface, watching as a considerable strand of SCP-4276-A diverts from the main force. It swirls around the arm in spiraling patterns, forming rings around it before merging with the limb</em></p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Sir! We need to shut this do-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Silence! Carla, what does it s-</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> You're a Chiral Hypocrite.</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> But what does that mean?!</p>
<p><strong>18:21:</strong> <em>One agent moves to apprehend O-12. It intercepts with its skeletal hand grabbing onto one of the personnel's arms. The agent's arm, extending to the shoulder, quickly falls apart onto the floor</em></p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Shit!</p>
<p><strong>18:21:</strong> <em>The other agent backs away, attempting to retrieve a sidearm from its holster. O-12 stretches its arm in his direction, releasing a bout of SCP-4276-A which envelops the agent. He falls to the ground, writhing in pain</em></p>
<p><em>König is stationary, watching as this unfolds, watching O-12 intently</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> You have truly become inhuman, Carla.</p>
<p><strong>18:22:</strong> <em>O-12 looks at König</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> These men have families, you and I know. But such is the cost of progress, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> I-I-I want to leave, Köni-</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> -It only took us this many tests to realize it. The permanent effects of SCP-4276-A on a <em>willing O-Class</em> subject, on one that was embraced but that had not yet fully succumbed! Before, with the ones that did not quite die-</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> -No, no! No, this was … this wasn't …</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> And an apparent mental struggle too! There is so much about you that I now wonder. So many new variables have been opened. Yes, any other forms of testing must be put on hold, we must understand what has become of you, how, or even if we can replicate it, and the nature of your newfound capability. You are truly doing good work here, Carla.</p>
<p><strong>18:24:</strong> <em>O-12 falls to its knees, massaging its affected hand with the other and covering its face. It sobs</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Oh, Carla, you have become inhuman - more than human. You have received a gift today, a great and powerful gift. You will help us in this war for humanity's survival against the anomalous, even from your new position.</p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> Please, stop talking!</p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> All of these months, all of these tests, all of this work - you have become it all personified! And I, I am proud, Carla. We will accomplish many things, me and-</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> -<strong>SHUT UP!</strong></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>18:26:</strong> <em>O-12 retreats, covering its face with both hands</em></p>
<p><strong>18:27:</strong> <em>König gets down on his knees in front of O-12, rubbing its shoulders before hugging it. It does not respond</em></p>
<p><strong>18:28:</strong> <em>König looks into O-12's face, smiling</em></p>
<p><strong>König:</strong> Carla, I-</p>
<p><strong>18:28:</strong> <em>O-12 violently plunges its skeletal hand into König's chest. He screams as the arm burns its way deeper inside</em></p>
<p><em>It digs around in his chest, eventually tearing out König's heart and holding it before them both as it crumbles into ash, spilling out and fading away</em></p>
<p><em>König clutches at his chest, falling to the ground and writing in pain. The hole in his shirt corrosively expands, revealing the large wound and several dark veins emerging from it</em></p>
<p><strong>O-12:</strong> Oh, oh God. Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>18:29:</strong> <em>The third agent arrives at the top level, hurriedly scanning the scene before him. All three Foundation personnel are on the ground, and the agent focuses his attention on O-12</em></p>
<p><em>The agent moves to the other personnel, tending to them whilst keeping watch of O-12. He holds his sidearm far out from himself in O-12's direction. Momentarily, the agent looks away from O-12, which seizes the opportunity and unleashes a small burst of SCP-4276-A towards his gun, annihilating it. O-12 quickly stands and maneuvers past the agent before running away</em></p>
<p><strong>18:30:</strong> <em>The agent moves to König, noticing the injury and his still body. He moves to assist the other, still living, personnel, kicking up a slight mound of dust in the process</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>18:32:</strong> <em>O-12 makes it to the bottom of the leveling system, running towards the chamber doors which it opens with its still valid keycard. It flees the chamber</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>18:33:</strong> <em>Klaxons blare, and a containment breach is announced</em></p>
