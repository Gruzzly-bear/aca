<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: SCP-9453 has been sealed with a biometric padlock. A notice is to be posted on the exterior of the door in Turkish, English, and Greek, stating that the room contains an asbestos hazard and must not be entered. Surveillance cameras, acoustic monitors, and seismographic sensors have been installed within the room and around the church perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-9453 is a 3.5 x 5 m room located under the Church of St. Mary of the Mongols<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> in Istanbul, Turkey. It is believed that the room had not been accessed from the 15th century until its rediscovery in 2026. At the time when the door was reopened, all surfaces were coated in a uniform layer of fine dust. All the walls except the western wall are plastered. A description of the room's contents follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Eastern side:</em> An iconostasis<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> inlaid with silver which has fallen down due to rotting wood. The six icons recovered are of the <em>Theotokos</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> in the "<em>Hodegetria</em>" style<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>. Two incense burners containing frankincense and myrrh.</li>
<li><em>Northern side:</em> A plain walnut scriptorium desk. A quill and several sheets of silk paper, upon which <strong>Text 9453-A</strong> was found, lie upon the desk. Carbon dating of these sheets indicates that the silk was harvested in 1430±20 CE. A drawer in the desk contained 12 Genoese testoni<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, 4 Venetian ducats<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and 5 Ottoman akçe<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>. There is a stool standing in front of the desk and a second, which was lying overturned at the time of discovery.</li>
<li><em>Southern side:</em> The oak door to the room. A clay oil lamp lies on the floor, with a black stain around it left by evaporated oil. The remains of a crossbow of Genoese manufacture are resting against the wall.</li>
<li><em>Western side:</em> The western wall is marked by a 2 m diameter circular area of bare stone. The mortar between the stones here has vitrified, though no fire damage or soot is present. There is a roughly circular area on the floor in front of the western wall 1.2 m in diameter where the stone is lightly bleached, and seven candle-holders are placed equidistantly around the circumference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every 16-25 minutes, observers within SCP-9453 may experience a series of three muffled sounds: a sharp crack, followed by a loud slamming sound closer to the observer, followed by a noise resembling the sound of stressed masonry. Mechanical detectors perceive no such sounds in the room. 3-6 times per day, a similar series of events occurs which is preceded by the sensation of a slight trembling of the floor and includes a much louder slamming sound.</p>
<p><strong>Text 9453-A:</strong></p>
