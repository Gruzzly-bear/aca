<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-5748-1 are stored in maximum security anomalous item storage at Site-109. Any persons exposed to SCP-5748 can be amnesticised and released from containment, with their lack of language skills explained as the result of a haemmorhagic stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5748 is a gaseous chemical weapon<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> designed to infiltrate the brain’s language centers, and remove all semantic connection between words and their meanings. All known SCP-5748 is in containment in the form of a collection of weaponised delivery systems, designated SCP-5748-1.</p>
<p>The initial onset of this effect is a corruption of the meaning of words and expressions such that they lose nuance. Individuals then experience a loss of vocabulary and understanding of grammatical structure. During this time, the affected individuals' communications become increasingly unintelligible, and they have increased difficulty in understanding verbal, signed or written language. In the final stages, they lose all capacity to understand language and become unable to learn or relearn any language in the future.</p>
<p>The duration of time between initial onset and final stages varies depending on how much SCP-5748 was inhaled by the individual. The effects can take days to fully manifest with small doses, while sufficiently large doses can cause near instant progression to the final stage. Thus far, no way to reverse the effects of SCP-5748 have been found.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5748 was created by <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gru-p-hub">GRU 'P' Division</a> in the early 1970s. It was originally intended to specifically target the English language, in order to be used as a weapon that would cause massive disruption amongst American forces while leaving their own troops unaffected. However, their attempts to create a targeted form of SCP-5748 failed, and the project lost its funding.</p>
<p>The SCP-5748-1 instances created as part of this project remained in GRU-P storage until the dissolution of the USSR, at which point they were obtained by the Foundation along with a number of other GRU-P assets and personnel.</p>
<p>Currently, the Foundation has 650 tonnes of solid state SCP-5748 in containment.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment Log: Subject-14</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Subject-14 is a healthy 32 year old female. Previously, she was an American spy captured during an attempt to infiltrate a GRU-P installation. Subject is intelligent, with a rich vocabulary and excellent grasp of the English language, and has moderate command of Russian.</p>
She has proven cooperative with testing after the consequences of non-cooperation were explained to her. She has been granted access to several personal items<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> as an incentive for good behaviour.<br/>

<p><strong>Incident Report: 5748-1</strong><br/>
A Fifthist compound on Orkney was discovered to contain multiple verbally transmitted anomalous memes. Fifthists resisted attempts to negotiate and repelled an initial assault through the use of various anomalous capabilities, all of which appeared to be mediated by verbal commands. In order to avoid the use of more destructive methods, and the loss of life that would entail, a request to use SCP-5748 was made.</p>
<p>This request was approved by Site Director Kristov under <em>Protocol 17.4</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> and multiple SCP-5748-1 instances were fired into the compound. Twenty four hours later, Agents breached the compound and successfully contained all Fifthists present with no loss of life.</p>
<p>A subsequent request for SCP-5748 to be reclassified as Thaumiel was denied by the Ethics Committee due to the deleterious effect on affected individuals' mental states following total loss of language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report: 5748-2</strong><br/>
A large scale breach of the Veil has occurred in the town of Durban, South Africa. A majority of the population has been infected with SCP-6111, an anomalously memetic religion that is highly transmissible via verbal or visual contact. It compels those infected to devote themselves to passing the memetic infection onto others, and to build large pyramidal structures. Research indicates it is carried via language, and would be unable to persist in non-lingual persons.</p>
<p>A quarantine around the town of Durban has been created, however SCP-6111 still poses a high risk of spreading and the possibility of global contamination remains catastrophic. SCP-6111 has also developed an immunity to amnestics. Use of SCP-5748 was proposed and a vote on its use by the O5 Council passed 8 votes to 2, with 2 abstaining.</p>
<p>Large quantities of SCP-5748 were airdropped across Durban over the course of several days and aerial surveillance has indicated the SCP-6111 infection has been Neutralized. Clean up operations across Durban are still ongoing, but the use of SCP-5748 appears to have been successful. All civilians encountered thus far show no desire to construct pyramids.</p>

<p>The Durban Incident has dramatically worsened and spread globally. SCP-5748 and SCP-6111 appear to have somehow combined into a new anomaly, preliminarily classed as SCP-5748-2. It retains SCP-6111’s high transmission rates but has taken on SCP-5748’s effect of rendering language incomprehensible. It appears to transmit via memetoturgic pathways and is estimated to currently infect <tt>71.2</tt>% of the global human population. All uninfected personnel should ambersate directly to their nearest sacotogical defensive bassart.</p>
<p>All prasonnate who have already been infected, stay calm and stay alarpal. You will not lose your self and you will psa die, only yab language mre be lost.
