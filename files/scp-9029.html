<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Complete containment of SCP-9029 has proven to be impossible. Instead, MTF LAMBDA-12 "Pest control" is to routinely patrol the area surrounding SCP-9029 to monitor its expansion, and prevent unauthorised personnel from reaching SCP-9029. Surveillance of the perimeter walls is to be maintained at all times, through the use of cameras and stationed MTF operatives. On a bi-weekly basis, MTF operatives, equipped with the appropriate ballistic equipment, should advance into the containment zone, following the sustained fire of several artillery pieces stationed 10 kilometres North from the containment zone. MTF operatives involved in this advance should make use of kinetic, incendiary and chemical weapons in order to decrease the population and area of influence of SCP-9029.</p>
<p>Should a member of MTF LAMBDA-12 be lost, their body should immediately be retrieved and incinerated. Following the findings of Addendum 02, the transfer of SCP-9029 to Wilsons Wildlife Solutions is no longer being considered. Caution when advancing into the containment zone is also advised following Incident 01.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> The containment procedures previously displayed are currently under review, and will be subject to change.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>The designation 'SCP-9029' refers to an anomalous colony of leafcutter ants, located in a 5km wide forested zone in Southern Texas. While SCP-9029 mostly resembles a mature colony of <em>Atta mexicana</em>, workers of SCP-9029, referred to hereby as SCP-9029-1, have never been seen cutting or consuming any type of leaf. SCP-9029 as a colony also harbours an abnormal ratio of workers to majors<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, with over 40 percent of the colonies estimated population being composed of majors.</p>

<p>Majors of SCP-9029 also display greater polymorphism<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, with the largest supermajors reaching over 60mm. The colony of SCP-9029 has also shown to be polygynous<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, with the number of queens estimated to be over 50,000. Paired with an exceedingly quick egg to worker development of just under 2 weeks, as well as the ability to inbreed<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, SCP-9029 as a colony is able to expand rapidly, should sufficient nutrients be available. SCP-9029-1 instances have also shown to be invulnerable to all forms of common pesticide.</p>
<p>The most dangerous anomalous effects, however, begin to manifest once any vertebrate approaches SCP-9029. The affected subject's bodily systems will begin to gradually fail, with the rate and severity of these failures varying between subjects and species. Below is a list of the organisms tested, with the results attached.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th><strong>Subject</strong></th>
<th><strong>Result</strong></th>

<tr>
<td><strong><em>Atta mexicana</em> (Leafcutter Ant)</strong></td>
<td>No discernible effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Atta texana</em> (Leafcutter Ant)</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong><em>Centruoides vittatus</em> (Striped Bark Scorpion)</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong><em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em> (Asian House Gecko)</strong></td>
<td>Subject immediately started showing signs of distress, with its tail being dropped roughly 5 minutes after being placed into the containment zone of SCP-9029. Approximately 20 minutes after first exposure, skin discolouration could be seen, which rapidly progressed to bleeding from the eyes and mouth. The subject subsequently died from blood loss. Following dissections revealed a high concentration of an unknown hemotoxin in the subject's bloodstream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Varanus acanthurus</em> (Spiny-Tailed monitor)</strong></td>
<td>Subject remained within the containment zone for 16 days before the onset of the first symptoms. The subject died due to the formation of a blood clot in the coronary artery, caused by the presence of the same hemotoxin in the subjects bloodstream. No other symptoms were recorded prior to the subject's death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Struthio camelus</em> (Common Ostrich)</strong></td>
<td>Subject remained in the containment zone for 8 days before the first symptoms developed. The symptoms first manifested in necrosis around the right calf, but quickly progressed into acute, body wide necrosis. The subject later died from blood loss, as well as an infection in the wound. Later dissections also found the same hemotoxin present in the subject's blood stream, however it was found in a much lower concentration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Pan troglodytes</em> (Chimpanzee)</strong></td>
<td>Subject remained inside the containment zone for 2 months without the development of any notable conditions past infrequent nosebleeds. The hemotoxin was not found in the subject's bloodstream, and it is suspected that the exceedingly low concentration of the hemotoxin rendered it undetectable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Human Subject D-4839 (Measured IQ 105)</strong></td>
<td>No discernible effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Human Subject D-5017 (Measured IQ 68)</strong></td>
<td>No discernible effect.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>These results suggest that the severity and lethality of the symptoms are directly linked to the intelligence of the subject affected, with subjects with lower intelligence experiencing the most rapid and severe onset of symptoms. The anomalous abilities of SCP-9029 also do not seem to affect other invertebrates. Finally, the hemotoxin compound present in the bloodstream of every organism affected has since been named Hemotoxin-9029, and research on the effects of this toxin are still ongoing.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the lack of symptoms experienced by humans in the previous tests, it is still recommended that proximity with SCP-9029-1 instances is minimised. Once the death of a subject occurs, a large number of SCP-9029-1 instances will exit the nest and form trails to the newly placed corpse, provided that the corpse is not being visually observed by a primate. SCP-9029-1 instances will then begin to cut and divide the corpse into segments, to be disinfected by chemical compounds stored on the mandibles of SCP-9029-1 instances and carried back into the nest. It should be noted that the pieces of flesh 'harvested' by SCP-9029-1 instances have been drained of blood, due to the presence of Hemotoxin-9029.</p>
<p>The current size and depth of the main nest is unknown, and has been rendered difficult to calculate due to the presence of satellite nests. However, current estimates place it being over 80m deep, and spanning a diameter of 2km. Despite the size and population of SCP-9029, the area in which SCP-9029 inhabits remains biodiverse, and has no notable ecological differences when compared to other forests located in Southern Texas.</p>
<p>As the population of reptiles and mammals monitored was seemingly unaffected, it is theorized that the anomalous effects posed by SCP-9029 are significantly less potent towards reptiles and mammals that were found naturally in the containment zone. This was later confirmed by running parallel tests using reptiles of the same species taken from different ranges.</p>
<p>Further analysis of the rate at which SCP-9029-1 instances naturally 'harvest' has revealed that SCP-9029 does not intake a significant amount of nutrients, despite the size and population of SCP-9029-1 instances. This suggests that SCP-9029 is capable of surviving and expanding with significantly limited nutrients. The method in which SCP-9029-1 instances are able to survive such long periods of time without nutrients is currently unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9029 was discovered following the attempted publishing of a journal titled ‘My Time Spent With Gaia’, which was in the process of publishing on the behalf of the author ‘Alice Pearce’, before her disappearance. The journal details Miss Pearce's experience studying numerous ‘unnatural’ organisms, with some of her descriptions assisting the Foundation in the capture of SCP-████, SCP-████ and SCP-9029.</p>
<p>This journal was found by Foundation agents embedded within the publishing industry, and was seized shortly before publication. Amnestics have since been administered to all civilians that had previously viewed or had knowledge of the journal’s existence.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the final pages relating to SCP-9029 had been torn out prior to Foundation recovery. It should also be noted that Miss Pearce had previously been in Foundation custody for witnessing an SCP-████ event, and was given amnestic treatment before being released.</p>

<p>As I continue to scour this forest, I've come across a species of leafcutter that really shouldn't exist. They definitely resemble <em>Atta</em>, but the colony structure is unlike anything I've ever seen before.</p>
<p>I almost only see majors, and their polymorphism is far greater than even <em>Carebara</em>. Some of them reach almost 3cm. I only ever see them venturing outside their nest when forming large trails, and I almost never see them deviate from this.</p>
<p>These trails also seem to never end. I've followed them for hours, but I have yet to see even a single worker harvesting. Come to think of it, I don't see how a colony this large can even survive in a forest this small. By now, there shouldn't even be any plants left.</p>
<p>I just can't quite shake the feeling that maybe they're the reason half of this forest is drenched in blood… This doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Still, I haven't ruled out a hemophagic virus yet. Even if it was the leafcutters, I should be finding bodies; even just skeletons…</p>
<p>There's something unnatural in this forest, and I'm going to find out what it is.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-01: Containment Revision 01</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Due to growing resource concerns, it has been decided that the size of the area containing SCP-9029 should be decreased, with the vegetation being cleared to facilitate ease of management, as well as improving the accuracy of monitoring efforts. With this in mind, MTF LAMBDA-12 was sent into the current containment perimeter with heavy machinery to remove significant amounts of vegetation. An artillery barrage was then used to eliminate instances of SCP-9029 outside of the newly designated zone.</p>
<p>Since the first advance, MTF units have been successful in clearing 12.5km²of land containing SCP-9029, with no notable changes in behaviour occurring in SCP-9029-1 instances. Due to this, construction on a wall encircling the perimeter of the area effected by SCP-9029 has begun. Long term containment procedures have also been changed to accommodate the limits in resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-02: Discovery and subsequent analysis of SCP-9029-2</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Through further study, it has been found that instances of SCP-9029-1 are sustained through a symbiotic relationship, not dissimilar to non-anomalous leaf cutters. However, instead of cultivating the Leucoagaricus gongylophorus fungus, instances of SCP-9029-1 cultivate what appears to be a constantly growing mass of flesh, hereby referred to as an SCP-9029-2 mass. Samples of SCP-9029-2 were extracted from SCP-9029 quickly following this discovery. These samples were safely contained for a period of three weeks, before these samples were then tested for their effects on various tissue samples and living organisms.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When exsanguinated dead tissue was exposed to an SCP-9029-2 sample, the effects were almost immediate. The dead tissue started warping, quickly being reduced to a semi permeable mass of biological material. Later chemical tests revealed that the proteins stored within the tissue had been broken down into their relative amino acids, along with the lipids being converted into glycerol.</p>
<p>Further examination of this substance revealed that this had been caused by a fungal pathogen, which replicated and processed the tissue through the production of digestive enzymes, creating a nutrient rich blend.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The effects of the pathogen were then tested on a living muscle tissue sample, taken from a lab rat. While the subsequent result was similar to that of the dead tissue, it was found through further testing that this tissue was slowly releasing fungal spores. Samples of the blood stored within the tissue were then tested, which revealed the presence of a low concentration of active SCP-9029-2 instances.</p>
<p>These SCP-9029-2 instances were using nutrients present in the blood to produce fungal spores, which were then being released through the semi permeable membrane. It was also found that the SCP-9029-2 instances had caused the rapid growth of new blood vessels, which were redirecting nutrients present in the muscle tissue to the main bloodstream.</p>
<p>The discovery of fungal spores was made several hours following testing, due to the low concentration of spores being released. This resulted in the infection of junior researcher Jeffrey Anderson, who has since been quarantined. No other researchers were found to be infected by SCP-9029-2, and the effects of SCP-9029-2 on Dr. Anderson are currently being examined.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Anderson initially began showing flu-like symptoms hours after the first infection with SCP-9029-2, slowly progressing into more severe fevers after several days. It was at this time that various antifungal medications were administered to Dr. Anderson, with no noticeable effect. Shortly after the fevers developed, SCP-9029-2 began to cause rapid and uncontrollable mutations in the body of Dr. Anderson, resulting in a rash forming over Dr Andersons' skin, as well as several health complications. These complications were not dealt with, for fear of the infection spreading to other researchers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the formation of the rash, Dr. Andersons' immune system was completely degraded by SCP-9029-2. It was at this time that the decision was made to cease all interaction with Dr. Anderson to prevent further infection. SCP-9029-2 then deconstructed Dr. Andersons' nervous system shortly after his immune system was compromised, quickly causing paralysis. Dr. Anderson died almost immediately after this due to his brain functions ceasing. It should be noted that while Dr. Anderson suffered complete brain death, Dr. Andersons' heart continued functioning, allowing most of his tissue to continue undergoing aerobic respiration.</p>
<p>Following Dr. Andersons' death, SCP-9029-2 then hijacked his digestive system, using it to dissolve much of his remaining living tissue. Dr. Andersons' bone structure was also broken down in this period. After approximately 24 hours, the body of Dr. Anderson was reduced to a mass of flesh, similar in composition to the tissue sample tested previously. However, Dr. Andersons' heart continued circulating blood throughout this mass, which was aided by the growth of an extensive system of new blood vessels.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:50%;"><img alt="Fibrin_strands_on_blood_smear.jpeg" class="image" src="https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/corpse-cutters/Fibrin_strands_on_blood_smear.jpeg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Magnified image taken of SCP-9029-2 instances in the bloodstream, during the formation of new blood vessels.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Analysis of the blood showed a substantially high concentration of SCP-9029-2, with a significant amount of fungal spores being emitted from this mass. It is currently estimated that flesh infected with SCP-9029-2 is capable of lasting indefinitely, despite differing climate conditions and exposure to other pathogens. This is due to the tendency of SCP-9029-2 instances to actively locate and engulf other pathogens, destroying them through the production of digestive enzymes. This has so far prevented all contained samples of SCP-9029-2 decomposing, as no tested pathogen has proven to be capable of proliferating within these samples.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The effects of the pathogen have since been tested on multiple different species of mammals and reptiles, consistently resulting in the death of the subject. At this time, there is no known cure to SCP-9029-2. Analysis of SCP-9029-2 spores have shown that they are capable of surviving in the air for upwards of 6 months, and have an infectivity rate close to 100%. To attempt to prevent a potential outbreak, containment efforts should be reinforced.</p>
<p>Resources should immediately be allocated to extract as many instances of SCP-9029-2 as possible, to be prepared for incineration. 20 samples of SCP-9029-2 should also be stored within separate containment chambers in biological storage centre 23 for further testing. This should be done directly following artillery bombardment on the main nest, in which drones should then be used to extract exposed SCP-9029-2 instances.</p>
<p>When conducting tests involving SCP-9029-2, personnel must wear level A hazmat suits, and be routinely checked for any symptom's characteristic of SCP-9029-2. Should Foundation personnel be suspected to be infected with SCP-9029-2, they should undergo immediate quarantine. Should their infection be confirmed, they should be terminated remotely, with their body being incinerated.</p>
<p>Due to the bloodborne nature of SCP-9029-2, it is theorized that SCP-9029-1 has evolved to manifest a hemotoxin in subjects as a way to counter the pathogenic effects of SCP-9029-2, thereby allowing them to cultivate SCP-9029-2 for nutrients. This suggests that SCP-9029-1 and SCP-9029-2 are unlikely to have evolved whilst having a symbiotic relationship, instead suggesting that this relationship is a recent development.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Ok, let's get this started.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren uses a syringe to inject SCP-9029-2 into a previously prepared lab rat</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Shouldn't we be a little more cautious? I mean, last test it immediately caused the tissue to convulse after seconds-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> -<em>Relax</em>. It's not like it's going to jump out at you or anything; besides, there are worse ways to go working for the Foundation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes lets out a nervous laugh</em></p>
<p><em>They all watch silently as the lab rat rapidly begins to change form</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I see George's point… More and more the Foundation hands us the dirty work. I must say - I start to feel more like a D-class sometimes.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Anderson seems visibly surprised</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> I would've thought someone in your position would be worshipping the Foundation by this point.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren laughs</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yeah, well. Times are tough I guess.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes starts noting down the condition of the lab rat</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Alright, I'll leave you too it then - I've got to get to a meeting</p>
<p><em>Both junior researchers start laughing</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> Foundation hands you the dirty work, huh?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren grins, before he can be seen leaving</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Anderson begins writing while Dr. Barnes observes the lab rat</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes sighs</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> It's all the same as last time. Literally identical.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Knowing last time, we'll be here all day. <em>Just to be sure…</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Anderson laughs</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> And you have somewhere else to be?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Well yes, actually. I didn't want to be here in the first place, but… Well, you know the Foundation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Anderson continues writing, before pausing</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> You know, I could probably cover for you. It's more of a one-person job anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> Yeah, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Wow… Thanks, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson:</strong> No problem.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Anderson looks back to the lab rat, which has now been reduced to a mass of flesh</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I'll make it up to you.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I was recently notified of your request to leave SCP-9029 research.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Yes. I can't continue like this. I was hoping to be moved to SCP-████ soon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> May I suggest that you reconsider? You're a valuable member of this team - We need you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren pauses for a moment, watching Dr. Barnes's expression</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I understand that Anderson's death was a lot to take in. You two were close.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes looks down, tears beginning to form in his eyes. He makes eye contact before speaking</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I'll never forget how Jeffrey died. Alone. Locked away: There was no humanity left… Was it you that made the call to let him die?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I. Well… I had no choice. You saw what was happening in there. There was; nothing we could do. I did the only thing I could, stop the infection spreading.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes takes a moment to consider</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I… I understand - you did what you had to do. But it will never make this right. I can't continue.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren is visibly disappointed</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> You will move past this. There's no one else like you. With your expertise. You have the chance to make a difference - a real difference. For Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> No… It can't go on like this.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren remains silent</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> You don't understand, do you? What it's like to lose someone so close. That feeling - That you could've done something more.</p>
<p><em>A brief look of sadness passes over Dr. Warren, but is quickly supressed</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I'm sorry, but we can't just give you up to another division. I wish there was another way. I really do.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 9029-01:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Approximately 48 hours following the first tests on SCP-9029-2, MTF operatives spotted three trails of SCP-9029-1 instances, primarily composed of majors, heading towards the main walls. MTF operatives continued to stand guard, observing as the three trails merged into one, seemingly heading directly towards a sentry tower. When the trail reached approximately 50m from the sentry tower, MTF operatives were instructed to fire on the trail, destroying thousands of SCP-9029-1 instances. This did not deter the surviving SCP-9029-1 instances, which continued to advance despite the heavy casualties. It was at this time that almost all of the perimeter floodlights stopped functioning, forcing the MTF operatives to use handheld flashlights.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively small advancing force, members of MTF LAMBDA-12 were quickly overpowered and forced to retreat. SCP-9029-1 did not advance past the walls during this advance, with night vision cameras confirming their retreat shortly before sunrise. Later analysis has found several tunnel entrances exiting behind the perimeter wall, each roughly 30cm in diameter. Further investigation through the use of remote-controlled rovers have found that the tunnels have been recently blocked approximately 200m from the source. It has been concluded that these tunnels were constructed quickly following the bombardment of the main nest, and allowed SCP-9029-1 instances to quickly overpower the MTF operatives stationed by the perimeter.</p>
<p>Further analysis of this attack found that the floodlights were disabled due to large numbers of SCP-9029-1 workers entering the light through the seals in the plating, causing the floodlights to short circuit, destroying all SCP-9029-1 instances in the process. Almost all the floodlights were rendered useless within minutes of each other, displaying a great degree of coordination and intelligence. The use of these strategies in tandem also suggests that SCP-9029-1 instances may have some form of collective consciousness, with at least a basic understanding of military strategy.</p>
<p>A total of 14 casualties were sustained during this attack, with the deaths of 5 MTF operatives. Instances of SCP-9029-1 seemingly did not utilise their anomalous abilities to cause these deaths, as evident by the lack of Hemotoxin-9029 in their bloodstream, instead using their mandibles to make small incisions, eventually causing the MTF operatives to die from blood loss. Whilst SCP-9029-1 instances did not 'harvest' these corpses, they continued to make incisions into the corpses flesh, rendering the corpses unidentifiable without DNA confirmation. Instances of SCP-9029-1 were still present on the body when it was recovered, with no signs indicating that they would have stopped 'processing' the corpse. Due to this notable change in behaviour, SCP-9029 is to be reclassified to Keter. Increased caution is advised regarding the containment of SCP-9029.</p>
<p><strong>Update Incident 9029-01:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Approximately one week following Incident 01, all outward communications from biological storage centre 23 ceased. MTF LAMBDA-12 were dispatched quickly following this, and made contact three hours after dispatch. It would seem that during Incident 01, several SCP-9029-1 queens began founding underneath biological storage centre 23, forming an established colony in under a week. This directly conflicts with the egg to worker development seen in SCP-9029 that had been measured previously, suggesting that the speed of brood development is dynamic, and can be altered based on circumstance.</p>
<p>After the satellite nest reached a substantial population, a large number of SCP-9029-1 instances emerged from underneath the storage centre and immediately targeted the communications array, using supermajors to unscrew various panels, allowing smaller SCP-9029-1 instances to enter the circuitry. While many instances of SCP-9029-1 were able to breach biological storage centre 23, it would seem that the SCP-9029-1 instances were attempting to enter the containment chamber of SCP-9029-2. Instances of SCP-9029-1 were unsuccessful in entering this containment chamber before the arrival of MTF LAMBDA-12, due to the chamber being hermetically sealed.</p>
<p>This containment breach was quickly stopped upon the arrival of MTF LAMBDA-12, with MTF operatives destroying the SCP-9029-1 instances on site. The source of the SCP-9029-1 instances was quickly traced back to the satellite nest by following the trails left by these instances. An incendiary explosive was then placed inside the satellite nest, which due to the nest's size, was able to destroy all remaining SCP-9029-1 instances upon detonation.</p>
<p>A total of 3 armed guards were killed during this containment breach, with many others being wounded. Extreme caution has been advised with the containment of SCP-9029, and a containment revision has been deemed necessary.</p>

<strong>George Barnes</strong> (Junior Researcher)<br/>
<strong>—————————————————————————————————————————</strong><br/>
[BEGIN VIDEO/AUDIO LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Would you like to explain what you were doing in Bio-centre 23?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I was doing my job, studying samples of SCP-9029-2.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Are you sure? It would have been quite late to be staying overtime. I don't exactly remember giving you much of a workload.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I was just being thorough.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> 15 samples of SCP-9029-2 don't just go missing on their own. You haven't exactly been very cooperative lately. I think you might need a better alibi than that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> How many times am I going to have to answer the same question?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> As many times as it takes.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes lets out a faint sigh</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Listen, I'm just trying to keep this from becoming an official Foundation investigation. Once it's in their hands, there's no telling of what would happen to the perpetrator…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes sits silently for a moment, before speaking</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Ok. Fine. I did it. I stayed back and took those samples. As much as I could. All the way to the containment site.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren is visibly surprised</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I-don't… Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> I was just trying to make things right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> By putting this whole site at risk? What if you hadn't been able to contain them? What if the SCP-9029-1 instances rejected it… It's almost like you <em>want</em> to end up like Anderson.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes's expression darkens. He takes a moment before speaking</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> We both saw the bodies. Hardened MTF operatives rendered to a pulp. You couldn't even recognise them.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren lets out a deep sigh</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yes. Truly tragic what happened. If only we could've known. But I don't understand why-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> -Except that's not quite the full story, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I'm afraid I don't quite understand?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Why would you try and cover that up?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> You're going to have to expl-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> -The bodies. They weren't quite as you suggest. Not quite as unidentifiable.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren's expression hardens</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> There were words written on them - not quite written - etched into their skin. In standard English. Why do you leave that out?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren stares back blankly</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> How do you kn-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Does it matter?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren looks away for a moment, before answering with a grim expression</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> There were some things better left out. For morale's sake.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> So you believe that we shouldn't know that the anomaly was trying to reason with us?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren chuckles</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Reason? You call tearing our personnel apart reason!? It's almost like you've forgotten what they used as a canvas. And you trust them? Trust what they say-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> -You ignore what they say. You've forgotten that we're the ones who brought them to kill. They never even touched our personnel, even after we burned down their home and killed hundreds of thousands of them. It's you who've brought this upon us. You made the call to take the pathogen away from them. All they ask is for us to return it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> You ignore reason. You think giving an anomaly that has the potential to kill thousands control over a pathogen that could kill millions is a good idea?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> You must know we wont be able to contain it indefinitely. It's only a matter of time before we cause an outbreak. Don't you get it? The anomaly is Hiemal. It's always been Hiemal. Your tampering with that balance is going to get us killed!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> So what? You think that if we just leave them together it will solve all our problems?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> They gave us an ultimatum. One month. We've got 9 days, Raymond. You've seen the damage they caused when crossed. So far it has only been a warning. So yes, I think we would be solving problems most of our personnel didn't even know we had. So far they have shown to be capable-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> -So far? So far?! You're willing to risk the lives the lives of millions - on what? On the mere hope that they'll all keep to themselves? No; We need to deal with those ants once and for all, before they have the chance to hurt anyone else.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barnes pauses for a moment</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> You're letting your feelings for her cloud your judgement.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren resolve fades into anger</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> Ever since I saw your reaction to me talking about how I felt after Jeffrey's death, I knew something was off. I should've known the instant you asked me to cover you. You didn't amnesticize her in that room, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barnes:</strong> All this time, it was you getting rid of the evidence… How much else have you lied about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> -CUT IT</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-03: Containment Revision 02</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Following several more attacks by SCP-9029-1 instances, it has been concluded that the containment of SCP-9029-2 is impossible, without the termination of SCP-9029-1. With this in mind, a number of autonomous drill units were dispatched to the site affected by SCP-9029, and began to drill spherical holes from the surface into many nest chambers. These holes were then used to rapidly pump 35 tons of propane gas into the nest through external gas taps on the autonomous drill units, which were supplied from an array of gas canisters placed on the exterior of the perimeter walls by gas pipes. Once all 35 tons of propane was used, it was quickly ignited through the use of an air to ground missile, launched from an unmanned drone.</p>
<p>Following the impact of the air to ground missile, the area affected continued to burn consistently for over 48 hours. Following extensive analysis of the nest system and surrounding area, it has been concluded that no instances of SCP-9029-1 or SCP-9029-2 survived this termination attempt. A front has been created to disguise this event and area as a test site for a newly developed fire control system. Media coverage has since been limited, as not to expose the reality of this event.</p>

[BEGIN VIDEO/AUDIO LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> I'll take it you know why you're here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Good. Let's get started.</p>
<p><em>Mr Barnett can be seen placing a document on the table</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> This document states that you amnesticized all witnesses of SCP-████ yourself, after Dr. Barnes was unable to attend. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Ok. So, would you like to explain your previous exchange with Dr. Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Again?</p>
<p><em>Mr Barnet waits patiently. Dr. Warren sighs</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Like I said before, he was far in over his head - you can clearly see from the note he left - those were not the actions of someone thinking clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> He could've gotten himself killed, or worse. Thank God he's finally getting the help he needs-</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> -Warren, I have the log. The real, original log of you and Alice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> So do I. Every Foundation researcher has-</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Don't play games with me, Warren. Let's just say that after all you put Barnes through, I would've done the same thing. He gave me the logs. It all adds up.</p>
<p><em>Mr Barnett retrieves a file from his vest, before placing it onto the table</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren looks visibly shocked</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> You're going to have to start talking soon, for both of your sakes. You wouldn't want that log getting out, would you?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren is visibly panicked</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Fine. I didn't amnesticize Alice. But you have to understand-</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> -Understand why you ripped out those pages, and kept her death a secret?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Y - you - what? How…</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Don't make me keep repeating myself. I want the full story.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren is visibly distraught</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I didn't do anything - why would you think it was me?!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> I'm going to need a better answer than that. The amount of evidence you left in your wake was startling. It's already neatly packed away in documents, with much of it just waiting to be uncovered. Did you ever think that just rubbing out that date would suffice?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Al… Alright…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren pauses for an extended period of time, before continuing</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I asked George to cover for me that day… I had… I loved her… I didn't want her to forget.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren stops talking for a moment, attempting to regain composure</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I - I never realised the extent of it. Until… Until she - didn't come home…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren can be heard quietly sobbing</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Continue?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren attempts to clear the tears from his eyes</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I; I found the journal… I found out everything…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren takes a moment to collect himself, before speaking</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> On the last page. It said - something - about going to dig up the nest to find something… I ripped out those pages, and rushed to the nest as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> But by then it was already too late. The only thing left of her was a pool of blood, left to stain the forest floor… I tested it. It was her blood.</p>
<p><em>Mr Barnett takes a moment to process this, before asking</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> And then you called it in?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren musters the strength to say a single word</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Both Dr. Warren and Mr Barnett remain silent for a long period of time, before Mr Barnett speaks</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Very well. You will continue as head of SCP-9029 until a replacement researcher is found. Be thankful that demotion will be your only punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Barnett:</strong> Oh, and don't worry. You'll be catching up with Barnes soon enough. I'm sure he has plenty to say.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-04: SCP-9029-2 Mutation Analysis</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Following frequent testing, it has been noted that some of the general conditions required for an SCP-9029-2 infection to develop have changed. This was first noticed following the testing of an infected human tissue sample, taken from D-5487. SCP-9029-2 spores were extracted from this sample, and placed on a sample of exsanguinated human muscle tissue. Whilst the SCP-9029-2 instances initially began breaking down the muscle tissue, they did this at a far lower rate than previously observed.</p>
<p>Researchers involved in this test were immediately quarantined, after the exsanguinated tissue sample failed to show signs of degradation after 2 hours. All researchers involved in this test were found to be infected with SCP-9029-2 shortly after quarantine, and were promptly terminated through incineration. Analysis of the infected tissue sample following the incident has found that the tissue had been producing spores for approximately 1 hour before any change was noticed.</p>
<p>Dissection of the sample revealed that many new blood vessels had grown outwards from a small pulsating mass. This mass seems to be similar in structure to a small human heart, and continues functioning despite the notable lack of pacemaker cells. The blood mixture found in the blood vessels of the tissue sample has also shown to be identical in concentration to standard human blood, and has the same genetic composition as the surrounding muscle tissue. It has been concluded that the growth of a double circulatory system happened shortly after initial infection, and allowed the production of SCP-9029-2 spores at a significantly heightened rate.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown how SCP-9029-2 instances replicated haemoglobin, among other compounds found in human blood, despite no blood being initially present. This notable change in SCP-9029-2 following the presence of a limited supply of hosts suggests that SCP-9029-2 instances are capable of rapid and targeted mutations, allowing them to adapt quickly to different environments.</p>
<p>Following this incident, it has been decided to increase the frequency of testing on SCP-9029-2, to attempt to determine the limits of this adaptive ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-05: Outbreak Mitigation Efforts</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Approximately 3 months following the termination of SCP-9029-1, numerous reports of a 'flesh eating disease' from hospitals and the media have surfaced across Texas, Louisiana and Northern Mexico. This corresponded with the containment breach of a developed sample of SCP-9029-2, 2 weeks prior. This occurred due to the development of a mutation that allowed SCP-9029-2 instances to both bypass advanced air filtration systems, as well as allow them to remain undetected in the bloodstream of hosts. Whilst this breach was thought to be contained, the disease responsible for these reports was quickly confirmed to be SCP-9029-2, following Foundation autopsies on infected subjects. While a total death toll is currently unavailable, Foundation estimates place the number infected to be over 200,000.</p>
<p>The Foundation has administered warnings and significant medical aid through government agencies. The Foundation has also instructed these agencies to incinerate bodies infected with SCP-9029-2, to decrease the amount of ground that SCP-9029-2 instances are able to cover. Media coverage of this fact is to be censored, as to not promote widespread panic. While country wide quarantine has been advised, due to the wide distance that SCP-9029-2 spores are able to travel through the air, this will most likely be ineffective in preventing the spread of SCP-9029-2.</p>
<p>Foundation containment efforts are to be completely focused on the development of a cure for SCP-9029-2 effective immediately. Once the cure has been finalised, it is to be distributed through an established vaccine manufacturer.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, SCP-9029 is to be reclassified as hiemal.</p>

[BEGIN VIDEO/AUDIO LOG]</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> It has come to my attention that the recent outbreak of SCP-9029-2 has been caused by your actions, both for and against the Foundation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren remains silent</em></p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> Not only have you gone directly against Foundation protocol and risked the veil, your actions have caused the death of thousands. Do you have any idea what this means?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I… I know it's my fault… You - you have to listen to me.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> I'm listening, Dr. Warren.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren attempts to regain composure</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> You can't cure this… Not with science. This is a dead greenhouse scenario waiting to happen…</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> Continue?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> You need to break the veil. By the time you've made a cure, everyone will be dead. You need to use anomalies. SCP-████, SCP-████, hell, find a way to reproduce the panacea. Anything would be better than wasting away the Foundations capabilities on an impossible cure.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> I'm afraid you don't quite understand. SCP-9029-2, as deadly as it is, is just a pathogen. Nothing more. Such, the cure will be matching this.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren stares in disbelief</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Are you ready - willing - to risk the lives of billions. For the veil?! The veil was made for safety! You can't just leave humanity to fend for itself; from something we've created-</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> -Something that you've created. Never forget that. Humanity can fight this off on their own. I am not breaking the veil because of your mistakes. Mistakes which, may I add, got Dr. Barnes terminated.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren stares in disbelief at ██████████</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> So… George; never left.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warrens' disbelief warps into anger. He lunges towards ██████████, quickly pinning him against the wall</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Why?!</p>
<p><em>Multiple MTF operatives can be seen entering the room, quickly restraining Dr. Warren. ██████████ relaxes back into his chair</em></p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> His pathetic attempt to expose you told me everything I needed to know.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren looks towards ██████████ with disgust</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I should've known when I signed up to the Foundation. You care only for yourself.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> Very well.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-06: Management Notice</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Keller has replaced Dr. Warren, following his termination. Cure research will continue as previously stated.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-07: SCP-9029 Pandemic Alert</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>The development of a cure for SCP-9029-2 infections has been significantly slowed due to the rapid mutation observed in SCP-9029-2 instances, across various quarantined sectors. Despite recent containment efforts, SCP-9029-2 has rapidly spread across much of central and northern America. Major cities such as New York and Chicago are currently in anarchy, significantly impacting the global economy.</p>
<p>While the total death toll remains impossible to calculate, Foundation estimates place it at approximately 160 million, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in the southern states of the USA. While this is estimated to be due to the higher temperatures present, cases of SCP-9029-2 infections have also been confirmed across Canada, reaching as far as Dawson.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-9029-2 sampled from colder regions have shown to have a significantly different genetic makeup compared to instances sampled from warmer regions. This suggests that SCP-9029-2 instances are capable of rapidly adapting to extreme climates, allowing their infectivity to increase drastically. The cause for the rapid mutations has been attributed to the vast number of host subjects infected by SCP-9029-2. This suggests that SCP-9029-2 instances are capable of exponential targeted mutation, should they infect a sufficient number of subjects.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the number of hosts received by SCP-9029-2, the Foundation has taken full control of all remaining US military assets, across all branches. This has been done following a series of assassinations conducted by covert MTF operatives on high-ranking personnel within the US military. This transfer is known to very few of the remaining members of the US military. Should any members of the greater public be made aware of this, they are to be administered amnestics immediately, with any of their claims being heavily discredited.</p>
<p>This has allowed the Foundation to covertly issue a complete lockdown over the entirety of North America, significantly reducing the chance of SCP-9029-2 spreading across continents. Remaining citizens have been instructed to stay inside their homes until the situation is resolved. Large scale sabotage operations have also been conducted on North America's networking infrastructure, cutting off large portions of media coverage.</p>
<p>MTF BETA-7 "Maz Hatters" are to work in tandem with these assets in order to establish and maintain a perimeter around the SCP-9029-2 infected zone. Naval convoys have been put in place surrounding much of the American continent. All naval vessels spotted leaving North America are to be destroyed on sight. Propaganda campaigns have already been established, presenting North America as lost. These have so far prevented international trade from taking place with North America, significantly decreasing the number of naval vessels sighted.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-08: SCP-9029-2 Containment Revision</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>The American continent is to be considered lost. SCP-9029-2 instances were able to quickly spread across South America within days, rendering the last major population centres present in the Americas inhospitable. Clusters of biological mass infected with SCP-9029-2 have begun growing root systems across large areas of land, connecting many pockets of SCP-9029-2 together. This has vastly increased the rate of infection and spore production, as nutrients are able to be shared between different host bodies.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these root systems are similar in composition to human blood vessels, with the blood flowing through them sharing the genetic composition of multiple different hosts, often with varying blood types. The interaction between these different blood types does not seem to impact SCP-9029-2 instances in any way. Experimentation on SCP-9029-2 has become increasingly difficult to conduct due to the differing properties present in different instances of SCP-9029-2. Many southern strains of SCP-9029-2 have become unaffected by the advanced air filtration systems used in Foundation test sites, resulting in the loss of numerous Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>Foundation estimates place the total death toll caused by SCP-9029-2 at approximately 875 million. Remaining populations within the infected zone have fallen into anarchy. Following current rates, the human presence on the American continent is expected to end in under 2 weeks. It is currently unknown whether SCP-9029-2 spores are capable of traveling across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.</p>
<p>Following approval from the 05 council, all major airports and harbours in the American continent have been destroyed using a series of aerial attacks, using ballistic missiles. Many Foundation sites housing non-essential anomalies have also been remotely destroyed, as to prevent the acquisition of these anomalies by remaining groups of interest.</p>
<p>The collection of SCP-9029-2 instances from south America is to be strictly minimised, and is only to be taken for crucial experimentation. Further testing on SCP-9029-2 is strictly to be conducted on Foundation naval vessels, positioned over the South Atlantic Ocean. Should communications be lost with any of these vessels, they are to be destroyed remotely with upmost priority.</p>

<p><strong>Overseer Notice:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>There has been a significant number of internal sabotage attempts, across multiple branches of the Foundation. These sabotage attempts have resulted in multiple containment breaches, with a total death toll of 32 Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>The reason behind the increase in internal sabotage remains unclear, as all currently known culprits have refused to disclose any information. No relation between these culprits has been found.</p>
<p>For this reason, Foundation researchers are to be randomly entered for psychological evaluation effective immediately. It is hoped that this may expose the reason for these internal attacks. Personnel suspected to be involved in sabotage attempts are also to be evaluated, by threat of termination.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-09: Project Aurora</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>The successful development of a cure to SCP-9029-2 has been deemed impossible due to its increasingly volatile genetic composition. After careful consideration, research has begun on the creation of a targeted nano virus, for use against SCP-9029-2, codenamed 'project Aurora'. This is being done through the careful manipulation of receptors present on SCP-██████, allowing their frequency to be altered. Should this be successful, infected instances of SCP-9029-2 could be terminated remotely through the activation of a kill switch, present on SCP-████. The following are currently the most notable frequencies:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th><strong>Frequency</strong></th>
<th><strong>Result</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>B7</strong></td>
<td><strong>16% efficacy.</strong> Numerous personnel began showing symptoms of infection almost immediately after the test was completed. The vessel was detonated remotely quickly thereafter. Overhead drone footage confirmed no survivors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>E73</strong></td>
<td><strong>23% efficacy.</strong> The experiment was conducted in a hermetically sealed metal chamber by multiple D-class personnel. The chamber was immediately disposed into the ocean following the experiment. No efforts were made to extract the D-class personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>E103</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unknown.</strong> Remote countermeasures did not activate. The vessel is to be considered lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>C21</strong></td>
<td><strong>49% efficacy.</strong> Dr. Jordan Stevens attempted direct sabotage on the vessel's crew and countermeasures, resulting in the infection of three Foundation personnel. All personnel present on this vessel were subsequently terminated remotely using backup incendiary explosives. The reason of Dr. Jordan Stevens's sabotage is currently unknown.</td>

<p>Research into this incident is currently ongoing.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-10: SCP-9029-3 analysis</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>It would seem that new strains of SCP-9029-2 are capable of forming animate organisms from infected tissue. These organisms, known hereby as SCP-9029-3, take various forms, seemingly dependent on the levels of armament possessed by the Foundation team sighting them. Instances of SCP-9029-3 have been described by most accounts as bipedal, approximately 3 metres in height and with a vaguely humanoid shape. The size and number of appendages present on instances of SCP-9029-3 vary significantly, with some instances having upwards of 6 armlike limbs. Appendages often end in a brittle pointed structure, theorized to be composed of human keratin.</p>
<p>While instances of SCP-9029-3 are believed to possess a complete double circulatory system, more detailed examinations have shown to be impossible to conduct, due to their tendency to transmute into SCP-9029-2 instances following capture. Providing that the total mass of this SCP-9029-2 instance has not been significantly altered, it is then capable of transmuting back into an instance of SCP-9029-3. This allows SCP-9029-3 instances to effectively 'reanimate', should they be significantly injured, making them significantly more difficult to destroy.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-9029-3 are extremely hostile, and will attempt to incapacitate and incorporate large organisms into their mass. While most instances of SCP-9029-3 can be significantly slowed through the use of kinetic weapons, incineration is currently the only known method to completely destroy SCP-9029-3 instances, preventing reanimation from taking place. Many Foundation personnel attacked by SCP-9029-3 instances have been found to be infected with SCP-9029-2, despite no physical contact taking place. Due to this, it has been theorized that instances of SCP-9029-3 passively release SCP-9029-2 spores into the surrounding environment, although this has yet to be proven.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Project Aurora progress update:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>72% efficacy.</strong> Activation of the kill switch causes SCP-9029-2 samples to rapidly degrade on a molecular level. SCP-██████ instances are infrequently transmitted to other SCP-9029-2 instances in close proximity. This rate of transition is significantly affected by the ambient temperature, with infectivity being nullified in temperatures lower than 5 degrees Celsius.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-11: SCP-9029-3 Revision</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Further research suggests that SCP-9029-3 instances will only manifest from SCP-9029-2 if a large organism is nearby, and will de-manifest back into SCP-9029-2 once this organism has been incorporated into their mass. This allows SCP-9029-2 infected zones to be traversed safely through the use of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>It has also been found that SCP-9029-3 instances exclusively target individuals that are already infected with SCP-9029-2. For this reason, should instances of SCP-9029-3 manifest near any Foundation team, all Foundation vessels nearby should be immediately relocated away from the coastline until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>Overseer Notice:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>As of writing, approximately 10% of Foundation personnel have been entered for psychological evaluation over the course of three months, yielding no notable findings. The number of internal attacks has continued rising, resulting in the loss of a further 136 Foundation personnel, as well as the destruction of seven Foundation vessels.</p>
<p>Many Foundation researchers have also begun defecting to other groups of interest, such as the Global Occult Coalition and Chaos Insurgency, resulting in the loss of numerous high value anomalies.</p>
<p>Due to the stable mental state that defecting researchers have been found in, it is suspected that personnel involved in these attacks may be under the influence of an unknown, mind-altering anomaly.</p>
<p>Due to this possibility, MTF ALPHA-1 "Red Right Hand" has been instructed to monitor the activities of all Foundation personnel below level (3) clearance. It is hoped that this may reveal the location and nature of the anomaly responsible. Should this anomaly be found, it is to be destroyed with upmost priority.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9029-12: SCP-9029-2 Outbreak</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-9029-2 has reached the southern coast of Russia, proliferating across Magadan and Nelkan. The outbreak has so far been limited to only a few hundred cases, and mass scale evacuations across Siberia are underway.</p>
<p>With the consent of the Russian government, tactical nuclear warheads have been utilised to create a dividing line across eastern Siberia, as well as to terminate all instances of SCP-9029-2 in Magadan and Nelkan. It is hoped that this will delay the advance of SCP-9029-2 until project Aurora is completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Project Aurora progress update:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>89% efficacy.</strong> SCP-██████ instances are now far more infective, with instances of SCP-9029-2 being at risk of infection as much as 50 metres away from another infected instance. However, SCP-██████ instances will now often self-destruct before fully eliminating an SCP-9029-2 mass, should the kill switch be activated. As a result, SCP-██████ instances may have to be distributed repeatedly within a region to have a significant effect, significantly slowing termination efforts.</p>
<p>Distribution of this incomplete frequency is currently being considered by the 05 council.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 9029-13:</strong> █████████████████████████</p>
<hr/>
<p>Project Aurora is complete. Millions of SCP-██████ instances set to the Y45 frequency have been replicated within Site-300, and are being stored within hermetically sealed steel containers. This frequency has been found to have a 98% efficacy in both transmitting between and terminating instances of SCP-9029-2. Aerial distribution has begun over large parts of Scandinavia and North America.</p>
<p>Current Foundation estimates suggest approximately 90% of the total mass of SCP-9029-2 will be infected by SCP-██████ within 4 days. The kill switch is not to be activated until authorised by the 05 council.</p>

<strong>Calvin Keller</strong> (SCP-9029 Head Researcher)<br/>
████████████████████████████<br/>
<strong>—————————————————————————————————————————</strong><br/>
[BEGIN VIDEO/AUDIO LOG]</p>
<p><strong>██████████:</strong> I understand you've requested me here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Yes. Project Aurora is finally complete. Almost all SCP-9029-2 instances are currently at the mercy of the Foundation, save for a few.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Keller pauses for a moment, surveying ██████████'s indifferent expression</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I was hoping you would allow us to refrain from executing project Aurora. You see, the team hasn't been working well of late.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> Continue?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I have reason to suspect that there is sabotage at play.</p>
<p><em>A faint flicker of shock registers on ██████████'s face, before it is quickly silenced</em></p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> You see, some things just don't add up. That boat for example - the one that went missing. The boat should've been blown into oblivion, but the countermeasures didn't work. The chance of one malfunctioning is astronomically low - but both? Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> No one on that vessel had any knowledge of the second countermeasure. I doubt anyone would've even had the skill to disarm it. This was an outside job - through and through.</p>
<p><em>██████████ takes a moment to consider</em></p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> What makes you suspect someone on your team? Surely any Foundation member could've sabotaged the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I'm almost certain that the countermeasures were deactivated remotely. The only terminals with access to those countermeasures are on this site. The only ones with admin are members of our research team.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong>If a site terminal was used, all of the inputs would have been recorded. Why haven't you already checked through them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I've had my eyes on Dr. Joe Feron for quite some time now. He's always messing up research, getting mixed up with safety protocols. People have died because of him. But he's also a great technician. Knowledgeable with code. I don't doubt that he could've erased his inputs, and replaced them with the activation code. No one would suspect anything other than mechanical failure.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> I see… So, what are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I need you to delay the distribution of SCP-██████ long enough to let me figure out the truth. I understand that we have no time to spare, but those instances could be dangerous. We can't trust the tests anymore.</p>
<p>██████████<strong>:</strong> They've been tested by many different researchers all over the Foundation. No one could've tampered with those findings.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Only ever on small sample sizes. We have no clue of the effects that SCP-██████ could have on the environment</p>
<p><em>██████████ takes a moment to consider</em></p>
<p><strong>██████████:</strong> I can organise an investigation into Dr. Joe Feron. If he's truly the man you think he is, we'll know. But I can't let you delay. We have countless containment sites all over Russia. If we don't put an end to this quickly, we'll lose all the facilities we have left.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Keller answers in a desperate tone</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> What good is distributing the cure if everyone dies starving! You must understand the risk-</p>
<p><strong>██████████:</strong> -If we wait humanity will surely face extinction. I think I'll take the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> We don't know what Joe could have done! It could…</p>
<p><em>Dr. pauses for a moment, as if reconsidering</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> This may be your last chance to save humanity. To save yourself. There will be no turning back.</p>
<p><strong>██████████:</strong> I agree. My word is final.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Keller remains silent, observing ██████████</em></p>
<p><em>██████████ gets up to leave</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Keller sighs. His tone darkens</em></p>
<p>[VIDEO FEED IS LOST]</p>
<p><em>The doorknob can be heard rattling</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> That's quite the shame. I wish you could have seen the other side.</p>
<p><em>Frantic pacing can be heard</em></p>
<p><strong>██████████:</strong> What is this!-</p>
<p><em>The sound of a gunshot resonates through the feed</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Researcher's Note:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The time has finally come</em></p>
<p>It was not long after my transfer that the cure was blessed upon me. I remember how it felt to have the pestilence rid from my flesh. To become something greater than myself. To watch the sun set on that blessed day.</p>
<p>I was fearful. That night I couldn’t sleep. Yet I dreamt. I dreamt of a world devoid of the all-consuming plagues. A world where the elements governed themselves. And then I understood.</p>
<p>So I waited patiently. I fulfilled all the menial tasks given to me, all while the Foundation lost its grip over the new world. But I could only wait so long. I devised a plan. An anomalous weapon, capable of ridding the world of its final plague.</p>
<p>And now it’s over. We won. For all my respect to Gaia… She could never understand. This had to be done. When we wake there will be no more plagues, no more pestilence.</p>
<p>It’s funny, really. I could keep it all going. I have the kill switch right here. But how weak I would have to be to flick it. I must be patient. The time will come. But to you. Well… Your time has run out.</p>
<p>I was naïve then. I thought the 05 indestructible. I even believed that your eyes would see through the façade of my actions, that my very creation would silence the hope for a better world. But following my conversation with 05-8, I realise just how mortal you really are.</p>
<p>You cannot hope to contain us - it was always going to end like this. Your mere attempt was insulting… Still, I am truly grateful that your Foundation set us free. I hope that you will allow me to return the favour.</p>
<p>Samples of the cure have been dispersed in Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai and Delhi, among other major metropolitan areas. It is to my greatest regret that tactical nuclear warheads have been used on various military centres and embassies. This didn't need to happen. We just needed more time…</p>
<p>How characteristic of the pestilence, to strive to fight an unwinnable war, even when hope is truly lost. I can only hope their sacrifice will not be in vain.</p>
<p>SCP-610 has been terminated by the cured. Those vile creatures were far beyond saving. Numerous sites have been instructed to detonate their on-site alpha warhead. The Foundation’s structure has allowed us to cull many remaining anomalies with ease. The cured have determined the surviving anomalies to have been rid of the pestilence.</p>
<p>As of writing, the war is nearly over. The cured have been used to crush the last remaining strongholds of humanity. The only people left lie counting their time, living in borrowed tombs.</p>
<p>It’s not long until their need for sustenance brings them to our world. Not long until the pestilence is vanquished. Not long… Until I flick this switch.</p>
<p>Nothing is permanent. There is no structure in this world that will not, one day, return to dust. We can only hope tomorrow will have a brighter sunrise.</p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p>
