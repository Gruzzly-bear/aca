<p>An SCP-4041 event in progress.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4041</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The DYNASTY Protocol is currently in effect, and is to be maintained indefinitely. Birds injured by SCP-4041-1 are to be explained under the cover story of predatory birds consuming toxic materials. Civilians witnessing or interacting with SCP-4041-1 are to be amnesticized.</p>
<p>The DYNASTY Protocol is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete infiltration of the paleontology field by Foundation personnel.</li>
<li>Surrounding planned and current paleontological dig sites, both <a href="scp-4003.html">anomalous</a> and nonanomalous, with anti-avian measures prior to excavation.</li>
<li>Widespread declaration that the theory suggesting that birds evolved from dinosaurs is obsolete.</li>
<li>Use of memetic agents embedded in educational media to reinforce that birds and dinosaurs are unrelated, and that no dinosaurs ever possessed feathers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4041 is a phenomenon involving anomalous coordinated behavior among various species of birds.</p>
<p>SCP-4041 events begin as ordinary flocks. The flock will stay close to the ground, often generating large clouds of dust or dirt. High-speed cameras trained on SCP-4041 events have detected small groups of birds within the flock attaching their wingtips together to form rings before dispersing again in a very short burst of light. Observation of SCP-4041 events has not shown any inherent pattern in these lights.</p>
<p>Excavation of the ground beneath SCP-4041 events will often (~70%) uncover various dinosaur fossils. Rarely, this will occur even in locations previously shown to have been completely excavated for fossils. Fossils discovered after SCP-4041 events are always of theropod dinosaurs, often coelurosaurians<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The variety and quantity of the fossils increase with the number of birds in the SCP-4041 flock.</p>
<p>Fossils located via SCP-4041 appear nonanomalous. They exhibit a high degree of preservation and detail, with feather imprints and skulls often intact; all fossils match generally accepted taxonomic timelines. Eleven new species and seventeen new subspecies have been tentatively accepted by Foundation paleontologists.</p>
<p>SCP-4041-1 instances are translucent Class III Incorporeal Entities, and resemble theropod dinosaurs in various states of decomposition. All instances with visible skin lack feathers.</p>

<p><strong>16:14</strong> Four MTF Phi-2 agents arrive on the scene, and enter from the back of the conference room. Three instances of SCP-4041-1 are present; two indistinct raptors and one <em>Deinocheirus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. The raptors have bitten five researchers already, while the <em>Deinocheirus</em> stands over one attendee.</p>
<p><strong>16:15</strong> Phi-2 agents fire at the raptors, to no effect.</p>
<p><strong>16:17</strong> Phi-2 leader charges the raptors, flanked by her teammates, and vocally imitates tyrannosaur roars to challenge them. The raptors retreat. Site-wide evacuation commences.</p>
<p><strong>16:20</strong> The raptors call to the Deinocheirus. It crouches over the prone attendee (identified as Dr. Karina Barrera), then joins the raptors.</p>
<p><strong>16:22</strong> The Deinocheirus charges, knocks over one agent, and swats another with its tail. Several attendees are trampled.</p>
<p><strong>16:27</strong> One raptor solidifies to bite on an attendee's leg; an agent shoots it in the head. The raptor screeches and disintegrates in a cloud of purple smoke.</p>
<p><strong>16:31:</strong> The Deinocheirus attempts to flee, picking up Dr. Barrera and carrying her on its back.</p>
<p><strong>16:33</strong> Mu-13 agents arrive and neutralize the remaining raptor instance using spectral weaponry. Phi-2 leader recommends capture of the Deinocheirus.</p>
<p><strong>16:36</strong> Following setup by Mu-13 agents, Phi-2 agents use dinosaur calls to herd the Deinocheirus into the CHALICE-class spectral containment ring, which activates and successfully contains the instance.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Phi-2 Agent Angelica Iglesias<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dr. Karina Barrera</p>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> State your name, for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Doctor Karina Maria Barrera Campaña.</p>
<p>(<em>Iglesias places a large file folder on the table.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> How's your arm?</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> Just a scratch. Look, Karina, let's just get through this. Right now I want to know exactly what went down at the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Ghost dinosaurs. Not the weirdest thing in our world.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> Come on. I've read the 4041 documentation, I know there's ghost dinosaurs. What I want to know is how you got through without a scratch while 16 other people have Jurassic Park scars.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Jig's up, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> What the hell did you do?</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Right, so remember that paper I published in '07? The one about ornithomimoids and striations on their arms and wing anchoring bones.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> Yeah, of course. Read all your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Yeah… okay so, that wasn't <em>all</em> me.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> I know you're not a plagiarist, Karina. Get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Okay okay. Three weeks before the submission deadline I had a dream. I dreamed of a <em>Deinocheirus</em> and a <em>Gallimimus</em> and a couple others. They showed up in my room, but they weren't ghostly at all. They were fully fleshed out, most vibrant colored scales I'd ever seen. Not a single feather on 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> Right. And this… fever dream inspired you to crank out that paper?</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> <em>Sí.</em> They stood different, looked different — nothing about them fit the standard model. I went back into our database and cross-referenced the records, but ignored all fossils associated with SCP-4041. What I ended up with didn't look like the standard model at all. They looked like the things in my dream.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> Wait, so what are you saying —</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Doesn't it strike you as just a <em>little</em> suspicious how perfect the 4041 fossils are? They're <em>too</em> well-preserved. You got feather imprints on a Troodon in the same formation as a single fragmented Triceratops foot. It's like a murder scene with the fingerprinted gun left behind with a confession note.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> I mean, there's plenty of other ways to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> Yeah, that's what I thought, too. So I decided to test it: I got to work publishing articles critical of the standard model. And you know what happened? Every time I exposed a flaw, someone found an answer. Sternum not the right shape to support a transition? Next 4041 fossil, there it is.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> But… why? Why would anyone do something like this? Who would want to create an entirely false fossil record?</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> (<em>sighs</em>) You're gonna think I'm crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Iglesias:</strong> At this point, I don't think anything is too crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Barrera:</strong> (<em>whispers</em>) I think it's the birds.<br/>
