<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Explained</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lake ███████ is to be monitored for appearances of SCP-1933. Civilians approaching the Lake are to be turned away on the grounds of the area being scouted out for construction. Due to SCP-1933's memetic effects, removal from the Lake is highly unlikely to occur. Individuals who claim to have seen SCP-1933 are to be administered Class A amnestics, and released. Personnel being transferred to research SCP-1933 are not to be informed of SCP-1933 or any documentation regarding it until they have observed SCP-1933 firsthand. Individuals discovering this document without having first seen SCP-1933 are advised to immediately exit this document, and contact Dr. B. Reynard as soon as possible for Class A amnestics, or observation of SCP-1933.</span> No special containment procedures are required for SCP-1933-EX at this time. Distribution of Class A amnestics to subjects who claim to have observed SCP-1933-EX is currently discontinued.</p>
<p><strong>Description (REVISED):</strong> SCP-1933-EX is allegedly a creature measuring an estimated 6 to 8 meters in length, residing in Lake ███████, British Columbia. Exact details vary from report to report, but SCP-1933-EX is almost always reported to have a long, serpent-like neck and head, a similarly long tail, dark blue coloration, and long, leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. However, SCP-1933-EX has been, in each report of sighting, quickly determined to have been a misidentified common occurrence, such as a large piece of driftwood, large eel or fish, or simple unreliable testimony. Recovered 'footage' of SCP-1933-EX has been easily explained by photo or video manipulation, or intentional staging to simulate an SCP-1933-EX encounter. It is most likely that reports of SCP-1933-EX are the result of subjects being influenced by local myths and legends.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1933 is an unidentified aquatic creature, measuring an estimated 6-8 meters in length, residing in Lake ███████, British Columbia. SCP-1933 is dark blue in coloration, possessing a long, smooth neck and tail, a serpentine head, and numerous leaf-like protrusions running from the base of its head to the end of its body. Details regarding the lower half of SCP-1933's body are predominately unknown, as it has never been observed to beach itself, or surface more than its neck and upper half of its body. As SCP-1933 does not appear to possess gills, it is currently theorized to reside in an underwater cave, which is currently being searched for using sonar. SCP-1933 has been observed camouflaging itself with aquatic plants or fallen trees, and ambushing large prey that approaches the water, as well as preying on passing birds and fish. SCP-1933 has been observed to actively avoid boats in most situations, but has occasionally attacked solitary humans entering or around the lake.</p>
<p>SCP-1933 possesses a secondary effect, possibly memetic in nature, that causes those who become aware of it from any method except firsthand experience, (including documentation, personal testimony, or video or photo evidence) to become extremely unwilling to consider its existence. This can include finding flaws in a subject's testimony that are not actually present, seeing 'wires' 'animatronics', or 'photo-manipulation' where none are present, or verbally shutting down conversation regarding SCP-1933. This is thought to be the result of a defense mechanism designed to keep potential prey from becoming wary of approaching the lake. While this has caused significant delay in documentation and observation of SCP-1933, it has expedited ensuring civilians do not become aware of SCP-1933. At time of writing, only a small group of researchers are aware of SCP-1933, and a way of informing the rest of the Foundation of its existence, allowing more effective containment, is being researched.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On ██/██/████, an experiment with the intent of proving the existence of SCP-1933 to the rest of the Foundation will take place. SCP-1933 will be lured to the surface using the carcass of one elk, deposited in the middle of Lake ███████ by boat. Dr. Reynard will then contact MTF Eta-10 ("See No Evil") and attempt to live stream an appearance of SCP-1933 directly to them. If this is a success, then we will have taken the first step in successfully containing SCP-1933. If not, then we're probably going to all be brought in for questioning and/or amnestic treatments. Either way, it's been a pleasure working with you all. - B. Reynard</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-1933-EX was reclassified to 'Explained' after a group of researchers led by Dr. B. Reynard contacted MTF Eta-10 ("See No Evil") claiming to have evidence of a possible new cognitohazardous entity, which would be demonstrated to them over a private internet live stream. Eta-10 personnel viewing the live stream reported that the researchers had constructed an animatronic to resemble the entity they were referring to, which rose out of the lake and dragged under the carcass of an elk. These researchers were quickly located and brought in for questioning. Dr. Reynard was reprimanded for abuse and waste of Foundation resources.</p>
Dr. Reynard was discovered to have been drowned in Lake ███████ roughly a week after the reclassification of SCP-1933-EX in an unrelated boating accident<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Allegations that Dr. Reynard appeared to have been (sic) 'half-eaten' are currently under investigation. Official cause of death is believed to be drowning after extensive blood loss due to injury from a boat propeller.<br/>
