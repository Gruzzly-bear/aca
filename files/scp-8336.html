            <h1>SCP-8336</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8336</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Relevant footage is to be stored within the Site-243 databank for safekeeping.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8336 refers to the anomalous sequence of events leading up to the death of Site-243 Director Jackie Barker.</p>
<p>On March 31, 2009, Barker engaged in a foundation-related phone call while driving through his hometown of Glen Avon, California. Only an hour hour later, at 4:18 PM, a report was filed to local authorities concerning a bloodied human corpse laying in the streets of northeastern Sunnyslope, less than five miles from Barker's previous location.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, foundation personnel identified the corpse to be of Director Barker, with the only item of significance still found on person being a disconnected dashboard camera; the location of his car never ascertained. Postmortem examinations revealed an "immensely irregular amount of both internal and external hemorrhaging", despite no visible lacerations, punctures, or fractures.</p>
<p>Beyond this incident, all other traces of SCP-8336 were only established in the recovered dashboard footage of Barker's drive.<br/>

<strong>Addendum:</strong> An edited transcript of the aforementioned evidence has been included below.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The camera faces the front windshield, where dry suburban streets can be seen cast under harsh sunlight.</p>

<p><strong>16:01:01</strong> | (Barker keeps driving, and turns left at an empty uncontrolled intersection. He idly mumbles the lyrics to himself.)</p>
<p><strong>16:01:21</strong> | (Abruptly, Barker turns silent.)</p>
<p><strong>16:01:29</strong> | (He slows the car to a halt. The street ahead appears perfectly innocuous, although devoid of people.)</p>
<p><strong>16:01:35</strong> | "What the…?"</p>
<p>Further analysis reveals that every suburban home past the intersection completely differs from their usual geographical equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>16:01:39</strong> | "W… Wha-"</p>
<p><strong>16:01:40</strong> | <em>Psst.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:01:41</strong> | (An abrasive noise akin to a high-pitched buzz fills the car.)</p>
<p><strong>16:01:42</strong> | (Barker can be heard gasping an indistinct expletive.)</p>
<p><strong>16:01:43</strong> | (A single shade of deep crimson consumes everything in frame.)</p>

<hr/>
<p>Footage immediately cuts forward by precisely a minute, removing all prior hints of crimson. The car has not moved. It is uncertain whether Barker experienced the gap in time.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…God…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Buzzing]</p>
<p>The radio continues to broadcast the aforementioned noise, but at a much softer volume.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…What the hell is-"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Rock in the empire! Good afternoon on 24.3 NSECT Rocks, the ultimate hot-spot for the hottest rock music around!</em> [Distorted cheering]</p>
<p>It sounds like an old man trying to imitate the voice of someone much more youthful and energetic.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Hello!? Who-… 24.3? That's not even a damn valid frequency."</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>That last song was only a sweet taste of today's platter! Next up is</em>-</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Stop! Stop. What's your issue with me?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>…</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "You're referencing Site-243, aren't you? Why?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>…</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Distorted applause]</p>
<p>Without warning, the car begins moving forward, presumably against Barker's control.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Oh-… Really!?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Unintelligible laugh track, looped]</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "What do you want? Just TELL me!" (Muffled by laugh track.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | (Barker can be heard fumbling with the door handle, vigorously striking against the driver window. His breathing becomes stilted)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "F-Fuck… Can you at least quit the damn noise?" (Muffled by laugh track.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Laughing fades]</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Please, just…identify yourself."</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>…</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Please."</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>…</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Isn't this weather nice?</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "This…weather?"</p>
<p>The unswerving road ahead is smothered in blinding heat. An end can't be seen.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Yep…</em> (It laughs, wryly.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Buzzing]</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…Who are you?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>The Mosquito.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | (Radio shuts off.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…What?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Are-… Are you serious? Are you fucking serious? You're already leaving me here!? You fucking worthless piece of-…!"</p>
<p>Barker becomes quiet.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…W-What the hell am I supposed to…do…?"</p>
<p>The car continues onwards.</p>

<p>Fourty minutes elapse. Barker is alone.</p>

<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Piercingly loud garbled static]</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "-n! Oh, fuck OFF!"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | (Barker angrily slams down on the dashboard radio.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | [Distorted laugh track]</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Ah, I thought you loved that song?</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "This doesn't-"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>I only exemplified your favorite parts!</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>16:02:43</strong> | "…Where are you taking me? This obviously isn't normal Glen Avon. The houses, they've been-… They've been getting more…wrong? I don't even…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>The destination doesn't matter! It's about the trip and what you learn.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "I'm… I'm basically just a fucking office manager. What possible reason could you have to target me specifically? You're interested in the foundation, aren't you? Can't you go shit on someone more important?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Hm.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | <em>Check your right hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:43</strong> | "Huh…?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | (There is an abrupt splatter of crimson across the internal windshield. For a brief moment, Barker can be heard screaming while writhing in his seat.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>…you-… unfold-… with every mistake-…</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><em>The Beatles</em> - <em>While My Guitar Gently Weeps</em></span> [Warped music]</p>

<hr/>
<p>The amount of time passed is uncertain. Rather than an endless suburban street, the horizon now vaguely resembles the Colorado desert. Pristine houses are replaced with destitute wreckage. The red stain remains fresh.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | (Barker can be heard groaning.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "…Please…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "…God…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>Shouldn't you know not to take your anger out on those around you?</em></p>

<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "…Fuck you."</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>Ah.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | [Buzzing]</p>
<p>Both voices linger in monotony while the endless road persists. The blaring sun hovers only slightly within view.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "…Do you want me to give you something of value? Is that what you fucking want? Or am I just here to get tortured for no damn reason?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>Neither.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:24</strong> | "Right, of course…" (He scoffs, weakly.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>You know there's a reason, Barker.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "I-… What?"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>You should've stopped lying after today's phone call.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | (An intense clatter overtakes all other audio. The entire frame shakes, as a flood of viscous crimson pours down the external windshield. It is raining from above.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | (The noise is deafening. Footage darkens.)</p>
<p>Within seconds, the interior is ridden of all natural light. Audio returns to clarity.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | (Barker can be heard hyperventilating in distress.)</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>You proclaim yourself as so deeply unimportant, until that status no longer benefits you. Isn't that right?</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>Isn't that right, Barker?</em></p>
<p>It's voice, aged and rusty, is no longer putting up any imitation.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "S-Shit-… Please, ple-…"</p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | "…ghh…"</p>

<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>The Mosquito. Didn't I already say?</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>Although, even if I didn't say, you know who I am.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:02:44</strong> | <em>You're a religious man, after all.</em></p>
