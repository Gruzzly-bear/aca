            <h1>SCP-6088</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6088</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation agents embedded within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are to periodically search through all stored records and check for signs of SCP-6088. In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA's Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious <em>Herald</em> space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time — the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.</p>
<p>Alterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to <em>Herald</em> as a counterpart to <em>Voyager</em>, usually replacing <em>Voyager 2</em> in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of <em>Voyager 2</em> are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of <em>Herald</em>, and what information is provided does not give any wider context.</p>
<p>Mentions of a 'Black Accusation' — a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em> — are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.</p>
