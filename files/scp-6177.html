<p>SCP-6177's primary containment unit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The remains of SCP-6177 are stored in the Site-12 morgue.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6177 was a 14-year-old human male suffering from an anomalous form of Werner Syndrome<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Symptoms developed faster than average and all biological objects within 12.6 meters of SCP-6177 also began aging at an accelerated rate. This rate would frequently fluctuate with the highest recorded rate being 3.153x 10<sup>4</sup> times faster.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-6177 was taken into Foundation custody after an incident at Seven Lakes Junior High School in Katy, Texas on 03/11/19. A total of 12 civilians had developed symptoms of SCP-6177's anomalous effect. 11 of the affected displayed nominal visible signs, were amnesticized and returned to society. 1 was deemed unfit to return and is currently in Foundation custody.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I’m afraid I can’t tell you that either.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Of course, you can’t. Because you people are all fucking crazy. You do know this is illegal, right? My uncle is a lawyer and with the amount of rights violations you've committed, you're going to be screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I don't think you'll have to worry about that. And you must understand no one is trying to punish you. This is for your safety.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Bullshit, I know what this is. You're gonna run all sorts of tests on me. You're gonna cut me open to see what makes me tick isn't that right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Okay-</p>

<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Intake Interview</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> So when did you find out you had these abilities?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I'm not sure, I guess if I thought about it I'd say I’ve always had them. Little things you know. Like food in the refrigerator would always expire a little too soon. And my mom’s friends are always asking if she’s been sick when they see her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> So there were never any incidents like the one that took place yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I suppose once or twice it has gotten me into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Could you elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I remember one summer when I was six or seven my dad planted a garden. He had tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, peppers, the whole shebang. And by this point they had a pretty good idea of what was going on, so he always told me that I was never to go near the garden. Now I mean c’mon. What is a kid that age going to do the first chance they get? So one afternoon when my Mom and Dad were busy with something I walked down the little stone path to the back of our property where he kept his pride and joy. And it was beautiful. You could actually see the flowers bloom and slowly turn into different kinds of fruit. Like it was a timelapse. But then he caught me. And I panicked. Of course. And that was it. No more garden. I think that was the only time my dad yelled at me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> So this was the first instance you can remember a rapid increase in the intensity of your anomalous effect?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> And would you say the emotional stress was the trigger for this increase?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I don’t know. I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> And what triggered the outburst yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I told you this only works if you are completely honest with us. I can personally guarantee this information will not be shared with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Do you promise?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I do.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> If I tell you, do you think you can get me something to do here? Like anything. I don’t think I’ve ever been more bored in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I’m sure we can help you with that. But first, what happened immediately prior to the incident?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> So there was this boy and we had been spending a lot of time together. You know just talking, walking home together. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> And would this boy be Brian Ortega?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Connard holds up a 7th-grade yearbook photo of Brian</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><em>pause</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Well, we had been hanging out, so one day he told me he and a couple of his friends were gonna break into the school after hours. Just for kicks. Some high school boy had snuck a bottle from his dad’s liquor cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> And you weren’t concerned about the potential legal repercussions of trespassing, not to mention underage drinking?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6177 shrugs</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I mean I guess. I didn’t really think about it that way. So I decided to tag along. And after a couple of hours of drinking and fooling around in the gymnasium he um… well he…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> He… Well, I guess we…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> He kissed me.</p>
<p><em>pause</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Go on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Well, he kissed me and everything started to feel weird.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Weird how?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> My heart started beating really fast and everything looked like it was far away. I thought I was going to faint but then Brian started screaming. He was getting bigger. The top two buttons of his shirt came undone and he started to just look older. And older. And older. And I just sat there. I couldn’t move. All I could do was watch as he screamed and screamed. But I couldn’t see his face. His hair had completely covered it like a big mop. The roots were white. By the time everything calmed down and the other boys came back with the security guard. He was just lying there breathing. He sounded so hoarse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Thank you for sharin-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Well yes, we currently have him in our private medical unit. But, he hasn't been very responsive.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Unfortunately, that is going to be impossible.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>A small cluster of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) sprouts 4 meters to the east of SCP-6177 and it begins to limp towards them.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> What are you doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I want to go smell the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>Before SCP-6177 can reach them, the lavender begins to wilt and decay.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> Oh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>After a few moments SCP-6177 reaches the dead patch. It lets out a small sigh and with a groan sits down.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> There is a cluster of sunflowers behind you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> What?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Dead ones are being replaced by new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>SCP-6177 looks behind it for a moment then looks down at its legs.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I can't.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> (whispering) I can't stand up. It's finally chewed them off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>SCP-6177 begins to cry</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Guard 2:</strong> Sir?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>Dr. Connard motions for silence</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I stopped for just a second and it tore them clean off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>(pause)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> I just can't do it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Can't do what?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> ANY OF IT!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>(pause)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> It's not fair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> …I know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>A few moments pass and SCP-6177 leans back to lie down. The grass is over 2 feet tall now and completely obscures SCP-6177.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Guard 2:</strong> I've lost line of sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Guard 1:</strong> Ditto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I'm afraid I need you to sit back up. We need to be able to see you at all times while you are outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>SCP-6177 grunts multiple times and returns to a sitting position</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>SCP-6177:</strong> (Sobbing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to- I wasn't trying to-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> It's okay. I'm sure you're just tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>The next 12 minutes pass. SCP-6177 weeps quietly as it runs its hands through the grass. Mumbling is heard but can't be discerned.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> It has been twenty minutes. I'm going to need you to start heading back inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>No response.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> I repeat, please get up and return to your containment chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>No response.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Hello can you hear me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>No response.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>Dr. Connard:</strong> Hello?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>All activity inside ECS 27 ceases. There is no sign that SCP-6177's anomalous effect is present.</em></span></p>
