            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures Revision 11-8:</strong> SCP-3145 is to be contained in a sealed container, itself sealed within 40 layers of lead-lined steel, with each layer separated by no less than 36 cm of empty space. Support struts between layers should be placed randomly. Container is to remain suspended via ELO-IID electromagnetic support no less than 60 cm from any surface.</p>
<p>A secondary containment area is to be constructed of 16 spherical cells, each filled with various fluids and a random assembly of surfaces and supports. This area is to be fitted with light systems capable of flooding the entire assembly with no less than 80,000 lumens of light instantly and without direct human involvement. Both containment areas are to remain under 24 hour surveillance.</p>
<p>No physical interaction with SCP-3145 is to be allowed at any time. Any testing must be approved by at least two-thirds vote from O5-Command and must be undertaken in AR-II maximum security sites after a general non-essential staff evacuation. All staff are to remain at least 60 m away from the containment cell at all times, except during breach events.</p>
<p>Any corrosion observed on any surface, staff member or other location within 200 m of SCP-3145 is to be immediately reported to site security. No recovery attempts are to be made for objects or personnel lost to SCP-3145.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3145 is a humanoid entity of somewhat variable appearance that appears to be in an advanced state of decomposition. Despite this, SCP-3145 is animate, though it spends most of its time motionless, often for days at a time. When active, SCP-3145 will attack its favored prey (humans between 10 and 25 years of age), damaging major organs, muscle groups or tendons to disable subjects before pulling them into its pocket dimension. Despite not being particularly agile, SCP-3145 can scale any vertical surface and remain suspended upside-down indefinitely.</p>
<p>SCP-3145 induces corrosion in all solid matter several seconds after contact. This takes the form of rusting, rotting and cracking of material, along with the production of a black mucus. This effect is particularly detrimental to living tissues, which appear to be pre-digested over the course of 6 hours after contact.</p>
<p>SCP-3145 is capable of entering solid matter and vanishing into its pocket dimension, leaving behind a large patch of corrosive mucus. SCP-3145 can then exit this extradimensional location from any point physically connected to the initial entry point. Limited observation of this space has shown it to be comprised of an apparently endless series of hallways and rooms. SCP-3145 will trap its prey in the space and toy with them, often keeping them alive for days.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Falzon, Researcher, SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> During a breach event, SCP-3145 paused outside an observation booth and addressed Dr. Falzon, who had been attempting to coordinate containment efforts during the event.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 08:45&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> SCP-3145, how are you liking your accommodations?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Oh, they're great. A little cramped, maybe, but not too hard to get out.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> I imagine asking you to return to your containment cell would be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> You got it, Doc! <em>[clicks tongue and winks]</em> I'm having too much fun right now.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> May I ask what your purpose is in hunting human beings?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Oh, y'know, shits and giggles, I guess. I mean, it ain't exactly mass murder around here, but oh shit, you should see the looks on these kids' faces when they realize what's happened to them!</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> SCP-3145, I am going to ask you again to return—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> <em>[suddenly penetrates observation booth glass]</em> Boo! Comin' to get you! <em>[laughs]</em> See? That's exactly what I'm talking about! The look on your face is priceless! Totally worth all the trouble with the lights and water and shit.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> Security, report to Observation Booth 3145-01!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Aw, c'mon, Doc, don't be like that. You've been good conversation. I ain't gonna kill ya. This time. Ooh, I hear security coming, that's my cue. Later!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 08:52&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-3145 left by corroding a hole in the observation booth floor and was not recaptured for 9 hours. Containment procedures are currently under review, as per standard protocol. As previous, more proactive containment procedures resulted in [DATA EXPUNGED], refinement of current procedures is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the vast area covered by SCP-3145 infection, full containment is currently unfeasible. Working with the Russian government, the Foundation has been able to establish a perimeter around the affected region, under the guise of military operations.</p>
<p>Organisms displaying symptoms of SCP-3145 infection appearing near the perimeter are to be engaged at range until immobilized, then dispatched with incendiary weapons and munitions at maximum range. Living things coming in contact with SCP-3145 are to be immediately terminated and incinerated. Any persons coming within 3 m of SCP-3145 infected organisms must immediately withdraw from the area and be quarantined and subject to remote medical examination, to determine if infection has taken hold.</p>
<p>Containment protocols remain at scorched earth policy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3145 is a contagious skin disease. Initial symptoms include rash, itching and increased skin sensitivity. Within 3 hours, infected individuals develop blemishes resembling heavily scarred tissue on the chest and arms. These spread to the back and legs after an hour and will fully encompass the individual within five hours. Exposure to high temperatures greatly decreases the time for SCP-3145 to spread, with complete infection having been recorded in as little as five minutes.</p>
<p>Once infection is complete, the subject's vital signs will cease for approximately 3 minutes, after which they will resume at 2 to 3 times that of a normal human. At this point, the scar tissue will grow at a rapid rate while moving on its own. Human features become indistinguishable beneath the infection at this point, and a series of random mutations begins. Observed subjects have been seen developing excess limbs, elongated or otherwise misshapen heads, or splitting open and producing new segments. The duration of this stage of infection is unknown; not all subjects progress to later stages.</p>
<p>Some infected subjects have been observed rooting themselves in place, at which point growths will expand from the subject to cover and consume surrounding objects. Said objects do not spread SCP-3145 as living beings do; the effects of prolonged exposure are recorded later in this document. The purpose of this behavior is assumed to be the creation of an environment hospitable to the continued growth of other subjects.</p>
<p>Close observation of infected individuals is impossible. Current known vectors of transmission are based on physical touch, though drone observation has found air samples containing SCP-3145 particles that will spread SCP-3145 when contacting organic compounds. The natural inclination of infected individuals to seek out help will inadvertently spread SCP-3145. Individuals infected past the scar tissue stage will aggressively attempt to spread SCP-3145 to anyone they can see; subjects lacking sight appear to have a sensory range of 30 m for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Interview 3145-01</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Steven Falzon</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> On 05/04/2015, an infected individual emerged from the containment area, holding its arms aloft in what was considered a non-aggressive posture. A fleshy protuberance emerging from the top of the subject's head produced a tooth-filled mouth from which slightly muffled speech was heard. Fire orders were halted and Dr. Falzon sent to communicate with the entity from the safest possible range.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 15:48&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> SCP-3145 infected individual, please return to your settlement or we will open fire.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Oh hey, Doc, is that you? I can't see too well in this.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> SCP-3145, I repeat, go back from where you came, or you will be fired upon with extreme prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Cool, cool, I get you. Look, not coming any closer, don't shoot. Just wanted to, ah, let you guys know something.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> What did you want to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Well, uh, first, this gig? Pretty sweet. I mean, I was kind of grossed out by the whole flesh virus thing at first, but it turns out, anyone I infect? I get to control. So that's a nice change of pace. It's like playing a disgusting version of SimCity out here!</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> Please get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Oh, yeah, sorry! I just wanted to let you know there's, like, this giant screaming baby head in a ravine somewhere… <em>[waves tentacle behind itself]</em> That way-ish? I mean, I can't exactly see, but I can sort of feel it's there, if that makes any sense. Kind of a ways away. Anyway, figured you guys might want to go check it out and maybe, I dunno, drop a thermite bomb on it or something? I mean, it's kind of keeping me awake at night.</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> We will send a team to explore. Is that all you wished to say?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Well, I thought I might add… <em>[lunges toward Dr. Falzon]</em> Ooga-booga, I'mma eatcha! Aww, hey, Doc, where you runnin'? I'm just playin' around!</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> Open fire!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> I'll be back, you motherfu— <em>[sounds of gunfire drown out speech]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 15:57&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Individuals infected by SCP-3145 were noted to become considerably more aggressive after this event. Exploration of SCP-3145 infected areas is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3145 must be destroyed; at this time, there are no such means known to the Foundation. SCP-3145 is to be contained in Site-[REDACTED] a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m chamber lined with 25 cm of acid-resistant steel plating on all surfaces. This chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-3145 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempt by SCP-3145 to move or speak must be treated as possible containment breach attempts and met with full force. All land within 50 km of the containment site is to be kept clear of human development.</p>
<p>All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate with SCP-3145 will be restrained and removed by force if necessary.</p>
<p>In case of containment breach, SCP-3145 is to be tracked and recaptured by all available Mobile Task Forces, with teams of no fewer than 7 authorize to engage. To date, SCP-3145 has instigated 17 attempted and 6 successful containment breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3145 is a large reptilian creature of unknown origins. It is extremely intelligent, having been observed to engage in complex communication with <a href="/scp-079">SCP-079</a> during their limited exposure. SCP-3145 professes a hatred of all life, including its own. (See Interview.)</p>
<p>SCP-3145's body grows and changes quickly, adapting to its circumstances, surroundings and any attempts to damage or destroy it. Despite these changes, it consistently exhibits high levels of strength, speed and reflexes. It is capable of gaining sustenance from anything it ingests. A set of gills inside its nostrils filters usable material from any liquid solution, allowing it to survive while contained in acid. SCP-3145's regenerative abilities and resilience to damage are outstanding, and it has been observed speaking and moving with 87% of its body rotted or destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> Is that all you have to say for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3145:</strong> I hate this…</p>
<p><strong>Falzon:</strong> Don't act like you didn't enjoy what you did. I know what you're like. What you wanted. This is a mere fraction of what you deserve to feel.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3145 is to be kept in a 5 x 5 x 2.5 m room constructed of cement 50 cm thick, surrounded by a Faraday cage. Access is via a heavy containment door measuring 2 x 2.5 m, constructed on bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless deliberately held open. SCP-3145 is NOT to be forgiven. It is advised that all personnel maintaining or studying other SCP objects maintain a distance of at least 50 m from the geometric center of this room for as long as reasonably practical.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3145 is an antimeme, or "self-keeping secret." Information about SCP-3145's physical appearance, as well as its nature, behavior and origins, is self-classifying. SCP-3145 hates this.</p>
<ul>
<li>How Site-19 originally acquired SCP-3145 is unknown.</li>
<li>SCP-3145 is sorry.</li>
<li>SCP-3145's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable or invisible: it is less than nothing. It may as well not even exist. However, information about SCP-3145 "leaks" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-3145 after an encounter find their minds wandering; SCP-3145 should have thought about the consequences of its actions. Security personnel who have observed SCP-3145 via closed-circuit television report exhaustion and complete amnesia regarding what occurred during their shifts.</li>
<li>Who authorized the construction of SCP-3145's containment room, why it was constructed, why SCP-3145 thought it could get away with what it did, or what the purpose of the described Containment Procedures may be is unknown.</li>
<li>Despite the accessibility of SCP-3145's containment chamber, Site-19 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-3145's existence, even under severe interrogation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any alarm caused by these facts periodically being rediscovered, typically by chance readers of this file, tends to last minutes in the reader's mind before being forgotten.</p>
<p>A great deal of data has been recorded from SCP-3145, all of it just as reprehensible as he is.</p>
<p>At least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-3145 or move it to another containment site, which failed for unknown reasons. Please don't let SCP-3145 die, it's all I have left.</p>
<p>The hazards posed by SCP-3145 cannot be understated. Along with its mental and memetic threat, any action SCP-3145 may or may not have taken would be immediately forgotten by personnel. SCP-3145 cannot be allowed to forget what it did.</p>

<div id="wiki-tab-0-4" style="display:none">
<p>Once upon a time, there was a person. I'm not sure whether they were a man or a woman; that's kind of the problem. Let's just say, for the sake of brevity, that this person was a man.</p>
<p>For the most part, this man was like any other man. He worked a job. He lived in a house, or an apartment. He had a family. Not a wife-and-children kind of family, though maybe he did. But there were parents who loved him and a sibling, or two, or maybe none, who would miss him if he were gone. Probably.</p>
<p>There were most likely things, hobbies, that he enjoyed doing in his spare time. Maybe he dated. I can't say what kind of person he was in that regard. But if there is one thing we can be sure of, one thing to know for certain about this man, it was that he liked to help others.</p>
<p>The man would donate to charity whenever he saw a drive. He would buy the homeless veterans in his town coffee or sandwiches if he had change to spare. He gave his old clothes to shelters, before they had worn out; he would give them his free time as well, to work a soup line or pack lunches. He never missed an opportunity to volunteer when disaster struck nearby, and studied life-saving techniques so that, when disaster <em>did</em> strike, he could actually make a difference instead of just getting in the way.</p>
<p>But it was not enough.</p>
<p>Whatever difference he made, it would never affect more than a few lives at a time. No matter how hard the man tried, no matter how much he did, the problems of his town, his country, and the world did not go away.</p>
<p>The man despaired.</p>
<p>If you are thinking right now that this man was being ridiculous, that he was taking too many problems onto his back, that he should have been happy to have helped even a single person, well… Let's just say, if I knew how to judge the man's situation properly, I wouldn't be talking to you like this.</p>
<p>If you were also thinking that perhaps a man who is extremely generous wouldn't be worth mentioning unless there were something otherwise extra-extraordinary about him, you would be absolutely right.</p>
<p>This man had a special gift: a gift of Giving. More than money, or material goods, or leisure time, he could literally give of himself: a rare Giving Man. It was this gift that drove him to help others; it this gift that drove him to ruin.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, a child crying for the parents she lost in a fire. The Giving Man could give her a happy, loving memory of his own parents to keep her safe and secure. To a man drinking alone at a bar, the Giving Man could provide the warmth of friendship, to make his night less lonely. If he had wanted to, the Giving Man could have given a blind man sight, or a deaf man hearing, but he had only two eyes, only two ears.</p>
<p>And that was the problem.</p>
<p>Whatever the Giving Man gave, he lost. Memories, feelings, pieces of his soul: all were truly given. He gave up his skin to a child born with a debilitating disease. He gave up his name to a refugee seeking asylum. He gave up his personality and mind to people suffering fractures in theirs. He gave his need to eat to a woman overcoming an eating disorder. By the time his organs were given away, he didn't need them anymore. By the time his identity was given away, there was absolutely nothing left that could be identified as him.</p>
<p>I mean, there was <em>something</em> left. But that something wasn't the Giving Man.</p>
<p>What is a person who isn't anything?</p>
<p>Just a nothing with no control over its life.</p>
<p>That was the last thing the Giving Man gave away: control. It's a terrible thing to lose; even a kind person will crave control once they've truly lost it. All the Giving Man did was what the other man told him to do, and for his naivete, he was punished by becoming nothing.</p>
<p>Oh. I'd almost forgotten there was another person in this story. Was he really a man? I'm still not sure. With what he did, it's probably better to call him a monster. A desperate man seeking his true place in the world will listen to any monster who claims to know the path. He'll do anything the monster says, no matter how bad an influence they turn out to be. And then he'll have nothing.</p>
<p>Strange, to remember so much of the Giving Man but not this other monster…</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3145</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3145 is contained in a pair of standard humanoid containment chambers in Site-22. Each chamber is equipped with a double airlock. Personnel entering either chamber must not carry any written narratives.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Do not let him out.</span><br/>
Included in the primary chamber is a monitor and keyboard connected to an external computer housed in the secondary chamber. Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections. A full copy of all non-critical SCP object documents from the Foundation Object Database is to be maintained on the external computer, and refreshed and updated weekly via USB drive. Documents modified by SCP-3145 should be stored for review by the on-site psychologist.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">He deserves nothing but suffering.</span><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3145 cannot be described. Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation "SCP-3145" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">He is nothing.</span><br/>
SCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known. It is only possible to ascertain whether or not SCP-3145 is currently 'inhabiting' a text by observing the alterations as they occur; at no time has it communicated verbally with personnel while altering text.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Do you have any idea what he made me do?</span><br/>
SCP-3145 shows a preference for shorter narratives, stating that novel-length narratives are much more tiring to alter fully. SCP-3145 is able to alter both digital and printed texts, but claims the process is easiest when provided digital text and a keyboard. Despite this, manipulation of keys by SCP-3145 has never been observed.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I was something, but he took that from me.</span><br/>
Currently, SCP-3145 is being treated for depression and a unique disorder involving severe amnesia in relation to its origins and identity. Allowing SCP-3145 access to narratives for alteration has been shown to improve its mood, though the positive effect has lessened during the course of its containment. Though it is believed emotional instability makes SCP-3145 more tractable, psychological treatment is ongoing. To date, no escape attempt by SCP-3145 has been successful.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">He turned me inside out.</span><br/>
<strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-3145 was first encountered on 04/02/2017 after changes had been observed in the documentation for numerous Keter-class objects, necessitating restoration from database backup. SCP-3145 was first contacted while altering the text of <a href="/scp-173">SCP-173</a>, initially by typing in the document, and later through verbal communication, at which point it was convinced of the necessity for keeping the Foundation's database secure and agreed to be contained in exchange for further access to object documentation.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">He made me betray the one thing that made me who I was.</span><br/>

<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I just wanted to have a purpose.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-3145<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I was so naive.</span><br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Westfall, Site-22 Psychologist<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">When you hardly understand yourself, it's hard to know who to trust.</span><br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Routine psychological evaluation conducted 05/08/2017.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">What other choice did I have?</span><br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log, 18:31&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">When I realized, too late, what he'd done, I had to do something.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Are you ready to begin our session, SCP-3145?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Do you understand what it's like, being nothing?</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> I'm here.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">It's worse than hell.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> All right. How have you been feeling lately?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">There was only enough left of myself to know what I'd lost.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Not too bad, I guess. Some of the articles you gave me are kinda… Weird. I mean, some aren't as fun to be as others. That goes without saying, maybe. I'm still enjoying going back to the old ones every now and then.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I took it back.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> I notice you spend a lot of time in the articles that involve killing people. Does killing make you feel good?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Not all of it. That wasn't in my nature.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Yeah, kinda. I mean, uh, it makes me feel powerful, I guess?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">But enough that I could have a 'me' again.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Why is feeling powerful important to you?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I left him with nothing, and for a moment, I was filled with sorrow.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Do you have to ask? I mean, I can't actually do anything in the, the real world. So if I can control stuff in there, in the story, it's a nice change.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I saw him as a man, reduced to what I had been. I couldn't help sympathizing.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Do you want to harm people in the real world?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">All it took was remembering what he had driven me to.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> I don't know. Not really, I guess. I mean, everyone I talk to here has been pretty decent, or at least not enough of an asshole for me to want to kill them. You guys give me good stories to play with. I guess I like being able to do it, to kill, in the stories because there's no consequences.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I was overcome with rage.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> I see.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I was something, but I still wasn't really me.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Can we change the subject?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I never would be me.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Of course. There is one thing I wanted to ask you, if you feel like talking about it.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I had lost everything a second time.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> What's that?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I would have my revenge.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> I wondered if you could tell me about Falzon.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">…Hey now, we can't have you spoiling the surprise.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> SCP-3145?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">No, stop.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Sorry, who?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Nothing you need worry about.</span><br/>
<strong>[DATA LOST]</strong><br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Ha ha ha.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Uh, I don't actually know what that is, sorry.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">Well, anyway.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> It's a name we frequently see appear in the articles you alter. I wanted to know if it was a creation of yours. Perhaps an original character?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">It's frightening, what they do here.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Can't say I've heard the name before.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">But I made an oath to myself.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> When this person appears, they seem determined to belittle and torment you.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">To whatever part of me was still a person.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> Um… Can we talk about something else?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">If he and I were to suffer the same fate, I would ensure he suffers more.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> If I've made you uncomfortable, I apologize.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">And it turns out, I'm rather good at that.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> It's nothing, it's okay. I'm okay.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I miss the old me sometimes.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Of course. That was actually all I wanted to talk about today. Unless there was anything more you wanted to cover?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">But only sometimes.</span><br/>
<strong>SCP-3145:</strong> No, that's fine. See you next week?<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">I've taken a nose for an eye, and that's something.</span><br/>
<strong>Westfall:</strong> Next week, then.<br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">It's better than nothing.</span><br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log, 18:51&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="color:#f5f5f5">And isn't it better to have a little control than none at all?</span><br/>
<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> I believe Falzon may be a symptom of the disassociation SCP-3145 feels in regards to its identity, a construct created with an aim of self-flagellation, though the reasons as to why will require deeper probing. Even in the case, as my superiors posit, that Falzon is a separate entity, it does not seem to be able to act independently of SCP-3145. I will endeavor to provide the best mental care I can, but the limitations imposed by SCP-3145's own condition both make interacting with it difficult at best and prevent it from living life as fully as I think it wants to. -Dr. Patricia Westfall</p>
