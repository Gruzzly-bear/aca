<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9598 can not be directly contained; however, its manifestation is localized solely on Clare Island, Ireland.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:30%;"><img alt="island.png" class="image" src="https://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/pjpolddraft47/island.png" style="width:100%;"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:100%;">
<p>Clare Island.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A rotating group of 100-150 members of personnel live on Clare Island for periods of three to six months. These personnel must be trained in agriculture, botany, and/or floral design. The Foundation employees stationed on Clare Island have been separated into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tilling and Planting</li>
<li>Watering and Fertilizing</li>
<li>Harvesting and Sacrificing</li>
</ul>
<p>It is expected that crops and botanical life are farmed and harvested at all times on Clare Island. For this, an almanac specifically designed for Clare Island has been created and will be given to all members of personnel upon their arrival.</p>
<p>SCP-9598 incorrectly believes itself to be an unworshipped fertility god, and as such, the Foundation's resources have been utilized to generate the largest crop yield. SCP-9598 requires a sacrifice of 30% to 60% of any given yield. There is a 0.5% margin of error tolerated from SCP-9598 before it deems its "subjects" as disrespectful and takes action.</p>
<p>Personnel are expected to interact with SCP-9598 in a respectful, obedient manner. Use of terms such as "sir," "my liege," "your greatness," etc. are highly encouraged, as inadvertent disrespect, both linguistically and behaviorally, will likely lead to death.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9598 is a sapient, 54-meter-tall tornado situated on Clare Island, Ireland. SCP-9598 self-identifies as Taranis, a minor god and the personification of weather and storms in Gaelic mythology. Due to the lack of historical documentation on Taranis, this claim has not and likely can not be verified.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:20%;"><img alt="Taranis.png" class="image" src="https://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/pjpolddraft47/Taranis.png" style="width:100%;"/>

<p>Within SCP-9598's funnel,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> it is capable of weather manipulation, such as creating lightning, inducing heavy rains, and creating snowfall. While less powerful, SCP-9598 can also control the weather of Clare Island and induce certain weather patterns based on its own desires/temperament or after prayers from the island's inhabitants.</p>
<p>SCP-9598 is extremely temperamental and insecure, likely due to its status as an unworshipped deity often forgotten by historical documents. Paradoxically, this lack of worship has caused SCP-9598 to grow incredibly powerful, as before Foundation involvement, SCP-9598 controlled all of Ireland's weather. Due to this, strict protocols of worship have been developed to prevent SCP-9598 from growing more powerful.</p>
<p>Gaelic tradition is focused on fertility, and a plurality of its major deific figures are focused on acts relating to large crop yields and agriculture. SCP-9598 demands it be treated as a fertility god. As detailed in the Special Containment Procedures, strict protocols on crop growth, flower growth, and the sacrifices of crops have been instituted.</p>
<p>SCP-9598's temper has caused a number of intentional and unintentional deaths, mostly caused by it striking people with a bolt of lightning at any sign of impudence. As of documentation, all targeted lighting strikes from SCP-9598 have been fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9598.1:</strong> Containment of SCP-9598</p>
<p>Due to Ireland's climate and Clare Island's barren soil, many modifications were enacted in order to satiate SCP-9598's desire to be a fertility god and prevent it from gaining further power. This issue, combined with the need for housing, storage of crops, and the rigorous linguistic, behavioral, botanical, and agricultural training necessary for personnel, has led to the containment of SCP-9598 becoming a significant cost sink. Actions taken included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The delivery and implantation of 10.3 million tonnes of fertile soil onto Clare Island;</li>
<li>The creation of a farmer's almanac for the island, which took over five years, and the creation of multiple predictive AICs to accurately complete;</li>
<li>The creation of a twelve-ship blockade around Clare Island due to its proximity to the Irish mainland;</li>
<li>The Foundation hiring over 300 skilled botanists and farmers to create a regimen and to ensure a crop is always growing on Clare Island within a 0.5% margin of error;</li>
<li>The creation of a provisional Site with proper living conditions on Clare Island;</li>
<li>The creation of underground refrigerator and freezer storage for the harvested crops;</li>
<li>The creation of incentive packages for those willing to work on Clare Island;</li>
<li>Mental health support for those deployed to Clare Island due to the lack of human contact and the long, tiring work needed to successfully contain SCP-9598.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, personnel require language and behavioral training in order to conduct the necessary work properly. Below are examples of interactions SCP-9598 deemed disrespectful.</p>
<div class="interview">
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> GREETINGS, SUBJECT.</p>
<p><strong>F. Perez:</strong> Good harvest, my liege.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YES, GOOD HARVEST. I HAVE BLESSED YOU ALL. YOU ARE BEARING THE FRUITS OF ONLY MY HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE. NO ONE ELSE'S. JUST MINE.</p>
<p><strong>F. Perez:</strong> Yes, we have put in no work. You tilled this land and planted these crops. It's all you, your greatness. You do everything.</p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes Perez, killing her instantly.)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="interview">
<p><em>(Dr. Robert Stein is holding the smallest piece of corn from the harvest. SCP-9598 notices this.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes Stein, killing him instantly.)</em></p>

<div class="interview">
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YOU.</p>
<p><strong>E. Wratt:</strong> What?</p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes Wratt, killing him instantly.)</em></p>
</div>
<p>Day-to-day containment is less overtly lethal than it is deliberately humiliating on the part of SCP-9598. Appeasement is dependent on personnel’s constant attention to petty, shifting requirements that almost invariably waste work hours, spoil supplies, and stall operations on the island. The following is a running list of such requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>At midnight, two personnel must recite a fixed series of honorific statements for between 10 to 30 minutes. Any mistake will trigger localized rainfall in staff housing, soaking bedding and electronics.</li>
<li>During the morning audience,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> SCP-9598 deemed that umbrellas, hoods, and rain gear are “disrespectful.”
<ul>
<li>Compliance with this ruling has resulted in a 28% increase in upper-respiratory illnesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SCP-9598 will revise planting and harvest windows with, at maximum, a two-hour notice, requiring crews to replant the same fields up to 3 times in 36 hours.</li>
<li>If the smallest visible fruit, ear, tuber, etc, is touched before SCP-9598 reviews the daily sacrifice sorting, it will generate microbursts that destroy surrounding materials.</li>
<li>At random, SCP-9598 requires that a seed lot be held individually under its funnel for “recognition” before sowing, which can lead to delays of up to 10 hours.
<ul>
<li>In conjunction with this, SCP-9598 has also ordered that all seeds be sorted by size before being presented to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On four occasions, SCP-9598 randomly enforced a “first strike” ritual for new arrivals, wherein they were forced to stand in an open field while SCP-9598 discharged a lightning bolt within one meter of their position.</li>
<li>SCP-9598 requires all shift changes to occur only during any active rainfall it produces, which may extend personnel's hours unpredictably.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is estimated that over 8.9 billion dollars have gone into the containment of SCP-9598.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9598.2:</strong> Incident Log<br/>
Below is a conversation between SCP-9598 and Dr. Anthony Coix. Coix had been sitting on a bench, smoking a menthol cigarette before gaining SCP-9598's attention for an unknown reason.</p>
<div class="interview">

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<p><em>(SCP-9598 moves towards Coix.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> <em>[…]</em> Smoking? Sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> I BLESS YOU WITH CROP AND YIELD, AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME? YOU BURN MY PLANTS AND SUCK ON THEIR VAPOR?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I bought these at a 7-Eleven on my way here… your greatness.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> I DO NOT CARE WHAT TIME IT IS.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> What do you want me to do? Do you want me to put it out? Uh, my liege.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YOUR ARROGANCE IS RATHER BOTHERSOME, SUBJECT.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I apologize sincerely, my sir-greatness-sir.</p>
<p><em>(Rapid lightning strikes are seen within SCP-9598.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS MAKES ME FEEL?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Sad, sir?</p>
<p><em>(Coix takes another drag. A wisp of SCP-9598 knocks the cigarette out of his hand. It's quickly vacuumed into its funnel. Small plumes of smoke are seen exiting the entity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> OH.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p><em>(The lightning strikes cease.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> WHAT IS THAT SHARP, COLD FLAVOR?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Uh… mint.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> INTERESTING. I WOULD LIKE ANOTHER MINT.</p>
<p><em>(Coix pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. A wisp of SCP-9598 quickly knocks the package out of his hands and is sucked into its funnel.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Oh, come on!</p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes the cigarettes within SCP-9598's funnel. The entity makes a sound akin to a cough.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> MORE.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I don't have anymore, god damn it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> I WILL NOT DAMN ANYTHING.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes Coix, knocking him unconscious and hospitalizing him.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«END LOG»</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Following this interaction, SCP-9598 was observed hovering over the charter boat used to transport Dr. Coix, lifting it out of the ocean. After dropping the boat from a great height and destroying it, SCP-9598 uncovered a stash of Coix's fruit-flavored, disposable vape pens hidden in a duffel bag. Several arranged sacrifice piles were overturned by gusts in the process, all of which went unnoticed by SCP-9598.</p>
<p>Despite the vape pens' packaging claiming they can last seven days with regular use, SCP-9598 drained all six within two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9598.3:</strong> Fall Out</p>
<p>Subsequently, the head researcher on SCP-9598, Dr. Mara Dobbs, held a discussion with Coix due to the events of Addendum 9598.1.</p>

<tr>
<td>SCP-9598 abandoned the morning audience, opting instead to circle jacket pockets and bags. All agricultural tasks were also unacknowledged by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Following a successful apple harvest, SCP-9598 was witnessed striking the bushels with lightning several times and grew frustrated that they “did not produce the tingly breaths.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When allotted a carton of cigarettes to be spread over a month-long span, SCP-9598 tore Dr. Dobbs' living quarters apart and stole the rationed cigarettes within three hours of the arrangement.</td>

<tr>
<td>SCP-9598 retrieved one of its vapes that had run out of battery two days prior, removed the metal casing, struck the battery with a bolt of lightning, then smoked it again for ~70 seconds until it died once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-9598 developed a lingering cough and took on a yellow hue. It also shrank by up to 10 meters.</td>

<p><em>(SCP-9598 turns to the group of personnel under their umbrellas.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> WHAT IS THIS IMPUDENCE? WHY AREN'T THEY TENDING TO MY BLESSINGS?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9598 speeds towards the personnel. Dobbs follows)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> WHEN— <em>(Loud cough.)</em> WHEN IS THE NEXT HARVEST? YOU ALL HAVE TAKEN ME FOR GRANTED.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9598 takes a heavy, wheezing breath.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dobbs:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A SACRIFICE IN MANY MOONS. YOU— <em>(Cough.)</em> ALL OF YOU ARE WORTHLESS. LAZY. <em>(Wheeze.)</em> YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO BE IN A GOD'S GRACE.</p>
<p><strong>Dobbs:</strong> That's fine. They're going home, sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> WH— <em>(Wheeze.)</em> WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>Dobbs:</strong> I'm sending them home.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YOU.</p>
<p><em>(A bolt of lightning strikes Dobbs. She remains standing and unharmed.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> YOU'RE ALL BUT SNAKES.</p>
<p><em>(A second bolt of lightning strikes Dobbs. She remains standing and unharmed. SCP-9598 wheezes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.</p>
<p><strong>Dobbs:</strong> Are you done?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> THIS REBELLION— <em>(Heavy wheeze.)</em> IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.</p>
<p><em>(Bolts of lightning rapidly strike the Foundation personnel. They remain standing and unharmed. SCP-9598 erupts into a coughing fit.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dobbs:</strong> Sir. I have an unopened mint-flavored vape in my room. Your favorite, my liege. Should I retrieve it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9598:</strong> <em>(Cough.)</em> THAT… THAT WOULD BE MOST APPRECIATED. YES.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9598.6:</strong> Updated Special Containment Procedures</p>
<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Dobbs and a small research team, SCP-9598 continued chain smoking cigarettes and vape pens, upwards of twenty packs and fifteen pens per day over the following two months. After this period, SCP-9598 was less than one meter in height. Its containment procedures have since been updated:</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9598 has been captured and placed in an air-tight, acrylic storage container. Three times per day, a mixture of flavoring, nicotine-rich vapor, and oxygen is to be dispensed into the storage container. SCP-9598 requires no further interaction.</p>
