<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7452 is to be contained in an item locker at Site-56. Research is currently underway to identify a possible method to awaken SCP-7452 for experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7452 is the skull of an <em>Ursus americanus</em> (black bear) possessing an intense fluctuating signature of Elan-Vital Energy (EVE). The item was obtained from Eric Klammanski, designated PoI-7452.</p>
<p>According to PoI-7452, when SCP-7452 is active, it possesses flames in its eye sockets and speaks in a deep, masculine voice. The item is allegedly able to predict future events including, but not limited to, games of chance. The user is required to sacrifice blood to SCP-7452 before soliciting it for predictions.</p>
<p>Following its acquisition by the Foundation, SCP-7452 is presently dormant. A method of awakening it has not been determined due to a lack of knowledge held by PoI-7452 regarding such a process.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-7452 was obtained in Kyuzhevitz, North Carolina, USA. Prior to containment, PoI-7452 attempted to use information gathered from the object to win the Super-Duper Millions Jackpot on July 18, 2014. A video was filmed by a bystander during the event and posted to social media; PoI-7452 admitted to the existence of SCP-7452 in this video, alerting Foundation webcrawlers. Site-56 personnel were dispatched and successfully detained PoI-7452.</p>
<p>Following containment, the convenience store in which the aforementioned event occurred was identified. The store's security footage of the event was obtained successfully; the transcript below has been written with data gathered from both the security footage and the video filmed by the bystander.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Transcript 7452-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Choi's Corner Market in Kyuzhevitz, NC, USA</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> July 18, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The Super-Duper Millions Jackpot draws its numbers every Friday at 22:00 EDT.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>It is 21:50 EDT. PoI-7452 is waiting behind another customer at the cash register, fidgeting with a piece of paper. His right hand is bandaged. He continuously checks his wristwatch and wipes the sweat from his face.</em></p>
<p><em>The customer in front of PoI-7452 finishes the transaction and walks away from the counter. The clerk, identified as store owner Kang-doo Choi, waves goodbye.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> Thank you, come again!</p>
<p><em>Choi turns towards PoI-7452 as the latter approaches the counter with the paper.</em></p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 grins as he sets the paper on the counter and claps his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Choi, my man! You know the drill, one Super-Duper ticket my good sir.</p>
<p><em>Choi frowns as PoI-7452 points at the paper.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> I got the winning numbers <em>right here</em>, they're uh…</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 looks down at the paper.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Eight, six, seventy-five, thirty…</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 looks up at Choi, who is shaking his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> Eric, out of good conscience, I refuse to sell you any more lotto tickets.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Wha- how come?!</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> You've spent thousands of dollars on the lotto. Scratchers, Super-Duper, Lucky Horseshoe, and every time you win <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Okay, but now I <em>know</em> the numbers, Choi. I'll actually win now, just let me enter one last time!</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> I will <em>not</em> indulge your addiction anymore, for your own good.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Sir, just- after this, after today, I'll be set for life! Please just sell me the ticket!</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> No means no, Eric.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 rubs his forehead and hair with his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> You know you're losing my money by refusing me service, right Choi?</p>
<p><em>Choi looks at the line of customers behind PoI-7452, one of which is holding up a smartphone to film the event.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> I can survive without watching you suffer. There's paying customers behind you with places to be.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 checks his watch.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Shit, nine fifty-four!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 holds up the paper and points at it.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> These numbers'll expire in six minutes! I need to play them <em>now!</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> Play them next week, today you take a break.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> But Choi, I can't- I can't play them next week, I told you!</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 pauses to breathe and wipe his brow.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Look, uh… I found this bear skull, right? It was like a- a magic skull, it could talk to me and predict the future. I had to give it my blood…</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 shows Choi his bandaged hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> …to get it to tell me today's lottery numbers. The problem is, after it told me, it fell asleep, and I don't know how to wake it up for next week's lottery. So that's how I got these numbers and why I need to use them <em>today.</em></p>
<p><em>Choi stares at PoI-7452.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> You need to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Wait- no, I'm not bullshitting, I promise! Just let me play one more time, sir! Please!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 clasps his hands together.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Mister Choi, I beg you. Just one more game, then I'll never, <em>ever</em> play again. I'll give you twenty-five… thirty percent of the winnings.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 leans forward towards Choi.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Just <em>one</em> more time, then I'll quit forever. Please sir, <em>please.</em></p>
<p><em>Choi looks behind PoI-7452 at the line of customers. He takes a deep breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> This <em>will</em> be your last lotto, Eric. What are the numbers again?</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 pumps his fists.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> YES! Okay, uh… eight, six, seventy-five, thirty, and nine.</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> …seventy-five, thirty-nine?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> No, it's…</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 holds up the paper towards Choi and points at the numbers on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> It's thirty, as in "three-zero", and <em>then</em> the last number is nine.</p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> Three-zero, and nine. Five dollars.</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 inserts his credit card into the card reader. It beeps twice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> It declined.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> NO!!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 turns towards the line of customers behind him.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Can someone pay for me? I'll pay you back, I promise!</p>
<p><em>The other customers snicker at PoI-7452.</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer 1:</strong> Get a job!</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> You don't get it! I found a magic skull and it told me today's lottery numbers! One more play and I'm set for life!</p>
<p><strong>Customer 2:</strong> Go see a shrink, you junkie!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 scratches his head and looks at his watch.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Look, uh… I got a blanket and a pack of Newports in my car, I'll give them to you, just someone <em>please</em> help a brother out!</p>
<p><em>Another customer checks her phone, then looks at PoI-7452.</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer 3:</strong> If I pay, will you finally leave?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Yes yes yes! Please!</p>
<p><em>Customer 3 sighs and approaches the counter. She places her six-pack of beer on the counter, Choi scans it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choi:</strong> With the lotto ticket, it's eleven ninety-seven.</p>
<p><em>The customer inserts her credit card into the reader. It beeps once; Choi nods his head at PoI-7452.</em></p>
<p><em>The lottery ticket is printed out, Choi hands it to PoI-7452, who examines it.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Nine fifty-nine! I fucking made it! Nine fifty-nine!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 laughs as he pumps his fists in the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer 3:</strong> Excuse me, my Newports?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> Of course, of course! Thank you so, so, <em>so</em> much, ma'am!</p>
<p><em>PoI-7452 looks at Choi.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> And Choi, you're the man as always! Thank you for coming around!</p>
<p><em>Customer 3 and PoI-7452 exit the store as the latter points at Choi.</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-7452:</strong> As I promised, twenty percent!</p>
