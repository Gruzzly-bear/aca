</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-5307 is an olfactohazard found within an oil designed for a personal vaporizer. The containers are labeled as "Donk Juice, The Juice You Jam To" and are found at convenience stores across the Southern United States. SCP-5307 is marketed as a flavored CBD musical mood enhancer distributed by Western Wilds, LLC.</p>
<p>Upon olfaction of SCP-5307, a neurological event occurs causing altered audio and visual perception. Subjects exposed to SCP-5307 will internally visualize a music video featuring a humanoid donkey resembling <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4768">SCP-4768</a>; songs observed appear to be parodies of popular songs released between 1970 and 2010. The duration of the event varies based on the length of the parodied song, typically 2-6 minutes. The affected individual will only vaguely recall the exact contents of the SCP-5307 event, though will remember the basic themes and structure of the song. SCP-5307 has no known negative effects on exposed subjects.<br/>

<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>Numerous reports of hallucinations of an entity matching SCP-4768's description in Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana led MTF Kappa-12 ("Rough Riders") to discover SCP-5307. All instances of SCP-5307 were traced to convenience store franchise "1-Stop". At this time, MTF Epsilon-17 was dispatched to handle the situation, with MTF Kappa-12 providing auxiliary support.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investigation</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>The "1-Stop" franchise cooperated fully during the SCP-5307 investigation, willingly providing their entire supply of SCP-5307 and all known information on its origin. The "1-Stop" franchise records indicate that they purchased its supply of SCP-5307 from a company known as Western Wilds, LLC, a limited liability company based in Delaware, USA. While the filing records indicate the owner of the license to be Harold Thompson, the address given for the agent of record does not exist.</p>
<p>As of the filing of this record, no known address exists for Mr. Thompson or Western Wilds, LLC. A nation-wide search for a known address yielded a divorce case filed in the state of Texas, indicating that Mr. Thompson is divorced and gave a legitimate address for his ex-wife, Carolyn McLean.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Carolyn McLean is being interviewed regarding her knowledge of POI-5307W and Western Wilds, LLC.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> Okay Mrs. Th–</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Miss, it's Ms. McLean.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> Of course, <em>Ms. McLean</em>, are you ready to begin?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Yes, but you need to make this quick. I need to pick my son up from practice and God knows I've wasted enough time on Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> I'd like to discuss Mr. Thompson's business.</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> <em>[Ms. McLean snorts.]</em> Of course, 10 years wasn't enough– now I've gotta' listen to more of this bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> I'm sor–</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Listen, my ex-husband was pretty great when we met, he was an outgoing entrepreneur. But after his father passed, something changed. He became obsessed with those– those donkey men.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> You're referring to Ulysses B. Donkman?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Yeah sure, whatever you want to call it. Those <em>things</em> ruined my marriage. Harry went on and on about how his family didn't understand the damn things, how there was <em>"a fortune to be made"</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> You speak as if there is more than one?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> I don't know much– but I know there are two of them.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> Alright, and Mr. Thompson's family has a connection to these "donkey-men"?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Obsession is more like it. As Harry told it, his father, grandfather, and great grandfather <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/ulysses-b-donkman-and-the-heinous-hitman">all tried to kill one of the damned things</a>. But not Harry, he thinks he can make money off of it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> So he is working with the entities?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> <em>"Entities"</em>, you make it sound like this isn't all fantasy bullshit. No, of course he's not working with the <em>"entities"</em>, him and his little club are trying to capture them or something. You should've seen his office, it had newspaper clippings and photos pinned to the wall with strings. Like some sort of serial killer collage.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> So he created Western Wilds in an attempt to capture and exploit the entities?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> Listen, I get you have a job to do, but I really don't know much else. Once Harry started trying to get our son involved, I had to get out and away from all of it. I'm just trying to put the whole thing behind me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> I understand, do you have any of your ex-husband's material here?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> I have a box with a few of his things, I burned the rest. You're more than welcome to take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> Okay Ms. McLean, we're just about finished here. I have to ask again for the record, do you have any idea of your ex-husband's whereabouts, or anything else to do with his company?</p>
<p><strong>McLean:</strong> No, like I told you– I haven't spoken to him in years.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sonder:</strong> Thank you, Ms. McLean. I won't take up any more of your time.</p>
