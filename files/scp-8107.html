<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8107 is permitted to freely roam Site-██. Any tags used to close plastic bags (including anomalous objects and SCP objects) are to be sent to the Department of Occlupanology at Site-██ for study and containment by SCP-8107. SCP-8107 is scheduled for weekly therapy sessions.</p>
<p>Recovery of lost data regarding SCP-8107 is ongoing and is considered a high priority task to be handled by SCP-8107.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8107 is Dr. Gwendolyn Lovelace, head of the Department of Occlupanology. During incident 03-02-2025-8107, the Department of Occlupanology, its single occupant, and all objects contained within suddenly materialized in Site-██. For more information regarding this incident, see Incident Report 03-02-2025-8107. Dr. Lovelace has provided detailed information regarding Foundation protocol upon request, and is confirmed to be working in the Foundation’s interest.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> Hello, SCP-8107, I-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Oh, why do I have an official designation now? Did something happen? There isn't something <em>too</em> wrong with me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> Ok let's get right into it then. Your entire department suddenly materialized yesterday. We’ve launched an investigation into you, your department, and your… studies.<br/>
<em>Dr. Lovelace twiddles an occlupanid between her fingers nervously.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Um, that doesn't make any sense? I’ve been here the whole time! C’mon man, I helped you draft up your presentation on the synthetic taxonomy of SCP-████ last week.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> I did write a presentation on that subject last week, but it was a solo endeavor. I think I'd remember if you personally assisted me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Is this some sort of prank? We've been working in the same building for four years. I've been documenting the phenomenon designated SCP-████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-872352-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-872352-2')">2</a></sup> since it was first discovered, right down the hall from you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> It's not a prank, and if you knew me, you'd know that I'm not the type. We have no record of your employment, your department, or of the anomaly you just mentioned. You really have no memory of how you wound up materializing on-site?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> I've been telling you, I remember working here for years. You should check with my wife, or my family. My department probably just got hit by an antimeme.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> An antimeme?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> You haven't been taking your mnestics, have you?</p>

<p>Mnestic testing with Dr. Miller revealed no hidden memories of SCP-8107. Similar results were ascertained with Dr. Lovelace's proclaimed parents, who were found to have never had any children. Dr. Lovelace's proclaimed spouse was found to have been deceased since 02/24/2022. No personal records pertaining to Dr. Lovelace could be located. The address Dr. Lovelace claimed to live at was a previous residence of their proclaimed spouse. Three new instances of SCP-8107-1 discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Miller:</strong> Uh, no. We still don't have any evidence that you existed before this week. The mnestics didn't help with that either.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> …shit. Um…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lovelace can be heard tapping her finger loudly and repeatedly on an armrest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> So, since you still don't have proof that I'm meant to be here, I'm going to be stuck at this site, contained, unable to see my wife until they get back to us?</p>

<p>[Irrelevant portion stricken.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> You've mentioned your wife a few times now. What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> <em>They</em>. I was kind of misunderstood my whole life. The things I was interested in were uninteresting to other people. I had a hard time understanding other people and they had a hard time understanding me. My family loved and supported me, but they never really <em>got</em> me, y'know? Well, Alex was the same as me. They understood me and I understood them. I was into synthetic taxonomy, and they were always cross-stitching. We were just weirdos, supporting each other's special interests.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> They seem like a very special person.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Alex was. I mean, they still <em>are</em> the most amazing person I know, it's just. Fuck. I can't imagine how they're doing. As far as I know, they're all alone. Like me. I just want to see them again so badly, to let them know that they aren't alone, that I'm here for them, that I understand them. I keep feeling like they must be grieving me too, despite not knowing that I just blipped off the face of the Earth or whatever, but I know that isn't really possible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> Why do you think that they're alone?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> We both had a hard time growing up. We were always excluded, always ignored. They'd told me that nobody ever really stuck around in their life for more than a year or two, that nobody ever saw them for who they were. That it always felt like the ones who stuck around were doing so more out of pity or obligation than anything else. They never deserved that. They never did anything wrong, they just never really clicked with anyone. Until they found me. They absolutely could have found someone else… I just don't think it's super likely.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> Yeah, yeah… It sounds like that was really tough…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> I'm sorry, but is it ok if I switch topics? There's a few questions I'm required to ask and we're running a little low on time for this session.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Th-that's fine.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lovelace twitches. She pulls a couple occlupanids out of her pocket and inspects them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> Thank you. So, what originally inspired your interest in occlupanology?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Oh, I discovered this website, <a href="https://horg.com/">horg dot com</a>, H-O-R-G, shortly after Trump got elected for the first time. It's just a silly website where this guy's catalogued a bunch of bread tags as if they were alive. I wasn't doing too well emotionally at the time, and they made me feel better. I felt connected to all the silly little names they have, the lore, the… pseudoscience of it. Shortly after that, they started talking to me, and the Foundation picked me up. I earned a degree in synthetic biology at the Foundation, and I've been working on containing skips in my field ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> Has your anomaly made your life more difficult?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Not particularly. Most occlupanids are pretty chill and quiet. They're just li'l guys who don't have a lot to talk about. The few that do have a lot to say, or just scream constantly, are usually anomalous and get contained or locked up in that soundproof box.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pines:</strong> How is your depression at the end of this session, on a scale of one to ten?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lovelace:</strong> Seriously? One.</p>
