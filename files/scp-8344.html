<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8344 is stored in a standard anomalous object locker at Site-17. Interaction is permitted only during authorized testing sessions in a monitored chamber with psychological staff present. All letters produced by SCP-8344 must be cataloged, scanned, and archived. Originals may be returned to the subject only with approval and after inspection for further anomalies. Repeated testing with the same individual is prohibited unless authorized by Senior Researcher Wexler.
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8344 is an unmarked wooden box measuring approximately 18 cm × 12 cm × 12 cm. When a human subject inserts their hand, SCP-8344 produces a single handwritten letter. These letters consistently reflect the handwriting, vocabulary, and emotional tone of the subject’s childhood, typically corresponding to ages five to twelve.</p>
<p>Content is typically accurate to the subject’s developmental context, often referencing details such as childhood pets, familial relationships, or early interests. In some cases, the letters reference experiences the subject had entirely forgotten, which can be verified through external records. The letters have not exhibited any memetic or cognitohazardous effects, though emotional and behavioral impact is consistently significant.</p>
<p>Typically, subjects receive only one letter. Attempts to retrieve additional letters from SCP-8344 yield no result. No mechanical or anomalous components have been identified inside the box. Non-human testing produces no effect.</p>
<p>A notable exception occurred with D-3147, Marcus Avery, who retrieved five letters across separate sessions. This repeated interaction is under active review.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8344.1:</strong> Discovery<br/>
SCP-8344 was recovered on ██/██/20██ from the attic of Eleanor Watts, a retired elementary school teacher in [REDACTED], Michigan. Following her passing, the estate was opened for public sale. Several former students who attended the estate liquidation reported finding the box among her belongings and attempting to take part in what they believed was a sentimental classroom ritual. Witnesses claimed that one of them produced a letter from inside the box with handwriting identical to their own from childhood.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that Watts had routinely encouraged her students to write "Letters to My Future Self" and place them into a small wooden box at the end of each school year. The letters were never returned, and no records exist of Watts delivering them. It is unclear whether SCP-8344 exhibited anomalous properties during this period, or whether its effects manifested gradually.</p>
<p>Interviews with former students yielded consistent recollections: most had forgotten about the ritual entirely until they reencountered the box. Several expressed strong emotional reactions to the object, reporting sensations of nostalgia, regret, and “feeling seen.” One former student was hospitalized briefly due to an acute anxiety episode after touching the object. Foundation operatives embedded in local law enforcement were alerted and acquired the object under the cover of a biohazard alert.</p>
<p>No other anomalous objects were found on the premises.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8344.2:</strong> Testing Logs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test Log 8344-0148</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-1483<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong><br/>
Letter was written in purple crayon on notebook paper, with uneven writing and misspellings:</p>
<p><em>“I'm sorry I broke the vase. I said it was the cat but it was me. I was scared you'd be mad.”</em></p>
<p>Upon reading, the subject became visibly emotional. After a long pause, he asked if the letter could be destroyed. When asked why, he replied:<br/>
"That was the first lie I ever told. After that, lying got easy."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test Log 8344-0097</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-9702<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong><br/>
Letter retrieved appeared as a single sentence scrawled in red marker:</p>
<p><em>“Are we the bad guy now?”</em></p>
<p>Subject read the note aloud and immediately became hostile, demanding to know if personnel “set him up.” Subject was placed in solitary following an attempted assault on security staff. No further testing permitted with subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test Log 8344-2133</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Alan Meers (Level 3 Researcher)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong><br/>
Letter was written in pencil on loose-leaf paper, with several words misspelled:</p>
<p><em>“You don’t have to be the smartest. Just don’t forget how to laugh.”</em></p>
<p>Subject chuckled, then remained silent for the remainder of the day. Psychological review concluded a temporary depressive episode was interrupted by the encounter. Subject later began participating in staff morale initiatives and humor seminars. When asked why, he replied, “It turns out I used to be funny.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Name:</strong> Marcus Avery</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>D-Class Designation:</strong> D-3147</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Former Status:</strong> Death Row Inmate</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Crime of Record:</strong> Felony Murder</p>
<p>Marcus Avery was transferred to Foundation custody on 5/14/2024, following his conviction for involvement in a multi-state string of armed robberies that resulted in the deaths of three civilians. According to court transcripts and witness testimonies, Avery had served as the group's planner and getaway driver, though forensic evidence confirmed he never discharged a weapon.</p>
<p>Despite this, Avery was labeled the ringleader and scapegoat by his accomplices during their respective plea deals. Public outrage led to a swift sentencing: death by lethal injection. Foundation records note Avery exhibited low aggression, minimal resistance, and high psychological compliance upon induction into the D-Class program.</p>
<p>Initial psychological screening suggested depressive symptoms, numbed affect, and a diminished sense of future. When presented with SCP-8344, he was not informed of its effects. The result of that first test marked a notable deviation from prior subjects. Unlike most who received one letter and showed short-lived emotional reactions, Avery retrieved five separate letters — each progressively deeper in tone and more reflective of internal conflict and hope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Upon reading the letter, Marcus held it silently for several seconds before setting it on the table. Security footage shows him re-reading it two additional times without speaking. When asked what he thought, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“I don’t remember writing that, but it sounds like me. Or like who I thought I’d be.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No outward signs of distress. Subject appeared quiet and reflective for several hours after the session. First request for outdoor detail came two days later.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “What do you make of the letter?”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “It’s not fake. I mean… it can’t be. That’s my old crayon style. Sloppy ‘P,’ backwards ‘E.’ I remember trying to be neat like that.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “Do you remember writing it?”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “Not really. But it’s like seeing a photo you forgot someone took. It feels… true.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “You wrote that you wanted to help people.”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> “I guess that didn’t work out, huh?”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “Maybe not yet.”<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Subject showed curiosity and quiet reflection. No visible signs of agitation or distress.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">“We had this mutt named Bean. Used to sleep under the porch. I forgot about him.”</p>

<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “This one… it made me feel small. Not in a bad way. Just… like I used to think about dogs and sunshine. I wasn’t always thinking about survival.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “Why do you think you forgot that?”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “Because it didn’t matter in the life I ended up in. You don’t keep pets when you’re sleeping in cars.”<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Subject requested additional outdoor time and light-duty assignments. Marked improvement in eye contact and responsiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “What part?”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “All of it. ‘I try hard.’ I remember saying that to teachers. To my uncle. I used to want people to know I was trying.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “And now?”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “Now it just feels like no one cares if you try, as long as they can blame you.”<br/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Subject began journaling. Noted introspective silence after session. Surveillance showed him offering help to another D-Class in hallway.</p>

<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “I didn’t expect to cry. I felt like I wasn’t allowed to when I was little. Like it made things harder for everyone else.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Truss:</strong> “That’s a heavy thing to carry alone.”</p>
<p><strong>D-3147:</strong> “That’s just it. I wasn’t supposed to carry it alone. But I did. And I kept doing it. Even later. Even when I joined up with the crew.”</p>

<p>On 11/5/2024, Marcus Avery (D-3147) was approved for release under the Foundation’s Controlled Reintegration Protocol following a unanimous recommendation from Site-17 psychological and ethics personnel. Prior to release, Avery was administered a Class-B amnestic regimen tailored to remove memory of SCP-8344 and its effects, while preserving all non-anomalous emotional development.</p>
<p>He was assigned a civilian identity, employment assistance, and housing under limited Foundation surveillance.</p>
<p>Before the procedure, during his final counseling session, Avery made a quiet request:</p>
<p><em>“I know I won’t remember this. But if I’m going to start over, let me start over as someone who wanted to be better. That’s enough for me.”</em></p>
<p>No additional letters have been recovered from SCP-8344 since Avery’s last session.</p>
