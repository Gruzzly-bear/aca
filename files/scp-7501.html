            <h1>SCP-7501</h1>
            <div class='text-content'>Item #: 7501<br/>
Object Class: Pending</span></p>
<p><span style="color:cyan">Special Containment Procedures-<br/></span></p>
<p>SES-42 paused and gazed the maintenance room, the beast was huddled up against a warning light next to the hatch, hyperventilating. SES-42 attempted to ignore it and returned to writing the draft:</p>
<p><span style="color:cyan"><br/>
"-SCP-7501 is to be-"<br/></span></p>
<p>The rodent grew louder, quivering next the the light. The maintenance area was freezing cold. Feeling pity for the creature, SES-42 started up the small radiator that was onboard, consuming vital power.</p>
<p>The rat slowly warmed up, growing quiet. This <em>thing</em> wasn't some anomaly, he was just a poor rat, a rat who was dying. SES-42 had one friend now, and it was this rodent. There was no point in treating it like some monster, because it wasn't.</p>
<p>Secure…Contain…Protect. That was SES-42s goal, and at the moment, the goal had been achieved. Their purpose served, yet still, an empty feeling radiated. If this was truly SES-42s purpose, then why did nothing feel different?</p>
<p>The rat peered upwards, staring directly into the camera-</p>
<p>He had an ugly little face, but in a way, it was beautiful. Such a frail creature, such a small speck in the universe, and yet SES-42 had found it.</p>
<p>And despite this beauty-</p>
<p>It was a rat, and that's all it was.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>How could such a small thing be so complex? Was this what SES-42 had missed out on? Doomed to travel the abyss, whilst others enjoyed each other's company, enjoyed life, enjoyed touch, it wasn't fair!</p>
<p>SES-42 and the rat were alike in that way. Neither of them asked for this. Neither of them had a choice. Nonetheless they found themselves here, but at least, they found themselves together.</p>
<p><span style="color:cyan"><br/>
<strong>[We're sending one last message home.]</strong><br/></span><br/>
<span style="color:red"><br/>
<strong>[USE OF COMMUNICATIONS WILL USE ALL REMAINING POWER]</strong><br/>
<strong>[PROCEED?]</strong><br/></span><br/>
<span style="color:cyan"><br/>
<strong>[Yes.]</strong><br/></span></p>
<p>SES-42 looked down at its new friend and felt happy. Another new overwhelming feeling before the end of it all…</p>
