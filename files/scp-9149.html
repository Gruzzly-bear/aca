<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Samples of SCP-9149 are to be kept in a secure biological containment unit in the medium-risk biological containment wing, located on floor 16 of Site-19's Heavy Containment Zone.<br/>
Standard haz-mat suits have proven sufficient in preventing SCP-9149 infection, personnel must undergo standard decontamination procedures after leaving SCP-9149's containment unit.</p>
<p>In the event of an SCP-9149 outbreak, MTF Epsilon-37 ("Holiday Antibiotics") are to be deployed to the outbreak site, to discern the scale and severity of the outbreak. Infected subjects are to be quarantined and transported to the nearest Foundation facility equipped for the containment of bio-hazardous anomalies, subjects are to be sedated while they progress through the stages of infection. Infected subjects are to be incinerated after expiration.</p>
<p>All testing with SCP-9149 must be approved by the project lead,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> 3 Level 3 Researchers or the Containment Manager of the medium-risk biological containment wing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9149 is a virus of unknown composition, the structure of which appears snowflake-shaped when viewed under a microscope. Subjects infected with SCP-9149 become obsessed with celebrating the Christmas holiday and will alter their behavior and routines to center completely around activities associated with Christmas, even if they do not celebrate the holiday or possess Christian beliefs.</p>
<p>SCP-9149 is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids, SCP-9149 is primarily concentrated in the saliva and mucus of infected subjects. Due to the method of infection, SCP-9149 has a low rate of infection as it does not spread through airborne or waterborne vectors.<br/>
SCP-9149 is most commonly spread by infected individuals serving food and drink items tainted with their saliva to non-infected individuals, tainted items tend to include but are not limited to cookies, eggnog, cakes and hot chocolate.<br/>
SCP-9149 is invariably lethal to all infected subjects; there is no known cure for SCP-9149 at this time.</p>
<p>SCP-9149 progresses in 5 stages of infection:</p>
<p>Stage 1: SCP-9149 incubates within the host for a 24-hour period before active infection begins.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Active infection begins; infected subjects will begin to purchase Christmas decorations in bulk and will decorate their domicile. Subjects will become more sociable, inviting friends and family to participate in social gatherings. During these gatherings infected subjects will serve guests tainted food and drink items that will spread SCP-9149 further.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Infected subjects will begin donating significant amounts of money to any nearby charities that are considered reputable, this as well as increased gift buying and the purchasing of further decorations, will commonly result in financial difficulties for infected individuals.<br/>
Subjects will develop an indifference towards violence.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Infected subjects will attack any individuals that do not celebrate Christmas or individuals that do not possess "adequate Christmas spirit" and force them to participate in Christmas related activities, if these individuals do not comply, then infected subjects will attempt to kill the individual, usually via blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
<p>Stage 5: After approximately 2 weeks after initial infection, infected subjects will begin to bleed from every orifice, before exclaiming "Merry Christmas, Happy New Year", and finally, expiring via spontaneous cranial eruption.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9149 was discovered in Cleveland, OH on 23/12/2016 after an infected individual expired during an interview with a local news station. Carl Keller, a 37-year-old stockbroker who won a neighborhood Christmas light contest, despite displaying no Christian beliefs and having previously denounced the Christmas holiday.<br/>
During the interview, Keller succumbed to Stage-5 infection and expired. Foundation Agents embedded in the network that conducted the interview, confiscated the interview footage and Keller's body, before administering amnestics to witnesses.<br/>
After SCP-9149 was identified, Agents screened the civilians that had come into contact with Keller in the days before his death, the investigation uncovered that Keller had served tainted gingerbread cookies to the news team, 5 members of the news team had been infected and were transported to Area-12 for end-of-life care.<br/>
The source of SCP-9149 was determined to be a gift basket containing several gingerbread cookies, that was delivered to Keller by his neighbor Alan Doherty.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Foundation Agents conducted a raid on the Doherty residence and discovered the body of Mr. Doherty on the floor of the living room, bound with rope, with his hands nailed into the floor.<br/>
Cause of death was determined to be a .9mm gunshot to the head.</p>
<p>Two notable items were recovered from the Doherty residence; they are as follows:</p>
<p>1: A medical vial containing samples of SCP-9149.</p>
<p>2: Alan Doherty's personal journal. (See below)</p>

<p><strong>27 November 2016</strong><br/>
Another Ok day at work, not as bad as yesterday. I could actually stand Greg today, it's a Christmas miracle. Though I guess compared to some managers I've had, Greg isn't too bad. The kids seemed excited for the season, unlike their parents, they seemed so tired, worn out. Like they'd drop dead any minute. One little girl wanted to see me so bad, but her mother just pulled her along like some animal. The poor girl was crying all the way to the parking lot. I've worked retail long enough that I know better than to get upset with the customers, but something about the way that woman treated her daughter, just made me so angry. People just don't have the Christmas spirit anymore.</p>
<p><strong>3 December 2016</strong><br/>
Bad day today, Greg jumped down my throat about my line not being orderly enough, how am I supposed to control these people? I lost my cool and told him to shove it. I'm the best Santa this mall has ever seen, so I deserve a little respect. He didn't take it very well, he didn't say anything, but he didn't have to, his face said it all. I don't think he's used to people standing up for themselves around him. As for the shoppers, they were savages! Honestly, I couldn't believe it, they were fighting over toys, and useless decorations, it was unbelievable. Christmas used to be about giving, about peace and love. Now it's about consuming, about buying the trendiest bullshit, about donating to charity, not out of the goodness of your heart, but to brag about it on social media! Christmas wasn't supposed to be like this…</p>
<p><strong>5 December 2016</strong><br/>
I got fired today, I should have known. Greg is such a petty little shit, he's everything wrong with corporate Christmas. I've been thinking of a way to bring more Christmas cheer to people and get them in the holiday spirit. My buddy Stevie knows some people who make stuff, weird stuff. Evidently, they bought that weird glowing stone that me and Stevie found back in high school off of him, and he's kept in touch with them over the years. I'll call him up and see if he can reach out to them for me.</p>
<p><strong>9 December 2016</strong></p>
<p>Stevie came through, turns out he does some work for that group he knows, so he's real close with them. They make paranormal shit, I'd think it ridiculous but then there's that stone me and Stevie found, I wonder what they did with it? Anywho, they came back with, what I think is a good answer to my problems. It's a virus that makes people want to celebrate Christmas! Pretty ingenious, I think. I've got a vial of the stuff, I know what I'll do. I think I'll start with Carl from down the street, he's always been a real Scrooge.</p>
<p><strong>23 December 2016</strong></p>
<p>Oh God what have I done? It was going so well, Carl really got into the spirit of the season. His light set up is fantastic and he was giving to charity. I saw him.. on the news. His fucking head exploded, it just blew up. God there was so much blood. I was so stupid to trust those shady motherfuckers, and poor Carl paid for it. He was never the nicest guy, but he didn't deserve that, no one does. I'm going to the police, they won't believe me but if I show them the vial, they'll have to believe. Those bastards will pay for what they did. I gotta call Stevie and tell him what happened.</p>
<p>Stevie told those fuckers that I was going to the police, the idiot! He said that I should let them handle damage control, I won't let Stanton just sweep it under the rung. Stanton will be coming for us, I gotta hurry. If I don't make it then go to the warehouse on Clarkson oh fuck I just heard someone in the living room</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9149-01</strong> The individual mentioned by Poi-98763's journal was identified as Steven Trevino<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> by investigating Agents.<br/>
MTF Epsilon-37 discovered Trevino bound to the radiator in the corner of his living room, he was completely nude and showed signs of undergoing advanced interrogation techniques.<br/>
Cause of death was determined to be a .44 gunshot to the head.<br/>
On 26/12/2016, MTF Iota-10 conducted a raid on a warehouse belonging to the Crimson Consumer Products Corporation. The warehouse was believed to be the one mentioned in<br/>
Mr. Doherty's journal. Agents engaged several Crimson Consumer Products security personnel, resulting in the loss of 1 agent and the termination of 7 Crimson Consumer Products personnel, 8 personnel were taken into Foundation custody. 4 anomalous objects were recovered from the warehouse and were transported to Site-19 for containment.<br/>
Crimson Consumer Products is believed to be a front for a previously unknown paracriminal organization. Investigation is ongoing.<br/>
A handwritten note was discovered inside the manager's office. (See Below)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Rylie, word just came in, those Foundation bastards are poking around, and Mr. Stanton wants your place liquidated. Burn the records, take the items to Emersons, and kill whoever you think will snitch. I can't believe you let Doc make that virus for those idiots and believe me Mr. Stanton is pissed. Expect a thrashing.<br/>
