<p>SCP-9892, Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item#:</strong> SCP-9892</p>
<p><strong>Object class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The owner of SCP-9892, Dylan Molson, has been hired in a limited role for the purposes of maintaining SCP-9892. All Foundation information that mentions the existence of a Site-𝒾 should be logged for later reference and no further action taken in its regard.<br/>
SCP-9892 has been found to infect other articles that mention a site and change it to Site-𝒾. AI program Banshee has been implemented to scrub and correct all instances of SCP-9892-1 from documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9892 is a red-painted slat shed with a black shingle roof located in rural Ontario, Norfolk County. SCP-9892 resides on the property belonging to Dylan Molson, who is currently being treated as a member of staff. SCP-9892's anomalous properties began manifesting on 21/05/2010, when the page listing all active Foundation sites and facilities listed Site-𝒾, which includes a list of anomalies it contains. SCP-9892-1 instances manifest digitally as Site-𝒾 on the relevant Foundation pages and forums.</p>
<p>The following is a partial list of the anomalies manifested by SCP-9892.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<td>SHD-1</td>
<td>A collection of artifacts that are used for repairing and building.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHD-2</td>
<td>A large mechanical blade used for cutting green spikes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHD-3</td>
<td>A metal container of viscous liquid, which is used to make SHD-2 work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHD-4</td>
<td>A long-handled artifact with a wide flat head, used for making holes in the ground.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A Foundation agent was sent to SCP-9892 to investigate any anomalous activity associated with the listed anomalies. The investigation concluded that all anomalies manifested by SCP-9892 were mundane items within itself, such as tools, a gas-powered lawn mower, oil, and a shovel.</p>
<p>Since Foundation contact with SCP-9892 was formerly established, the number of SCP-9892-1 instances manifesting decreased by 10%. This was reduced by a further 25% when permission was granted to use a part of SCP-9892 to store clearance level 0 documentation. A trial run of storing a safe class SCP inside SCP-9892 reduced this number by up to 75%.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> On 17/10/2012, Site-44 entered an automated lockdown in response to SCP-9892 being broken into, as it had no way of entering its own lockdown. Contact with Dylan Molson revealed that his lawnmower had been stolen, which is corroborated by a message found on a toilet supplies restock list for Site-50 on the same day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trouble at Site-𝒾, SHD-2 is no longer here. Please help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dylan Molson was given a Foundation lanyard and ID to wear when interacting with SCP-9892 and was asked to make at least one visit to SCP-9892 every day. SCP-9892-1 instances were reduced by 95%. Further reduction of SCP-9892-1 instances has been deemed non-essential.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> On 08/02/2025, Clearance level 4 researcher Dr Kenzie Molson reclassified SCP-9892 as 'Very Important'. When asked why the reclassification was made, this was her response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lived with my dad until I was fifteen, and used to play different games using his shed as a base or hideout, or my own home. My mother got custody of me on the twenty-first of May. I missed my dad, and I missed the shed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum-3:</strong> SCP-9892-1 instances reduced by 100%.</p>
