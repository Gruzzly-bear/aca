            <h1>SCP-475</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-475</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-475 is to be kept in a watertight containment locker in Storage Unit 45-C of <a href="/scp-089">Site</a>-<a href="/scp-3615">36</a>. All testing with para-religions requires permission from the Site Director.</p>
<p>To prevent religious Groups of Interest from learning of the object's existence, knowledge of SCP-475 is to follow Level III Infosecurity Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-475 is an ornate sculpture of soap depicting an unidentified Pope. Inscribed at the base of the statue is the phrase "Cleanliness is next to Godliness." Analysis reveals the object to be composed of long-chain saturated fatty acids (CH<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>), totaling 89.7% of its mass, with the remaining 10.3% corresponding to ███████-████, attached as the hydrophilic head. It is believed that the ███████-████ gives SCP-475 its unique properties, but all attempts to recreate this compound have failed.</p>
<p>When SCP-475 comes into contact with water and is applied to the skin, all accumulated foreign contaminants are removed. Tested materials include dead skin cells, perspiration, bodily parasites, mold, dirt, and detergents. Post test examinations have shown that 100% of foreign contaminants are removed, a statistical anomaly. This process only occurs when used on human skin. All attempts so-far to use SCP-475 on non-humans have failed to produce its anomalous effects. Testing on anomalous animals, such as <a href="/scp-1845">SCP-1845</a> or <a href="/scp-2050">SCP-2050</a>, is pending approval. Unlike typical soaps, the usage of SCP-475 does not damage it.</p>
<p>SCP-475's secondary anomalous effects manifest when it is used on a professing member of an organized religion. Subjects universally report greater mental clarity, show greater adherence to church doctrine, and rate at least 15 <a href="/scp-1844">centiakiva</a> more on the Brandon-Spencer Piety Scale. These effects increase in intensity the longer the subject uses the object, culminating in local reality changes, signified by all bodies of water within a 5 meter radius turning into an equivalent liquid that is considered "holy" in the subject's religion. Examples of these changes can be found in Test-Log-475.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-475 came under Foundation containment when insubordinate elements of the Horizon Initiative relinquished control of it. These elements cited a desire to maintain unity and prevent infighting as to why the object could not be kept. SCP-475 was allegedly recovered from the residence of the Catholic Cardinal, ████ ███████, who was found deceased from injuries "consistent with upside-down crucifixion."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The following materials were also provided:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I write this document to preserve the personal revelation invested in me. Over these past years, I have grappled with my faith. Having committed it to paper, the idea seems absurd. I, a leader of the faith. I, whose vote has determined the successor of Peter. I, who has undeniable proof of God's glory. The Initiative, for all of its missteps and blasphemy, has provided undeniable proof of God's glory. Proof that has to be withheld from the world due to inscrutable agreements with <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-hub-page">occult forces</a> who do not have salvation in mind. Despite this undeniable proof, I wrestled with fears that God is not almighty. How can a God so glorious and almighty stand by as false idols exert their forces over man? By the grace of God, my fears have been quelled. The night before, I beheld an apparition of Mary. To try to capture the glory of it would be futile, but it is an experience too magnificent to withhold. We were out at sea. Below the waves, I could see the Church Penitent, awaiting purification. Further below that, deep beneath, there was Creation. All around us were the gilded statues of Saints, each linked to a church, far below us. The Virgin Mother herself was resplendent, situated atop a pedestal, the pedestal carried by a many-winged creature of fire. In her right arm, she held the Savior. In her left, a block of marble. She confided in me, told me of my purpose. Encased in the marble were the Keys of Heaven, the Church's Magisterium itself, the Authority to Commune with Saints. I was to take it, "free the keys", and cleanse the Church Militant. Then, "All will be made clear". When I woke up, there was a block of soap on my nightstand. Queer, but I do not question the machinations of God. Every day since that night has been hazy. I have worked with a fervor to accomplish this mission. Even to this moment, I have my doubts. But I am human. It is in my nature to doubt. If there is once thing I can be certain of, it is that I am a cog in God's plan.<br/>
