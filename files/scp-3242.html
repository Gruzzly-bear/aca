            <h1>SCP-3242</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3242</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The subject should be contained in a rodent cage. Live rodents or similar-sized animals should be housed within the vicinity and are not to exceed forty in number.</p>
<p>Researchers are to call SCP-3242 "the subject" if mention of it is ever necessary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Assigned staff are allowed to leave the area unless the subject has vanished from containment. Should this occur, all staff working with the subject must be contacted and pass two of three required tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic health evaluation.</li>
<li>A psychological evaluation.</li>
<li>Look into a mirror.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The subject is an unknown organism restructured into a self-building program made for the assumed purpose of stealing information. This program has been made "real" by unknown methods, seeming to work on predefined logic rather than natural laws. The true appearance of the subject has been described as "less than grey" in the few verified observations available.</p>
<p>The logic by which the subject operates is thought to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infection can spread through media concerning or specifically mentioning the subject, if the contents of the media are retained in memory. Class-A Amnestics are the most effective way to reverse this.</li>
<li>When the subject replaces an object or entity, everything, including biological processes and materials often described as data or code, is replaced. The matter that replaces it proves unattainable for testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject currently resembles <em>Mus musculus</em> or House mouse, of the BALB/c<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> strain. Iterations can be identified by random, increasingly regular superficial changes in characteristics also specific to the species or "grouping" of the iteration appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>
<p>The anomaly was discovered in Brookfield Zoo on 6/15/2013. Risk to the public has been assumed self-negated as of 2/15/15, when the number of individuals affected by the anomaly reached fifty without the immediate loss of the subject from its containment.</p>
<p>The mass, weight, and physical capabilities of each iteration are determined by species and/or stereotyping. Individuals unaware of the subject are unable to be touched by the subject.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The subject is also unable to interact with or touch powered technology. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Attempts to take photographic evidence of the subject have also failed.</span> As of May 2015, the subject has appeared as an outline in photographs. Each subsequent iteration has shown increased opacity in pictures.</p>
<p>Other abnormalities are noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>A process similar to capillary action occurs when dermal areas are removed. The effectiveness of this lessens with repetition and larger areas of removed dermis.</li>
<li>Internal physical functions are reduced to muscle spasms; the lack of air flow explains the loss of the subjects' ability to speak. Conditions to observe the inner workings of the subject for longer than thirty seconds are difficult to accomplish.</li>
<li>Ability of the subject to continue living without major parts. This includes the loss of the head. Complete and simultaneous removal has not been successful due to the fragile nature of the body.</li>
<li>The effect on substitutes given after the above; objects of appropriate shape have been observed to gain the same random visual changes despite not actually functioning.</li>
<li>The subject can be destroyed with slight deliberate force.</li>
<li>Any part removed from the subject quickly dissipates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that the subject consumes is returned without any loss in mass. All materials consumed become their individual ingredients<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>that previously constituted the former, albeit with an unusual color and viscosity.</p>
<p>Visual anomalies within the area have been reported by staff since at least 1/1/15. Specific descriptions deviate slightly, but are otherwise consistent:</p>

<ol>
<li>An unknown species of owl with unreasonably long legs and a crown. Often noticed only as a shadow running through the nearest wall. This has made attempts to capture it difficult and ongoing.</li>
<li>"Soft" masses that follow staff randomly. Changes in shape, size, and color are common.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> No clearly aggressive or determined behavior has been observed. Physical contact fails or causes the specific mass to "burst" and vanish.</li>
<li>A "pig" that possesses a long, prehensile body and no other limbs. Sometimes appears with multiple segments that move independently, and may have a preference for appearing in high places. It disappears when approached.</li>
<li>An inverted wooden chair suspended five feet off the hallway floor at a diagonal angle, just outside of video surveillance. Later found to merely be nailed to the wall and ceiling, and assumed related to previous responses from staff and security.</li>
<li>A cervine animal with goat horns- only has appeared during Christmas every year. Sometimes manifests as a humanoid with above head and horns, or is seen as such despite conflicting perspectives. It may have an affinity for tableware.</li>
<li>Featureless humanoids that do not seem to possess arms. The few that observed it described a feeling of unplaceable anxiety and helplessness. No movement has been noted from these.</li>
<li>An immaterial duplicate of a birthday cake from the family gathering of Researcher Andersen. It changed into a highly agitated "unicorn" before vanishing and has not manifested since. Indentations in the floor following the incident have been found.</li>
<li>A sheaf of paper that appeared next to this file. Both were on the desk of Dr. Hester, and the manifested object disappeared when Dr. Hester attempted to open it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some display the ability to move small objects but seem unable to pose any higher threat. As they have been observed manifesting in new ways and copying forms on occasion, exact identities cannot be confirmed or determined.</p>
<p>Visual anomalies may not be dependent on the location of the subject, as previously believed.</p>
<p>Direct communication has had little to no success.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The subject may cause</span> permanent code generation may occur on any blank storage device located within at least fifteen meters around the subject. How or why this happens is currently unknown. The devices are filled with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">random syntax</span> abbreviated names for amino acids, repeated names of missing individuals, and known casualties in binary.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this are transcribed below and listed by the time of their realized corruption.</p>

<p><em>Any unwanted behavior from the subject that is not a risk to containment should be ignored. To do otherwise has proven to only encourage the repetition of behavior.</em></p>
<p><em>Speaking about restricted information or previously assigned staff while within the vicinity of the subject may be considered grounds for reprimand or demotion, depending on the infraction.</em></p>
<p>Note: Those incapable of maintaining emotional and psychological detachment should be given amnestics and reassigned.</p>
