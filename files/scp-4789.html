<p>SCP-4789</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4789</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4789 and its DVDs are kept in a standard Safe-class locker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4789 is a pair of promotional cardboard 3-D glasses produced for the 2005 movie <em>The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</em>.</p>
<p>While using SCP-4789 to view a movie, subjects often describe the experience as more 'immersive' or 'real', and report auditory and sensory hallucinations providing the sensations of rain, wind, heat, vibrations, and other stimuli in the movie viewed.</p>
<p>Repeated uses of SCP-4789 result in anomalous effects occurring near subjects while they sleep. Subjects are never woken by these effects but report significantly improved moods after waking normally. These effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds of indeterminate source, such as loud footsteps, roars, explosions, or engine noises.</li>
<li>Reptilian and selachian bite marks appearing in nearby walls.</li>
<li>Significant changes in ambient temperature.</li>
<li>Small electrical discharges.</li>
<li>Objects within the room moving as if underwater.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> D-19060 was allowed to view a movie using SCP-4789, and equipped with a prototype OJOS Dream-Visualizer system.</p>

<p>[<strong>BEGIN LOG</strong>]<br/>
<em>Visuals suffer from slight interference. D-19060 appears to be in a large rocky plain, at night. Volcanoes can be seen in the distance, as well as a large inky black cloud taking up half the horizon and obscuring the moon. Thousands of similarly black entities of various shapes and sizes walk ahead of the cloud.</em></p>
<p><em>A woman dressed in orange armor releases a large explosive blast from her eyes, aimed at tentacled extensions of the clouds. Beams of solid light extend from the moon, piercing the cloud.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> My finger's gonna go through.</p>
<p><em>D-19060 pushes his finger into his palm. The finger appears to phase through.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Alright, it worked. Wait.</p>
<p><em>D-19060 looks down at his arms again, and sees that he is wearing colorful, gemstone-inlaid armor.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Oh yeah, duh.</p>
<p><em>D-19060 begins to run towards the cloud.</em></p>
<p><em>A large (~200 m) cloud arm erupts from the ground and swings in a wide arc, throwing multiple entities aside. D-19060 is knocked down from the shockwave.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Damn!</p>
<p><em>A purple skinned humanoid clad in iridescent armor helps D-19060 to his feet. As a blob of dark substance is launched at the two of them, the humanoid bisects it with an oversized glaive. The halves of the blob dissipate into smoke.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Whoa, thanks, uh-</p>
<p><strong>Purple Humanoid:</strong> Tbil.</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Tuh-bill?</p>
<p><strong>Tbil:</strong> There's more where that came from! Let's go make waves.</p>
<p><em>Tbil runs off, and proceeds to engage other dark entities.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> I need to find the commander, or leader or whatever.</p>
<p><em>A volcano emerges from the ground to his left and erupts, briefly blinding him. Interference intensifies for the next minute. The OJOS system becomes warmer.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Probably that way?</p>
<p><em>As he runs, D-19060 looks up and sees a flying Viking longship equipped with rocket engines, flanked by six shiny metal spacecraft, flying towards the volcano.</em></p>
<p><em>A 500 m tall gaseous entity manifests and emerges from the cloud. The entity resembles a large three-headed dragon, with several gorilla-like arms protruding at random locations.</em></p>
<p><em>[STATIC]</em></p>
<p><em>A gigantic, four-armed mechanical battle suit grapples with the dragon, while the Viking ship and its escorts provide suppressing fire.</em></p>
<p><em>D-19060 finds an abandoned motor vehicle, with one oversized wheel on front and a jet engine pointed downward on the back. He boards the vehicle and drives it towards the volcano.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> I think it's safe to say I'm dreaming.</p>
<p><em>[STATIC]</em></p>
<p><em>A large blue armored tyrannosaur charges up the volcano, wielding a glowing red and black blade. On its back sits a human woman with pink hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> FORWARD!</p>
<p><em>The woman stands up and runs towards the back end of the dinosaur's spine. The dinosaur whips its tail, sending the woman flying towards the dragon's head. The woman emits a bright light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Woman:</strong> Not destruction. Not a simple flame.</p>
<p><em>The woman shouts, and a flare of light erupts from the volcano, enveloping both her and the dragon.</em></p>
<p><em>[STATIC]</em></p>
<p><em>D-19060 punches a wormlike dark entity in the face, and it explodes in a shower of seashells. A high school marching band walks forward, destroying more entities with the shockwaves emanating from their instruments. A large, wheel-shaped dark entity rolls towards D-19060, and the band scatters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Male Voice:</strong> BEGONE!</p>
<p><em>A tall man wearing gemstone-covered armor and wielding a greatsword makes a crushing motion with his free hand, and a large number of green beams emanate from within the wheel entity, destroying it. D-19060 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> No way… King of Greenworld?</p>
<p><strong>King of Greenworld:</strong> Eric! Welcome back!</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> I… yeah. It's me.</p>
<p><em>A green glow envelops the King of Greenworld for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>King of Greenworld:</strong> The other Kings will be glad to see you once I regroup with them.</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> What is this place?</p>
<p><em>The King of Greenworld frowns.</em></p>
<p><strong>King of Greenworld:</strong> Are you quite alright, Master Eric? I would have thought you'd know your mission front and back by now. I shall, uh, retrieve the Ancient Weaver; she will know what must be done.</p>
<p><em>The King of Greenworld taps his ear. An ovoid shape made of glowing woven fibers appears in the air. The fibers separate, and the blue tyrannosaur previously seen emerges.</em></p>
<p><strong>King of Greenworld:</strong> Ancient Weaver. I will take my leave now, the Ten Gems require my backup in the magnet fields.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> May your sword remain ever sharp.</p>
<p><em>The King of Greenworld whistles, and a green, dragon-like creature with butterfly wings flies in. The King climbs atop the creature and flies away.</em></p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver turns to face D-19060. Its left eye is mechanical and glows red, and appears to scan D-19060.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Eric.</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Please, Ancient Weaver. I just want to know where I am. I haven't even thought about the King of Greenworld or his brothers and sisters since I was 14.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> You dreamed them. Where did you think they went when you no longer had need of them? (<em>pause</em>) Something isn't right. You've been a valued warrior here for years. The Kings and Queens rally under your banner and flourish under the power of your memories. And yet…</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> I feel like I've seen <em>you</em> before.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Every soul that dreams has seen me.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver holds her sword outward and twists it, causing D-19060 to become entangled by a mass of thread. She sheathes the sword, and the threads turn into crystal.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, the OJOS system freezes for several seconds before reconnecting. The machine is beginning to reach its tolerable heat limit.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> Hey wait!</p>
<p><em>Large comets composed of the dark cloud begin to fall to the ground in the distance, scattering large black scorpions upon impact. Flying fish resembling ocean sunfish arrive to engage the scorpions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> There is no time, and the darkness in the air grows stronger. If in fact you have been compromised, I will try my hardest to save you.</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> At least get me out of this so I can go home.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Guillermo and Wilberto were right that your people have so much to offer the world of dreams. The purity of light, the vastness of possibility, the courage and the strength to fight for what you love. Small wonder that the darkness seeks to attack you most of all.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver reaches her arm out, and phases it through D-19060's head.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> I am not sure how much of this you will remember with this abnormality in play. If you retain anything at all, let it be that it is your duty to dream a better dream. And we in turn shall fight to make it real.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver pulls a metallic thread from out of D-19060's head, causing severe static.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Ah. [STATIC] interloper. We have met before, I believe. Please do not interfere again.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver turns to her right, and draws her sword in preparation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Every thing that is or was began with a dream. And unless I, Palsinnor, stand resolute at the head of these worthy warriors, every thing will end with a nightmare.</p>
<p><em>The ground shakes. The cloud parts, and a large amorphous mass with several dozen legs crawls forward. An indistinct face emerges from its front and roars loudly.</em></p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver spins her sword in a circle. The crystal trapping D-19060 shatters into dust.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> He reformed more quickly than we thought. King Sapphire! Jelrikam is at my position.</p>
<p><em>A loud thunderclap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Dreamwalkers, it's now or never!</p>
<p><em>A large number of people, all clad in various costumes or armor, materialize behind the Ancient Weaver. Each one is wearing an instance of SCP-4789.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Dreamwalkers, summon your creations. As they once helped you when you created them, now help them, help us win this war once and for all.</p>
<p><em>A man in blue armor, wielding a gigantic shard of sapphire as a sword, rides in on a large, animate stuffed turtle. He swings his sword upward, and several hundred duplicates of himself form from the ground. Meanwhile, a humanoid in a spacesuit flies down from the Moon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> (<em>to D-19060</em>) Either tell me to free you, or stay and fight alongside us.</p>
<p><strong>D-19060:</strong> (<em>to himself</em>) It's all coming back. (<em>out loud</em>) I will fight.</p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver smiles. She draws another weapon from her back, a black stone macahuitl, and swings it in a tight pattern. Miniature solar flares fluctuate along its edges.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Dance with me again, Jelrikam, but you will not darken the stars we have earned.</p>
<p><strong>King Sapphire:</strong> Let us expel it from this plane. Forward!</p>
<p><em>Jelrikam ejects eight of its legs, which orbit it rapidly. After accelerating, all eight legs break orbit and speed towards D-19060 and the others. King Sapphire shouts, and a wall of solid crystal blocks the legs and shatters. King Sapphire waves his sword, and the shards of sapphire spin and destroy the legs, reducing them to smoke.</em></p>
<p><em>The Ancient Weaver vocalizes, and shimmering, spiderweb-like portals appear in a ring around Jelrikam's center. She stabs her sword into the ground and bright beams of light emerge from each portal, striking Jelrikam. A white cloud appears in the sky, and brains fall from it to hit Jelrikam, exploding on contact.</em></p>
<p><em>D-19060 reaches down to his belt. A weapon appears that wasn't present previously, and D-19060 draws it. It is an oversized gun, with the barrel shaped like a shark head.</em></p>
<p><em>Jelrikam charges forward, still smoking from the beams. It partially splits itself down the middle, and bolts of electricity are released.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ancient Weaver:</strong> Get down!</p>
<p><em>D-19060 immediately wakes, and the OJOS system overloads and bursts into flames.</em></p>
