<p><strong>Special Cooking Procedures:</strong> The meal is kept within a fifty (50) by fifty (50) by twenty-five (25) centimetre conventional oven for a period of four (4) hours at four hundred and twenty-five (425) degrees Fahrenheit. Access is via a slightly jammed door that really only opens if you pull <em>up</em> first and <em>then</em> outwards. Site personnel are NOT to use the blender, toaster, or coffee maker while the oven is on, to avoid blowing a fuse, again. It is further advised that all personnel preparing food or eating within the vicinity should maintain a good distance from the oven due to how much heat bleeds out around the edges.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7855 is currently being cooked by Director Vincent Bohart, within Site-333's employee kitchen. Conversation with the aforementioned individual, as well as other attempts to discern what is in the oven, have not yielded a definitive answer. Personnel are unable to recall any details regarding SCP-7855 when not preparing or cooking it directly. To clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Vincent Bohart originally acquired SCP-7855 is unknown.</li>
<li>The reason behind the cooking time, temperature, and method used, are unknown.</li>
<li>SCP-7855's physical appearance, texture, flavour profile, and relevant wine pairings are unknown.</li>
<li>Whether the burning smell noticeable near SCP-7855 is a result of the item, or the oven itself, is unknown.</li>
<li>Why Vincent Bohart chose to cook <em>whatever</em> SCP-7855 is in the communal staff kitchen, is known: he's a short-sighted jackass.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although they were not able to describe the sensory experiences of cooking SCP-7855, Site-333 personnel uniformly agreed that the experience was "making them hungry." Individuals began to prepare non-anomalous food for group consumption while SCP-7855 cooked.</p>
<p>After a period of time that Vincent Bohart determined "seemed about right." SCP-7855 was removed from the oven. This is presumed to be the case due to the uncleaned baking tray left in the Site-333 kitchen sink.</p>

<p><em>The group sits around Site-333's conference table, as snow continues to settle outside. Half-eaten, mundane, recognizable foodstuffs spread across the table. Several new wine stains are visible on the chairs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> So there I was, behind the blackjack table, trying to deal out the cards while the goat's trying to chew through my pocket to the stack of $100s I'd stashed there. And the 8'-fuckoff" <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7666" target="_blank">Wrath demon</a> is glaring down at me, and I say to them 'well, I heard they've got a roasted goat leg going over at the buffet, so you must have missed the sacrifice.'</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> How'd that work out?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> Fella was so pissed he hit on a 19. Broke the table in half. I slipped out the back door with the chips while he took off after his startled furry friend.</p>
<p><strong>Noah Patel:</strong> Is that why you were transferred from <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/undervegas-hub" target="_blank">Site-666</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> No, that's a whole different story. What about you, Leonora? Any memorable holidays this time of year?</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> I once spent Christmas on the Faroe Islands, in a single-person micro tent eating cold canned beans and taking samples of bird shit to check for anomalous parasites.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> Jeez, okay, you win the worst Christmas award.</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> That was my favourite Christmas memory.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> Real Hallmark holiday special, there.</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> <em>Laughing</em> Okay, favorite Christmas movies, go.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano &amp; Vincent Bohart:</strong> Die—</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> And you can't say Die Hard!</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> Die Hard with a Vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> Not actually a Christmas movie, it takes place during the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> You gotta be shitting me. Okay, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Reminds me of growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> Watching the film or its events?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> Both. What about you, Noah?</p>
<p><strong>Noah Patel:</strong> The Grinch. It's rare you see accurate cryptids depicted in the media.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> Isn't that—</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> Oh, let him have this one. It's the season for it.</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> And, uh. How are we feeling about the 'it' we just ate?</p>
<p><em>The group looks towards the center of the conference table, where a picked-clean serving platter sits empty surrounded by an array of smaller tableware and cutlery.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> I mean, it wasn't bad. Certainly no worse than the Christmas meatloaf I'd be eating tonight otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Noah Patel:</strong> How would you describe the texture? I can't recall. Was it… spongey? gristly?</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> Both I think? The gravy certainly helped. As did the cranberry sauce. I think whatever I ate was more of a soup.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> Huh, I was chewing something, that I know. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>Noah Patel:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> I kind of, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong> What is it, Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> I remember the flavour, I think. Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong> Well, go on then. You cooked the thing so it seems about fair. What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong> It tasted like <span style="filter: blur(4px);">chicken.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> Happy Holidays, everyone!</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel:</strong></span> Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> Thanks again for cooking dinner, Vincent.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Don't expect me to make a habit out of it.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> As strange as it feels to write this, I kind of actually…. had a good time?</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> Yeah, me too. Well, I suppose we can avoid writing you up for misuse of the Foundation emergent breach channels, Vincent. It is the holidays, after all.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> I don't appreciate the slander.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> Slander is written, this is libel. I'm using speech-to-text.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> You're liable to be getting a disciplinary report for insubordination.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> There's the Scrooge we know.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel:</strong></span> Have any of you felt kind of off the last few days? I have and I'm wondering if it has to do with what we ate.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> Maybe a little bloated.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> What <em>did</em> we eat?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Oh yeah, I figured out what was going on there.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> You're just telling us this now?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange"><strong>Noah Patel:</strong></span> Was I right it was a turducken?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Gas leak.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> What?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> <em>Major</em> gas leak. Like off the charts, the oven was free-pouring it into the site.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> One-day-old Christ. Seriously?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> That's not even the half of it. It turns out everything on site: the oven, the boiler, the furnace, the hot tub, everything that heats up, is powered by burning sewer gas. We had an agreement with a group calling themselves the '<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7715" target="_blank">Plumbers</a>,' which saved us a lot in heating costs.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> This isn't natural gas, it's <em>natural</em> gas, and chances are it's been leaking for a few weeks now. The whole Site is like a dry Christmas tree in a chimney.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> Thank god we stopped Noah from flaming the pudding when he burned himself.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> Or that the damn <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8472-ex" target="_blank">rat didn't set it off</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Yeah, so any way that's the reason for the season.</p>
<p><span style="color: green"><strong>Leonora Morales:</strong></span> So how are we just now learning about this?</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Oh. One of those interns must have messed around with the monoxide detector or something when they triggered that breach alarm.</p>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Tony Catalano:</strong></span> That doesn't explain anything.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> Mysteries of life. Anyway, they need some time to fix the oven and pump all the gas out of the old building.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Vincent Bohart:</strong></span> So I suppose you're all getting an extra week of vacation. Happy Holidays. As for me…</p>
