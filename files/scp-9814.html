<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The walls of SCP-9814's containment chamber are lined with seven (7) millimeter thick tungsten plates, which are replaced yearly. No personnel are to be within SCP-9814's containment chamber at any times other than the purpose of replacing the plates in the chamber surrounding SCP-9814. When this is carried out, a titanium box is lowered over SCP-9814 to prevent it from becoming active.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9814 is a wooden dining chair, measuring fifty-eight (58) centimeters in height. It is carved ornately, with traditional Chinese markings and designs engraved upon every surface sans the seat. Testing of SCP-9814's wood has revealed it is carved from a Japanese cherry blossom tree, and is not segmented into pieces, meaning it was simply a large log carved into a chair.</p>
<p>When a person is within SCP-9814's blast radius, SCP-9814 will enter its 'Active' stage, in which it will violently detonate with the force of one (1) kilogram of TNT explosive. This explosion appears to happen spontaneously, with no factors inducing it, and will launch wooden shards up to twenty (20) meters away. Approximately forty-five (45) minutes after SCP-9814's 'Active' stage begins, it will deactivate and re-enter its "Inactive' stage. When this begins, all shards of SCP-9814 will reform into SCP-9814. This appears to happen in 'reverse,' with the shards moving in the exact path they exploded in, accompanied by the reversed audio of the explosion, and the flames seemingly returning into SCP-9814. When this is complete, SCP-9814 will become inactive for at least forty-eight (48) hours.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9814 was discovered in the home of retired nurse Constance Bullsworth, age sixty-six (66), who was found severely mangled on her dining room floor after she was reported missing by her sisters. The room was completely trashed, with nearly everything destroyed. The only thing that was not damaged was SCP-9814.</p>
<p>It was found that Constance had purchased SCP-9814 from an antique dealer, who had previously acquired the item through <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/marshall-carter-and-dark-hub" target="_blank">Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark</a>. On her nightstand, an unopened letter was found, that had apparently not been its original envelope (as it was not stamped with the Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark insignia).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Item #942</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">An unassuming item at first, this seemingly normal chair has a volatile reaction that is perfect for any would-be assassins needing an easy way to remove a target. Simply place this object within a targets abode— guised as a gift, perhaps— and wait. Within the week, the target will be obliterated, and the item will remain still and destroyed until collection can be achieved. When recollection is possible, the item reforms, easily transportable. Death of the target is <sup>nearly</sup> guaranteed!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bidding starts at $12,000</p>
<p><sub>Disclaimer: Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark LLC is not responsible for any damages or injury sustained due to misuse of the item. Purchase at your own risk.</sub></p>
