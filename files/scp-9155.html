<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Any SCP-9155 samples not being used in research are to be housed in secure storage at Site-101. Researchers who wish to obtain a sample of SCP-9155 for experimentation or analysis should contact Doctor Darian Coatyl. The substance should be stored in sterile containers, and extreme caution should be taken to avoid contamination of surfaces; even small amounts may create 9155-1 instances if it comes into contact with plant life. (If you wish to view the containment procedures for the previous designation of SCP-9155, they have been archived below for convenience.)</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9155 is a fluid of extraterrestrial origin collected after Incident 9155-D, in which the substance was scattered across the southern United States as a form of precipitation (see Addendum 1). This fluid is the excretion of a serpentine celestial entity, seemingly analogous to urine. It is believed that its anomalous properties are related to a life- or hibernation-supporting process within the entity (see Addendum 8). It is a shimmery blue that glows slightly in daylight, though this glow has been observed to fade over time as its thaumic potency decays.</p>
<p>The substance has a significant revitalizing effect on any organism that comes into contact with, or ingests, SCP-9155. During Incident 9155-D, the Exclusion Zone(s) experienced anomalous floral output, restoring dying organisms and causing healthy growth to expand rapidly. Organisms that have been affected by SCP-9155 are hereafter designated as 9155-1 instances.</p>
<p>This document was originally drafted during Incident 9155-D; however, after its abrupt conclusion, the fluid itself was reclassed as the primary anomaly. For documentation purposes, the original description concerning Incident 9155-D is included below.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>On March 17th, 2026, an anomalous fluid began to fall across the American South, affecting states as far west as Colorado and as far north as Ohio. Foundation Sites within the affected area mobilized to establish Exclusion Zones around populated or significantly affected areas, evacuating those on the outer borders of these zones. Those remaining in the heart of the Exclusion Zones are currently under Foundation custody; security forces have been dispatched to monitor population centers and ensure neither entry into nor escape from their assigned zones.</p>
<p>Around 9 hours after the incident began, noticeable growth of floral life within the Zones was documented by both the Foundation and the citizens contained in the broader Exclusion Zone, established to encompass the entire southern portion of the nation. State parks, nature preserves, and similar areas experienced a boost in vitality and productiveness unmatched by any existing records. The various cities and suburbs within the Zones were similarly affected, with many experiencing a rapid rewilding of the previous ecosystem(s) as seed banks and encroachment of neighboring environments outpaced attempts to combat their germination or growth, respectively. As such, containment attempts focused on a return to normalcy have failed, and will likely continue to be ineffective as long as the precipitation continues.</p>
<p>Should the incident conclude, protocols have been drafted for mass amnesticization of current residents. Suppression protocols are already in place to prevent knowledge of Incident 9155-D spreading outside the Exclusion Zone; webcrawlers have been instructed to search for and scrape all attempted online documentation of these events. Selected documentation may be included within this article for future reference. This is an ongoing event, and this description will be updated with any new developments.</p>

<p>If you've been below the Mason-Dixon recently, you've seen the shimmering rain and lush growth that's been spreading across the southeast. Our submissions have been flooded with readers stunned by this seemingly miraculous event, and last night, I ventured out of my Tennessee home to see it for myself.</p>
<p>[REMOVED FOR BREVITY]</p>
<p>While many of us would see these changes as inspiring hope for the future of these struggling, fractured ecosystems, others are (somewhat) rightfully concerned about potential destruction or obstruction of human spaces; some interviewees recalled the dreaded kudzu invasion that swallowed many neighborhoods in years past. It seems that local governments are inclined to agree, as many cities and small towns have seen an influx of officials and security forces where the growth is highest. What do you think? Could the pace of growth increase, as experts are predicting? Comment below with your thoughts!</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9155.4:</strong> Establishment of temporary containment procedures</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1 id="toc4"><span><strong>A Memo from Darian Coatyl</strong></span></h1>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging our Site Staff, MTFs, and various other personnel for their rapid response to this ongoing event. Establishment of the Exclusion Zones has allowed us to maintain Veil integrity despite the scope of the anomaly. However, the situation has changed.</p>
<p>As of one hour ago, SCP-9155 has demonstrated a significant effect on floral growth. Many of our ground teams have observed this for themselves, and the danger it presents to both Foundation and civilian safety. In response, I have proposed an evacuation and suppression campaign to our partner Sites, which has just been authorized by Command. We will relocate civilians around the borders of the affected areas, prevent external coverage or documentation of the anomaly, and establish a patrolled border around the broader Exclusion Zone. This last effort is to prevent incursion from the outside and escape by those within.</p>
<p>Due to the size of the Exclusion Zone and the logistical difficulties of moving such a significant population without risk to the Veil, there will be civilians in the heart of the Zones who cannot be evacuated. It is our responsibility to protect these people from SCP-9155, and from themselves, until the anomaly concludes or further research provides us with a more efficient response.<br/>
To Secure. To Contain. To Protect. This is our duty, and it will be done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Commentary from Head Researcher Coatyl:</strong> Confidence and commitment among the response teams has been flagging, to say the least. Frankly speaking, I don't blame them; thousands of hostile, reality-breaking entities safely contained, and yet we're losing to rain. I'd like to believe we will find an answer to this problem, but our current knowledge has offered little of use.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9155.5:</strong> Selection of recorded data on ecosystem productivity and behavior changes</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Location/Ecoregion</th>
<th>Notable Changes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everglades</td>
<td>Rather than the expected increase in density observed in other grass species, sawgrass coverage in the marshes has not uniformly increased. Existing dense patches have seen a rise in productivity, but other areas in the marsh have instead shown an increase in biodiversity as specialist and opportunistic species benefit from the fluid's effects. Local increases in the population of periphyton in such areas is expected to support larger insect and amphibian populations, important food sources for many local species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kentucky Canebrakes</td>
<td><em>Arundinaria gigantea</em> (common name: giant river cane) coverage has grown significantly; the slow-spreading bamboo engages in sexual reproduction very rarely, preferring to spread through cloning of an established specimen. This cloning behavior has occurred at a much faster pace since the beginning of the Incident, increasing the population from a handful of small, isolated patches to an emerging network. Recorded populations of Alabama Pitcher Plants, a species only found within canebrake ecosystems, have begun to climb according to preliminary data; similar results have been predicted for several species of local fauna whose lifestyles depend on or greatly benefit from the canebrakes. The increased presence of cane stands along riverbanks has contributed to improved water filtration and quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Colorado Plateau</td>
<td>Typically dominated by pinyon-juniper woodland and xeric shrubland, the region is currently experiencing a bloom event normally caused by consistent rainfall. The sudden increase in wildflower population has attracted swarms of local pollinators and bird species; the spread of the desert globemallow, larval host for the small checkered skipper, has been well-documented due to its bright orange flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blackland Prairies</td>
<td>This region has also undergone a bloom event since the start of the Incident, with gayfeathers, wild indigos, and both species of bluestem grass experiencing the greatest population boost according to current data. Smaller mammals such as white-footed mice and gray foxes have been observed using the increased cover provided by this growth to expand their foraging and hunting ranges; great horned owls and barred owls have been sighted more frequently over the fields, likely attracted by the concentration of mice to these areas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ozark Highlands</td>
<td>Within the White River Hills region, general productivity of the oak-hickory forests and cedar glades among the streams has seen a marked increase. The various lakes fed by these streams have risen significantly due to the influx of fluid; water quality and clarity, notably, have not decreased despite the expected rise in soil erosion or runoff caused by such precipitation. Along the Eastern Ozark Border, the fluid has been unable to penetrate the dense claypan soil, instead running down the rocky slopes to concentrate within the river valleys below.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Commentary from Head Researcher Coatyl:</strong> I admit to no small amount of wonder seeing the prairies of my youth in such splendor; however, at the time of writing, we continue to lack a sufficient containment plan for locations on this scale. Our response teams are doing their best, but civilians within the Exclusion Zones are becoming restless or outright hostile to Foundation presence.</p>

Ooooookay I think I'm calling it there; if I didn't get to anyone, Avi's working on a help desk sidechannel.<br/>
Let's try to keep general, well, general in the meantime- how has everyone been holding up the last few days?</p>

I'm just saying, it's nice and all but I want to be able to drive down the street again. I know I'm not the only one. The second this stops or they figure out how to make it stop, expect the flamethrowers to come out.</p>
<p><strong><tt>ParakeetAvenger</tt></strong><br/>
yeah because if there's one thing nature does it's lie down and quit because humans told it to</p>
<p><strong><tt>BennyandtheJetsons</tt></strong><br/>
I've seen so many more birds in the backyard these past few days then I have in years. It's made a difference.</p>
<p><strong><tt>Kayla</tt></strong><br/>
As much as I understand the desire for things to go "back to normal," torching it all sounds… excessive.</p>
<p><strong><tt>Hacker/Slash</tt></strong><br/>
Precisely. We've been watching these ecosystems struggle for decades, and in days it's like everything just woke up and got to work again. People have said "it won't matter" or "it'll never last" for years, this is nothing new for us.</p>
<p><strong><tt>BananaManDan</tt></strong><br/>
ok but like. there's no way they're just gonna leave a quarter of the country overgrown and inaccessible</p>
<p><strong><tt>FrancisB</tt></strong><br/>
My father told me how the cities from a distance would look brown because of the smog. You'd have to stay inside because the air itself would make you sick. No one thought that would change, either.</p>
<p><strong><tt>7LeafClover420</tt></strong><br/>
Ok but that's exactly the point. The air was a problem, so people got together and fixed it and now it isn't a problem. You all see this as a good thing, which, sure, but how am I gonna get groceries if I can't even go down the street? How's the truck gonna get to the store if the highways are all blocked or broken?</p>
<p><strong><tt>Mar-soup-ial</tt></strong><br/>
not to be that guy but it's never been a better time to learn what plants in your area are edible<br/>
got a whole guide i can drop in the resource chat</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9155.7:</strong> Interview with POI-97462</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interview log 9155-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Doctor Darian Coatyl</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> POI-97462</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Webcrawlers cataloguing discussion of the anomaly for later removal alerted Foundation agents in the user's Exclusion Zone of their stated intention to consume a sample of SCP-9155. The user, hereafter referred to as POI-97462, was detained for questioning shortly after consuming the fluid.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[Begin Log]</p>
<p><em>POI-97462 appears relaxed, eyes slightly glazed over with a soft blue glow. Dr Coatyl enters the room holding a clipboard and pen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> Apologies for the delay. I understand you consumed a portion of the… rain, that has been falling for the last few days.</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> Yes! And it has shown me wondrous things.</p>
<p><em>POI-97462 becomes visibly excited as they speak, swaying slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> Please describe for me what you experienced after drinking the fluid.</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> I felt… <em>alive</em>. Like I had been asleep all my life and only now awakened. Aches, pains, all gone, a great lightness in their place.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> I see. Were you aware of any injuries that may have been affected?</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> No- well. I had this scrape from that damned chair I need to get rid of, surprisingly sharp for-</p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> Try to remain focused. What happened to that scrape?</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> It's gone! Like it never happened. All the dead dry skin disappeared.</p>
<p><em>Coatyl adds this to his notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> Interesting. You claimed that it "showed" you things. Elaborate on that, please.</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> Yes, yes. The lightness came first, and it brought great joy. I stood in the rain and let it wash over me, and the lightness became light, a light in all the life around me. I looked into the sky and felt the breath of all that breathes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> …Anything else of note?</p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> In the sky the light became an embodiment of light, of life, of all that is. For one brief moment I was myself in my backyard and the pulse of a thousand forests and an existence older than time, vaster than infinity. The light stretched across all that is, a great dragon of unfathomable size with the light of a million stars pulsing through its being. I have seen it, and it is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> Do you still see this "dragon?"</p>
<p><em>POI-97462 deflates slightly, eyes dropping to the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-97462:</strong> I feel the light fading. I don't want to go back. To feel the weight and pain again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Coatyl:</strong> I understand. If that is all the information you have, then we may conclude this interview.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Following the interview, POI-97462 was amnesticized and, at Dr Coatyl's request, provided with referrals for pain management and therapy.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Commentary from Head Researcher Coatyl:</strong> The euphoric and analgesic effects are scientifically interesting, though evidently short-lived. With the continual application of fluid from the anomalous event, we have not yet seen a "withdrawal" scenario play out. Perhaps further inquiry into the source of the fluid will yield better answers.
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9155.8:</strong> Discoveries on the nature and origin of SCP-9155</p>
<p>On March 20th, 2026, Dr. Coatyl and other members of the Site-101 9155 research team collated data received from other Foundation Sites in the Zone, tracking the disbursement of the fluid matched against atmospheric conditions up to the exosphere. This allowed them to create a simulated model of the precipitation event, reverse-engineering the origin point of the fluid to an estimated position in space somewhere between the orbit of the moon and the neighboring planet of Mars. Drones with arrays tuned to thaumic resonance were dispatched to the predicted zone and tracked the readings to a relatively precise position of 1.3 AU or 194.5 million kilometers from Earth. While the originating point emitted the expected levels of thaumic energy, a much lower reading was detected in an approximate line stretching from either side of this point, as if running between Mars and Earth. Attempts to discover an end point for this line were abandoned after the drones' fuel levels risked becoming too low to complete the return journey.</p>
<p>Stray thaumic energy signals were detected around the Moon, though a follow-up mission with a fresh drone failed to discover any samples of SCP-9155. It is believed that the expulsion path of the fluid may have initially intersected with the Moon's orbital path before reaching the planet's surface. The thaumic radiation on early samples of the fluid has degraded while in containment, which may explain the lack of the fluid itself; with the decay of its thaumic energy, the restorative properties of the fluid may also decay, and thus freeze off or evaporate like ordinary substances exposed to the vacuum of space.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 20: Transcribed Recording</strong><br/>
Date: 21 March 2026<br/>
Objective: Test working hypothesis on thaumic potency of fluid after elapsed time<br/>
Researcher: Junior Researcher Charus Feret, overseen by Dr. Darian Coatyl<br/>
Subject: A 10 mL sample of SCP-9155 collected on 3/17 and a 10 mL sample of SCP-9155 collected on 3/21</p>
<hr/>
<p>00:13 – <em>Each sample is applied to a separate, identical instance of Astroloba tenax<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. Both instances have been left without water or fertilizer for a period of three weeks. The plants are housed in a sealed glass case, with wires and tubes running towards the wall behind the camera.</em></p>
<p>00:19 – <strong>Dr. Coatyl:</strong> The effects should become visible within the next ten minutes. Feret will be here to document these changes; I will be monitoring the soil and air readings in the back room.</p>
<p>00:21 – <em>Coatyl exits.</em></p>
<p>[REMOVED FOR BREVITY]</p>
<p>10:43 – <em>The second plant, given the fresh sample, has straightened and regained some of its natural color. The first plant remains visibly wilted.</em></p>
<p>12:27 – <em>Feret can be seen peering at the first plant, which appears slightly brighter but otherwise sickly. He makes a note and returns to his seat.</em></p>
<p>13:58 – <em>The second plant appears to have returned to full health; its leaves are bright and plump. The first plant remains poor in appearance, only mildly improved from its previous condition.</em></p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Commentary from Head Researcher Coatyl:</strong> The continual application of fresh fluid seems to be what sustains its effects; older samples lose potency, and will eventually become useless. There's a strange feeling of loss as I write that.<br/>
More concerning is the potential for further study of the anomaly to become impossible if the event concludes and we are unable to replicate the fluid.

<p><strong>Addendum 9155.9:</strong> Post-Incident Conclusion Events<br/>
Five days after Incident 9155-D began, the anomalous precipitation ceased. Growth of -1 instances returned to normal rates; however, the overgrowth remained healthy and functioning despite its significant increase in size and coverage. Doctor Coatyl, who was in charge of the response team for the incident, elected not to destroy the majority of floral growth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> Unevacuated residents were amnesticized. Falsified reports on the shipment and unintentional release of an experimental fertilizer were disseminated among local and regional news channels, with national coverage suppressed to brief or no mention of the event.</p>
<p>Several hours after the conclusion of the Incident, three Foundation satellites monitoring deep-space anomalies transmitted identical readings of a sudden wave of thaumic energy in their respective sectors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> Only one satellite was equipped with video recording equipment, which transmitted an additional slow-scan signal along the SPCE network. This signal was converted into video footage upon receipt two days later: the captured images appear to show a serpent-like celestial entity exiting our galaxy. As of the writing of this addendum, four other Foundation satellites have observed similar energy readings. A Junior Researcher attempting to map these readings noticed a pattern in the direction of the waves, visually resembling the meandering of a river. Based on these readings and the (admittedly dubious) testimony of POI-97462, it is currently theorized that this entity is the "Great Dragon" POI-97462 witnessed after consuming a sample of SCP-9155.</p>
<p>All known stores and aggregations of SCP-9155 have been collected by the Foundation for containment and further testing; a means of replicating the fluid has not yet been found. Preliminary data from the latest studies has demonstrated that SCP-9155 has the ability to dissolve and incorporate into itself all soluble materials thus tested except for oils. This is, notably, a property the fluid shares with water and which few other substances possess. The potential implications of these findings are under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary from Head Researcher Coatyl:</strong> I have spent several late nights updating this file. At this moment, a glass of water from one of the Juniors is sitting on my desk. I would like to believe this is a gesture of sympathy. I will not be drinking it.</p>

<h1 id="toc9"><span><strong>A Memo from Darian Coatyl</strong></span></h1>
<p>For those of you reading long after these events, questioning why the garden remains, why the Foundation did not enforce normalcy by flame or sharpened blade, as we have so many times before.</p>
<p>In our line of work, it is easy to develop a certain confidence, perhaps bordering on arrogance, that there is nothing we are unprepared for. We have faced the apocalyptic and the absurd. We have shackled gods – killed gods, even, broken or burned from the collective psyche. We are the Foundation. We have ventured into the dark so that humanity may live in the light, and we have seen all that hides there.</p>
<p>As much as we may strive to believe it – as much as I believed it, one week before – this is simply untrue.</p>
<p>Perhaps even we need a reminder, now and then, that normalcy is a relative condition. We inhabit a strange and wondrous world, and it is rarely predictable forever, even with our capabilities. Today, that reminder came in the form of a celestial dragon urinating on the American South and creating a paradise to rival Eden in its splendor. Perhaps there's something beautiful in that worth preserving.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible, of course, that in your time the garden has been metaphorically stripped. The cover story has been approved for use, but if my superiors or the Council order its destruction, I have no power to oppose them. The extent of my control is laid before you: a record of these five days of absurdity, a record of my own humbling before the winking gaze of chance. Regardless of what the future may bring, this document will be preserved.</p>
<p>As for this "Great Dragon?" If our running theories prove true, I doubt it realizes this little blue dot has been so changed by its brief presence, if such a being even shares our level of sentience. By the time we received our satellites' energy readings, the surge had long since passed; wherever it's going, it's likely too far for us to follow, let alone capture it.</p>
<p>If nothing else, let this be a lesson that even we cannot control everything. And perhaps we shouldn't try to. Perhaps, when your carefully-tended garden permits a single weed to sprout, it may be worthwhile, just this once, to let it be.</p>
<p>It just might bloom into something beautiful.</p>
