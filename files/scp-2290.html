            <h1>SCP-2290</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2290</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An area covering approximately 1 km² around SCP-2290's primary area of effect is to be isolated from unnecessary traffic. If an individual witnesses any anomalous behavior or physical conflicts between SCP-2290-1 instances, they are to be restricted from exiting SCP-2290's area of effect until the 0500 reset event.</p>
<p>Individuals who enter SCP-2290's area of effect on a regular basis and leave before the 0500 reset are not to accumulate knowledge of SCP-2290's existence. Class B amnestics are approved for use in eliminating such knowledge.</p>
<p>Phone calls originating from SCP-2290's residence to emergency services are to be redirected to secure Foundation phone lines. Under no conditions are active Foundation staff to be allowed inside SCP-2290's area of effect between 0300 and 0500 local time. All surveillance of SCP-2290-1 instances during this time period is to be accomplished utilizing local individuals or automated drones.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2290 is an effect which is centered around a home in Stockbridge, Massachusetts that houses a family of three (identified as SCP-2290-1 instances). At 0500 local time, the SCP-2290-1 instances will be immediately relocated to this home regardless of their current location. Additionally, injury to any of the instances will be immediately healed (up to and including death).</p>
<p>Any individual which is inside an area approximately 1 km² around the SCP-2290's primary residence will, at 0500, lose any memory of the SCP-2290-1 instances beyond baseline knowledge. Baseline knowledge of SCP-2290-1 instances include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a family of three living in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.</li>
<li>These individuals are Jonathan Jenkins (SCP-2290-1-A), Sophie Jenkins (SCP-2290-1-B), and Josie Jenkins (SCP-2290-1-C).</li>
<li>These individuals have lived at their current address for 3 years.</li>
<li>SCP-2290-1-A is aged 43 and is employed as a bricklayer at a construction company.</li>
<li>SCP-2290-1-B is aged 36 and is a stay-at-home mother.</li>
<li>SCP-2290-1-C is aged 9 and is a student at a local elementary school.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the anomaly's 15 year containment SCP-2290-1 instances invariably appear to have an age consistent with these details. This is believed to be related to the reset event.</p>
<p>SCP-2290 anomalous properties were first documented during an incident involving Child Protective Services which resulted in the removal of SCP-2290-1-C from the residence. The following morning SCP-2290-1-C was no longer at the protective home in which she had been placed. Child Protective Services removed the child an additional 3 times before a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">UIU agent</a> implanted in CPS brought the situation to the Foundation's attention.</p>
<p>A failure of current containment procedures occurred on November 15th, 2005. Police were contacted by a neighbor with regards to an abusive event originating from SCP-2290-1-A. Police entered the home and SCP-2290-1-C was removed from the premises. The following interview with Foundation staff took place prior to the subsequent reset event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date and Time:</strong> November 5th, 2005 at 19:04</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Melissa Malcolm</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-2290-1-C</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> A previously established Foundation adjunct site outside of SCP-2290's area of effect.</p>
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Transcript:</span></h3>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> Hello, little one. I'm Agent Malcolm.</p>
<p><em>SCP-2290-1-C does not respond. Agent Malcolm produces a stuffed elephant doll and sets it on the table in front of SCP-2290-1-C.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> He can't hurt you here. I promise.</p>
<p><em>SCP-2290-1-C takes the doll and holds it for the remainder of the interview.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> Yes he can.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> Why do you say that?</p>
<p><em>SCP-2290-1-C pauses for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> He doesn't want me to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> I promise you, I'm just here to help.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> Are you going to make me forget?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> I think I wrote myself a note. It said I'll forget what he did when tomorrow comes.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> Josie, what else did the note say?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> It said I get to play with mommy all day before he comes home.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> We're working very hard to get you and your mother out of there Josie.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> The note said you'd forget too.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Malcolm:</strong> I promise that I won't Josie.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2290-1-C:</strong> I don't mind. I wanna forget. I'm just glad that we can both wake up happy.</p>
<p><em>Agent Malcolm concluded the interview at this point. SCP-2290-1-C was given a sedative and slept until the 0500 reset point.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doll given to SCP-2290-1-C by Agent Malcolm disappeared with the instance the following morning. Current surveillance has concluded that the doll is in the possession of the SCP-2290-1-C instance and persists over resets.</p>
