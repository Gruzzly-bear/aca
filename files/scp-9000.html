<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9000 is the collective designation for an extradimensional space and the facility it was built to house — Detention Center Tri-1, a penal complex maintained by the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-9000 is located within the Marianas Archipelago, off the coast of the Maug Islands. The facility was constructed in 1983 in conjunction with the federal government of the United States, under an agreement that it would serve as an extralegal outlet to hold prisoners of both entities.</p>
<p>To artificially construct SCP-9000, hundreds of undersea Pleroma-class subsistence shifting nodes were installed along the seafloor. This extradimensional space resembles the surrounding nautical environment, but remains visually obfuscated to those outside of it. Only watercraft with specialty-built navigation consoles and approved matter signatures are capable of accessing SCP-9000’s extant space.</p>

A census taken on 1994/4/24 recorded 2521 inmates within captivity at SCP-9000, of a maximum capacity of 3000.</p>
<p>While the US government has frequently used SCP-9000 to employ enhanced interrogation tactics and incarceration of its opposition, the prison’s primary purpose is to hold non-anomalous humans within the custody of the SCP Foundation for enrollment in the "D-Class" program.</p>
<p>The Foundation has acquired these captives through a variety of means, predominantly as selective transfers to SCP-9000 from various maximum and supermax security prisons in the United States in exchange for the federal government’s use of the facility.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>

But everyone in this room right now is here because they believed, more than anything else, that the Foundation had a duty that extended far above some career academic's fringe research. That it shouldn’t have to lobby for funding or grovel for permission to do the things only it was capable of doing. Because that little coalition that spun out of the dying days of the Containment Initiative was destined to become an authority, and my God, am I honored to witness it myself.</em></p>
<p><em>I'll put it this way: the Tri Center project embodies the ideals of our Foundation just as much as any white-walled lab or cabinet-filled archive does. But this is an anchor to the world — not a window.</em></p>

<div class="addendumin">
<p>The Foundation has recognized the need to incorporate carceral components into its organizational structure since its establishment. In 1958, the “D-Class” program was launched at select facilities. Using inmates on loan from state prisons within the United States, D-Class performed guided testing that valued personnel were not approved to conduct themselves. Following successful testing, D-Class personnel were promptly amnesticized and returned to their original places of captivity.</p>

<p>On-Site D-Class Personnel holding area, Site-19</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the program was popular, its loose, decentralized nature disallowed organization-wide implementation. As the Foundation continued to grow in both size and global importance throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the amount of requests for D-Class personnel could not be reviewed and approved within an adequate timeframe to meet demand. Though the possibility was floated, the incorporation of D-Class into every facility’s permanent structure — including board and upkeep — was unwieldy, financially unmanageable, and ultimately endangered high-value personnel.</p>
<p>SCP-9000 was conceived by the Department of Internal Affairs as an response to these demands, with the centralization of carceral power being considered a necessary fixture for the Foundation’s future growth. While a reworking of the D-Class initiative has yet to be performed (as of 1994), a structural overhaul of the program is in active development, contingent on SCP-9000 as a source of manpower.</p>
<p>The future of the D-Class initiative is dependent on SCP-9000’s continued operation.</p>

<p>State Correctional Institution - Greene</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Carceral History:</strong> D-1098 was sourced from State Correctional Institution — Greene, in Franklin Township, Pennsylvania. Subject was a noted abettor to street violence in the Kensington/Allegheny area, with ties to prominent 'F.I.8' gang members.</p>
<p>On 1993/2/4, subject was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of involuntary manslaughter, reckless discharge of a firearm, and unlawful possession of a firearm in a vehicle. On 1993/9/29, subject was moved from general population to a segregated, solitary confinement unit after frequent disruptions and multiple violent altercations with other inmates.</p>
<p>Following a 1993 Foundation-run, nation-wide survey of State prison populations for candidates meeting ideal criteria for D-Class personnel (including likelihood of repeat offenses, little to no external familial ties, and social ostracization even among peers), D-1098 was eyed as a potential exchange. On 1994/5/12, D-1098 was approved for transfer to SCP-9000.</p>
<p>Of the 132 remaining prisoners assigned to SCP-9000, D-1098’s account of Incident Totem remains the most comprehensive and cognizant testimonial to date, and has been included alongside relevant documentation for this reason.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Right. Just to clarify, cooperation benefits both of us, D-1098.

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Alright. Take the reins, then.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I don't even— what do you even want to know? You've got files right there.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I want your voice. Start wherever you feel is an appropriate place to start. I understand you spent a rather brief period of time at SCP-9000 compared to others.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Fucking lifetime.</p>
<p><em>Pearson gestures forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Fine. One night I fell asleep in Phoenix, and woke up with a bag on my head. Hands and feet zip-tied to a chair. Back of a truck or something — some vehicle. You want me to skip ahead?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> It's your testimonial.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Yeah, I'll keep you here all night then. So I tried to fight out of it and got something smashed against my nose. Bled so hard I tasted that shit in my mouth. Truck stops, and you threw me on a boat. Still couldn't see but that whole time I knew you had that cold, hard thing still pointed at my face.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> You believe I did these things?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I had a bag on my head. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Continue.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Few hours on the boat, dried blood in my mouth. We get off, and you took me into a building where light was so bright I felt like I was going to puke. You ripped the bag off and I did.</p>
<p>At first, I just assumed I was in a hospital or something. And then I thought I'm in another prison. But I didn't see any cops. Just your guys instead. Masks over their faces, mirrors for the visors so you can always see yourself. Nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> And how did you know they weren't police?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Been processed before, ma'am. None of these guys were screaming in my face or riding my ass the second they saw me. Nah, these guys didn’t say shit.</p>
<p>It was all very on-brand, ma’am, congratulations. All very on-brand. You patted me down. Hosed me off. Gave me that jumpsuit and that name you didn't want to say. I'm booked in maybe 5, 10 minutes — that’s efficient. It’s all efficient. Not a word the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> What was your reaction upon seeing your living conditions?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> The cell? Shit, it was barely a cell. Made the closets in Greene look like condos. Got your commode, your sink, a fucking slab to sleep on. Then your chair anchored to the floor, terminal screen in front of it. That was new.</p>
<p>Now I’m not even ten minutes in that room and my head was already pounding. Then the screen started buzzing. Screaming at me, buzzing. ‘Report’, ‘Report’, ‘Report’. I sat down and I didn’t even know how to use this thing, but you’re all efficient, so you accounted for that. Starts 'report'-ing by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> The orientation, I assume.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> That bastard was the only person I saw that night. You've seen his face, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Warden Aquino, I have.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> He's got a bastard face. Go look at him in the video. Fresh to death in a suit and tie because he’s in love with this shit. You look at those eyes, you know that he loves this shit.</p>

<div class="addendumin">
<p>D-Class personnel stationed within SCP-9000 are considered essential components to the Foundation’s continuity due to their capabilities to contribute to data-entry operations.</p>
<p>While the prison was originally conceived as a purely carceral facility, SCP-9000 has become a testing ground for Warden Aquino’s efforts to revitalize the D-Class program by outsourcing the Foundation’s soft, yet essential labor to its inmates.</p>
<p>At the behest of Aquino, a panel of Foundation Ethics Committee representatives and intraVeil psychologists specializing in prison research have collaborated to develop a system best suited to reward productive behavior within SCP-9000.</p>
<p>The Aquino System is a merit-based model employed within SCP-9000 intended to assign each D-Class personnel to suitable work, deriving potential upward mobility from their performance and competency.</p>
<p>The system is organized into three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review Unit:</strong> D-Class personnel belonging to this group are responsible for clerical oversight of other D-Class personnel and the data they produce. Essential duties include reviewing documents produced by the Data Unit and guiding those personnel in producing work capable of meeting the internal standards and style of the SCP Foundation. Personnel in this class have achieved their status through the merits of their efforts in the data unit, and are entitled to recreational privileges such as yard time, premium meals, and potential advancement within the SCP Foundation itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Unit:</strong> All D-Class personnel within SCP-9000 are entered into this unit following processing. Due to the overwhelming influx of visual data created by the Foundation’s newly-developed surveillance technology, such as body and security cameras, there is a high demand for readable transcriptions to compliment documentation. As such work is often time-consuming for the Foundation’s research arms, the majority of audiovisual transcription has been outsourced to SCP-9000.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Production Unit:</strong> D-Class personnel who are demonstrably incapable of adhering to the Foundation’s standards for document production are moved to the Production Unit. The Production Unit is located within the fourth and fifth levels of SCP-9000, and is centered around the manufacturing of the Foundation’s physical necessities. Select articles of clothing, communications devices, and standard-issue field gear are all manufacturing responsibilities of the production unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Aquino system seeks to remove punitive measures and successfully rehabilitate former prisoners, D-Class within the production unit maintain the opportunity for upward mobility within their respective class. Team lead, production manager, and even participation in external, on-site testing at select facilities are all potential paths a successful member of the production unit can hope to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> How do you feel about the Aquino System?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Smart. I'll give you that. It's smart.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> How so?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> You know how to get people working. What buttons to push. Make them feel like they're a part of something, like this is another chance. We got nothing else, so all that shit work is the only way to prove ourselves. It's smart because it works.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> What elements of the system stood out to you?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> The board.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Right. The leaderboard. You came in at a particularly volume-heavy time for us. The board was considered an effective motivator but—</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> But you were against it though. Is that what you're going to say?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I was, in fact, against its use. I felt that it turned rehabilitation into something competitive.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> But it worked. As soon as I finish that video, that board comes up, and there I was. Number zero. Zero files, zero rank, nothing. And you see everyone just slightly above you, the ones, twos, all that, and you're thinking "I can do better than them. I know I can do better than them." Good way to get shit done.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> You felt it was rewarding?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I felt you were supposed to reward me.</p>
<p><em>Pearson is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> The reports I've read from the Review Unit said that your initial trainings went well. One notes that you, and I quote, “displayed an intrinsic understanding of the cadence and standards of the Foundation’s written language.”</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Never liked English class. Never liked working with my hands either. But if you tell me all I'm allowed to do is sit in front of a screen all day… I just did what I had to do when I had to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> What did you like— academically, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Getting outside.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Fitness?</p>

<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 8 hours and 23 minutes of body-cam footage sourced from Foundation Mobile Task Force Delta-1. Footage depicts the team mobilized at a long-term care home affected by an SCP-████ instance. As a result, residents had become permanently fused to surfaces inside of the building, still maintaining consciousness. Following multiple failed attempts at harmless removal, the remainder of the footage revolves around the task force euthanizing and then forcefully prying the affected residents away from their restricted positions.</p>

<strong>Source:</strong> Abyei, South Sudan<br/>
<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 12 hours of interview footage sourced from Provisional Site-291, where Foundation personnel interview a contingent of child soldiers, aged 6-12, aligned with the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The children recount their experiences with an anomalous, performance-enhancing stimulant provided to them by their commanding officers that had resulted in the complete annihilation of their base camp and the deaths of 43 SPLA soldiers. As a result of the stimulant's abuse, all subjects have developed outbreaks of large, pus-filled boils on their feet and lower legs, originating from the point of injection between the toes. Incident and interviews found irrelevant to Foundation documentation and discarded.</p>

<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 4 hours of edited footage concerning Andrew Mako, New York City resident and senior software manager at AOL, being scolded by SCP-████, which is recording from behind a desk. Over the length of the footage, Mako is repeatedly informed of deaths within his immediate family, including his wife and children.

<p><em>For the consideration of Deputy Director and Warden of SCP-9000, Richard Aquino,</em></p>
<p><em>A recent survey of SCP-9000's extant space, conducted by the Department of Interior, has highlighted several abnormal concern-factors within the structure's occupied area, namely:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A degradation of structural integrity commonly attributed to potentially flawed engineering, namely rebar corrosion, cracking concrete, and sloping floors present on all levels</em></li>
<li><em>An inability to permanently remedy any insufficiency within SCP-9000's construction, regardless of the number of repairs it has undergone</em></li>
<li><em>Ground-penetrating radar scans detecting a swelling abscess of unknown materials pooling beneath the extraphysical 'floor' of SCP-9000</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>These concerns indicate a potential danger to SCP-9000 and personnel stationed within it. A board of Foundation engineering and construction managers have convened to discuss these issues, and determined them to be wholly unrelated to the facility's construction within an extradimensional space.</em></p>
<p><em>As we fear these matters are dependent on the collective environment of SCP-9000 on an extrasensory level, we have attached referrals to several Foundation-verified Gestalt Specialists. They can provide an assessment and proper course-correction model to repair any deficiencies within the immaterial health of your environment.</em></p>
<p><em>Please consider these options,</em><br/>

<strong>Production #:</strong> 1098-902<br/>
<strong>Source:</strong> "Saint of the Sea" Private Cruise Liner<br/>
<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 3 hours of unedited footage recorded in secrecy through unknown means and sold to an animal rights activist group. A host of affluent figures in the finance, law, and political sectors congregate at a social event on a private ocean vessel. A team of staff reveal a large aquarium tank, containing a massive, unknown marine mammal resembling a hirsute, horned whale. The creature is sedated, and the tank is lifted. Over the course of the footage, guests brandish specialty tools to gut and consume small portions of the creature, while staff routinely inject a host of unknown sedatives and stimulants to keep it conscious. Transcript deemed relevant to ongoing case concerning stolen Foundation body camera technology.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> D-1098 repeatedly filed an information request regarding the identities of guests on the boat, believing a group of them situated in the background to be Philadelphian acquaintances he knew prior to his orientation as D-Class Personnel. While the identities were unable to be determined, the Foundation has attributed these reports to pure confusion.</p>

<strong>Production #:</strong> 1098-903<br/>
<strong>Source:</strong> Munich, Bavaria<br/>
<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 15 minutes of unedited footage taken from an unknown warehouse. Olaf Hendl, PoI-████ and active member of "Stolen Nation", an Eastern German neo-facist organized crime outlet, demonstrates the use of a personal anomalous attribute in front of his associates. Five hooded men, visibly nonwhite, are lined in a row. Hendl successively taps each on the forehead. This causes them to gravitate toward one another, and progressively lose control of their muscle groups until they soften entirely. Hendl physically manipulates each man until their bodies have collectively formed a sphere-like structure. Hendl's associates cheer, beat, and lightly burn the victims with lighters and cigarettes throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> D-1098 filed 4 subsequent information requests, claiming to recognize the hooded victims through the sound of their voices and physical builds. Requests similarly dismissed, as Foundation records of the incident do not align with D-1098's claims. D-1098 has been flagged for potential psychiatric inadequacies as a result of increased workload, though an assessment remains to be conducted.</p>

<strong>Production #:</strong> 1098-904<br/>
<strong>Source:</strong> Unknown Acquisition<br/>
<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> A 25 minute amateur recording of scenes from a child's eighth birthday party, presumably filmed by a relative. The child plays with friends and family, opens gifts, and eats a variety of party foods. They are identified in the video as Jason Davis. Zero anomalous significance identified within the recording. Insufficient ties to existing Foundation documentation. Unknown acquisition, origin, and relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> D-1098 refused to transcribe beyond the 3 minute mark. Surveillance footage shows D-1098 repeatedly being unable to stop their terminal's playback of the recording, culminating in them resorting to physical destruction to cease activity. D-1098 fractured their right hand in an attempt to destroy the monitor. Subject was frantic and distressed upon retrieval by armed guards, whom he attempted to assault under the pretense of administrative malfeasance at his expense.</p>
<p>D-1098 was subsequently quartered to SCP-9000's psychiatric wing as Review Unit governance examined the incident.</p>

<div class="interview">
<div class="addendumin">
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Personnel within the Data Unit reported seeing familiar images and faces within their material. No apparent cause… at the time. You had a more intense experience. Jason Davis.</p>
<p><em>D-1098 nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I read the story prior to this interview. About the drive-by.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> It was a tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Say what you're thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I'm not going to lecture you. It was a tragedy. I don't feel the need to project any personal grievances onto the consequences society already decided you should face.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I'm paying for that kid's life with my own.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Is that a motivating factor for you? Reconciliation?</p>
<p><em>D-1098 shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> For what? Kid's dead, it doesn't matter what I do after that. I can bullshit about forgiveness all day, about working on myself and all that other crap. What's that doing for his parents, aunts, uncles, whoever? They gave that kid his last birthday gifts, last meals, last day of school, everything. Didn't even know. Are they supposed to feel better knowing I'm doing better than their dead kid? Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> We determine the weight of our actions. Quite frankly, I don't know how you prioritize yours.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Davis was far from the only person you've deprived of a healthy, full life, D-1098. I've read your sheet. Yet you seem particularly fixated on him.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> He was a kid. I killed a kid. That spray wasn't meant for him, but it doesn't matter. End of the day, I killed him. That's the weight I give it. And he was a happy kid, with family who was there for him. You know how many guys I knew who would have killed for that?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> The Totem Anomaly was deliberately choosing emotionally charged imagery. It happened to others, under different circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> And don't start talking about taking lives like that means shit to someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I've been nothing but amicable towards your circumstances, D-1098. We come from different places, we hold different values. I recognize that</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Do we really? You know what pisses me off about you people?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> It's too easy for you. You want to talk about picking and choosing which weights to carry? What about running camps? How many people died because of this Totem bullshit? You're on my ass for not feeling for every death I've caused, but what about you?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I can assure you, I'm appalled by every death that occurred in this facility. But I'm discussing your morality, not ours.</p>
<p><em>D-1098 is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I'll cite the sheet then, Chambers. Darnell White. Alexander Ome. "Seven-O". Again, do you say a prayer for every murder you and your friends were responsible for, or just the ones you feel bad about?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Those were soldiers. That was war. You know what you sign up for, that's what happens in war. Soldiers die. You don't kill civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Yet here we are.</p>
<p><em>D-1098 abruptly stands up and begins to pace.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Don't you pull those names on me, because you're out here doing the exact same shit. Don't even try to deny it, I've seen more of what you people get up to than you're even allowed to look at. You kill, you move product, you rep your colors everywhere, you take more prisoners than the goddamn feds. So what's the difference?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Sit down, D-1098. I'm not repeating myself.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Tell me what the difference is.</p>
<p><em>Pearson gestures at the guards standing at the door behind her. The two men move forward, each carrying Foundation-branded assault rifles.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 sits down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> We're the bigger gang.</p>

<p><em>No one's coming here without an order from the goddamned Administrator himself. You're all guards. You seeing any structural deficiencies? Marshal, production. Everything's fine down there?</em></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><em>Of course it fucking is. Because they're lying. They want my ass. Records hates the backlog, Ethics hates the system, Logistics hates doing anything at all. So they come in, run fake numbers, start telling fortunes, and all of a sudden we've got invisible problems that need outside interference to solve? It's fucking fake.</em></p>
<p><em>They hate this place because they're not in control. I am. And they hate us because we're not limp-wristed, shit-sucking paper-pushers crunching numbers and deducting hypothesis' or whatever the fuck. There's no fucking respect for anything that takes place outside of a lab with these people. And now that we're the backbone of the organization, now that we're the outreach between the Foundation and the most powerful country in the world, they want to sabotage it. That's all it is.</em></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><em>Think about it this way. There's more of them being admitted to psych because they slipped goddamned memetic agents into the logs. Been saying this for a fucking month now. Internal affairs is looking into it. Don't take the bait.</em></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><em>Listen, if they want to send their thugs here, they have another thing coming. Because I've got thugs too. Hell, I've got me some killers. And they've been juiced up on nothing but blood and guts for years now. I look them in the eyes, and I know they're killers, they're animals, and they're waiting for meat. Tell these sons of bitches that we're fucking ready. And it's not just us. I've got motherfuckers in the fed willing to die on my hill. I'll string every last one of these white-coats from the rooftops.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p>D-1098 has displayed swift recovery since admission, but with a noted decrease in measurable productivity. Case similar to other recently admitted D-Class Personnel, with reactions sourced to stress and nervousness-induced breakdowns. The presence of anomalous footage within the facility's archives deliberately attempting to trigger these reactions in personnel is presently under investigation by SCP-9000's Internal Affairs detachment.</p>
<p>D-1098's competency and fitness for Data Unit work has been retested. Patient has displayed significantly lower output times and inadequacies in mechanical and linguistic composition. A loss of their previous position on the Data Unit Leaderboard has been a significant concern for D-1098. This, coupled with stress-related factors triggered by viewing emotionally resonant footage, are the most likely reasons for D-1098's current deficiencies.</p>
<p>D-1098 has consistently refused amnestic treatment. Regular dosages of 0.25 mg alprazolam have been approved for patient use.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Your output slowed significantly after your hospitalization.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Yeah, I was hospitalized.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Even after recovery, you weren't putting up the same numbers you were before. Review Unit wrote that you got sloppy.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Felt pointless after that. You're out for a week, even, and you fall back to the bottom of the leaderboard. Why try?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> This was around the period when there was a major increase in anomalous activity within SCP-9000 due to the Totem Anomaly. Did you notice anything after your initial hospitalization?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I don't know. At that point I just watched and wrote. Things here and there. Voices, places, sometimes other stuff, but I just ignored it. Stopped calling for your attention when you ignored it all.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Did the anomaly continue using imagery related to Davis?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Little things. Kid in the corner of a frame. Someone's last name. My car in the background. Just ignored it. It's easy to ignore a screen if you try.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Were you concerned about the Totem Anomaly? Being so familiar with the mishaps and dangers of working with the anomalous, did it occur to you that you might be the subject of a gruesome transcript they'll have to write about in the future?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I knew something was going down. And I knew it was going to get worse. But I didn't care. Long as it took the whole place down with it.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Why do you call it a totem?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> That's what it was. Something emblematic of a group of people. In this case, a swirling, pulsating mass of raw consciousness given form by the facility and those within it. What you were all thinking, feeling, and exposing yourself to daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Fucking horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> You would expect otherwise?</p>

<p><span class="title sub">Compiled by SCP-9000's Internal Affairs Offices, for the consideration of Warden Aquino</span></p>
</div>
<p><em>The following is a list of miscellaneous anomalous phenomena observed within SCP-9000 over the past quarter.</em></p>


<div class="list">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title sub">November 1994</span></p>
<ul>
<li>54 counts of D-Class personnel admissions to SCP-9000's psychiatric wing, originating primarily from the Data Unit. Reports of nervous breaks, cognitive stagnation, and audiovisual hallucinations during transcription production.</li>
<li>17 counts of audiovisual footage without apparent origin or inter-organizational source. Analysis has observed minor personal connections between content of the relevant footage and the Data Unit personnel viewing it.</li>
<li>102 counts of minor-to-major injuries within the Production Unit floor, primarily resulting from repeated machine malfunction. Repairs invariably unsuccessful.</li>
<li>Reports of cell interior viewing terminals malfunctioning, resulting in constant playback of footage. Terminals will automatically boot themselves to resume playback if manually deactivated.</li>
<li>Reports of auditory hallucinations from all layers of SCP-9000, namely the sound of heavy breathing from walls, floors, and ceilings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="list">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title sub">December 1994</span></p>
<ul>
<li>103 counts of D-Class personnel admissions to SCP-9000's psychiatric wing. Symptoms consistent with August.</li>
<li>80 counts of audiovisual footage without apparent origin or inter-organizational source. Nature consistent with August.</li>
<li>Severe increase in industrial emissions emerging from the Production Unit floor. Working conditions heavily impacted by visual haze, foul odor, and respiratory impact. Chemical analysis of pollutants found consistent with those produced by burning bodies.</li>
<li>Plumbing systems impacted by large clusters of epithelial tissue.</li>
<li>An outbreak of paralysis within Data Unit, primarily affecting personnel with low productivity rankings. Personnel were rendered wholly unable to communicate or move. Termination orders under review.</li>
<li>A cluster of 25 D-Class personnel within the Production Unit fusing together during their shift. A connective, web-like membrane had developed along their hindfeet and through their shoes while standing adjacent to one another in a production line. Separation resulted in severe injury.</li>
<li>The manifestation of linked chains and height-adjacent hooking fixtures within the cells of 82 Data Unit personnel. 37 personnel lost.</li>
<li>Numerous counts of audiovisual footage depicting a live feed of the transcribing personnel's cell. Depictions consistent with reality, save for the presence of pooling interstitial fluids and viscera emerging from an unknown source.</li>
<li>An inability to control SCP-9000's lighting fixtures. Inter-cell lighting is now powered at full intensity at all times.</li>
<li>Personnel attempting to stage outer-organizational intervention without the knowledge of Warden Aquino and SCP-9000's Internal Affairs offices were executed via free-fall drop from SCP-9000's highest point. Their bodies repeatedly dropped and landed for over 8 hours, severely damaging the corpses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="list">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title sub">January 1995</span></p>
<ul>
<li>304 counts of D-Class personnel admissions to SCP-9000's psychiatric wing. Symptoms consistent with previous months.</li>
<li>242 counts of audiovisual footage without apparent origin or inter-organizational source. Nature consistent with previous months.</li>
<li>Access to SCP-9000 has been impacted. All ingress and egress to the structure is considered impossible.</li>
<li>Occupied cells within the Review and Data Unit layers have similarly been impacted. Personnel of any rank are unable to open doors. 28 deaths have occurred due to an inability to deliver food or medication.</li>
<li>Total pollution of SCP-9000's plumbing systems. Large traces of fecal matter, blood, chemical discharge, and sewage found in water filtered through toilets, showers, and faucets.</li>
<li>Non-anomalous suicides of personnel and guards resulting in the resurrection of their bodies while maintaining any self-inflicted injuries. Personnel were euthanized when accessible.</li>
<li>3 counts of cell interiors becoming compressed to a .09m layer, forming a flat surface consisting of ceiling, utilities, personnel, and floor.</li>
<li>Data Unit personnel who have maintained productivity have seen an impossible increase in output. High-ranking personnel have been observed to produce up to 58 completed transcripts per day.</li>
<li>Thousands of submissions of Data Unit work originating from terminated D-Class employee terminals, resulting in abnormally high output. Work found acceptable and incorporated within Foundation documentation.</li>
<li>Warden Aquino has been observed to disappear for prolonged periods of time, up to multiple days. Internal Affairs investigation has documented several inexplicable visits to SCP-9000's production level.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title sub">February 1995</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The disappearance of SCP-9000's psychiatric wing.</li>
<li>All audiovisual footage remaining within SCP-9000's backlog has been determined to be of anomalous origin.</li>
<li>The presence of a sixth layer within radar readouts of SCP-9000's internal structure. Attempts to access this level have resulted in personnel loss and failure.</li>
<li>The spontaneous growth of tumorous masses of human tissue and fluids within SCP-9000's Production Unit Floor. D-Class personnel invariably claim to recognize the tissue, attributing it to personnel connections from their pre-Foundation life.</li>
<li>All cells within SCP-9000, including those that were previously locked under anomalous conditions, have been opened.</li>
<li>A resultant outbreak of mass violence occurred until guard personnel were able to regain control of SCP-9000's D-Class population through the use of ultrasonic weaponry and chemical safeguards built into SCP-9000's internal structure. An estimated 450 D-Class personnel remain, and have been relocated to their cells.</li>
<li>The disappearance of Warden Aquino. Search ongoing.</li>
<li>The manifestation of SCP-9000-B.</li>

<strong>Transcript Brief:</strong> 36 hours of unedited audio of a supposed interview between unidentified Foundation personnel and D-1098's mother, Marcia Chambers, who relates numerous minute, desultory anecdotes concerning D-1098's life. Over the course of the interview, she repeatedly chastises and berates D-1098, citing her own failures as a parent as rationale for his behavior. The final four hours of audio sees Chambers repeatedly shown street camera footage of the drive-by shooting that resulted in the death of Jason Davis.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Why didn't you engage with the rioters? You also held resentment towards the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> They were going to be put down. And they were. I don't care how many of us there were, they had the guns, the gases, the armor. Like you said, the bigger gang. I just wanted to keep watching.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> You were engaged by the anomalous footage?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Sure. That was my window. Everything sick, disgusting, and bloody was behind that screen. And when it got personal, it was talking to me. Hear my mom, see that kid, I could watch it all, as much as I wanted.</p>

<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I saw it down there.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Did you understand?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> No. I just knew it had more authority than all of you combined. You said it was our thoughts that made it, our totem. But you guys were there every day too. You contributed.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Certainly. These unconscious materials are unitary. We call them egregores. And they make no distinction between what forms them. Every agonizing night spent at your terminal, every pent up moment of rage or frustration, every one of those inexplicable incidents happening around the facility, they all inadvertently brought that thing into the world. It's something that's been known to happen in areas with high concentrations of emotional mass, especially those that overlap with the anomalous. We're not proud of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title">SCP-9000-B</span></p>
<p>SCP-9000-B is an egregore presently manifested beneath SCP-9000's fifth level. Attempts at direct observation have been met with failure. Until access to SCP-9000 from baseline reality can be restored and specialized research can be conducted, information regarding SCP-9000-B is limited to the research conducted by the remaining members of SCP-9000's Internal Affairs team.</p>
<p>SCP-9000-B's origin is speculated to be directly linked to the collective consciousness of those within SCP-9000. The entity's ability to interface with SCP-9000's audiovisual terminals has been attributed to the prison's use of natural and anomalous bioenergy as its primary source of power. As SCP-9000 resides within an extradimensional space, the use of a traditional electric grid was deemed impossible. Large amounts of extremities and tissue belonging to SCP-9000-B have been found fused to the prison's cabling and associated devices, allowing for the manipulation of existing footage, and the creation of new footage. Further attributes have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>SCP-9000-B continues to grow, and is expected to penetrate SCP-9000's fifth level within the month.<br/>

<p>The following transcript was sourced from SCP-9000's Review Unit database following the resolution of Incident Totem. Production was sourced to D-1098's terminal, despite the impossibility of this occurring. The footage has otherwise been determined to occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="addendumin">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<p><em>D-1098 is escorted from his cell by a single guard wearing heavily damaged and incomplete Foundation-issue armor. SCP-9000 is in a state of disrepair. Many cells are empty, while bodies of guards and prisoners alike litter the floors, halls, and ceilings of the prison. Remaining D-Class personnel shout at the two from their cells as they move through the facility's second layer containment blocks.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 is brought to an elevator. The guard motions him forward. D-1098 stares. The guard walks off, leaving him.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 enters the elevator, and is brought to SCP-9000's Production Unit ground floor. The body of D-1633 is slumped in the corner of the elevator. D-1098 fails to notice.</em></p>
<p><em>The lift opens, and a miasma of industrial residue enters the space.</em></p>
<p><em>The Production Unit floor is in disarray. The large machinery previously used to produce the Foundation's self-made equipment has ceased activity. As D-1098 moves forward, corpses of D-Class personnel line the machinery, stuck within interstices on the constructs themselves or strung from their external fixtures. Most have been mutilated via industrial means.</em></p>
<p><em>D-319, a Production Unit foreman, moves the corpse of D-291. Her body has been damaged beyond recognition at the limbs, save for the intact number on her jumpsuit. D-319 throws the body onto a pile of D-Class corpses.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Sent me to production.</p>
<p><em>D-319 wipes his hands on his jumpsuit, and pours a nearby container of gasoline on the corpses.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Sent me to production, sir.</p>
<p><em>D-319 tosses the container and fumbles within his jumpsuit pocket. Producing nothing, he collapses in the corner, next to the pile of corpses. D-319 places his head within his hands, and begins to sob.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 moves forward.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 moves through the Production Floor for one hour and fifteen minutes in total silence. The scenery remains consistent. Analysis of Production Layer floor plans indicate that SCP-9000-B had significantly expanded the floor plan of this layer. Machines, bodies, and architectural fixtures repeat, restructure, and realign themselves throughout the exploration.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 comes to an expansive area. The machinery has been altered beyond function, with sections appearing in illogical configurations and orientations. It expands from the floor to the ceiling, twisting and contorting in vine-like patterns. The smog is heavier than in previous areas. D-1098 struggles to move forward, but pushes himself towards a source of light, emerging from the center of the region.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 comes to a gaping hole at the area's center, situated between the machinery. Its depth extends far beyond the Production Unit's floor, and is filled with a luminescent, red liquid. At the hole's center is SCP-9000-B. The egregore, gigantic in its size, extends from the bottom of the hole and through the Production Unit's ceiling. Later investigation would reveal that SCP-9000-B penetrated the first layer of SCP-9000, breaching the prison's highest point.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9000-B constantly pulsates, writhes, excretes, and screams.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 does not look.</em></p>
<p><em>His words are unintelligible over the sounds of SCP-9000-B's bleating.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 sobs, falling to his knees.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9000-B extends a mass of small, connective tissue towards D-1098. He does not look.</em></p>
<p><em>The mass takes shape, forming the face of Jason Davis, a Philadelphia resident, aged 8. Various secretions from SCP-9000-B's 'mouth' cover D-1098.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 lifts his head, eyes bloodshot from the tears and fluids staining his pupils.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1098 attempts to form words, but quickly loses consciousness.</em></p>

<div class="addendumin">
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Quite frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive. There are a number of accounts of personnel approaching the Totem in the same fashion you did, but they're not here to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Probably knew that'd be too easy. That thing was spiteful. It was hatred. Kind of shit that makes you throw someone in a hole for the rest of their life and call it rehab. It liked the agony.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Do you sincerely feel that we enjoy your agony? Losing thousands of human lives, an entire facility; I know you have valid concerns, but all of this was done in service of giving you purpose in a society that rejected you. The work you've done here has contributed more to the Foundation's ability to protect the world than you realize.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> If you can't see how fucked up this whole thing is at this point, you're nuts. Fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I'm well aware of the incongruities and inconsistencies. We're still working through this system. In due time, we'll find a solution that works for everyone. I truly believe that.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I don't want a part in it.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> And I hope that can be an option. If you prefer to rot in a state institution for the rest of your miserable life, I genuinely hope we can provide the ability to do so. My sympathies are reserved for those willing to work with us, not in spite of us. Rehabilitation is not cheap, and our ship can't afford to carry parasites.</p>

<div class="addendumin">
<p>On 1995/3/3, A collective of Task Force Specialists and Extradimensional Physicists successfully penetrated SCP-9000's external barrier through the use of planar-boring drills and a reboot of SCP-9000's central nodes.</p>
<p>The structure was besieged by a group of 12 Mobile Task Forces and 3 aerial contingents, who successfully subjugated SCP-9000 and regained control of the structure within 24 hours. SCP-9000-B, alongside much of SCP-9000's internal structure, was destroyed via aerial bombardment.</p>
<p>Subsequent rescue yielded 108 surviving personnel, including 43 D-Class.</p>
<p>An investigation and assessment of SCP-9000, its personnel, and the events that led to Incident Totem are presently underway. As the Department of Internal Affairs is claiming systemic abuses on the behalf of SCP-9000's stationed staff, an Ethics Committee board has been convened.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Have you completed your testimonial?</p>

<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> I wanted to ask, I've seen your medical records from after the recovery mission. You talked about implanted memories.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> They said it's fine.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Oh, I believe that. It's residual. Barely living psychic tissue that's managed to slip past your body's internal systems, clinging onto whatever it can.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> What does it make you think about?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Whatever that thing felt. I don't fucking know.</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> It was distilled suffering. Does carrying that around really not bother you?</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> I can't tell. Bleeds together with everything else. I have to focus on it to feel it. Like I said, it's not my world. You can separate all this shit. There's reality, and then there's whatever happens in here.</p>

<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Who gets out?</p>

<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> What about all that shit about advocacy? Making things better? What about sending us back, I don't know, as a reward or something?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> It's a possibility. I'll be taking a lot from our conversations today.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Just get rid of the parasites or whatever you said. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> As I said, it's a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>D-1098:</strong> Has anyone ever made it out of the program?</p>
<p><strong>Pearson:</strong> Mr. Chambers, none of us make it out. That is the unfortunate reality of a life dedicated to service. But keep your head up, maybe you can be the first.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="title sub">INTERNAL MEMO: 1996/10/2</span></p>

<p>Following the investigation of SCP-9000 and Incident Totem, efforts were made to remedy the SCP Foundation's D-Class system from a structural standpoint.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Ethics Committee and the Department of Internal Affairs have repeatedly convened and established several key overhauls to the existing program.</p>
<p>These are the most significant, organization-wide changes, all of which are actively in the process of implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reinstatement of the D-Class program at Foundation facilities worldwide with adequate infrastructure to support the long-term internment of a small population of 15 to 35 D-Class personnel per major site.</li>
<li>Increased encouragement to use D-Class personnel in object testing and research in order to foster a sense of community and belonging.</li>
<li>Increased recreational time for D-Class personnel within approved D-Class Recreational Zones, located within each site's internment region.</li>
<li>Sufficient resources for D-Class use in transcription production, including mandatory amnestics treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Department of Internal Affairs and the Ethics Committee have hand-selected an administrative body to oversee all Tri-class Detention Centers, and attempt to mitigate previous managerial oversights.</p>
<p>SCP-9000 has been restored to an operational state.</p>
