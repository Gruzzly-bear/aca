            <h1>SCP-3523</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3523</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The house containing SCP-3523 is under Foundation ownership. Due to its distant proximity from other buildings and major roadways, it is to be kept in its current state indefinitely. A 1-kilometer exclusion zone is to be maintained around the property. Entrance into the house is forbidden.</p>
<p>To limit SCP-3523's continued growth, excess flesh is to be trimmed bi-monthly and shipped to Site-39 for analysis and incineration.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3523 is a biological entity of unknown composition occupying a house in rural Warren, New Jersey, USA. Its body currently fills both the basement and first floor of the house, with multiple appendages and tumorous growths extending into the second floor and back yard. Ground scans also reveal a large mass of tissue extending deeper past the basement into a small recess in the earth.</p>
<p>Scans and monitoring show the existence of organs and external structures, however, SCP-3523 does not conform anatomically to any known organism. Its dermis possesses a slightly pink hue and a flesh-like consistency. Multiple bulges and lesions are visible along the first- and second-floor sections, with two notable protrusions near the back side of the house which have breached the exterior walls and now extend into the back yard. These protrusions possess growths similar in structure and appearance to human sensory organs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A large umbilical cord extends around the entire first floor.</p>
<p>SCP-3523 does not appear to be sentient or sapient and does not display any need for sustenance. Occasionally, however, parts of SCP-3523 can be observed to twitch. DNA testing is inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The home in which SCP-3523 resides belonged to the McCall family for thirty-two years before it was abandoned in mid 2016. Foundation ownership of the property began two years later, during which SCP-3523 continued to grow without cessation. According to tax records, five people lived in the house at the time: Jim McCall, Lydia McCall, Benjamin McCall, and Sarah Nielsen. In early 2019, Foundation assets tracked down two of the five supposed residents of the house in 2016, Sarah Nielsen (previously McCall) and Benjamin McCall.</p>
<p>According to Benjamin McCall, the entity known as SCP-3523 came to the family's attention in mid-January of 2014, when muffled cracks and other noises were heard emanating from the basement. Upon inspection, a small crack had appeared along the floor, and a small amount of biological tissue was found within it. A small amount of yellow-tinted fluid was found leaking from the hole. Believing the crack to be a benign architectural issue caused by extremely low temperatures that winter, the family planned to have the crack fixed by a contractor.</p>
<p>As the month continued, the crack continued to expand, eventually overtaking the entire room it was found in. According to McCall, the flesh had covered the entire floor of the room by the end of the month. At this point, the family decided to move out, and, by the end of June, had found another home in New Jersey. During this time, SCP-3523 grew to occupy the entire basement level and began emerging through the ground floor and up the basement stairs. Lydia McCall (mother of Sarah and Benjamin) experienced a mental breakdown around this time.</p>
<p>In late August, a portion of the ground floor cracked as a portion of SCP-3523 breached into the main level. SCP-3523 also grew into the walls of the house, expanding through the insulation and behind the drywall. SCP-3523 reportedly breached the drywall in multiple places as it continued to spread onto the ground floor. The family evacuated in late August as the house entered an unlivable state.</p>
<p>The testimony of Sarah Nielsen lines up with McCall's from June onwards. However, Nielsen's testimony differs in two places, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviews with Nielsen suggest that SCP-3523 had existed since May of the previous year;</li>
<li>The family did not ever call a contractor to fix the crack in the basement floor when it initially occurred. Instead, Jim McCall (father of Sarah and Benjamin) elected to attempt to burn the fleshy protrusion and fill the crack with concrete. This never occurred, and, according to Nielsen, Jim McCall instead attempted to board the room shut and cover the door with new drywall. The reasoning behind this is unclear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, Nielsen attests that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plumbing system malfunctioned sometime in the middle of February and was not ever fixed;</li>
<li>The family would have moved out earlier, however, because Lydia McCall (mother) was still recovering from intense morning sickness, the family elected to move later;</li>
<li>The McCalls refused to call the police during the entire incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, according to interviews with Benjamin McCall, Sarah and himself are the only two children of the McCall parents.</p>
