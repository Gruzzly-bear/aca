<p>SCP-2236</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2236</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2236 is to be stored in its pouch (pictured) when not in use. The pouch containing SCP-2236 is to be stored in an airtight humidity-controlled and temperature-controlled case. To prevent security breaches, use of SCP-2236 must be approved by the administrator of Site 32.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Under no circumstances is SCP-2236 to be brought into the presence of any internal Foundation memoranda or documents, including its own containment records.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2236 is a cylindrical optical instrument which superficially resembles an early-model pocket microscope. The instrument is 11.6 cm in length, 1.9 cm in diameter, and has a planoconvex lens at each end with very slight convexity. One end is equipped with an eyepiece; the other end is flanged at an angle. The lenses and the body of the instrument enclose an airtight chamber between the lenses. This chamber is filled with a faintly phosphorescent gas which has not been analyzed.</p>
<p>When a written document is observed through SCP-2236, the content of the text that is examined appears different to the observer. See testing log.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Log:</strong></p>
<p>Please record all test results using the format below:<br/>
<strong>Researcher | Date of test:</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Text:</strong> Standard sheet of A4 writing paper with the text "This is a test" handwritten by Dr. Garcia. Dr. Garcia was not aware of SCP-2236 and was not involved in testing it apart from providing this sample to Dr. Patel without being informed of the purpose of the request.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Text appeared as "Piss off" in Dr. Garcia's handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Page 83 of "The Spectacular Spignetti", a popular romance novel about circus acrobats that was found in the Site 32 break room.<br/>

<strong>Result:</strong> Pages are blank</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> "Time Cube" essay by Gene Ray<br/>
