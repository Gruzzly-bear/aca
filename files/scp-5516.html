<p>SCP-5516-37 in containment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All 101 entities composing SCP-5516 are to be contained within Aquatic Enclosure L-23 at <a href="/secure-facility-dossier-site-184">Site-184</a>'s Aquatic Anomalies Wing. Aquatic Enclosure L-23 constitutes one 10 x 10 x 1m, aquarium holding ± 90,000L of seawater. SCP-5516 poses a Null-1 containment risk; as such, the use of localized seawater for the containment habitat — provided Site-184's seawater decontamination facilities continue to pass bi-monthly inspections<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> — and standard Aquatic Enclosure automated cleaning practices are approved.</p>
<p>SCP-5516 entities are fed via automated food dispersal at 08:00 and 19:00.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> All SCP-5516 entities are assigned designation numbers: SCP-5516-1 - SCP-5516-101. Designation numbers are to be marked on the carapace of SCP-5516 entities using FLaN-Aquatic Paints.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Emergent SCP-5516 entities are assigned the designation number of the recently deceased SCP-5516 entity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Deceased SCP-5516 entities possess no anomalous threat and are approved for incineration alongside Site-184's non-anomalous biological waste.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5516 is the collective designation for 101 SCP-5516 entities. SCP-5516 entities are visually identical to non-anomalous <em>Homarus Americanus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> but demonstrate a variety of anomalous behaviours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly higher cognitive aptitude and puzzle-solving ability compared to non-anomalous <em>Homarus Americanus</em>.</li>
<li>Communal hunting, and food rationing and distribution practices.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Simultaneous 'idle' state: When not hunting or feeding, SCP-5516 entities distribute themselves evenly across their enclosure and demonstrate simultaneous self-grooming behaviour.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></li>
<li>Ability to navigate to other SCP-5516 entities: When removed from their enclosure, SCP-5516 entities will return to other SCP-5516 groupings, displaying a 95% success rate while unobstructed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Collective, non-entity-dependent problem solving: Individual SCP-5516 entities are capable of solving memory puzzles presented to other SCP-5516 entities. SCP-5516 entities have utilized this ability to bypass simplified rotary numeric locks and meet kinetic-based food distribution systems in testing environments.</li>
<li>Limited Self-Proliferation: Following the death of an individual SCP-5516 entity, 6-18 hours later, a separate SCP-5516 entity undergoes a molting process that produces two distinct SCP-5516 entities of roughly equal size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the aforementioned behaviour, it is theorized that individual SCP-5516 entities are controlled by a singular group-consciousness.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> On 04/21/1987, all SCP-5516 entities<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> were recovered by <a href="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-14">Mobile Task Force Lambda-14</a> ("One Star Reviewers") while conducting a raid of "Allan's Seafood," formerly located in Liscomb, Nova Scotia, due to a suspected affiliation with <a href="/ambrose-restaurant-hub">GOI-116: Ambrose Restaurants</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Experiment Ceta-88C</strong> On 05/11/1996, Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED] oversaw the testing of Oros-Class Amnestic on SCP-5516-17, under R&amp;D initiative: Waning Moon - Ceta.</p>
<p>At the time of testing, the development of Oros-Class Amnestic was ongoing; the Ethics Committee issued approval for testing on █████████████ invertebrates. Following the events of 05/08/1996, Dr. Oswald Grisdale, alongside Dr. Sylvia Morrison, and Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED], administered Oros-Class Amnestic to SCP-5516-17.</p>
<p>Following testing, SCP-5516-17 entered a catatonic state for 2 hours before resuming typical behaviour. 10 hours after testing, SCP-5516-82 molted, producing two SCP-5516 entities: SCP-5516-82 and SCP-5516-101.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Collaert:</strong> Hello, Dr. Werner. I heard you wanted to speak to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Werner:</strong> Yes, please have a seat. This is about your work with SCP-5516.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Collaert:</strong> And the request for access to a higher clearance? Thank you, Sir. I'm trying to revise the entry, but without knowing what happened—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Werner:</strong> I'm afraid that won't be possible.</p>

<p>Jenny,</p>
<p>They just took me off SCP-5516.</p>
<p>I'm a little shocked. I got a folder with a new assignment—something to do with anomalous plankton blooms off the coast of Newfoundland. It's a six-month placement, like, on a boat.</p>

<p>What the fuck? That makes no sense, Sarah.</p>
<p>You spent four years with your face pressed against the glass of various lobster tanks for that degree and they're sending you to look at plankton? Christ, I know it's the Foundation, but I'm pretty sure you've introduced me to everyone in the lobster behavioural analysis scene in this hemisphere and I don't exactly think any of them will be taking on the job (plus they've got nothing on you anyway).</p>
<p>I've got to run, but we'll chat about this later, okay? Maybe it's a mix-up?</p>
<p>I'll do dinner, and don't worry, no shellfish!</p>
<p>It's going to be okay.</p>
<p>Love you,<br/>

<p>The following is a digitization of Dr. Collaert's journal entry, dated 25/08/2020. Dr. Collaert willingly surrendered these documents during ECI-11A82N.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>August, 15<sup>th</sup></em></p>
<p>I walked down to the beach tonight, I'm not sure why. I suppose I don't need to say goodbye yet - certainly not to the ocean.</p>
<p>I didn't notice at the time, but something weird has been happening the last few months.</p>
<p>It's the lobsters. I'm not sure how to explain it, I suppose I told myself I was just in touch with them. I was spending so much time staring into that tank; why would I question it when I knew a particular lobster was hungry? Sure, I couldn't wait to get back to work, to them - but why wouldn't I? I was doing important work, breaking ground in my field, even if no one outside the Foundation would ever read what I was writing. I was doing it for myself, after all.</p>
<p>Now I'm not so sure. I stood in the water, took my shoes off and everything, and I swear, I <em>could feel</em> the water around me, all of me, like a pressure. I don't remember undressing, but the next thing I knew I was laying in the water, resting my head where the sand ended.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, and a wave covered me, I let my mouth open and I drank it in. I don't really know what happened next. The memories, they don't feel like mine, they don't fit. I was trapped -surrounded by glass and acrylic, or wood and rope, or both.</p>
<p>I don't know if my brain couldn't handle it, or if I was drowning, but I was yanked back to myself. I pushed myself up out of the water, coughing the saltwater up.</p>
<p>Jenny was worried when I came back, she said I had been gone for a while - longer than I thought. I told her it was because I'd be leaving soon.</p>
<p>I hate myself for lying to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>August, 22<sup>nd</sup></em><br/>
<br/>
God, I hate packing. Somehow it always takes way longer than it should—as long as you have, it seems.</p>
<p>I don't want to go tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jenny's getting the last few things together. I know she doesn't want me to go either, but she's putting on a brave face: "it's only six months," "you'll come back with some sailor tattoos and a pet puffin and we'll take a drive down to Lunenburg — get your land-legs back." I don't deserve her.</p>
<p>I signed up with the Foundation — we both did — because it was a chance for us to see more, to know more; I suppose it's fitting that the first question I asked was the wrong one.</p>
<p>I suppose we'll still both be looking at the same moon, and the same ocean. Her, here on the porch, me</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">on the deck</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">looking out for signs of bioluminescent</span></p>
<p>puking over a railing.</p>
<p>There's something shining…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Collaert's journal continues on the next page, the writing appears to be scribbled hastily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>Okay, calm down, they covered this stuff in orientation, right? Write it down, yeah?</p>
<p>Wait, what if it's memetic? Shit, okay.</p>
<p>I'm going to write it down - I feel like I’m already losing it, like it's slipping past me.</p>
<p>There was a shine? From the moon, or the reflection of the moon on the water, like moonlight on water. Something ivory, moving, but not there - flickering.</p>
<p>I remember walking to it, or into it. It was cold, and I could feel them moving.</p>
<p>As the water passed my eyes, I opened them, but they weren't my eyes anymore. I wouldn’t be able to see like that. My head hurts trying to think about it.</p>
<p>I was alone this time, I remember being alone. I couldn't move. I felt the needle slide in, and I saw them: Dr. Werner and two others. Then I was undone. I came apart, I couldn't think anymore, they had taken that from me, or killed it. They had killed me, but I wasn't dead, the blood was still pumping, I was still moving. Yet, I was <em>annihilated</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>August, 23<sup>rd</sup></em></p>
<p>If it wasn't for what I wrote, I never would have known it happened, I've already forgotten. The weird part is I don't even <em>feel</em> like I forgot, nothing seems missing.</p>
<p>What else am I missing?</p>
<p>I know things without knowing why I know them. I don't remember what happened, but I know that the Oros-Class Amnestic kills the consciousness, I know they were panicked as they did it, but not because of the tests; I know they tested it on SCP-5516 when they weren't supposed to, I know that it made SCP-5516-101, they made SCP-5516-101; there were only 100 to start.</p>
<p>They thought they all shared a single mind, one that existed independent of the body, but that must not have been quite right - they weren't paying attention. I can't say I'd blame them; I don't know why they would have looked so close. The test worked, but not in the way they hoped. Whatever Oros-Class is, it didn't affect the hivemind, but it did affect the lobster, made it forgot itself. Then the hivemind registered one lobster down and popped out another - back to 100 - but the body was still around, so when that died, it popped out another. It found a new normal, and its kept that going all these years.</p>
<p>We though it was capped at 100, or 101, but why did we think that - because they are nice, sensical numbers and we like those? I know there are many more SCP-5516 entities out there - shifting in an inky blackness - but how many?</p>
<p>And I still don't know why they took the risk — what were they scared of? "The Ethics Committee issued approval for testing on [space left blank] invertebrates," non-anomalous - it must be.</p>
<p>They must have thought no one would remember, but something did.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERNAL REPORT FORM:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>COMPLAINT LEVELED AGAINST:</strong> Dr. Gregory Werner, Head Researcher for Site-184's Aquatic Anomalies Wing.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTEE:</strong> Dr. Sarah Collaert, Junior Researcher.</p>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 23/08/2020</p>
<p><strong>SITE (IF APPLICABLE):</strong> 184</p>
<p><strong>NATURE OF COMPLAINT:</strong> Dr. Collaert alleges that during the development of Oros-Class Amnestic — conducted as part of the Foundation's Research &amp; Development initiative: Waning Moon - Ceta, Dr. Gregory Wener, along with two accomplices, conducted experimentations on live, anomalous SCP-5516 entities. Additionally, Collaert alleges that Dr. Gregory Werner has been instrumental in the obfuscation of this breach of protocol; in doing so, Dr. Gregory Werner is furthermore accused of misallocating Foundation resources and personnel, falsifying Foundation records, and intentionally disrupting the Foundation's mandate by preventing accurate record keeping.</p>
<p><strong>VALIDITY OF COMPLAINT:</strong> An initial review board, after listening to the testimony of Dr. Sarah Collaert, has found the allegations leveled against Dr. Gregory Werner credible, and opened an official investigation: EIC-11A28N.</p>
<p><strong>ETHICS COMMITTEE RESPONSE:</strong> Following the opening of ECI-11A28N, Dr. Gregory Werner has been relieved of duty and placed under house arrest. <a href="/secrat-testing">Ethics Committee Investigation Task Force</a>: ECITF-Domum-3 ("Human Resources"), is responsible for the gathering of evidence related to ECI-11A28N and has received authority to detain and interrogate the associates of Dr. Gregory Werner: Dr. Oswald Grisdale and Dr. Sylvia Morrison.</p>
<p>Following the submission of evidence by ECITF-Domum-3 to the Ethics Committee, Dr. Gregory Werner shall be tried by an adjudicative board, as per bylaw EC-10.7.12</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Amd-1: As of 17/03/2007, Site-184's seawater decontamination facilities are inspected monthly.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. Amd-2: As part of my ongoing research into SCP-5516, food dispersal at 08:00 has been suspended. SCP-5516 entities are instead fed via hand dispersal at 09:00, to better conduct behavioural analysis.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. Amd-3: The use of FLaN-Aquatic Paints at Site-184 was discontinued in 1998, due to averse effects on delicate aquatic lifeforms. Current practices utilize Sea-Breeze P.I.T.s (Passive Integrated Transponders) for the designation of SCP-5516 entities.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. Amd-4: Following the events of 05/11/1996, procedures following an increase in total SCP-5516 entities should be codified. I propose the following addition: "Should the net total of SCP-5516 entities increase, emergent SCP-5516 entities are to receive sequential designation numbers."</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. The American or Northern Lobster.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. Cmt—1: Recent studies have shown that while SCP-5516 entities distribute food evenly, certain SCP-5516 entities display preferences; when various food sources are introduced, SCP-5516 entities can be seen exchanging their allotted food with other SCP-5516 entities. Of note, no SCP-5516 instance has been seen attempting to steal or otherwise deprive another SCP-5516 entity of food.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-7"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')">7</a>. Cmt-2: Upon introducing more diverse terrain features to SCP-5516's enclosure, certain SCP-5516 instances can be seen repeatability positioning themselves adjacent to particular terrain features. Upon repositioning these terrain features within the enclosure, SCP-5516 entities will redistribute themselves to allow individual entities to remain near their preferred terrain features.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-8"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')">8</a>. Amd-5: SCP-5516 entities display distressed behaviour when removed from close proximity to other SCP-5516 entities. This distressed behaviour is reduced if multiple SCP-5516 instances are kept within close proximity to one another, following removal from their Aquatic Enclosure</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-9"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')">9</a>. Cmt-3: Due to my ongoing studies into SCP-5516, I believe we have been too hasty to assign a group-consciousness to SCP-5516. Individual entities are seen displaying clear preferences, distinct from collective behaviour. I propose the possibility that SCP-5516 entities possess a two-leveled self-awareness, allowing them to be aware of themselves as both individual entities and a collective consciousness.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-10"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-10')">10</a>. Amd-6: Only the initial 100 SCP-5516 entities were recovered on 04/21/1987.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-11"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-11')">11</a>. Cmt-4: Although the original SCP-5516-101 and SCP-5516-17 entities have since died, the total quantity of SCP-5516 instances have remained at 101 entities.</div>
