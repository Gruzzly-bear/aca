<h1><span>Description</span></h1>
</div>
<p>SCP-6987 is the portfolio of insurance contracts between the SCP Foundation ("the Foundation", or the "insured") and Goldbaker-Reinz Insurance Group Ltd. ("Goldbaker-Reinz", or the "Provider"). Several of these contracts have anomalous enforcement clauses or benefit payments.</p>
<p>As an employee of the SCP Foundation, you are entitled to insurance coverage through Goldbaker-Reinz. You may choose to exempt yourself from any or all of this coverage and seek private insurance plans, if you so choose. However, note that the coverage offered by Goldbaker-Reinz provides timely global availability and a range of experimental medical procedures.</p>
<p><strong>By accepting employment with the Foundation, you are acknowledging that you have read and are aware of the following information, to your clearance level, in its entirety.</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to the Foundation!</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
Hello and welcome! We're so glad you decided to join us here at the SCP Foundation.
<p>At the SCP Foundation, our trusted insurance provider of choice is Goldbaker-Reinz. They're the most influential and most reliable insurer behind the Veil, yet almost completely unknown in the mundane world. They have proven themselves trustworthy time and time again in our sustained relationship dating back over 200 years.</p>
<p>Goldbaker-Reinz is uniquely equipped to help with the sorts of challenges the Foundation faces every day. As a full voting member of the GOC's Council of 108, they're very familiar with the anomalous, but they're contractually bound to remain nonpartisan in intergroup contracts. Goldbaker-Reinz is proud to service the SCP Foundation, nearly all GOC affiliates, the Horizon Initiative, and many more.</p>
<p>They are the only insurer with a proven record when it comes to anomalous, esoteric, and extremely rare world-changing "black swan" events. They've got a most-likely anomalous model for forecasting the probability and impact of these kinds of events, which of course is proprietary. Rest assured, though — our best and our brightest have pored over every contract we've had with them and every payout in every year, and we can trust them to adhere to our contracts to the letter.</p>
<p>And of course, Goldbaker-Reinz will aid you in your mundane insurance needs as well.</p>
<p>We're so happy you decided to join our Foundation family, and we hope your career is a long and fruitful one.</p>

<p>"Goldbaker" is among the first insurers to become established at Lloyd's of London. They (singular) are instrumental in the early prominence of the organization and serve on the committee of The Society of Lloyd's for decades.</p>

<div class="container right">
<div class="time-content">
<h2><span>1871</span></h2>
<p>"Goldbaker" publicly rejects the Lloyd's Act, declaring their intent to continue acting as an independent insurer.

<div class="time-content">
<h2><span>Late 1800s</span></h2>
<p>The modern Foundation forms. Goldbaker Ltd. declines a full merger, citing conflicts of interest and independence concerns. Contracts held by precursor organizations are renegotiated into comprehensive coverage agreement, designated SCP-6987 due to inherited anomalous enforcement clauses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2><span>1945</span></h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the Seventh Occult War, Goldbaker Ltd. again proves instrumental in funding rebuilding efforts. It is a founding member of the Council of 108 of the newly formed Global Occult Coalition. The Foundation considers cancelling SCP-6987, but both parties come to a mutual agreement and amend their contracts to include a neutrality clause in any future Foundation-GOC conflicts.</p>

<p>All other subitems of SCP-6987 are specific coverage policies. The following overview covers the insurance policies available at your level with major deviations from insurance policies you are most likely to have already seen.</p>

<h2><span>Note: Clauses 616 and 617 of SCP-6987-0</span></h2>
</div>
<p>As a member of the SCP Foundation with limited decision-making abilities, your coverage is unlikely to be affected by penalties outlined in Clause 617. However, <a href="/a-day-in-the-balance">it is important that you understand how SCP-6987 differs from mundane insurance contracts.</a></p>
<p>Goldbaker-Reinz and the Foundation understand that while both entities provide an indispensable service to the other, due diligence is a matter of practical business considerations.</p>
<p>As such, both entities employ anomalous means of ensuring compliance with contractual terms, or, in cases in which such enforcement is not possible, suitable penalties.</p>
<h4><span>Clause 616: Enforcement</span></h4>
<p>The acceptable methods by which the contractual terms of any subcontracts of SCP-6987 can be enforced, by either the Foundation or Goldbaker-Reinz, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memetic geas;</li>
<li>Thaumaturgical geas;</li>
<li>Blood pact;</li>
<li>Pain curse;</li>
<li>Serendipitous probability manipulation;</li>
<li>Automatic bank transfer.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Clause 617: Acceptable Penalties for Contractual Breaches</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Penalties levied are proportionate to scale of contractual breach.</li>
<li>Unless your employment with the Foundation is in a legal, finance, or audit role, you do not need to understand the entirety of acceptable penalties at this clearance level.</li>
<li><strong>If you are found complicit in a willful violation of SCP-6987, your employment will be terminated and you may be subject to prosecution.</strong></li>
