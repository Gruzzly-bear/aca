            <h1>SCP-8369</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8369</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Web crawlers are to flag any blogs focusing on the sexual gratification resulting from the direct application of heat during the cooking process, or any individuals purchasing significant amounts of meats and/or grilling equipment.</p>
<p>All potential SCP-8369-1 instances are to be transferred to Site-69-J for testing — confirmed instances are disposed of accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8369 is an anomalous compulsion manifesting in a progressively intense desire to consume grilled, barbequed, roasted, seared, broiled or smoked proteins,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> especially through the direct or indirect application of flames. This compulsion, when given into, gives the victims, SCP-8369-1 instances, immense sexual gratification both during the cooking and consumption of the meats.</p>
<p>Individuals will slowly develop greater degrees of pyrophilia, matching their reliance and compulsive need to grill. When SCP-8369 has taken full effect, individuals will attempt to fulfil their desires continually, rarely moving away from behind their grill of choice; once an SCP-8369-1 instance runs out of available proteins to cook, they will resort to extremes to ensure they have proteins to grill.</p>
<p>SCP-8369-1 instances have been observed doing each of the following, at the height of infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunting and killing wild animals;</li>
<li>Hunting and killing neighborhood pets;</li>
<li>Spending all their savings on meat subscriptions;</li>
<li>Cannibalism, either via murder or mutilation;</li>
<li>Autocannibalism.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not currently known what causes SCP-8369 to develop within individuals, nor how to reverse the effects. Efforts are ongoing to better understand the progression of the compulsions.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Recorded SCP-8369 Progression</p>
<p>On June 16th, 2024, Foundation web crawlers identified an individual who matched significantly with SCP-8369-1 instances, when comparing traits and cultural origins, designated SCP-8369-1-A. SCP-8369-1-A was Magnus A. Chive, 54, a father from Florida with a family of two; SCP-8369-1-A organized weekly 'block parties' for his cul-de-sac, and as such, was a prime target for observing the development of SCP-8369. Foundation agents were dispatched to his location, under the cover of being a couple hoping to start a new family; local realtors were amnesticized following the purchase of a property on SCP-8369-1's street.</p>
<p>The following are selected security and surveillance recordings, displaying SCP-8369-1-A's progressive infection, and resultant behaviors:</p>

<p><em>Footage shows security camera footage from SCP-8369-1-A's security system; the video shows SCP-8369-1-A standing in their backyard, with their neighbor, Doug Allen.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> So? Would you come over?</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> For a barbecue? Absolutely! We can bring the kids over, and the young ones can tire themselves out, while the women sit and gossip; meanwhile, we'll be drinking beers and 'watching the grill'. It's the American dream, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> You're damn right it is. &lt;<em>Sips beer.</em>&gt; I've been thinking about getting a new grill.</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> What's wrong with this one?</p>
<p><em>Doug gestures to a small propane barbecue, rusted and disused.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> I hate grilling on it, I have to fight the heat the entire time and at that point—</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> At that point, why not just let the wife do it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Exactly. Grilling should be fun, right?</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>The two clink bottles of beer in a cheers. The back door to SCP-8369-1-A's house cracks open, and their wife, Margaret Chive, 51, can be seen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> Hey Magnus, you still playing chef with Doug? Doug, shouldn't you be home by now?</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> And go home? Give me a few.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> Fine, but… &lt;<em>To her husband.</em>&gt; I'm going to the bedroom. Unless Doug can fill your every need, I suggest you follow behind, baby.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> &lt;<em>To Doug</em>&gt; Well, I can't leave my lady waiting.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A stands, nods to Doug and follows Margaret inside.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This recording highlights the sexual gratification experienced by SCP-8369-1 instances.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;<em>Recording Start</em>&gt;</p>
<p><em>Footage shows SCP-8369-1-A standing in front of a shiny, chromed barbecue, fresh out of the packaging. It is midday, and their family runs around the backyard — Doug's family is over as well.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Now, <em>that's</em> a beauty.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> I know. &lt;<em>Stares intently.</em>&gt; It's gorgeous, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Are we going to stare at it all day, or get some fucking meat on there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Doug, you cannot rush a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A moves to a nearby table — on a plate are two raw T-bone steaks, red and dripping blood. He carries them reverently, and walks to the grill.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> God, those steaks are <em>sexy</em>!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Just wait until you see this…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A approaches the grill. They slide their hands along the front handle, levering the top open. The chrome shines in the sunlight. They open the gas valves, and press the ignition — the barbecue roars to life, flames licking the underside of the grill.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Are we just standing around, or are you going to start cooking?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Doug. There's an art to things. A joy in grilling things, the right way. I've been waiting for a week, so just… just give me this.</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> Magnus, I don't say this enough, but you're a fucking weird dude.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A grabs the steaks, and slowly lowers them onto the grill. The meat sizzles as the cold protein touches the shining metal, flames licking up at the dripping fats.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> &lt;<em>Audibly moans.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Doug:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> What what?</p>

<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A is silhouetted in the glass of their back door, by the bright kitchen light. It is late evening, and the sun has begun to set.</em></p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Can it wait a second, baby? I have the grill on high heat, so I can go and clean her down, but—</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> That's what I wanted to talk to you about. The grill.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> What about her?</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> There you go again! Magnus, do you hear yourself? You're obsessed with the barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> No, I'm not!</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> You spend every evening with it, your phone is full of bookmarked recipes, accessories and cleaners — the TV is on the Food Network 24/7, and the fridge is packed with meats. What part of that isn't obsessive?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Honey, can we finish this in a second? I really need to go clean off the grill.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> If you go outside, I am going to go pack. Are you really doing this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Hmm? Sorry, I was just looking at the grill, she's got that shine she gets when the heat is cranked up all the way and—</p>
<p><strong>Margaret:</strong> Goodbye, Magnus. I hope the cold metal doesn't freeze your dead heart.</p>

<p><em>It is the middle of the night, and SCP-8369-1-A stands in the dark backyard, silently in front of the grill. Margaret Chive, SCP-8369-1-A's wife, is no longer living at home by this time, nor are SCP-8369-1-A's children.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> I saw you today, you know that?</p>
<p><em>They rest a hand on the shiny chrome of the grill, and shudders.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Don't play coy. I saw you, staring at me — you know? It's okay, the wife is gone, and now there's nothing that can get between the two of us.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A absentmindedly begins to stroke the chrome handled, back and forth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Do you know what you fucking do to me? I sit there, all day, just thinking about watching you work. The first second a fresh piece of meat slaps your top, the way it screams and sizzles in delight. Each second the meat gets drier, I get… I get wetter just thinking about it.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A turns on the gas to full, and presses the ignition switch — due to the delay, the flames flash up, singing their hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Fuck, look at you go. God baby, I want to cook something on you so badly, but—</p>
<p><em>They look at the back door of their house. SCP-8369-1-A does not move.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Unless?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8369-1-A places their hand on the burning grill — immediately their skin begins to sizzle as the flames lick their fingers. SCP-8369-1-A has visible arousal.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8369-1-A:</strong> Oh god, the way you feel under my fingers it's so good— &lt;<em>Groan.</em>&gt; Fuck babe, this is how you make me feel when it's just my hand.</p>
<p><em>They stand in arousal, watching as the flames begin to blister the skin on their hand, hair singed off, as the skin begins to change color.</em></p>

<p>SCP-8369-1-A was found dead, dismembered, with the grill still burning on full heat — any flesh left on the grill had been disintegrated by that point. SCP-8369-1-A's body was disposed of, and the grill was melted down and recycled, out of respect for the manufacturer.</p>
