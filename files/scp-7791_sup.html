<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Containment Class:</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Decommissioned</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> SCP-7791 is to be contained within Conceptual Containment Unit-34, located at Site-77. The nature of SCP-7791 is to only be made known to senior staff of the <span class="bigtext" style="filter: blur(4px);"><span style="color: #f24">Ethics</span></span> Committee and personnel with situational 5/7791 clearance. Containment of SCP-7791 is the primary directive of the <span class="bigtext" style="filter: blur(4px);"><span style="color: #f24">Ethics</span></span> Committee. Should SCP-7791's current status change, the <span class="bigtext" style="filter: blur(4px);"><span style="color: #f24">Ethics</span></span> Committee is to enact Procedure-333-WOZNY.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Procedure-333-WOZNY:</strong></span> Procedure-333-WOZNY consists of a team of essophysicists and memeticists temporarily destabilizing SCP-7791's nature into Foundation-safe fragments. In this state, certain events and actions can be added to its embodied memeplex, altering its essence into a non-hostile one. Following this, SCP-7791 will revert to its prior state, and the event causing its activity will no longer need to be contained. For more information on Procedure-333-WOZNY, read Supplemental Document WOZNY.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-7791 refers to an essophysical entity, or the embodiment of a concept that exists within almost all sapient cultures. Although the exact nature of SCP-7791 is unknown, containment of it has historically been of much importance to Foundation administration. The earliest mention of SCP-7791 was from a document written in ████, in which the <span class="bigtext" style="filter: blur(4px);"><span style="color: #f24">Ethics</span></span> Committee is formed explicitly to contain SCP-7791.</p>
<p>The closest known description of SCP-7791's embodied concept is that it is a property which certain actions have and others do not.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Behavior:</strong></span> Periods of increased activity have been documented to occur during highly dangerous environments. Actions taken by the Foundation such as genocide, torture, brainwashing, and abuse of sapient beings have historically been most effective in provoking SCP-7791 to action. Such events are antithetical to the continued existence of the Foundation and must be contained by the enactment of Procedure-333-WOZNY.</p>
