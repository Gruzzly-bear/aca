<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5858 is physically self-contained, but requires active censorship. All outbound communication from the town of Ambler will be screened, and revised by Site-24 AI <em>DONA</em>. Individuals made aware of SCP-5858 will be given Class-A amnesics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Locked Scenario (LS)</strong> occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with <strong>Temporal Loops (TL)</strong>, which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principles. Often mischaracterized as "hauntings" or "curses", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-112">SCP-112</a>, <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4382">SCP-4382</a>, and <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1337">SCP-1337</a>. As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution.</p>
<p>An LS will operate under two set variables: <em>Protracted vs. Indefinite</em>, and <em>Static vs. Organic.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Protracted LS (P-LS)</strong> will eventually self-terminate.</li>
<li><strong>An Indefinite LS (I-LS)</strong> will be self-sustaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>High-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or "burnout". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Static LS (S-LS)</strong> will only repeat a sequence of events.</li>
<li><strong>An Organic LS (O-LS)</strong> will "progress" within its own set confines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat its nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc.</p>

<p>There are 87 individuals affected by SCP-5858 directly, including the actors, stage hands, and audience members. All other residents of Ambler have been passively affected by this anomaly, believing the unnatural duration of the performance is completely unremarkable<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SCP-5858-1 through <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">13</span> 14 are the staff of the Ambler Theater, uniquely affected by the Locked Scenario. These individuals are easily identified by their red shirts, black vests, and perpetual full-body vibrations - visually resembling hummingbird wings in motion. All staff members have expressed enhanced speed, strength, and spacial awareness, operating at roughly 5 times that of baseline human capacity. While staff members will continue to perform their routine duties, albeit at a faster pace, their primary purpose is to act as Locked Scenario "maintenance", aggressively preventing all outside interference.</p>

<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Xi-5, this is Command. Report in.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> 5-1, coms online.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> 5-2, coms online.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-3|Volkov:</strong> 5-3, coms online.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> 5-4, coms online.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Xi-5 is green, Command. We're in full compliance with the scenario. Besides the earpieces, we're at zero equipment. I'm feeling a bit naked here.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> I told you to go with the high-neck, not the halter-strap.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> I meant the lack of tech, Sam. Though, yeah, it's going to be strange running this mission in heels.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Exactly why I chose the tux. I feel like I'm in a James Bond movie.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-3|Volkov:</strong> You look just like the supervillain's butler, Samantha.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> So I look like <em>your</em> butler, eh "Volkov"?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Enough, you two. We may be dressed as civilians, but we're still on the clock.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> He's right. Let's cut the chatter. On the flipside, Higs, we are pretending to be civvies. I'm gonna' need you to act like a person.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Yes, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Keep working on that. Command, we're ready for approach.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Copy, 5-1. Your objective is to locate the source of the anomaly. Neutralize, if possible, but use extreme caution.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> We've read the dossier, command - none of us want an ass-whooping from an octogenarian.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Good. Present your tickets at the gate, and maintain your cover as theater patrons. Keep radio chatter to a minimum. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Alright Bullies, let's get weird.</p>

<p><em>MTF-Xi-5 head to the main entrance to the theater. The ticket booth is manned by SCP-5858-6, 15 year old Edwin McAlister, who has been seated there for the past two years. Like all staff members, SCP-5858-6's head rapidly swivels in all directions, creating a featureless blur. McAlister focuses on 5-1 as she approaches, speaking rapidly, but clearly.</em></p>
<p><strong>McAlister:</strong> <em>(Spoken rapidly)</em> Goodevening. Doyouhaveyourtickets?</p>
<p><em>5-1 presents four tickets, recovered from absentees within Ambler.</em></p>

<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> <em>(whispering)</em> Command, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Received, 5-4. Is everything alright? We're picking up some feedback on your transmission. Has the anomaly-</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> That's just echo. I'm uh-… I'm hiding out in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Oh, yes- of course. Report.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> It's about what we expected, Command - no time dilation or visual distortions, just an ongoing event; classic Locked Scenario. It's difficult to say anything else without my equipment. Saksa and Higs took-</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Please use your call-signs, agent.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Right right, sorry. 5-1 and 5-2 took their seats near the front of the auditorium. The audience is fully embedded in the Scenario - no malnutrition, physical degradation or signs of distress. They don't even seem bored!</p>
<p>The play itself seems to be continuing way, way off the events of "Streetcar". Blanche escaped from the hospital several thousand acts ago, and is now on the run in Morocco. Stanley is still chasing her, but now it's because he was hired by Shep Huntleigh to hunt her down, since she stole this diamond that gives her supernatural-</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Thank you, 5-4, but we already knew this was an O-LS.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Right, yeah. Sorry, It's just… surprisingly engaging! I don't know if I could sit through two whole years of it but- wait, hold on.</p>
<p><em>A muffled groan is heard, followed by a sharp, quick 'thud'.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Sorry about that. This guy just won't stay down.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Guy? What guy? 5-4, what's happening?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> About that. We think we've found the source of the anomaly. Remember when I said no one looked bored? Well, Higs- sorry, 5-2, he noticed someone who was.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> And did you- accost this person!?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> What? Oh, no, no this guy was just sitting <em>next</em> to the subject. Sa- 5-1 signaled me to take him out, so I followed him into the bathroom. I tried to play nice, really, but this guy really, really wants to get back to his seat!</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> You were told not to break cover, 5-4. This <em>absolutely</em> constitutes breaking cover.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Sorry Command, but like you said, we needed to work quickly. They know we're not supposed to be here. I can't even wipe my nose without one of those buzzing black-vested freaks shining a flashlight in my face! I feel like a germ in this theater's body, and the white blood cells are circling.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> Still, this seems needlessly dangerous-</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> I know what it seems like, Command. I also know this is exactly why you transferred me to Xi-5. This is a team for problem solvers, yeah? We've got a plan. We're getting it done.</p>
<p><strong>Site-24:</strong> <em>(…)</em> Copy, 5-4. Keep us apprised.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-4|Fletcher:</strong> Copy that. Now I better get back out there. I don't want the ushers catching me-</p>

<p><strong>Exploration Log 4 - SCP-5858</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 15/02/2020 | 14:55</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Ambler Theater / SCP-5858</p>
<p><strong>MTF:</strong> Xi-5 "Newtons Bullies"</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>5-1 and 5-2 are heard surrounded by audience members in the main lobby. Two elderly patrons are standing nearby.</em></p>
<p><strong>Audience A(?):</strong> That last scene was breathtaking, don't you think? What do you suppose it represents?</p>
<p><strong>Audience B(?):</strong> I suspect it's another of Blanche's dream sequences, like in act five hundred and fifteen. Why must these local directors insist on their art-house nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>Audience A(?):</strong> Oh hush, darling. You've been grumbling and fidgeting for the past two months! I swear, you're like a child! I can't take you anywhere <em>(laughing)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Yasuo! Sweetheart! Where have you been?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> <em>(…)</em> Oh! Yes, hello… pumpkin. It was- uh- too loud, so close to the stage you know, so I took a seat further back. Say, what happened to our friend Samantha?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Had to run, I'm afraid. Poor thing has a terrible stomach bug. No less than five ushers had to help them outside!</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Are they alright?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Oh yes, they made it to the curb before- before anything bad happened.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> I'm glad. Actually, speaking of friends, I met the most interesting young man just before intermission. I think he might be-</p>
<p><em>The ambient volume begins to increase. Multiple couples begin shouting at each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Audience A(?):</strong> Always fidgeting! I can't take you anywhere! You're such a fucking useless child!</p>
<p><strong>Audience B(?):</strong> To hell with you! I don't even want to be here!</p>
<p><strong>Audience C(?):</strong> Nag nag nag, constantly! You wonder why I spend so much time at work!</p>
<p><strong>Audience D(?):</strong> Oh you know why I spend so much time at work, you harpy! Why would I ever want to be at home with such a shit family!?</p>
<p><strong>Audience E(?):</strong> You don't love me anymore! You never loved me!</p>
<p><strong>Audience F(?):</strong> I don't even know you anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-3|Volkov:</strong> <em>(Static)</em> Capta- d- you re- me?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Volkov? Damn it, we're supposed to be-</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-3|Volkov:</strong> <em>(Static)</em> Ushers-! Audit- the crowd is- eachother and- actors started-</p>
<p><em>The sound of shouting is overpowering in 5-4's earpiece</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-3|Volkov:</strong><em>(Static)</em> ound me- buzzing- shlights- they're trying t- ah! sto- get o-!</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Volkov? Volkov! God damn it. Higs, we're breaking cover. We need to get back into-</p>
<p><strong>Audience B(?):</strong> Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>Audience E(?):</strong> Liar!</p>
<p><strong>Audience C(?):</strong> I can't take this anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Audience D(?):</strong> Just talk to me, damn it!</p>
<p><strong>Audience A(?):</strong> <em>(Screaming)</em> Get the fuck away from me!</p>
<p><em>All 87 individuals inside SCP-5858 suddenly go silent, followed by a single, audible 'slap'. The sound of 86 bodies hitting the floor is heard, then nothing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> <em>(…)</em> What the actual fuck. Do you have any idea wha-… Higs? Higs, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Acting like a person.</p>
<p><em>5-2 walks forward, the sound of popcorn crunching under his feet. As he approaches, the microphone gradually picks up the sound of a young boy crying.</em></p>
<p><em>Transmission cut-off.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:13:</strong> All anomalous activity in Ambler abruptly ceases. Friends and family of those within SCP-5858 begin panicking. At the same time, the doors to SCP-5858 open, and people begin to exit. Many collapse into the street, openly weep, or stumble around catatonic. All members of Xi-5 report in safe.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum - 15/02/2020 | 15:17:</strong> The last three audience members exit the theater. A young boy is seen standing between a man and a woman, holding both their hands. The trio walk down the town's main street until reaching the first intersection. They embrace, then walk a short distance in separate directions before vanishing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum - Site-24 | Director Morgan:</strong> Reclassification to Neutralized pending.</p>

<p><strong>After Action Report - Captain Lyydia Saksa - SCP-5858</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 16/02/2020 | 13:01</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-24 Briefing Room.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> What exactly happened in there, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> I've given you my report.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> You have, yes, but there are still-</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Ma'am, with all due respect, the ink is already dry on this. You asked me what happened, and I gave you the full, clinical details.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> <em>(…)</em> So that's all you have to report? You didn't, at all, hear what 5-2 said to the boy?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> My ears were still ringing, ma'am - from all the shouting, you know. I just saw him approach the subject. I didn't hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> I see. Thank you Captain, that will be all.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> He's a good agent.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-1|Saksa:</strong> Higashi. He's a damn good agent - a bit uptight sometimes, maybe, but- okay, look, I know you're raking him over the coals right now. I may not know what he said to that kid, but ma'am, I know he said it for the right reasons.</p>

<p><strong>After Action Report - Agent Yasuo Higashi - SCP-5858</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 16/02/2020 | 17:16</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-24 Directors Office.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> Take a seat, Agent.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> I'll stand, if you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> <em>(…)</em> Very well. I think you know why you're here.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> During the broadcast cut-out, your earpiece automatically switched to hard backup. Everything was still recorded. We know exactly what you said to the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> The kid, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> The anomaly, Agent. Do you have any idea what you've done?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Yes ma'am. I sat down with a kid who's parents were fighting. I told him that I'd gone through the same thing. I saw a young man in need of help, and I helped him.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> That "young man" is a reality bender, Agent. He created a Locked Scenario that kept 86 people trapped in a theater for two full years.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> And now they're not trapped anymore. Mission successful.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> You can't possibly be this obtuse. You solved a problem by creating a catastrophe! We now have a sentient reality-warper out in the world with a twelve-year-old's sense of morality and consequences! Does that still sound like a "success" to you, Agent Higashi?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> <em>(…)</em> No ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> Do you realize how inconceivably dangerous it is to give an adult reality bender even <em>partial</em> awareness of their own abilities? Let alone a child?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> Do you have literally <em>any</em> justification for your actions, beyond being emotionally compromised and astoundingly irresponsible? Anything to say at all?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Just that I'm disappointed, ma'am. I thought I'd left this inhuman bullshit behind when I renounced the GOC.</p>
<p><em>Director Morgan pauses, then sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> You're demoted, Agent. I am officially removing you from Mobile Task Force Xi-5 until a formal inquiry is held. Turn over your uniform and equipment to the Quartermaster. You're dismissed.</p>
<p><em>Agent Higashi moves to leave the office. He pauses in the archway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> Director?</p>
<p><strong>Director Morgan:</strong> We're done, agent. Save your defense for the crucible.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-5-2|Higashi:</strong> No ma'am, no defense. This might end up hurting me, actually, but I don't care. I want you to know I don't regret it. A young man in that kind of situation… he needs someone to reach out. He needs to know it's going to be alright. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it any differently.</p>
<p><em>Agent Higashi leaves, closing the office door behind him.</em></p>
