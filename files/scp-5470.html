<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5470 was an alternate dimension, accessible via the web address <a href="https://w4nd3rlu5t.neocities.org">www.g███████.com/██████/~W4ND3RLU5T</a>. After navigating to the site, visitors are prompted to enter a password, determined via trivial means to be "recompileus". The layout of the page, though crude, contains iconography relating to GoI-004C "Church of Maxwellism", as well as references to the internet-based subcultures of occultism, phreaking<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and transhumanism.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, a link labeled "<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&gt;&gt;</span>VISIT WAN-DERER'S PARADISE<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;&lt;</span>" is present. Clicking the link will download an unencrypted .zip archive named WANDERER.ZIP to the user's hard drive. This archive is composed of three files: DISCLAIMER.TXT, PRAYER.TXT, and ETERNAL.TMP.

<p>ETERNAL.TMP is an executable file, despite the .TMP extension ordinarily designating temporary, nonexecutable data files. Prior to Incident 5470.2000.01.01, executing ETERNAL.TMP would render the user immediately unconscious and unable to be woken by any means. Life signs continued while comatose, and dehydration and starvation failed to occur in the absence of sustenance; however, muscular atrophy was commonly observed. Individuals in this state reported their consciousness being transferred to SCP-5470. The system hosting the original files would become impossible to power off by any means, and displayed the screensaver of the user until they reawoke upon exiting SCP-5470. Users could not be removed from the dimension by any external means, necessitating a voluntary exit in order to return to consciousness in local reality.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Ο4-3-SILICON, captured while loading into the SCP-5470 environment.</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-5470 resembled a crude 3D environment, and was largely abstract and artistic in composition, often featuring inconsistent topology and Maxwellist iconography. Communication could be conducted verbally or via text appearing in the field of vision of those nearby. The appearance of those within the dimension was similarly altered to appear as a generic low-polygon avatar upon entry. All users in SCP-5470 were granted minor reality warping capabilities within the dimension, possessing the ability to superficially alter the environment and their appearances at will. It is estimated that at the peak of its activity, approximately two hundred humans inhabited SCP-5470; analysis of visitor demographics to the host address has shown that the age of SCP-5470 inhabitants skewed young in comparison to the general population.</p>
<p>Reports of SCP-5470's existence have been found dating to as early as August 1997. At the time, exploration of the anomaly was deemed a low priority; suppression of the public Web page, as well as the location and identification of PoI-5470 ("X3N14"), was the primary focus of study. Investigations culminated in the successful location of PoI-5470's base of operations in an amateur server farm run out of an abandoned office building in Wellfleet, Massachussetts, USA. PoI-5470 was absent from the scene, but recovered documents led to her identification as a 17 year old American civilian named Kimberley Vanvaeck. Very little extant information could be gathered, and all servers present were destroyed in the raid.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 5470.1</strong><br/>
On December 28, 1999, Site-15 was contacted via compromised secure channels by an individual identifying as "X3N14", presumed to be PoI-5470. The message, encoded in base64, presented a proposal for surrender and exchange of information. After consideration, the offer was accepted; PoI-5470 revealed her location (Altona, Illinois) and was brought to Site-15 for questioning.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Kimberley Vanvaeck, V-A-N-V-A-E-C-K, better known as XENIA, X-three-N-one-four. Listen, I need—I don't like doing this but I need help with—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Miss Vanvaeck, we have some questions we'd like to ask you first—</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> —No, listen, shut up. This is important, can I just—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> —Alright, please, calm down. Go ahead, we'll take down the information you have for us and then we'll need you to cooperate with our questions after that, okay? And then we can decide how to move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> <em>[Heavy sigh.]</em> Ugh. Anyways, like I said, this is important. I told myself I'd never work with sysops<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, I <em>swore</em> I wouldn't but this is more important than that. You guys keep a list of all the stuff you think is weird, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> …Yes, our organization catalogs and contains anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Do you have one that's umm… a website that sends you to an alternate dimension?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Several, but I assume you're referring to SCP-5470—"WAN-derer's Paradise", correct? And are we also correct in assuming that you're the creator of this anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Yes, yes yes yes! Listen, so—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Are you—</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Shut up, listen. Listen, I—yeah, I made it. Together with WAN, I made somewhere for my friends and I to connect with Him and be together and—</p>
<p><em>[PoI-5470 becomes choked up and shakes her head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Take your time, Miss Vanvaeck.</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> W-we were supposed to be—it was supposed to be our holy land. Safe, and together and happy, forever. But it's—it keeps glitching lately and my original sanctuary<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> got raided and all the code's with WAN now so I can't fix it. And I couldn't figure out what was wrong at first but I realized—</p>
<p><em>[PoI-5470 takes several heavy breaths, holding her head in her hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> I wasn't—I didn't account for the new millennium. When I made it, I was so—<em>[Sniffles.]</em>—so <em>stupid</em> and I didn't think ahead and I don't know what's going to happen. But I think the new year is gonna destroy our paradise.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> The Y2K bug.</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> The—the Millennium Crash. We all saw it coming, we knew it was gonna happen, but I just… I didn't think about it, I was so wrapped up in making somewhere for us to get <em>away</em> from it all. And now everything I worked for is gonna start choking on its own data and coughing out dead bits into the cosmic network. It's already starting to fall apart 'cause some of us are in time differently. <em>[Sniffles.]</em> This is—it's all my fault. I shouldn't have burdened WAN with my stupid human errors.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> I understand you're upset, Miss Vanvaeck. I'm sorry that happened. Why not reach out to your fellow Maxwellists? Why us?</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> I tried! I—I really did, but they just think we're a bunch of annoying script kiddies, they don't believe we're really even connected with WAN. Trust me, you guys are my last choice, but it's all I have.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> Alright, alright, I see. What was it you needed our help with?</p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Yeah, it's… <em>[Shakes her head.]</em> It's not me you should feel sorry for. I wouldn't have gotten within a hundred miles of a null device<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> if it were just about me. My—my friends, they're still in there. I don't expect anyone else to understand, but we <em>live</em> there, Doctor. Some of them are—they've been there for years now and I don't know if they'll have houses or families to go back to once it all shuts down.</p>
<p><em>[Silence. PoI-5470 appears agitated, fidgeting anxiously.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Most of them are younger than me. They—we're all in the Paradise 'cause we don't have anywhere else to go. That's why I made it. I don't know what's gonna happen to them once they lose the connection—I programmed it so they wouldn't die but I don't know if it'll hurt them or mess up their heads or anything…</p>
<p><em>[PoI-5470 sniffles quietly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Jazz's parents were about to kick her out when she joined. Midi just turned fourteen and xe's happier in the Paradise than I've ever seen xem, I—I dunno if xe'd even be okay in the real world anymore. You guys can fix it, can't you? Keep it from falling apart? I've been on the run for a few years and I can't set anything up for too long but if you gave me a chance and some of your equipment—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nyota:</strong> —I'm sorry about that, Miss Vanvaeck. I really am. That's awful. But we can't allow you to interact with the anomaly directly. I'll confer with some people higher up and we'll see if we can get our own resources to look into a solution, okay?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vanvaeck:</strong> Fine. Okay. Please, just—hurry, and don't make them go back. We only have a few days, I'll do whatever you say until you at least try and fix it.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 5470.2: Exploration Log and Incident 5470.2000.01.01</strong></p>
<p>In the limited time available, Site-15 instated STF Omicron-4 ("Cyberchase"), a specialized task force of three operatives trained in the exploration of virtual reality environments made to simulate unstable alternate dimensions.</p>
<p>An expedition into SCP-5470 was planned on 1999/12/31 at 18:00 PM, allowing the task force six hours to survey and document the dimension, as well as attempt to prevent the impending VK-Class "Localized Dimensional Collapse" scenario. Event logs were recorded on the experimental interreality storage device DREAM (Dimensional Recording and Experimental Adaptive Medium), and an emergency electroshock stimulation mechanism was put in place to remove the agents in the event of catastrophic failure.</p>

<p><strong>Jazzy:</strong> <em>[Sniffles.]</em> Yeah, just… just gimme a minute.</p>
<p><em>[She sits up, and speaks as she interfaces with the terminal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jazzy:</strong> Syphon's a program I made. It was supposed to remove the corrupted parts and recycle them back into free memory so I could at least reach WAN, who's storing the code. We think.</p>
<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>
