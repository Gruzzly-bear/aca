            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3954</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-3954 is to be housed in a 5m X 5m humanoid containment cell in Site 4 with standard furniture items and a TV.</span></p>
<p>SCP-3954 is to be kept restrained to a 2m steel pole in a Type S Standard Humanoid Containment Cell. Under no circumstances may SCP-3954 be given amnestics of any class at any time. No meals are required and no other precautions are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3954 is a sexless humanoid, 1.5m tall and weighing 13.6kg. SCP-3954 resembles a scarecrow, with a support structure made up of paper and masking tape, with a thin outer layer of leather. SCP-3954 contains organic structures, including an oral cavity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, hair, nostrils, and luminescent eyes; all of these organs possess human DNA. SCP-3954 is sapient and capable of speech in several languages, and has shown passive-aggressive behavior when speaking.</p>
<p>Cranial Ultrasounds revealed the subject's optic nerves to be attached to a lone brain stem twice the size of an average human's. Further ultrasounds have revealed a larynx, trachea, bronchial tubes, and lungs. Each of SCP-3954's organs are encased in a protective, non-flammable mucus. Although the subject is immune to moderate blunt force trauma, electricity has shown to cause physical distress and damage to the living tissues in its organs. (See Addendum 3954-C) Subject is incapable of movement from the waist-below and unable to lift its arms above its head. The subject will remain motionless and unconscious during most of the day, only awakening <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for tests or</span> to converse with itself.</p>
<p>SCP-3954 has access to memories of individuals it views<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> or comes within close proximity of. The subject seems to recall only specific memories that usually cause stress or extreme discomfort, and tends to use this private information against its target in a taunting fashion. SCP-3954 has proven to be able to learn the full identities of individuals observed in a memory.</p>
<p>Multiple experiments have been conducted with chosen test subjects including D-Class personnel, actors<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, and a collection of presidential campaigns. SCP-3954's refusal in cooperation, however, has encouraged staff to terminate any possible future testing.</p>
<p>SCP-3954 was discovered in ██, Maine, when an individual attending a Halloween attraction became hostile and began attacking one of the scarecrow props after allegedly hearing it accuse them of homicide. Such accusations were confirmed to be true when the suspect confessed to law enforcement after being taken into custody for damage of property and assault. Wonders of how the theme park knew about the homicide encouraged local law enforcement to investigate, where they discovered SCP-3954, catching the attention of the Foundation after reports of a talking scarecrow began surfacing. Employees of the park claimed that SCP-3954 was never their property and were unaware of its existence until after the incident, leaving its true origins unknown. Agents of the Foundation easily contained SCP-3954, and all witnesses were given amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3954-A: Testing</strong></p>
<p>Originally assigned to SCP-3954, Dr. ██ requested amnestics and a transfer after conducting the first interview of its processing. SCP-3954 displayed its anomalous properties by focusing on Dr. ██'s personal life to the point where they became emotionally overwhelmed. Responsibilities were passed onto Dr. O'Dell.</p>
<p>Initial tests with SCP-3954 were first conducted with D-Class personnel entering its containment chamber under the supervision of Dr. O'Dell. Below is one of few relevant transcripts of SCP-3954's testing logs.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 3954-B: Amnestics</strong></p>
<p>On 12/16/2008, it was discovered that the Foundation's amnestics had effect on SCP-3954. The idea generated from Dr. O'Dell's theory on the drugs wiping SCP-3954's learned memories despite possessing only a brain stem and not a full brain. Dr. O'Dell tested out this theory with class A amnestics in aerosol form. Successfully administered, SCP-3954 had 12 hours of memory erased from its knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. O'Dell:</strong> Good morning, 3954.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Another day another dollar, right doc?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. O'Dell:</strong> Of course. Now then, I'd like to conduct an experiment with you, if I may.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Things usually don't work out for you and your family. Like health, am I right?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. O'Dell:</strong> I'll be using this can of spray. It's an inhalant.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Yeah?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Never better! Head feels good for once! That's a first. I gotta do that more often, whatever the hell I just did. Wait…what happened?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. O'Dell:</strong> Good. Still want to talk about Mabel?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With Experiment 3954-B successful, Dr. O'Dell planned further research in studying how far SCP-3954's memory could be wiped. It's been theorized that SCP-3954 could be administered more powerful amnestics without risks of severe side-effects<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>. However, without veins or the ability of oral consumption, injections and tablets were not possible for SCP-3954, thus encouraging Dr. O'Dell to explore the usage of class A amnestics in dosages higher than normally recommended by Ethics Committee. Dr. O'Dell conducted two weeks worth of sessions involving excessive amnestic administration. The results were temporary amnesia and SCP-3954 losing approximately over half its memory of the Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-3954 began displaying classic signs of dependency after prolonged use. On 2/28/2009, SCP-3954 experienced its first withdrawal, forcing medical staff to intervene and terminate Experiment 3954-B-2. After rehabilitating SCP-3954, Ethics Committee ordered the prohibition of freely experimenting amnestics on SCP's. If amnestics are to ever be used, medical staff must be present and perform follow-ups.</p>

<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> Good afternoon, 3954!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> What happened to the other guy? There was another one…at least I think there was.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> They've been relieved of your case; I've been assigned in their position. So, I'd like to start everything anew. All past failures and such will be counted as expunged.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Yeah, forget everything ever happened before, right? Heh…forget. This place is all about forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> Now then, I'm aware that you prefer to be evasive and unwilling during your interviews and testing, am I accurate?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Sounds about right. Like how you're evasive about certain papers involving a failing marriage.<br/>
<br/>
[ <em>Security personnel activates taser.</em> ]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> [waves hand] I want to discuss with you about your ability to see other's memories and such. What you did just there is an example of what I'm talking about. But I warn you to not stray far from the subject.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> What happens if I do?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> You'll find out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3954:</strong> You gonna take a swing at me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3954:</strong> It's quite alright. I can take it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> That won't be happening. Like I said, you'll find out. We both will since this is kind of an experiment at the same time as well. We're going to see if this method delivers any success. Any questions?<br/>
<br/>
[ <em>Silence</em> ]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> Good. Now then, would you care to tell me how you find out this kind of information from people? Does it come to you as a vision, an idea, anything like that?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> Maybe something along that line. See it pretty clearly. What I don't see is that wedding band on your finger. Was it forgotten at home this morning or is there too much trouble and shame to remind yourself that you're still tethered?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> If you're expecting a reaction, 3954, it won't happen. If anything it only makes me more curious.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> I'm curious, too! Curious about all those toxic pills you bring home to try and feed to those mouths you have waiting there for you. It's like burning baggage!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> What? That's not even real information, you're just trying to be cute.<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Dr. Simms:</strong> Interesting. Are you able to choose what memory you want to see?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-3954:</strong> No. They just appear. I have no control over it…though I wish I did. But they always tend to have a hold over that person. It's always a triggered fear or anger. It's all…quite amusing.<br/>

<p>Below is a transcript recorded on 6/12/2009 of SCP-3954 conversing with itself inside its containment chamber. The discussion caught the interest of staff due to its particular nature, but when questioned, SCP-3954 refused any explanations. This has been the first and only conversation SCP-3954 has had with itself involving possible origins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[ <em>SCP-3954 conversing with itself inside of containment. No personnel staff were inside of its cell at the time.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3954:</strong> That's quite lovely, isn't it? So vast and spacious. No worries of getting cramped and forgotten about. But there are many that I'd like to forget. They never leave. Some of them are funny, yes. They do help. Hang on to the funny stuff and make the best of it. After all, laughter is the best medicine, right? Do I miss him? Of course I do. Well…from time to time. Not so much anymore. You could say I'm glad that I'm away. I hated being his "reminder". But he is the one who created me, after all; I can only respect him, though he did say I was too flawed. But I remember everything just fine. My knowledge can't be forced back by a physical boundary like his. No brain and I have better memory than him. Hah! However, I wish some things would disappear forever. I wish I had a physical limit like he. But the only limit is the universe. And there's plenty of space.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3954-01:</strong> <em>Re: Procedure update</em> - Request for silencing SCP-3954 via gag during routined cell maintenance is denied. (See document 3954-01)</p>
<p><strong>Document 3954-01</strong> <em>As stated before, no other precautions are necessary. And refrain from assaulting SCP-3954. Just because it can take the damage doesn't mean you won't be reprimanded for it. If its remarks are too much to ignore then just wear headphones when conducting electrical maintenance around its cell</em>. ~Dr. Simms</p>
