<p>Superficially, the runes written on SCP-7414 translates to “I, master of the runes conceal here runes of power, which will be revealed when broken.”</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7414</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All civilians will be denied entry on the pretense of an archaeological investigation in the area. All accounts of SCP-7414 as a historical artifact have been removed from national archives. Authorized personnel will be stationed nearby an outpost in order to prevent civilian interference with the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7414 refers to three standing stones located on the Western coast of Sweden. Each stone is inscribed with runes written in the Elder Futhark, dating back to the 8th century.</p>
<p>When anyone attempts to view the runes, they will perceive rapid changes to their surroundings and feel powerless to resist these changes. Typical effects are described as different chronological events occurring in the middle of a haze. Subjects slip into a trance-like state, during which they experience a series of events narrated by an unidentified female voice. So far, no unexpected side effects have been reported after interactions with SCP-7414.</p>
<p>The three stones each elicit a different experience and they are therefore described here as SCP-7414-1, -2, and -3 respectively.</p>

<p><em>At the identification of the runes, we did not expect much, and so were shocked as the runes didn't have to be transcribed; instead, we heard a woman's voice, and everything became perfectly clear. And it was like the first stone blinded us and then clouds filled the sky, and we had a different land around us, plainer, but grazed by horses and oxen. A fort of wood had risen out of the ground around us, and a longhouse appeared on a mound. A company of warriors were marching towards it, clad in large pelts and adorned in ornate metal. A rustling told us of armor and weapons under all that fur. A voice spoke to us, as if it was in our heads.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Sigtruda, King of many men, welcomed one day King Alf to his court. The young monarch had carried gold and ornate jewelry from Miklagård in the east. The weathered Sigtruda was impressed by how the young King Alf fared.</p>
<p><strong>Sigtruda:</strong> You have impressed me well, brave King Alf. I suspect with these merry treasures you are here to aim for an alliance with my kin. However, I must disappoint you. For my kingdom is not the one it once was, and we must admit our weaknesses. Our fields do not yield much harvest, and our amber is out since a few years back. I am afraid, I have nothing to offer in return for this alliance between us.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> But King Alf only grinned under his moustache and showed the crooked Sigtruda the six front teeth that he had left. He let his hands go to his side.</p>
<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Your lands are weak, but your kin is still strong. And I can think of many solutions to this problem. If we tie bonds, not by economy, but by family, the fate of your land will brighten.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The young girl sitting on the throne’s left, but a nervous teenager who had just learned to take care of her younger siblings, stiffened. She was terrified, for the young king Alf had during his account laid his eyes on her.</p>
<p><em>The old king clasped his palms and raised a horn in the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigtruda:</strong> That is it. Tonight, we feast for the alliance of our kins! Skål!”</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> A roar was heard and the villagers were summoned to prepare the feast for the two kings. Meanwhile, the frail little girl, Alfhild Lathgertha, had escaped into her mother’s hut.</p>
<p>Her mother was smitten by Alfhild’s tears and embraced her daughter in her bosom. “So, so,” she said, awkwardly trying to comfort the child, who knew her mother had once endured the same event.</p>
<p>With them was also her closest friend, Tora, who appeared fierier with reddish flaming hair and a constant wrinkle formed upon her forehead.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Oh, curse that bloody king!</p>
<p><em>Mother Gudrun looked at her with a warning gaze.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Why should he take her away from us? He steals gold and treasure from Miklagård, but do we know he was the one who did the deed? Could it not be his servants or warriors? What more does he know? Does he have a big kingdom? Is he a good man? Look at his face, the giants were fairer!”</p>
<p><strong>Gudrun:</strong> We must not speak like that. It is not our place.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Gudrun was still stroking the long blonde hair of Alfhild.</p>
<p>Tora, with two wrinkles on her forehead now, took Alfhild by the shoulder and whispered something in her ear. Then she disappeared out of the tent. Gudrun looked at Tora and then back at Alfhild, with tears of pity filling her large eyes.</p>
<p>Later that night the two kings were discussing their affair.</p>
<p>Sigtruda and Alf were in agreement that Alfhild was the most fitting daughter to be transferred to Alf’s court. However, when Alf inquired on her whereabouts, the hall went silent.</p>
<p><strong>Sigtruda:</strong> Alfhild? Where’s my daughter?</p>
<p><em>From behind the throne, the mother of the house, stepped forward with a certain calm in her stride.</em></p>
<p><strong>Gudrun:</strong> I believe you will not find her here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The old king looked at Gudrun as if she had been a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>Sigtruda:</strong> What do you mean? Is she not here to welcome her suitor? Shame on-</p>
<p><strong>Gudrun:</strong> I don’t think she is meaning to come. I suspect she has already left the village.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> And so she had. While the longhouse was filled with dread and bitterness, Alfhild and Tora had made their way down to the boats. They threw oversized fur pelts in the water, costumes they had used to disguise themselves. Tora took them upon a boat that had belonged to her wretched father once, I say once, now it was theirs.</p>
<p>Back in the hall, the flames upon the fireplaces lining up the longhouse were weak. It was if the air inside had suddenly become frailer, and king Alf was struggling to breathe. He puffed and hummed, with a stormy red spreading over his throat and face.</p>
<p><strong>Alf:</strong> King Sigtruda, as joyeous this occasion has been, I am afraid I will have to take my leave in order to resort to my duty. Finding my wife!</p>
<p><em>King Alf slammed the end of his unsheathed battle-axe into the table. A roar lifted the longhouse as King Alf led his men out of the longhouse and toward the boats.</em></p>

The persons mentioned here are part fiction and part historical characters. Alfhild Lathgertha is mentioned briefly in sagas of the 14th century but has never been able to be tied to an actual person and king Sigtruda has been documented as a Geatish chief ruling in the 8th century. Local historians argue that the most probable place of burial is the colloquially named Sigtruda Hill located in the western parts of Sweden. However, there are no existing mentions of a king named Alf during this time period.

<p><em>At this point we were in a trance-like condition. However, there was a calmness in it all, like we were carried on by a pair of warm hands. Our environments shifted. We saw these two young women set up camp somewhere else and recruit fellow young women from the surrounding societies. At the same time, we could see this furious chieftain riling his men up and sailing along the coast. Hard weather hindered him, and mists concealed the company of these women. One night, he finally reached the final point of the coastline with his boat and the voice continued.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alfhild and Tora had gathered a small group of women from villages along the coast. Many had left their lives longing for a new life or an escape. Now they stood on the desolate cliffs where the sea winds howled to greet King Alf.</p>
<p>The young king left his longboat and met Alfhild’s wide eyes with his determined gaze.</p>
<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Come, Alfhild. You don’t need to run anymore. You will be safe with me! Our two kins together will make your homeland thrive again!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> King Alf grinned, just like he was used to do.</p>
<p>Alfhild felt a surge of fear and desperation. Tora stepped forward and grabbed her friend’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Go ahead fool. If you want your lovely concubine, show us you deserve her.”</p>
<p>Alfhild urged Tora not to aggravate him, and the king's men joined him on the cliff.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> You need your men’s help to take me on, king?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The king made a signal with his axe, in order to get his men back into the boat. He spun his battle-axe in his arm and threw himself forward into the battle.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> First, one must learn to use the size, and momentum of the enemy and learn to use your own.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The big man had ended up swinging his big axe into the ground. He growled and turned to swing at Tora again.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Then, one uses his lost footing.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The king missed his swing and trembled. Tora took one step forward and gave him a kick, sending him backwards.</p>
<p>Alfhild, the once fearful maiden felt a newfound courage when she watched her friend use this unknown knowledge to humiliate this clumsy warrior.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Lastly, you need to use your wits, and use tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alf made a roaring sound and swung his legs along the ground, turning Tora upside down. The confident Tora panted at the ground, and Alf sat himself on top of her. The women of Alfhild’s party had switched their emotion from inspiration to despair as they saw the big man raising his battle-axe.</p>
<p>And that was the moment Alfhild saw her guiding light and tackled the king. The surprise on his face mirrored the shock of the crashing waves below as Alfhild’s strikes landed true. The mouth of the king had turned red, his teeth were not visible, if existent at all. Alfhild dared to stand up first when Tora had landed a firm kick into his cheek. She handed the battle-axe of King Alf to Alfhild.</p>
<p><strong>One of Alf's men:</strong> That was not a fair fight!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alfhild had a quickened breath but resonated a quiet strength. She called back,</p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Fairness is a luxury. We fight not for fairness, but for freedom.</p>
<p><em>She put a foot on the face of the weak man below her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> But if it is fairness you want, I wonder how many conquests this man really did in Miklagård. And how many, he would not reward his company for.</p>
<p><em>The men in the boat lowered their shoulders and whispered nervously.</em></p>
<p><em>Alfhild waited for a wave to strike, and then swung the axe into the sky and followed its movement down into the man’s throat.</em></p>
<p><em>The novice turned warrior turned to examine the longboat and the pale faces of the warriors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> We fight for freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7414-2</strong></p>
<p>The following is a transcription of what occurred as the second stone, SCP-7414-2 was viewed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[OPEN TRANSCRIPT]</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The surrounding areas darkened once again and was shrouded in a thick mist. The mist cleared up and revealed a moving surface, soon splashing against rocks and cliffs. The rune stones were replaced with men and women rowing a longboat forward, fanning the sailors on board, and leaving a frothy wake in its wake. The narrating voice from above began with a thunderous noise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alfhild Lathgertha first met with the darkness when she was raiding the settlements of Lochlann. She was by now a proud warrior, with shining rustling armor, a sword smelt by the most cunning smiths and a decorated shield of oak. She had built and rebuilt a boat and gone from 26 pair of oars to 36. There was a feeling of invincibility, and a feeling that no one would question or challenge her with her loyal company. That feeling persisted until the day she met Katla.</p>
<p>Katla was no ordinary fiend, she would chill the sea, spreading a mist around her, and almost still the blood of ones near her. However, when she slithered on to the thick ice that had emanated from under her, she was more out for a talk, than a massacre.</p>
<p>When Alfhild ordered “Attack!” on the dark body that slowly surrounded her boat one day she found herself slowing down, and her company freezing in place. For the sea that had recently surrounded their boat was all of a sudden an uneven surface of ice while the air had filled with frosty particles. To her horror, she found she was the only one on the boat that could move forward reasonably, and the only one on the boat, who found two globes of reptilian eyes open to stare right at her. And where was she to escape?</p>
<p><strong>Katla</strong> I’m ssorry. Is that the cold shaking you up? Or do you fear my figure?<br/>
Katla rose up revealing her matte underside.</p>
<p><em>Alfhild had backed up onto the stern of the boat and held tightly onto a shield.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> What do you want with us beast? Take us to Helheim if you must, do not doubt it. We have no defense.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Katla revealed a set of fangs, spreading her mouth in what could only be a serpent’s equivalent of a smile.</p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> You are, mistaken little Alfhild. There are many sisters of mine in this world, but we are not all destined for Ragnarök. I am Katla, and I have been following you since you in so extraordinary fashion killed that ugly ccchharlatan.</p>
<p><em>Katla enunciated this last word with a hissing sound and squinted her eyes in disgust.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Are- are you a Lindworm? Child of Jǫrmungandr?</p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> I am here, to warn you.</p>
<p><em>The fins of the scaley serpent rose.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Wha-, what? Of what?</p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> You have taken your newly found powers, and used them of such a degree that we have had to lay our eyes on you. Do you think… It isss normal of you, a f- female, to wreak havoc upon the sea? It is too much noise.</p>
<p><em>Katla, who was the same approximate size of the whole ship, circled the ship and closed in on Alfhild with her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> You have treaded, untouched waters, and disssssturbed Her. Do not go close to sea again. Stay on land, the rest of your life. She has already started her hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Stay on land… For all life!?"</p>
<p><em>From behind, this quivering voice of a shivering body had slowly risen. It was Tora, hugging herself tightly for warmth.</em></p>
<p><em>Katla gestured with her head towards the shore, instantly melting a path of streaming water for the longboat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> It is your fate.</p>
<p><em>Katla loosened her grip of the longboat, and retreated off the boat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> W-, wait, wait Katla! Who is this creaure that you speak of? Who have we disturbed?!</p>
<p><em>Katla slithered across the ice and made her way towards the ocean.</em></p>
<p><strong>Katla:</strong> My ssssister.</p>

<p>The transcription reveals a common symbol within Norse legend and mythology, <em>the Lindworm</em>. Lindworms are the north germanic equivalent of dragons, much alike the British <em>Wyvern</em> and the French <em>Guivre</em>. They are often included in legends and on rune inscriptions.

<p><em>The skies darkened and the rune stones vanished. A ship had landed by a seaside that had not been there a few minutes ago. The company of the ship hurriedly entered a longhouse, situated not long from the beach.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The proud Alfhild Lathgertha, former raider of the seas, now raider of the country, had waited for word from across the sea. The messengers came into the well-lit longhouse with exasperated and fearful expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> My highness.</p>
<p><em>The first messenger sat down on one knee.</em></p>
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> The king, is very unwell. Your home is in dire need of a princess. As you know, there are no brothers to take his place.</p>
<p><em>The longhouse was shaken by the thrusting winds of the ocean. Alfhild pondered, and did not seem to reveal any emotion at this message.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> What of the queen?</p>
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> Yes, what may have exacerbated the king’s condition… In a violent fever, the queen, was swept away not long ago. She is dead, my highness.</p>
<p><em>The sky thundered and Alfhild had remarkably tensened the grip of her chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Is my mother dead?!</p>
<p><em>The fronting messenger had suddenly become so small in body, he averted himself from her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> Y- yes, my highness, yes.</p>
<p><em>The lighting in her eyes shone as a reflection of the fireplace.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Tora!</p>
<p><em>The loyal shieldmaiden came forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Prepare all of the boats, assemble all that we have got. We will give them three days. then we move toward Geataland<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> And so on the third day a fleet of eight longboats left the land of Lochlann to go home.</p>
<p><em>Alfhild Lathgertha gave orders to avoid the open sea, and so the trip was slower than usual. They travelled along the coast, and made for the coast of Jutland with several stops along the way. The company eventually came to fill with stressful worry, that seem to have emanated from Alfhild herself. Tora consulted her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> They are having nightmares, they get so little sleep… Some talk about an invisible voice following them.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alfhild had to restrain herself, for she had also heard whispers from the waters around them. Whispers from the deep, revealing that the difference between a dark secret and a truth is not always so stark.</p>
<p>Alfhild made her best effort to brush concerns aside, and soon the small fleet had rounded Jutland and were ready to cross the Kattegat.</p>
<p><em>A high-pitched wail was heard, making the rowers cover their ears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Nausea and headaches spread as a violent screeching noise pierced the ears of the sailors.</p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Go on! Do not fear, we are almost by the shore!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> The shieldmaiden Alfhild Lathgertha attempted to incite some morale in her people. Even the robust Tora had to cover her ears.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Ssso, here you are, Alfffhild. Stuck in the sssea. Maybe you should have ssstayed on land.</p>
<p><em>Alfhild shivered, and scouted the areas around the boat but did not find the source of the hissing voice. She wielded her battle-axe and told her people to stand ready.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> What do you want from us?” she screamed from the top of her lungs, but received no immediate answer.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Punishment.</p>
<p><em>Screaming warriors had been thrown out of one of the longboats to their starboard, a splash of water revealed a punctured boat that quickly capsized. Warriors stood in schock with gaping jaws. Alfhild made her way to starboard, signalling for other ships to pick up the warriors aboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> I have heard of you, in my dreams, you have spoken to me! Are you the guardian of forbidden knowledge? In that case, I have trespassed on your realm. But not my people! Spare my people, I am their leader, I am responsible!</p>
<p><em>At this, a powerful wave struck their ship so that Alfhild had to hold on and not be swept by the gushing wave onboard. The groaning rowers had been swept by their feet onto their backs. Another longboat, to their portside was suddenly shrinking rapidly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> No!</p>
<p><em>She commanded the sailors to get the boat closer to those now laying straddling in the sea to their left.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> These people did not choose this life. I did. It is only I who have broken the ancient accord!</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> To hell we did not!</p>
<p><em>Tora stepped forward, drawing her sword.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong>I chose this life, I chose this life by Alfhild Lathgertha, the true ruler of our people. I have heard your name in my dreams, harbinger of shadows, and I will find delight in your unraveling.</p>
<p><em>Alfhild made a meagre attempt of protesting but Tora was already at the front of the boat, waving her sword. The waves had risen higher and higher.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Our realms are intertwined, our fates as well. Come out, fiend. Come out, <em>Svafnir</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> And there she was.</p>
<p><em>Tora was swept backwards onto her back when masses of water gave way for a shining pale body rising out of the water. The warriors onboard either took cover or jumped ship. Alfhild shook with fear.</em></p>
<p><em>In front of the ship, a weathered being shook its head, widened its nostrils and revealed two blood-filled eye sockets.</em></p>
<p><em>Tora leaped onto her feet and roared, throwing her sword at the being. Svafnir screeched as the sword separated a plate of scaly armour from the white serpent. In the next moment a yellow substance shot out from the screeching serpent, hitting Tora across her body. She went down screaming.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Tora!</p>
<p><em>Svafnir jerked its body forward toward her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Svafnir:</strong> Why, how you petty worldly humans misunderstand… I am no guardian. I have not pursued you out of duty or lust… But because of hunger. Your ssstench draws me, it angers me, and now, I will rid you of it.</p>
<p><em>The serpent jerked in a different direction, and circled the ship.</em></p>
<p><em>Alfhild ran toward Tora, and tended to her unconscious friend who had a broad wound in her stomach from the acidic substance that Svafnir had spit. She shouted to those few warriors that were still on the ship.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Get off! Swim to the closest ship!</p>
<p><em>As Alfhild tried to drag Tora to a safer place, Svafnir screeched and snorted acid across the boat’s side, instantly fretting away the wood. The boat slowly began to take in water. Alfhild sat irresolute by her old friend’s side. She closed her eyes and cried, and begged to herself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Help, help, help.</p>
<p><em>She saw how the big serpent arched her neck and pointed her red eyes directly towards Alfhild and Tora. She pulled Tora to the side in time for the head of Svafnir to come lunging past them, ripping parts of the deck and rocking the ship. Svafnir shook her head. Alfhild swung her axe in the direction of the head, but Svafnir pulled away.</em></p>
<p><em>Alfhild noticed how the bow was very close to the sea surface and scouted for ways to escape. Before she could make her way anywhere, Svafnir lunged at them again.</em></p>
<p><em>She threw Tora to her right, while diving the other way. Svafnir again ripped parts of the ship loose and had to shake her head, when moving up again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Come on, again!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Alfhild found to her shock, that her bleeding friend now stood on her legs.</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Is that all you got, why don’t you hit us again with that venom of yours, I thought you’d be a god, you look more like a worm to me!</p>
<p><em>Svafnir snorted and hissed. She revealed razor sharp teeth and arched back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alfhild:</strong> Tora, stop!</p>
<p><strong>Tora:</strong> Yes, go ahead and try you pale, lisping bastard!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Afhild had almost accepted death, when she realized how long they had waited for Svafnir to make a final lunge. It was almost, as if Svafnir had frozen with her head arched and slowly struggled to move. It began, to snow.</p>
<p><em>Svafnir screeched, and jerked her head to her left, as another darker body of scales came out of the deep and sunk its teeth deep into the body of the pale serpent. Svafnir screamed and spit on the way down into the water.</em></p>
<p><em>Tora lowered her arms and Alfhild could hear the ocean waves again. The two shieldmaidens stood on their sinking ship, finally breathing in a moment of silence.</em></p>
<p><em>Then the two serpents came out of the sea again, violently thrashing at each other. The pale Svafnir was bleeding and screaming until Katla finally stopped, looking at her wounded sister with a sense of pity. Svafnir screeched with pain and jerked herself backwards, and away. Finally, she disappeared in the horizon.</em></p>
<p><em>Katla made her way toward the sinking ship, and brought Alfhild and Tora to safety.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Katla gave Alfhild a final reassuring gaze with her eyes before going down, deep into the sea again.</p>
<p>The town of the coast had seen the whole ordeal. A mass of people were lining the streets as the company of Alfhild Lathgertha made their way past the walls and toward the longhouse Alfhild had left so many years ago.</p>
<p>Alfhild was shaken and wet, and could barely notice the manner of the townspeople who were kneeling, bowing, and weeping to her sides. She would enter the longhouse, and there lay a withered man who was once her father on a makeshift leather stretcher.</p>
<p>And so, the warrior queen Alfhild Lathgertha was promptly accepted as new ruler of this small kingdom of the north. She ruled long and wisely. But the whispers of the Lindworm would follow her through the full course of her life, and remind her that somewhere out there, Svafnir would still be lying in the dark, waiting for her next prey.</p>
<p>Tora had these stones erected in memory of Alfhild Lathgertha, serpent-whisperer and queen of the Geats.</p>
