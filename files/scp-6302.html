            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6302</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation Webcrawler Delta-(SCP-CLAN) is to monitor the web for any content relating to the <em>Warriors</em> book series by Erin Hunter. Individuals affected by SCP-6302 are to be administered Class-C Amnestics.</p>
<p>To reduce the spread of SCP-6302, the Foundation is to advocate for the removal of the <em>Warriors</em> book series from public access under the guise of parental groups upset about the excessive violence portrayed in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6302 refers to a phenomenon that currently affects thirteen percent of those who have completed at least one book in the <em>Warriors</em> franchise. SCP-6302 causes the affected individual to feel compelled to travel to and enter the nearest forest or woodland area, where they will experience tactile, auditory, and visual hallucinations of a clowder<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>in the area stationed similarly to the living quarters in the <em>Warriors</em> series are described. Behavior of the felines has been observed to be similar to that of the characters in the books.</p>
<p>If the subject is injured by the hallucinations caused by SCP-6302, only they and other affected individuals will see the injuries. If the injury is fatal, death will appear to be spontaneous to the unaffected. Individuals affected will also gain the firm belief that domestic house cats should not be kept as pets, but rather kept outside to take part in a 'clan'. Many affected by SCP-6302 that owned felines as pets have released them into the wild. If all memories of reading any book of the <em>Warriors</em> franchise are erased from an affected individual's mind, they will no longer experience SCP-6302's effects, but are subject to experiencing them again if the individual is re-exposed to the franchise.</p>
<p>The individuals behind the Erin Hunter pseudonym were investigated and interviewed thoroughly. It has been concluded that none of them had any involvement with the creation of SCP-6302.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1-Discovery:</strong> SCP-6302 first came to the Foundation's attention when a Foundation Webcrawler alerted researchers of multiple abnormal social media posts. Multiple posts having mentioned multiple individuals traveling to the same locations with only some observing these 'clans of cats'.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> On October 29th, 2013, a news story covered by multiple news outlets was released, informing the public of a phenomenon of people releasing their pet felines into the wild was published. All different versions of this story included social media posts and statements from those who were with or against the cause. Examples of these posts are shown below.</p>

<p><em>Post was a description accompanying a photo of a cat.</em></p>
<p>Made a hard decision today but after visiting my local forrest and seeing a warrior cat clan (which I'm pretty sure was a form of river clan? they lived by the river and were carrying fish) I decided to release my cat Millie into the wild. She has webbed toes so that must mean she belongs with her fellow clanmates. who am I to keep her trapped inside? I hope the clan helps her choose a nice warrior name!!</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-3:</strong></p>
<p>On November 10th, 2013, news reports detailing a string of break-ins in Adair County of Kirksville, Missouri began to spread. The only noticeable change in the homes was that any pets residing in the household were missing. Law enforcement found that only homes that had pets were subject to attacks. A Twitter thread regarding the break-ins was posted to twitter by a user who had previously commented on the situation.</p>

<p>The IP address of the user who made the post was traced to a computer at a local public library. Due to the public nature of the terminal, it was deemed impossible to link the post to any specific individual.</p>
<p>The culprit remained unknown until home security footage taken on November 24th, 2013 was able to identify the culprit as 24-year-old female Rivina Charles. Charles was listed as a member of one of the city's homeless shelters, but had not been spotted at the location for thirty-four days as of that date. Library staff were able to confirm that Charles was a frequent patron, but had no record of her visiting their establishment since November 14th.</p>
<p>On November 12th, 2013, another post from the Twitter account Charles had previously used was released. The IP address of her latest post was traced to a computer in a house in Kirksville Missouri. The homeowners were investigated but found to have no connection to Charles. Although the digital history of the post had been deleted, Foundation personnel were able to recover the following.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-4:</strong></p>
<p>On December 15th, 2013, a hiker discovered a body while traveling through a forest which was soon identified as Rivina Charles. Initial observation found that Charles' had begun showing atypical physical characteristics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A snout developing in place of her nose.</li>
<li>Position of the ears transitioning higher up on the head while developing additional characteristics including sharper tips, pinnae, fur, cartilage, and a deeper ear canal.</li>
<li>Whiskers sprouting from the area around the eyes, nose, and chin.</li>
<li>Patches of fur on various parts of the body.</li>
<li>Sharper, pointed, and thicker nails.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cause of death was determined to be hypothermia and internal organ failure. Autopsy reports showed that Charles' internal organs, skeletal system was changing to a quadrupedal stance and that the skull was changing in shape.</p>
<p>Foundation researchers sent agents to receive the body and administer Class-A amnestics to all persons who had witnessed the discovery of Charles' body. Charles is the only instance of these effects occurring to date. It was concluded that any person undergoing the observed changes would die before the transformation is completed due to the human body being unable to support the physical nature of the changes.</p>
