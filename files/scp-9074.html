<p>SCP-9074.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9074</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9074-A is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber in the East Wing of Site-91. It is to be provided 50L of a special slurry, consisting of human sweat, mucus and sebum,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> daily for consumption.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours before the current SCP-9074-A is set to expire, SCP-9074 is to be removed from SCP-9074-A via the nasal cavity and transferred into the new SCP-9074-A specimen, selected from Site-91's pool of D-Class personnel. All non-D-Class personnel who take part in this procedure are to wear air-tight hazardous materials suits at all times. Personnel who become accidentally infected by SCP-9074 during this process are to be considered the new SCP-9074-A.</p>
<p>The corpses of previous SCP-9074-A instances are to be disposed of at Site-91's on-site waste disposal facility.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9074 is a sapient, parasitic flatworm that superficially resembles a clump of dried nasal mucus. It hosts itself inside a targeted human's nasal cavity, linking itself to the brain and influencing its host's behaviour via hormonal and chemical manipulation. This process slowly transforms the brain cells into an unidentified mucus-like substance, eventually leading to total brain death and the inability for SCP-9074 to control the host body. Before this occurs, SCP-9074 will attempt to transfer itself into a new human host, sometimes using other mammals as intermediate hosts. The current host of SCP-9074 is designated SCP-9074-A. All SCP-9074-A instances are seemingly unaware that they are infected and influenced by SCP-9074.</p>
<p>When without a host, SCP-9074 weakens rapidly, leading to expiration in around five hours. SCP-9074 sustains itself by absorbing nutrients from the bodily secretions of SCP-9074-A and other humans directly through the skin, into the bloodstream and to the brain; this includes sweat, mucus, sebum, urine, semen and saliva. This absorption primarily occurs when SCP-9074-A engages in sexual activity with another human, the frequency of skin-on-skin contact and release of bodily secretions during intercourse allowing for SCP-9074 to achieve large amounts of sustenance.</p>
<p>When deciding a host, SCP-9074 targets individuals considered to be conventionally attractive and currently in committed romantic relationships. This allows SCP-9074-A to have access to a large pool of potential sexual partners, maximising potential feeding opportunities for SCP-9074. The next SCP-9074-A will also be chosen from this pool of individuals. It is unknown how SCP-9074 is able to understand the complexities of conventional beauty standards and human relationships.</p>
<p>The following is an overview of the stages of SCP-9074 infection and the corresponding SCP-9074-A behaviour:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Behaviour</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 0</td>
<td>Individuals will come into contact with SCP-9074-A and begin a sexual relationship with it. If SCP-9074 chooses them as its next host, SCP-9074-A will engage them in intercourse a final time. During intercourse, SCP-9074-A will force the victim's mouth open before vomiting a stream of various bodily secretions and SCP-9074 into it. These bodily secretions act as a safety precaution for SCP-9074 to consume in the case it cannot find a suitable sexual partner quickly enough while in its new host. SCP-9074 will then take its place within the nasal cavity and connect itself to the brain. The victim is now designated SCP-9074-A.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 1</td>
<td>SCP-9074-A's libido will increase exponentially and they will attempt to have intercourse with their romantic partner as much as possible, up to four times a day. Their personal hygiene decreases rapidly, going long stretches of time without washing their body, hair and teeth. SCP-9074-A's behaviour and personality will become noticeably more flirtatious and confident than before infection. Their romantic partner, family and friends often attribute this drastic change in behaviour to a number of environmental factors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 2</td>
<td>SCP-9074-A's romantic partner will become tired of the constant intercourse and will refuse to engage in it as frequently or altogether. SCP-9074-A will then seek out new sexual partners either through previously known individuals from SCP-9074-A's prior life or new individuals sourced from real-life courting or online dating/"hook-up" apps and websites. SCP-9074-A is often described by loved ones as being cold and insensitive. By the end of this stage, around 35% of SCP-9074-A's brain will be mucus. As their brain mass decreases they will seek to rely on their romantic partner more for simple tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 3</td>
<td>SCP-9074 will prepare for transferring to the next host whilst continuing its usual pattern of behaviour. SCP-9074 will attempt to gather a large amount of sustenance to store within its next host during Stage 0 by aggressively seeking sexual activity with its pool of sexual partners in a relatively short amount of time. This may lead to non-consensual sexual contact. SCP-9074-A's romantic partner will usually discover its infidelity due to its blatant disregard for discretion at this stage. By the end of Stage 3, around 50% of SCP-9074-A's brain will be mucus. This leads to observable symptoms such as mucus leaking from the nose, ears and mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 4</td>
<td>SCP-9074 decides on a new host from SCP-9074-A's pool of sexual partners. See Stage 0. Once SCP-9074 has expelled itself from SCP-9074-A, the former host falls unconscious. By the end of this stage around 60% of their brain will be mucus. When they awake, subjects will experience amnesia affecting the last 24 hours and will display symptoms similar to individuals who've undergone hemispherectomy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></td>

<p>The time between initial infection to Stage 4 is roughly four months, with around a month per stage.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9074 was discovered on 11 December 2024 within Junior Researcher Maddison Haybrooke during a random parasite screening at Site-91.</p>
<p>Haybrooke, designated SCP-9074-B, was immediately moved to a secure biological containment cell and SCP-9074 was forcibly removed from its nasal cavity. This procedure caused significant damage to SCP-9074-B's brain stem, leading to its near instant termination. Containment procedures were then established for SCP-9074.</p>
<p>It was determined that SCP-9074-B had received SCP-9074 less than 24 hours prior from Junior Researcher Ryan Barnes, designated SCP-9074-C, who was later discovered immobile in the pair's home.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Example Infection</p>
<p>The following is an example of typical SCP-9074 infection from the case of SCP-9074-B and -C. There have been at least 12 other known cases of SCP-9074 infection prior to containment, although this case is the only known example of infection occurring between Foundation personnel. SCP-9074-C is assumed to have been infected by an individual currently unknown to the Foundation.</p>
<p>Various audio and video recordings were accessed from SCP-9074-B's mobile phone and home security cameras covering the four month period in which it interacted with SCP-9074-C, its romantic partner at the time.</p>

Haybrooke enters the frame holding a cake with two lit number-shaped candles reading '26'.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> [singing] Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Ryan, happy birthday to you!</p>
<p><em>She places the cake in front of SCP-9074-C. It blows out the candles and laughs. Haybrooke claps.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I know, I know.</p>
<p><em>It smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> How about you give me one more present tonight?</p>
<p><em>It places a hand on Haybrooke's thigh. She laughs nervously.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> We already did it this morning… I don't…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> C'mon, it's my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> I'm tired Ryan, you know I've got to get up early tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Why are you being so weird?</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I literally just want to have a nice time with you and you're acting like… this.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> I just… I just get exhausted sometimes, I'm sorry. I… I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Oh, so you're guilt-tripping me now, is that what we're doing?</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> What? What are you- Baby, I didn't mean to-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<p><em>Haybrooke begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Oh my god.</p>
<p><em>Nobody says anything for a while. Haybrooke continues to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> [sniffling] Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Let's just go to bed, okay?</p>

<p>After this event, SCP-9074-B filed a formal complaint against SCP-9074-C for physical and sexual harassment with Site-91's Human Resources department. The following is the internal complaint file:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><tt>Department of Human Resources Internal Document</tt></p>
<p><em>Complaint No. 2490</em></p>
<p><strong>Complainant:</strong> Junior Researcher Maddison Haybrooke, Botany Department</p>
<p><strong>Subject of Complaint:</strong> Junior Researcher Ryan Barnes, Sociology Department</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Investigating Officer:</strong> Stephanie Daniels</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Christopher Iguchi</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Haybrooke has alleged that Barnes physically and sexually harassed her during an argument on October 24th 2024, as well as sending her sexually explicit text messages after the incident. She also alleges that Barnes emotionally neglected her during their relationship, and pressured her into sexual activity multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> Haybrooke and Barnes have been in a committed romantic relationship since June 2020, and shared a home together up until the incident in question. No complaints have been filed against Barnes previously. According to colleagues, their relationship has been without issue up until recently. Haybrooke alleges that Barnes began emotionally neglecting her around September 2024, which later evolved into verbal abuse. She claims that Barnes repeatedly pressured her into having sexual intercourse with him, despite her rejections.</p>
<p>The main incident occurred on October 24th 2024, when Haybrooke confronted Barnes about acts of infidelity after discovering sensitive texts and images on his mobile phone. Barnes confessed to the infidelity and the pair had a heated argument, which is when Barnes allegedly grabbed her by the wrist and attempted to kiss her. Haybrooke is now staying at her sister's home. Haybrooke also claims that in the following days Barnes sent her multiple text messages soliciting her for sex. The two have not interacted since.</p>
<p><strong>Action Taken:</strong> It is not the place of the HR department to pick sides in something as subjective as a domestic scuffle. Barnes and Haybrooke's working hours have been re-organised to prevent overlap. Relocating Haybrooke to a different Site may be considered if any further incidents take place.</p>

<p>SCP-9074-B and SCP-9074-C did not interact with each other for almost a month. During this time, SCP-9074-C had intercourse with at least six known individuals. The pair then interacted with each other one final time on December 10th 2024:</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> December 10 2024, 23:49 PM</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-9074 is assumed to have been hosting SCP-9074 for almost four months.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>The video begins from the same camera and angle as the last log, with SCP-9074-C pressing the doorbell and waiting. It looks dishevelled, one nostril leaks mucus profusely. One minute elapses, and the door opens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> What… Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Listen, I'm sorry, can I please come inside I really need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> I don't think that's a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Please, Maddy. [sniff] I hate how things ended last time and… I just really need closure.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> …Okay.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9074-C enters the house. The video cuts the kitchen's security camera feed. Haybrooke sits down at the table. There is a glass of wine next to her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I just wanted to apologise [sniff] for the way I acted when I last saw you. It was horrible, and I don't expect you to forgive me but… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> I don't know what you want me to say, Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I don't know either.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> How could you do… <em>that</em> to me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I don't know… I just have so many <em>urges</em>, and I'm so weak. I can't help myself.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Something needs to change, you can't act like this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> You hurt me so bad.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>Haybrooke begins crying. SCP-9074-C embraces her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> [muffled] I love you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9074-C:</strong> I love you too.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9074-C begins to make a low retching sound.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Ryan- ugh!</p>
<p><em>Haybrooke pulls away from SCP-9074-C and wipes at herself. Mucus is sliding down her back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Ryan?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9074-C suddenly lunges at her. She screams as she is pinned to the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haybrooke:</strong> Ryan, stop!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9074-C kneels on her legs to stop them from kicking. It grabs her head while more retching can be heard. A stream of green liquid flows from SCP-9074-C's throat and into Haybrooke's screaming mouth. This lasts for approximately forty seconds before SCP-9074-C collapses onto her body. The volume of Haybrooke's screams slowly decrease until she falls silent. Still lying on the hardwood floor, she breathes heavily for two minutes before shoving the unconscious SCP-9074-C off herself and walking out of frame and into the bedroom.</em></p>
<p><em>Nine hours later, Haybrooke, now designated SCP-9074-B, re-enters the frame dressed for work. SCP-9074-C writhes on the floor, half conscious. It exits the house.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
</div>
<p>Four hours after the end of the log, agents arrived at Haybrooke and Barne's home and found SCP-9074-C unresponsive. It was taken to Site-91 and given medical attention, eventually regaining consciousness. After a nine month period of physical rehabilitation, SCP-9074-C continued its work at the Foundation. It now struggles with mobility issues and is unable to see out of its right eye.</p>
<p>Due to the complainant's SCP designation and subsequent termination, the Human Resources department filed SCP-9074-B's complaint against SCP-9074-C as resolved without further action.</p>
