<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The three villages and towns located within Location-6217 had been considered inactive since 2009. The anomalous nature of Location-6217 was discovered during a routine exploratory operation conducted by the Foundation. A record of the operation is shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Team members:</strong> Sigma-1-1 (Captain, Site-403 Chemist), Sigma-1-2 (MTF Hostile engagement specialist), Sigma-1-3 (MTF Tactician)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1 approach Location-6217 from the North, stopping at the New Stony Lake United Methodist Church for final preparations before moving towards the epicenter of the anomaly. Sigma-1-1 activates her shoulder cam and takes initial environmental readings.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Five. Five, do you read- okay, perfect. I read you loud and clear. Initial readings are looking good. Slight increase in humidity but that’s expected with the rain. Otherwise everything checks out. Are y’all ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-2:</strong> Ready to go.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1 walks behind the church and towards the treeline in the direction of the lake. Three meters from the first trees, the grass becomes a dark black and the soil a deep rusted red. After collecting a sample of the soil and grass in a small vial, Sigma-1-1 looks back up at the trees ahead. As the camera pans upwards, the trees come into focus to reveal that they have no leaves. Instead, a flock of black birds sit upon each branch, eyes fixated upon the three Sigma-1 members.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Ever get the feeling you’re being watched?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> <em>(Stifling a laugh)</em> Command, looks like there’s some unexpected fauna out here. Anything else we should know? O—okay. Sounds good. Alright guys, sounds like we might encounter some other things out here but it’s nothing to worry about. Just keep moving forward.</p>
<p><em>(Emerging out the other side of the wooded area, Sigma-1 encounters a small, dilapidated community of ten homes with a slight view of the deeply colored lake in the distance behind them. The houses have all been stripped violently of their gutters, garage doors, and other metal. As the wind blows, the houses sway loosely and several crashing sounds are heard. Several humanoids can be seen inside the houses through the open windows and appear to be aimlessly pacing in their respective rooms. Sigma-1-2 steps in front of Sigma-1-1 and readies her weapon. The three continue forward with Sigma-1-2 taking point.)</em></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="emerging-from-the-broken-7.png" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6217/emerging-from-the-broken-7.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A frame from the video record recovered. Although the exploration was conducted in summer, no leaves were observed on trees.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>(Moving further towards the houses, the road comes further into view to reveal that the center of the road has been dug up with branching trenches leading towards each house. Shattered glass litters the ground and several wooden utility poles have been knocked over with what appear to be claw marks running along their height. Upon the standing utility poles, more black birds watch Sigma-1 approach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-2:</strong> Not getting any movement readings from house three. Looks like our best way through.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Same readings here. I say we go for it.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1 continues towards 3 Stony Road slowly, stopping for a moment before stepping onto the porch due to the house swaying and creaking with a strong gust of wind. The trench dug up to the house from the road has been filled with rain and appears to be running uphill towards the road. Sigma-1-1 takes a sample of the trench water and continues forward.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The front door lays haphazardly on the porch, having had its hinges and doorknob forcefully removed. Inside, a couch has had its fabric and innards strewn about the living room adjacent to the entryway. The majority of the ceiling beyond the entryway has collapsed and the floor has caved into the basement, leaving only the support beams and the attached floorboards intact.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-2:</strong> No way we’re getting through all that. Looks like the hallway around the corner is still intact though.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Should be able to get there pretty easily from the garage.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1 all maneuver back towards the garage and walk towards the interior door. Shreds of rubber and leather are strewn across the floor and piled by the walls. Sigma-1-2 opens the interior door and motions Sigma-1-3 to enter first. Sigma-1-3 takes a few cautious steps into the hallway towards the kitchen before signaling for the rest to follow. The appliances have all been ripped away from the walls and moldering food covers the counters. Sigma-1-3 picks up a plastic handle laying on the floor and examines it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Not sure I’ve ever been hungry enough to eat the full pan like that but also not sure I’d eat anything else in- do you two hear that?</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1-1 turns to face a cabinet that is now rapidly shaking. Slowly, she reaches over to open it before being stopped by Sigma-1-2.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-2:</strong> I got this. [Sigma-1-3], ready to engage.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1-2 sticks the barrel of her rifle into the hole left by a now-missing handle and pulls. As soon as the door begins to open slightly, a large black bird scraws and flies out through the window, spraying a thick black substance over the room and Sigma-1 with every wing flap. In the commotion, a pile of black sludge begins to inch its way out of the cabinet and towards the window as well before being captured by Sigma-1-1 and added to the other samples.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> <em>(At a distance)</em> Slugs and birds? All this violence from slugs and birds?</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1 continue out of the back door in the kitchen and proceed towards the lake down a path behind the houses cut through the wooded area.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> I’ve seen weirder. Spend some time in the incoming anomaly dock at Site-403 and this will look fairly normal. Once, there was this doll that teleported back to where it was five seconds ago and the damn thing got stuck on the conveyor belt for four days. Apparently it had somehow caused the deaths of a full apartment building.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> <em>(Laughing)</em> Oh, this isn’t the weirdest I’ve seen by far. One time, there was this thing living in the toilet at an Applebees and we —</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-2:</strong> <em>(Muffled)</em> Quiet down. There’s something moving in the trees just up ahead. It’s been watching us since we left the houses. You two go ahead, I’m going to check it out. [Sigma-1-3], keep [Sigma-1-1] safe while I’m gone. I’ll meet you at the shore.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1-2 separates from the group and walks into the woods to the right of them. Sigma-1-3 and Sigma-1-1 continue along the path to the lake quietly.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Reaching the lakeshore, Sigma-1-1 pulls out a sample jar and fills it with water.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Sample collected. Any news from [Sigma-1-2]?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Nothing yet. She is usually pretty good at this kind of thing though. Never even seen her flinch before. Funny story actually —</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, a flare shoots out of the trees into the sky and explodes into blue smoke. Sigma-1-3 and Sigma-1-1 both stand up abruptly and look in the direction of the flare’s origin.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Something an old captain taught us. The telekill ammunition causes the phosphorous to explode into blue smoke when you shoot the flares. Means danger I think. Are you good here? We really need to get going.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Yes. I’m ready to leave this place.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Good. Move silently back towards the house. If anything seems wrong then hide in the grass or make a run for it. Do not wait for me and do <em>not</em> go near the trees. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1-3 hands Sigma-1-1 a handgun and takes off towards the woods in a full sprint. Sigma-1-1 starts walking quietly back down the path they came from. As the houses come back into clear view of the camera, the humanoid entities are no longer located in their respective rooms and the sounds of footsteps and branches snapping are heard emanating from the woods. Sigma-1-1 begins to increase speed until she is jogging towards the kitchen door.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Reaching the house, Sigma-1-1 bursts into the kitchen and lifts the door back up against the frame to catch her breath. After a moment of respite, the house begins to creak with footsteps upstairs, moving with a wandering pace towards the staircase into the living room. Sigma-1-1 raises her pistol and points it towards the entry to the kitchen from the direction of the living room.)</em></p>
<p><em>(After a few moments of silence among the footsteps, something large crashes through the kitchen window and Sigma-1-1 turns and fires.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Fuck! It’s me! What the hell are you still doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Oh my god are you okay? I thought —</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> You hit my arm. I’ll be fine. You were told not to wait for me! Now, <strong>move!</strong></p>
<p><em>(Sigma-1-1 and Sigma-1-3 move through the kitchen towards the garage. Beside them, in the direction of the living room, a large wet thump is heard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Keep going. We don’t have time to stop for every noise.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> Where’s [Sigma-1-2]? Are they —?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Don’t worry about that. I got there in time to see her being dragged back towards the lake and being submersed by some humanoid covered in tendrils of that goo. If she’s okay, then she will figure it out. And if not, then it’s not our worry right now. You can mourn at the church if we make it there.</p>
<p><em>(Reaching the garage door opening, the remaining Sigma-1 members look out towards the road and treeline they entered through. On the road, fifteen elderly people are wandering aimlessly and staring at the sky. Sigma-1-1 looks up to see what has drawn their attention.)</em></p>
<p><em>(As she looks upwards, the trees ahead of them begin to shake and the birds on their branches take flight, forming a massive swarm in the sky and blocking out the sunlight. As the birds fly erratically, the black sludge drips down onto the road and the humanoids, forming pools on the street that begin to grow in size by moving and combining with smaller puddles. As the droplets land upon the humanoids, they form long, thin tendrils stretching from their bodies like long fur.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Stepping outside of the garage, the birds begin swarming into a single ring in the sky, sending individual birds down to peck and claw at Sigma-1-3.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> On three you make a run for it. Understand. No more waiting for anything. Don’t look back until you reach the car. You’ll see me soon.</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> One</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Two</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> What —</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-3:</strong> Three</p>
<p><em>(On three, Sigma-1-3 sprints outside and down the street, parallel to the treeline. The birds above them form a spiraling swarm and birds descend down like a coil from the sky towards Sigma-1-3. Sigma-1-1 sprints out and towards the treeline they first came from. Several birds take notice and descend upon her, pecking and scratching at her exposed skin on her face and arms. She turns to look towards the direction of Sigma-1-3 to see her being lifted into the air by the swarm and disappearing into the sky. The coil of birds then turn towards her and begin quickly approaching just as Sigma-1-1 reaches the trees, branches now completely empty of birds.)</em></p>
<p><em>(She pushes through the branches as she runs, shoving metallic twigs and birds to the ground as she goes. As the swarm catches up to her, she removes her helmet, headset, and body armor and tosses them aside for greater mobility, retaining only her pistol, samples, and camera. Reaching the other side of the treeline, she takes a leap of faith and comes crashing down onto the earth beside where she had taken the initial sample, demarked by a missing patch of grass. She covers her head with her arms as the birds continue their attack, and curls into a ball.)</em></p>
<p><em>(In one quick movement, she flips onto her back and fires six shots in the direction of the swarm, causing them to divert their flight path. She stands, begins sprinting, and searches for the boundary of black grass for safety, finding that the boundary has now extended to the back edge of the church and the Foundation vehicle is missing. She sprints towards the house on the other side of the road and comes crashing through the door, tripping over a welcome mat and tumbling onto a coffee table with a family sat eating dinner.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown man:</strong> Can we help you?</p>
<p><strong>Sigma-1-1:</strong> I need to use your phone, if you would be so kind.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterward:</strong> MTF-Sigma-1-2 and Sigma-1-3 are both presumed to be lost, despite no remains having been identified. See Addendum V for the detailed analysis of the composition and structure of the black substance samples (SCP-6217-B material) collected during this and subsequent exploratory operations.</p>

</div>
<p>Analysis of the footage and samples collected by Sigma-1-1 show that almost all organisms within Location-6217, including animals, plants, and microorganisms, exhibit a complex set of symptoms of an incurable disease now designated as SCP-6217-A. Tissue samples of organisms infected by SCP-6217-A (designated as SCP-6217-A-1) were found to have had their hydrocarbon composition replaced by a complex mixture of iron and sulfur.</p>
<p>As of the third exploration (08/09/2010), a total of 23 human instances of SCP-6217-A-1 have been identified within Location-6217. No healthy residents have yet been observed in any exploration of Location-6217. All missing prior residents of Location-6217 are assumed to be deceased. All human instances of SCP-6217-A-1 have been relocated to Site-6217 for medical treatment and experimentation.</p>

<p><strong>Subject Name:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Adrian Rolfe</span> PoI-662164</p>
<p><strong>Subject Identifiers:</strong> Male, 43-years-old, hyperglycemic, blood type unknown</p>
<p><strong>Subject History:</strong> Subject was found alone in his house at the time of detection, was the most symptomatic of the admitted infected persons and displayed significant psychiatric symptoms connected to SCP-6217-A. Initial physical examination showed that approximately 43% of his total gross biological tissue had been replaced by iron-sulfur complexes.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>(Dr. Chugaev, wearing a protective suit, enter the ward and sits opposite to the bed of PoI-662164. Small but visible black patches are evident on the skin of PoI-662164.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Good afternoon, [PoI-662164]. I hope you are settling well into your new life here. We would like some information from you.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> You guys — what did you take me here for? … I want to go back — I want to go home. Are you guys in league with <em>that thing</em> to throw me in the lake?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Don't worry, I'm only here to ask you some questions. We'll provide you with medical coverage and protection —</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> Protection? Do you mean … you guys can protect me against <em>that thing</em>? Won't take me into the lake?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> We will try our best to keep you safe. But, for now, I'd like to know what's going on in the town where you live. <em>(Flipping through the relevant files)</em> It says here that you live with your wife. Do you have any idea where she might be? We haven't seen her.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> My wife … Anna … She went to the lake. She went to the lake a week before you guys came.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> I see. So she must be one of the infected then. Did you notice anything strange about her before she went down to the lake?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> She, uh, became very fond of iron and sulfur. Ate all the iron pans in the house, then the pipes, then the steel frames … she just <em>ate</em> all that stuff, somehow. Then the rubber on tires, and the dirt outside. She ate everything she could and left nothing for me to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> I see. And physically?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> She had lots of these, uh, black spots, all over her body. And these horrifying black tentacles … Then she started dreaming about <em>that thing</em> every day. Couldn’t close her eyes without thinking about it until it pulled her into the lake…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> <em>That thing</em>?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> Yes — Anna dreamed about it every day, she cried in front of me every day about her dreams … She said that she got closer to the lake every day, she tried to escape but felt unable to move her legs, and all I could do was watch. I couldn't help her … and now they … they’re coming for me too. They are screaming everywhere. They come to me in my dreams, they roar in my head, they— <em>(PoI-662164 goes silent)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> [PoI-662164]? Can you tell me more about your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> Every time I fall asleep I dream that I am standing by a lake surrounded by a white mist. Then, the black water starts to bubble and, when they burst, they make the sound of metal rods crashing all around me. Then I look up from the bubbles and there’s a monster standing in the lake. Every time I sleep, I get a little closer to it. Last time I fell asleep I was almost touching the water.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> A monster? Would you mind giving me a detailed description of its appearance?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> I can only ever see its apparent shape; the mist is always too thick to see it clearly. It was taller than all the surrounding mountains with its head in the clouds, but I couldn’t see anything more than that. It just stood there in the fog like that. And—</p>
<p><em>(PoI-662164 hesitates for a moment)</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> I felt that it had a powerful attraction for me. It was calling me. It roared to me directly in my head. Whenever I see it, it’s as if there’s a force making my body involuntarily come towards it. It makes me want to— <em>(Silence)</em> — nevermind that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> It’s okay, [PoI-662164], there will be time to get to that later. Apart from you and your wife, do you know if there are any other people who have had similar dreams?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> Everyone I know, everyone, has dreamed about that thing lately. As soon as you get caught by it, it engulfs you and becomes your life, pulling you into the lake. You’d go outside and the whole neighborhood would be standing in the moonlight looking at the water, then the next day everyone would be talking about wanting to go for a swim, have a barbecue down by the water, all these things that I’ve never seen anyone do before. But me? I don't want to. I don't want to get caught.</p>
<p><em>(The wind blows outside the interview room, blowing the window open and sending a howling sound throughout the ward. PoI-662164 freezes and slowly looks down at his hands before beginning to tremble.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> What’s happening? [PoI-662164] tell me what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> <em>(Now screaming)</em> It is coming again! It’s coming … it’s coming … again …</p>
<p><em>(PoI-662164 whispers "It's coming again" over and over to himself for the next thirty seconds before suddenly crying out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> Ah—ha … Fuck you! Fuck off! Demon! Get away! Get away from me! … I, I'm … I'm separate, I'm independent, I won't be consumed by you, no, I won't be a part of you! I'm a <em>human</em>, I'm an independent person, I'm not part of you, I'm not …</p>
<p><em>(PoI-662164 begins thrashing around his bed, prompting the caretaker beside him to hold him down on the bed and place him in restraints for his own safety.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Please calm down, [PoI-662164]. This place is safe, you won't get hurt here. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> No, you don’t understand, doctor! They— they are inside me. They come in through the windows. This room is already filled with them and they whisper in my ears, mocking me, calling to me. They want me to go to the lake, to Anna, they say that Anna is in that lake— that Anna is part of them, part of that monster, that monster wants me to be it …</p>
<p><em>(PoI-662164’s movements decrease to a shiver and he begins to cry, covering his face with his hands.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Don't worry, [PoI-662164]. You'll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> I can hear Anna saying that to me too. They have her voice. She— they want me to get swallowed up by the demons in the lake. They want you all to go down there too. They want everyone—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> It’s okay. They won’t get us. We deal with worse all the time.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Chugaev stands up and closes the window. The sound of the wind stops and [PoI-662164] settles down. The caretaker removes his restraints and [PoI-662164] begins to rock in his chair, hugging his knees.)</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-662164:</strong> I feel like I’m changing… I— I am a person, I am Adrian Rolfe, son of Mike Rolfe and Maria Rolfe, Anna's husband… electrical engineer and graduate of the Ohio State University… me… I am a person… I am human… I am not part of you, I am not… you. Give Anna back to me… send her back…</p>
<p><em>(PoI-662164 begins crying deeply again, prompting the rest of the interview to be suspended until further notice.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Thank you, [PoI-662164]. I will be back soon. Take care of yourself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following video log is recorded from the exploration of New Stony Lake using an unmanned submersible with instant messaging capability.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:00~00:29</strong> The submersible enters into New Stony Lake from the north shore. The view from within the submersible shows that the water is light brown in color with relatively good visibility.</p>
<p><strong>00:29~01:12</strong> The submersible descends to a depth of about 4m. A small, black, fibrous entity suddenly appears from the right side of the field of vision and then quickly leaves from the left side.</p>
<p><strong>01:12~01:24</strong> The submersible moves towards the lakeshore and finds a bivalve shellfish-like entity with roughly 40 elongated, black tentacle-like structures protruding from the shell and swinging in the water at the rocks of the lakeshore. Several metallic, mechanical structures of various sizes, including gears, motors, and levers, are observed on the slope of the lakeshore with their surfaces severely rusted. A large number of tiny, oily and fibrous materials are seen on the surface of the mechanical structures.</p>
<p><strong>01:24~04:10</strong> The submersible travels towards the epicenter of the lake. Several entities resembling [REDACTED] appear in the field of vision and then leave as the submersible approaches them. Another large entity moves close to the submersible and its tentacle-like structures protruding from its surface then rapidly grow and attempt to wrap around and capture the submersible. Through a quick escape maneuver, the submersible escapes unscathed.</p>
<p><strong>04:10~05:12</strong> At a depth of roughly 10m, a large number of tiny black oil droplet-like spherical entities are observed floating in the water. The entities appear to have the ability to move on their own through a pulsing motion akin to a jellyfish. They remain stationary in the absence of disturbance but actively evade the submersible when the latter comes close to them.</p>
<p><strong>05:12~06:58</strong> The submersible continues to dive and the number and size of the observed oil droplets gradually increase with depth. At 12m, several necklace-like structures consisting of 4-7 interconnected oil droplets are observed wriggling in the water.</p>
<p><strong>06:58~07:10</strong> A fish-like entity of about 2m in length appears in the field of vision. All the tissues on its back and tail are seen sloughing off as the submersible approaches, leaving only the skeleton connected by black fibrous material still swimming – several small black oil droplets continue to separate from the fibrous materials with every movement. The remaining tissues of the front half of the entity are completely covered by a large amount of black substances, forming ribbon-like, tentacle-like, and wheel-like large structures on the skin; some of the tissues around the eyes are detached and the skeleton is exposed. During swimming, the black material on its body surface continuously releases the black oil droplets of various sizes to the environment.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="emerging-from-the-broken-2.png" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6217/emerging-from-the-broken-2.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A still frame at 18:52 (top) and the same frame after adjusting the exposure (bottom). Black fibrous structures and the large mechanical-like entity can be seen in the upper right corner of the frame.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>07:10~09:20</strong> The submersible descends to a depth of about 18m and observes a school of fish swimming in the distance. All the individuals in the school are covered with black material and have a large number of forked tentacles and sarcoma-like structures extending outward from their bodies. Two entities observed appear to be only fish skeletons connected by black fibers. One of the entities suddenly stops moving after swimming for a few seconds and the black fibers attached to the skeleton break apart into droplets - followed by the skeleton breaking up and sinking deeper.</p>
<p><strong>09:20~14:13</strong> The submersible continues to dive to a depth of about 30m. No fish are seen below a depth of about 20m, but the number of black oil droplets observed increases considerably and individuals with a diameter of about 10 cm begin to appear. Necklace-like structures consisting of multiple (&gt;50) droplet entities are observed at a depth of about 30m, extending upward from the deeper area and twisting and oscillating in the water. Their lengths range from about 5 to 20 m.</p>
<p><strong>14:13~15:02</strong> The submersible accidentally makes contact with a chain-like structure, which quickly wraps around the surface of the submersible attempting to damage it. Despite successfully escaping through standard evasive maneuvers, the submersible's surfacing system is damaged irreparably; the submersible, as a result, is deemed irrecoverable from this point on.</p>
<p><strong>15:02~17:10</strong> The submersible sinks naturally to a water depth of approximately 40m. With the help of its illumination lamp, an unidentified giant entity with a roughly cylindrical shape is observed swimming below the submersible from the deeper area, with an estimated cross-sectional diameter of about 5m and a length of about 20m. The surface features of the entity resemble complex mechanical and fractal structures, although the specific structural details could not be captured due to the low transparency of the water and the limited lighting conditions.</p>
<p><strong>17:10~19:32</strong> The submersible sinks to a water depth of 50m. A large number of complex net-like structures formed by intricate necklace-like structures are observed filling the area below this depth. Droplet entities of varying sizes are continuously dislodged from each net and swim into the holes of other nets, integrating themselves within the new structure after a short period of time. The camera captures a cumulative total of three similar giant, cylindrical entities swimming far in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>19:32~19:40</strong> The submersible sinks into a net of necklace structures and is rapidly and completely enveloped. The camera frame changes to total blackness and, a few seconds later, the submersible loses its signal.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>Five days after his initial interview, Site-6217 medical staff conducted a thorough physical examination of PoI-662164, finding that the internal structure of his body had completely changed in composition. All of his original nerves, blood vessels, and other tissues had been replaced completely by different tissues formed out of SCP-6217-B substances and his organs had transformed completely into structures never before seen.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following the physical examination, PoI-662164 began entering frequent states of mania, stopped communicating with others, and attempted several times to escape from his containment room. Following his attempts to breach containment, Site-6217 staff began keeping records of all events involving PoI-662164 trying to harm guards, doctors, staff members, and researchers. Six days after his physical examination, incident 6217-20100831A occurred and the recording was entered into this file:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>00:00~01:42</strong> PoI-662164 walked to the center of the room, looked up, and stared into the camera. A black, fibrous material extended out of PoI-662164 and began writhing in the air, covering his whole body except for his face.</p>
<p><strong>01:42~02:12</strong> PoI-662164 kept a standing pose and stared at the camera for 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>02:13~05:22</strong> PoI-662164's body suddenly shattered and collapsed. The fragmentation process produced a large number of black spherical droplets of varying sizes that fell to the ground and rolled outward with a relatively large aggregation of black droplets presented at PoI-662164's standing position. The nearby droplets then recoiled and slowly clustered toward that aggregate and merged together.</p>
<p><strong>05:23~05:48</strong> The black droplet aggregate began to shake and deform, shifting its appearance between multiple forms rapidly - several new, complicated structures could be seen forming on the surface of the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>05:48~05:55</strong> The amorphous aggregate forms into a singular entity with an appearance similar to [REDACTED]. A large number of rotating, gear-like structures can be seen on its surface, interconnected by encircling fibrous structures.</p>
<p><strong>05:56~06:32</strong> The black entity suddenly breaks through the door of the containment room at an accelerated speed before changing its appearance into another form, that of [REDACTED].</p>
<p><strong>06:33~07:32</strong> The disc-like structure on the entity's surface rotates at high speed, driving its thousands of tree-like cable structures to move. The entity quickly entangles the two guards standing right outside the chamber door and binds them inside its mass of curled, tentacle-like structures.</p>
<p><strong>07:33~12:44</strong> The entity captures twelve more people in the corridor and lobby of Site-6217 in a similar way as before. Eventually, the entity breaks through the Site-6217 doors with the victims bound by its tentacle-like branches and moves towards New Stony Lake with great speed.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterward:</strong> The 15 individuals involved in the accident have been presumed lost to the entity. After the accident, Site-6217 modified the admission rules to allow the release of all SCP-6217-A-1 individuals exhibiting significant symptoms given that they will not leave Location-6217 in order to prevent additional loss of life of Foundation personnel.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>SCP-6217-B refers to a class of complicated substances based on iron-sulfur cluster compounds, which are naturally found exclusively within New Stony Lake and have currently been identified as the main source of the black coloration of New Stony Lake water. Derivative substances of SCP-6217-B have been found in body tissues, fibrous structures on the skin, secretions, and excretions of SCP-6217-A-1 individuals. As well, SCP-6217-A-1 entities have been found to produce samples of SCP-6217-B. Experiments at Site-6217 have also confirmed that the SCP-6217-A infection is caused directly by contact exposure to any SCP-6217-B substance, i.e., SCP-6217-B substances are the pathogen of SCP-6217-A.</p>
<p>Theoretically, SCP-6217-B substances are not thermodynamically stable and cannot exist outside of a vacuum environment. Therefore, their presence itself within Location-6217 is considered an anomalous phenomenon. Under natural conditions, SCP-6217-B substances have an intrinsic tendency to spontaneously aggregate and assemble into larger specific structures.</p>
<p>The corresponding substances/aggregates/objects have been designates as SCP-6217-B-1 to SCP-6217-B-4, respectively, based on their different levels of assembly. The theorized final assembly level has been designated as SCP-6217-B-5, although it is still unclear whether SCP-6217-B-5 exists and what its nature is.</p>
<p>The following documents show a series of studies on SCP-6217-B conducted by Site-6217’s former principal researcher, Dr. Alexander Chugaev.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6217-B-1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6217-B-1 refers to the basic, and most prevalent components of SCP-6217-B, which are chain-like polymers of different sizes and molecular weights formed by several iron-sulfur atom clusters. These substances are soluble in water and are considered the underlying cause of the rusty-brown color of the water in New Stony Lake.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="emerging-from-the-broken-3_.png" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6217/emerging-from-the-broken-3_.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Schematic illustration of the primary structure of SCP-6217-B-1. The red, yellow, grey and violet spheres represent oxygen, sulfur, iron, and potassium atoms, respectively.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The basic structural unit of SCP-6217-B-1 substances is an [Fe<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub>] cluster structure. The atomic clusters are connected to each other by sulfur atoms, forming chain-like multimers of different sizes and charges.</p>
<p>Each cluster unit is surrounded by four different small molecules attached to the iron atoms, which are treated as ligands. The SCP-6217-B-1 compound with water molecules in the place of all ligand binding sites is referred to as the primary SCP-6217-B-1 compound.</p>
<p>Other small molecules, such as amino acids, can also replace the water molecules and function as ligands on SCP-6217-B-1 substances. The oxidation state of the iron atoms in the atomic cluster may also change, which will lead to a change in the overall charge of SCP-6217-B-1 molecules. This change often triggers the spontaneous folding of the parent SCP-6217-B-1 to form various SCP-6217-B-2 aggregates of different sizes and functions.</p>
<p>SCP-6217-B-1 is following a completely different set of chemical laws compared with the usual iron compounds. Theoretical calculations based on the normal chemistry of iron and sulfur show that these compounds are not supposed to be thermodynamically stable, especially not in the presence of oxygen. Other characterization results imply that the forces between the atoms have been changed.</p>
<p>It is impossible to synthesize any SCP-6217-B-1 compounds with "normal" iron- and sulfur-containing precursors obtained outside Location-6217. However, if these normal iron- and sulfur-containing materials are mixed with the anomalous compounds, their tendency to spontaneously assemble into SCP-6217-B-1 will rise significantly. They can also continue to pass on this anomalous property to other normal iron and sulfur atoms upon contact.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> SCP-6217-B-1 is one of the most unique anomalies I have ever encountered at the Foundation. The assembly of these atoms, rather than describing it as a result of thermodynamics or chemistry, is much more similar to a deliberately built sculpture. Yet, even as sculptures, they should not be able to stand.</p>
<p>As I work more with these compounds, I question if the atoms in these substances are even remotely like those I have worked with previously. It’s as if they are no longer iron and sulphur atoms - as if they no longer belong to their original elements and something has changed them and transformed them into something else completely.</p>
<p>This isn’t even to mention that they are actually able to infect ‘normal’ atoms through what I can only assume are their electrons. As soon as the normal atoms ‘touched’ those infected by SCP-6217, they lost their original chemical properties and spontaneously assembled into SCP-6217-B-1. It feels like a zombie crisis at the atomic level.</p>
<p>If these abnormal substances are allowed out of Location-6217, I am afraid that it will definitely trigger catastrophic consequences for life as humans have come to know it. Until further work can be done on these substances, I am declaring Location-6217 to be a quarantine zone with no samples out of Site-6217.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6217-B-2</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6217-B-2 is a kind of molecular aggregate based on iron-sulphur clusters that behave similar to molecular machines, such as molecular motors and bearings capable of performing a series of complex functions. SCP-6217-B-2 samples are found abundantly in the lake water of New Stony Lake. Under suitable conditions, different SCP-6217-B-2 instances will spontaneously aggregate further to form vesicle-like structures known as SCP-6217-B-3.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Structural model of an SCP-6217-B-2 nanomotor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-6217-B-2 entities form various different structures and utilize energy from different sources as the driving force of their motion. Depending on their structure, SCP-6217-B-2 instances can catalyze a variety of energy-releasing redox reactions and use the chemical energy for their own motion. Additionally, all SCP-6217-B-2 instances can use the current generated by light as an available source of energy.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of SCP-6217-B-2 instances with different structures and functions have been identified, and the detailed structures of most of them are still unknown. A few kinds of SCP-6217-B-2 have been structurally analyzed with X-ray diffraction and other characterization methods, which have confirmed that SCP-6217-B-2 instances are formed through the folding of SCP-6217-B-1 substances. As well, the exact folding mode of the SCP-6217-B-1 compounds depends on their charge and the type of ligands on their surface, which lead to the formation of different SCP-6217-B-2 structures and functions.</p>
<p>Despite this, the experimental and observational results are still contrary to the theoretical prediction (i.e. the folding patterns of SCP-6217-B-2 are not in accordance with the theoretical predictions). Simulations have also failed to reproduce their observed motions, which may indicate that further investigation of the underlying physical mechanisms of motion is needed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> If SCP-6217-B-1 can be regarded as analogs of amino acids and peptides, SCP-6217-B-2 can then be seen as the counterparts of proteins.</p>
<p>The way of folding from SCP-6217-B-1 to SCP-6217-B-2 reminded me today of Chinese and Japanese origami. The same simple piece of paper can have different shapes, functions, and movements if you fold it in different forms. But some origami structures, such as a paper spring that is pressed tightly, are not that stable and can only keep that shape if you press them with your hand.</p>
<p>The structure of many SCP-6217-B-2 instances roughly give me the feeling that something keeps holding them in their present shape and controls their movement like controlling marionettes. It is my intent to find this entity.</p>
<p>I don't know why. I shouldn't have such an attitude towards these molecular structure models. But ever since I arrived at Site-6217 I've had a … lingering fear in the back of my mind when I look at these structures.</p>
<p>It makes it hard to think clearly and rationally. Maybe it’s a mental influence, a cognitive hazard, or something else. I don't know. But these things in my lab … they lack the vitality of life. My instincts are keeping me away from them.</p>
<p>In my fear I had conceived of these atoms as dead. As empty shells, lacking a tangible feeling. They were no longer iron or sulfur atoms; something had killed them and was manipulating them. They had become corpses to me, corpses sewn together by some unknown, uncaring force.</p>
<p>The structures of SCP-6217-B-2 are Frankenstein's monsters made up of tens of thousands of corpses. They seem to be driven solely by the hunger for energy, unsatisfactorily devouring it voraciously from the outside world and then using it in their own twisted actions and, in the process, damning other matter to their same merciless fate.</p>

<p>Aggregating SCP-6217-B-3 entities with the size of 100~600μm viewed through an optical microscope.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6217-B-3</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6217-B-3 refers to a collection of vesicle-like structures of varying sizes formed by the spontaneous aggregation of SCP-6217-B-2 instances. SCP-6217-3 entities generally appear as black circular droplets ranging in size from 5 μm to 10 cm and contain a variety of SCP-6217-B-2 with different functions working together.</p>
<p>SCP-6217-B-3 entities behave similarly to organics-based cells in that they have the ability to act autonomously and can ingest similarly composed matter from the surrounding environment for their own growth. An SCP-6217-B-3 entity often contains multiple energy-harvesting SCP-6217-B-2 individuals within it, which makes SCP-6217-B-3 extremely efficient at utilizing energy from iron and sulfur sources as operational power. (<strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> They are feeding on themselves and the earth. Their hunger may never end on this planet of silica.)</p>
<p>Under high concentrations, SCP-6217-B-3 tends to aggregate spontaneously to form necklace-like SCP-6217-B-4 structures, as well as more complicated SCP-6217-B-4 aggregates.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> I watch them flagellate in the Petri dishes, feasting on each other and whatever iron and minerals they can reach. But they are not without intention.</p>
<p>It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. They seem to be— well, to be thinking. Together. And speaking. As I look down through my microscope I can feel them looking back up at me. Urging me to feed them. Something. Anything. I deposited a handful of soil and a nail into their beaker today and, for a moment it stopped. They tore through both like a swarm of rabid piranha and left me with silence for the following hour.</p>
<p>Maybe some new containment measures are required.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6217-B-4</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6217-B-4 refers to structures formed by the spontaneous aggregation of SCP-6217-B-3, which are extremely complex and diverse in shape. The most common structures of SCP-6217-B-4 are the tree- and necklace-shaped entities, which are considered as the primary form of SCP-6217-B-4.</p>
<p>The vast majority of SCP-6217-B-4 with complicated shapes have partially mechanical-like characteristics; their structures often contain parts that are similar in shape and structure to mechanical designs, such as gears, hydraulic pistons, axles, and electrical circuits.</p>
<p>SCP-6217-B-4 entities can be classified into different types based on their internal structure, similar to multicellular organisms. SCP-6217-B-4 entities are typically able to deform and move autonomously, and they are aggressive towards entities and objects containing iron- and sulfur-based materials. As well, SCP-6217-B-4 will attack regular creatures, resulting in them becoming infected with SCP-6217-A. (<strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> SCP-6217-B-4 entities appear to be attracted to human blood and will enter a frenzy when blood is entered into their immediate environment. It is presumed that this is because of the iron in our hemoglobin, but this is yet to be tested thoroughly.)</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, different SCP-6217-B-4 instances will further merge and assemble into more complex SCP-6217-B-4 entities. The largest known SCP-6217-B-4 entity is a massive, reticulated structure found at the bottom of New Stony Lake.</p>
<p>It is assumed that infecting organisms with SCP-6217-A is an important way for SCP-6217-B-4 to reproduce. SCP-6217-B can also obtain the energy necessary for their growth and activity by oxidizing organic components of the organic tissues of the host.</p>
<p>When a sample of SCP-6217-B-4 comes into contact with an organism, it will release some of its SCP-6217-B-2 instances into the body of the host and will rapidly infect the organism, turning it into an instance of SCP-6217-A-1. When infected by these SCP-6217-B-2 instances, the SCP-6217-A-1 will seek and ingest large amounts of iron and sulfur to synthesize more SCP-6217-B-2. The newly generated SCP-6217-B-2 will then combine to form SCP-6217-B-3 instances, which will undergo further aggregation to form new tissue-like SCP-6217-B-4 and replace the host's original body tissues.</p>
<p>The newly generated SCP-6217-B-4, capable of replacing the original body organs of the host, often have different structures and operating mechanisms from the original biological organs, mimicking various mechanical devices instead of organ systems. In one occurrence, a human heart was replaced by a mechanical membrane pump, nerve tissues were replaced by a wire-like system, and a brain was replaced by a modular structure similar in principle to an electronic computer motherboard assembled with various accessories.</p>
<p>When the SCP-6217-A-1 instance enters its final stage of infection by SCP-6217-B-4, they will become compelled to enter into New Stony Lake. Once they reach the water, SCP-6217-B substances will be released into the lake, completing the reproduction process of SCP-6217-B-4. This pathway is currently speculated to be one of the main sources of SCP-6217-B within New Stony Lake.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> It seems that SCP-6217-B bears similarity to parasitic wasps and parasitic fungi, laying their eggs or spores inside their hosts, manipulating their hosts to find nutrients and a suitable environment for their descendants, and finally killing the hosts and releasing the new entities. Once infected, the hosts are not of their own free will and are obedient entirely to the infection. And yet, [PoI-662164] resisted. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>Unlike the other SCP-6217-B entities, I am left with nothing but emptiness looking at the samples of SCP-6217-B-4. No matter how much I feed them, no matter <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">who</span> what I feed them, they behave as soulless machines, working to consume and infect and nothing more. Like everything they do follows a command written long ago, telling them to do this. Telling them to reproduce, to attack, to go back to the lake, to bond with others of their kind.</p>
<p>The creatures manipulated by them see the lake as their home and fall into the water, one after another. Something in the lake is calling them, and I'm afraid it's not some monster, but— instructions. Instructions buried deep in the tiniest mechanical structures of these entities. Their own mechanical structures command them to return to the lake, it's part of them, it's themselves. They cannot resist, they will not resist. And once you become them, it’s part of you too.</p>
<p>But, why?</p>

SCP-6217-B-5 is suspected to be related to the "giant black entity at the bottom of the lake" described by several human SCP-6217-A-1 instances as appearing in their dreams.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject Name:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Michael Christensen</span> PoI-678142</p>
<p><strong>Subject Identifiers:</strong> Male, 43-years-old, medical history unknown, blood type unknown</p>
<p><strong>Subject History:</strong> Initial physical examination showed that, at the time of his discovery, PoI-678142 had only 0.6% of his body tissue replaced by SCP-6217-B and was in the early stages of disease progression. Background investigation into his history revealed that PoI-678142 was a former member of GoI-004A "Broken Church." PoI-678142 was asked about SCP-6217-A and SCP-6217-B due to their similarity to other anomalies associated with the Church of the Broken God.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Good afternoon, [PoI-678142]. I hope you are settling well into your new life here. We would like some information from you —</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> No need for formalities, jailer. I was once an academic man like you, so ask your questions and spread our history through your records.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Our previous investigation revealed that you were a member of the Broken Church. The entities we have found [in Location-6217] are remarkably similar to the church’s style. So when we found <em>you</em> lurking around— I think you can see where this is going.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> I admit that the lake does have some relevance to the Church of the Broken God, but not the Broken Church. It’s <em>us</em>, my mentors.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Sorry, what does this mean? Aren’t you a Broken Church member?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> To be honest, I left the Broken Church years ago. I am still retaining my devotion to the Broken God, but after witnessing <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/twistedgears-kaktus-proposal" target="_blank" target="_blank">how our attempts to resurrect God have failed</a>, my faith in the old church had begun to waver. I couldn't understand why this was happening. That is, until my mentors came along and helped me clarify the path.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:200px;"><img alt="sanctuary-of-the-holistic.png" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6217/sanctuary-of-the-holistic.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Emblem found on the walls in the factories, believed to be relevant to the previously unknown church mentioned here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Your mentors? Are you saying that there are other followers of the Broken God here?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> About a year ago, they appeared out of nowhere in this town and established a sect by the lake. You should know about it, it's the factories you see there. They approached me and a few other members of the Church of the Broken God who lived nearby and asked us for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Of course we made note of the factories. They’re nothing but some old, run-down, chemical plants located near the lake. They’ve been checked and—</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> You could not be more wrong, jailer. Those buildings are not common factories. Sure, that’s how they started, but for most of their life, they were places of divine worship.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> So what did they say to you?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> They have developed a new belief about the God of Brokenness that is very inspiring to me. I've been thinking about the problem that we've always understood the Broken God as a combination of mechanics, but nothing that has been attempted has been successful.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Those people seem to have left the Broken Church as well as several other branches since the catastrophe of 1945. They told us that we chose a … wrong path before. We seem to be moving farther and farther away from the nature of God.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> 1945 — okay, this looks like something that is beyond my clearance, but never mind. So, you are saying that they are a new church different from the previous three churches.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> That's right. They criticize the old church's view. The Broken Church and the Cogwork Orthodox Church have been working to resurrect God with machinery, but no one had ever defined what machinery is. Mekhane is a… too formalistic understanding. Maxwellism … According to the mentors, WAN is the closest form to the essence of God, but is still only a facet of Him and fails to touch the nature of God.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> What <em>is</em> the nature of the Broken God, then?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> It's something more essential. We can call gears, tracks, bearings and balls mechanical, but that does not cover the full spectrum of the word's meaning. From the smallest atoms and molecules to the largest planets and universes, all of them are in mechanical motion. The God of Brokenness is the master of it all, the will of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Quite a novel theory. Well, I've never heard any members of the Church of the Broken God talk about it, which is interesting. So, you've invested in their faith instead.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> I should say … for myself, that is true. But they didn't take us with them before they left. Faith is only a necessary form to reach the ultimate goal … They said they would return one day and become one with us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Leave? Becoming one? Sorry, I think we're going too fast, can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> After their arrival, they had used the factories to produce all kinds of parts for their rituals. They were driven out and dumped everything directly into the lake.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Hold on a second. So this lake was polluted by that church?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> You call it pollution; they call it spreading the Broken God’s influence. The iron and sulphur of the earth and lake were just waiting to be actualized by the church and all it took was a few rituals before life began to proliferate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> So you are joining in this too.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Not exactly. But what I know is, as one night, lightning shot forth from the cloudless sky and struck the middle of the lake during a ritual. Just as <a href="scp-2217.html">The Book of Rites</a> stated, lightning is the hammer of God, and this phenomenon, we believe, is His will. The Holos Field was created.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> What is a Holos Field?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> The electromagnetic field of God, the glue used to connect all beings in the world, the loving touch of the hands of the Broken One. He would reach into our world through the power of the ‘Holos Field’ to reshape the very atoms into brick and mortar.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Are you saying that this anomaly is an electromagnetic field? It caused the formation of this strange disease?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Yes, and no. It is the electromagnetic field that created the new form of life of the Broken God. But jailer, you do not understand. It is not a disease. It is symbiosis. We are the same, us and them. Just as we always have been.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> So they — no, what is your purpose in doing this? Most of your people have disappeared-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> We never disappear, jailer. We just change form.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> And what exactly are you changing form into? People are missing. Their bodies collapsing into black droplets. I don't really think there is any doubt that this is death in the physiological sense.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> The world does not care what you believe and what you doubt. We have received true revelation from the words of the Broken God. There is only one way to truly restore the Broken God, and that is to integrate all of ourselves into Him. We are the parts. When all physical bodies of life are put together into a new body, and all the souls become one, the divinity of the Broken God will be revealed. Each of us will share in His divinity and become a part of Him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> So what's happening here is that you're trying to build what you call a broken god, by killing everyone and turning them into slimy black liquid robots? Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> No, jailer. It is not <em>us</em> doing this, it is the will of God Himself. He is constructing his own incarnation and bringing us to the ultimate state of union. The fragments are assembling spontaneously. This lake is to become the primordial soup of the Broken God’s light.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> But why are you so sure that it's the Broken God and not something else — you know, the Cogwork Orthodox Church had also encountered a <a href="scp-3179.html">monster disguised as the Broken God</a>, and now there's nothing but black mud in this lake. Maybe there <em>is</em> no such thing as a Broken God.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Although He has not yet been born in this world, He has appeared in the dreams of each of us in the spiritual world of the followers, extending an invitation to us. He stands in the middle of the foggy lake, and anyone who knows anything about the Broken God will not doubt after seeing Him - He is the real God of Brokenness. Each of us is sharing in the love and gifts of Him. He is guiding us on the path to becoming God. He is returning to the world, and this time, each of us will be His parts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> I know very well. Those things don't have any feelings, they are like puppets on strings manipulated by something, just carrying out some fixed instructions. Would you rather become like this and follow the god you speak of? This is not in line with the teachings of any of your old churches, this is … imprisoning your souls.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Creatures are never free, jailer. Each of us fights for instincts. What you think is free will is nothing more than an instinct engraved in your selfish genes. If you want to gain true freedom, you should choose to join us, to become part of the Broken God, to become part of the will of nature, to put yourself into the movement of everything in the world, from the largest star to the smallest dust.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> It is impossible to stop this process. The will of the God of Brokenness will spread throughout the world with the winds, the rivers, the circulation of matter, and the movement of the atmosphere. When the stars shine, He will return to His earth, so that all beings will share in His divinity in the ultimate union, becoming Him, becoming God — <em>(The screech of a chair sliding backward and PoI-678142 standing up quickly are audible)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Please sit down, I have a few—</p>
<p><strong>PoI-678142:</strong> Remember this, jailer. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/twistedgears-kaktus-proposal" target="_blank" target="_blank">Apart, we are Broken. United, we are God.</a></p>

<p>Fields of a positive point charge. SCP-6217 functions in the same pattern.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6217</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6217 is an anomalous electromagnetic field occurring at the atomic and molecular scales known by members of the Church of the Broken God under the name of “the Holos Field.”</p>
<p>SCP-6217 is close to the electromagnetic field produced by point charges, and is able to superimpose itself upon the original electric field of an affected iron atom nucleus, causing a change in the nucleus's ability to bind electrons naturally inside the atom.</p>
<p>The occurrence of SCP-6217 leads to an increase in electronegativity and electron-withdrawing ability of the iron atom, enhancing the affinity of iron atoms for sulfur atoms and the strength of Fe-Fe and Fe-S chemical bonds. New weak interactions between the affected iron atoms will also occur as a result of the anomalous effect.</p>
<p>The anomalous effect of SCP-6217 stabilizes the structure and folding of SCP-6217-B substances, and thus provides a basis for the existence of complex chemical systems and even rudimentary life forms based on iron-sulfur clusters. Therefore, it is theorized that SCP-6217 is the basis for the existence of SCP-6217-A and SCP-6217-B.</p>
<p>SCP-6217 is infectious between iron atoms. When an unaffected atom gets within 5 angstroms<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> of an SCP-6217 affected iron atom, it may be assimilated by SCP-6217 and transformed into an anomalous iron atom. Spread of anomalous iron atoms is expected to lead to an increase in the range of SCP-6217’s effects until the entire planet is under the influence of SCP-6217. As of yet, there is still no effective way to interrupt this process.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Researcher’s note:</strong> I awoke in the middle of the night last night with an idea. If we add a positive electric field to the atomic structure of iron that emanates outward from the nucleus — in other words, slightly increase the electronegativity of iron — we could stop SCP-6217 in its tracks.</p>
<p>After making some corrections to our calculations, I was able to match our experimental results of the SCP-6217 phenomenon with the simulation. If my calculations are indeed correct, even the slightest change to their structure could cause a complete collapse of the chemical basis on which the entire SCP-6217-B is maintained.</p>
<p>The Broken God or not, something really is manipulating these atoms to make them act like this. It’s making machinery out of the very earth and writing its designs into our universe through this almost mechanical structure.</p>

<p>But that’s alright, not everyone can be good at mathematics. Instead, I’ve sent him off to the medical ward to conduct brain scans of those affected. Next week we start doing open-brain scans, so we are hopeful of results then.</p>

<p>March Report</p>
</div>
<p>A staff member of Site-6217 was infected. He was never in contact with any SCP-6217-related materials.</p>
<p>This is really strange. What I am afraid of is that … If these ashes and dust containing anomalous iron atoms can spread SCP-6217 …</p>
<p>Hope that this is just an isolated case, but I just couldn’t stop worrying.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the three closest towns to Location-6217 are considered affected seriously by SCP-6217. All organisms left are transformed to SCP-6217-A-1. 3 humanoid SCP-6217-A-1 entities in their final phase of infection were observed.<br/>
<br/>
A proposal to enlarge the range of Location-6217 to cover these towns has been approved by the Overseer Council. Effective immediately. Total number of towns in Location-6217 increased to 10.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A research article published on <em>Journal of the American Chemistry Society</em> reported the unusual chemical behaviors of iron ore samples collected in Ohio. The article has been retracted under the covery story of data misuse. 1 author of the article has been diagnosed SCP-6217-A.<br/>

<p>July Report</p>
</div>
<p>After years recording them, I saw it finally with my own eyes a week ago. The black figure. I feel like it is a giant black hole, absorbing the souls and wills of all life without satisfaction. I can see that behind it is the one controlling all the aimless mechanical black marionettes.</p>
<p>Yesterday I accidentally cut my hand during the experiment. No pain, No blood. I could clearly see something under my skin, not veins, but … wires. I tried to get a bandage from the drawer, and as I obtained it, the wound became bloody again. Today, the wound vanished, as if it had never occurred.</p>
<p>Am I hallucinating? I’ve been working continuously for like four days without sleep. I cannot even feel sleepy. Maybe it is time to have a rest.</p>

<p>September Report II</p>
</div>
<p>All contact with the Foundation has been lost. No more updates. We have been isolated. I have activated the distress beacon, hope that works.</p>
<p>More than four-fifths of staff members are diagnosed SCP-6217-A. John is one of them, me too. Now it is almost impossible for us to leave this cursed place … and we are likely to die here, am I right? I am feeling fog in my brain, as if something is controlling my motion.</p>
<p>John reported yesterday that he had dreamt about the black figure and asked to talk to a psychologist. I pretended to reassure him that that was perfectly fine as I’ve been having dreams since July, but … well. Both of us know what this means.</p>
<p>Strangely, I did not feel very upset, as if I had been asked not to do so … Well… now that I have no choice, I’ll be here, working on it.</p>

<p>December Report I</p>
</div>
<p>The final living staff died of starvation this week. Frankly, I hadn’t even noticed that we had run out of food at all. In fact, I haven’t left my office in months. I must have been eating something, I don’t know what … but almost all steel things in my living room have gone.</p>
<p>I have no idea what I have done during the previous days, as if I was acting autonomously, without any memories and emotions.</p>
<p>Am I becoming a robot? Like what is hidden under my skin?</p>
<p>John also has been lost to the infection completely. In his last days he was just repeatedly saying nonsense like a broken record. His voice cracked and gargled with each dry breath he took. I asked him about his family, he did not give me any answers that make sense. I guess this is also what I will be.</p>
<p>I really don't want to.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Undated report</p>
</div>
<p>What is the date today? I feel like I have been sitting here for like more than one month without any memory. I stared at the photo on my desk for like an hour, trying to recall who they are. Damn it, they are my family. Why am I forgetting about this?</p>
<p>What have I done during the past days?</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>Am I a robot? Am I a human — no, I am still a human. See, I am still thinking, remembering, I am still feeling the emotions.</p>
<p>I am Alexander Chugaev. Head of research at Site-120.</p>

<p>Undated report</p>
</div>
<p>I've been dreaming the black … figure, for months. I feel like He is saying something to me but I cannot hear it clearly.</p>
<p>I must escape - I want to escape but I simply can't. I can feel that every time I step forward, I am losing my free will.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Maybe being a robot won't make much difference</span> No … This is impossible. I am still a human, I have the right to change my life, I'm not just gears and wheels controlled by someone else, right?</p>

<p>The calculations finally make sense. He explained them to me. It is not the calculations or atoms that are wrong, it is the rest of the world. Nature rips at the universal code and pieces it together without intent.

<p>The black figure is calling me. He is asking me to go to the lakeshore factories. It is the goddamn factories.</p>
<p>I must go there. I need to ask them why, what and when.</p>
<p>I must show him that I am still a human, I will never be a robot.</p>

<p>The following content was recovered from a portable recording device left in the office of Dr. Alexander Chugaev. The voice of his interlocutor is close to an electronically synthesized voice and lacks intonation, and his vocal characteristics are difficult to identify. More information about the previously unknown branch of the Broken God Church mentioned in the log, known as GoI-004D "Sanctuary of the Holistic", is still under investigation.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Who summoned the Broken God.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> You belong to the fourth church of the Broken God.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Correct. We are the Sanctuary of the Holistic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Why are you doing this? Why are you killing people with the black mud? Why are you summoning your so-called Broken God? None of this seems right.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> We left the old churches dozens of years ago. They are seeking to restore God, but they are stuck with God Himself in various forms. If they go one step further, they will discover His nature — union, orderliness, emergence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> So why is this related to the figure on the lake – what is in the lake?</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> The incarnation of God. Like Mekhane or WAN, they are indeed the Broken God, but not the only side of Him. But, He will need this body to come back into the world. Everything that happens in the lake is just a replay of the evolution of life, the self-assembly of the Broken God, helping all life to arrive at the pole of evolution — the ultimate connection He represents.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Now it is not yet developed; they are still separate pieces, just like everything else in the world, and have not yet reached the final union. But they are messengers. They will guide every soul in the world to the road of union.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Now let me ask you – what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Why are you still hesitant to join the great work?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Because I am a human, I'm not a robot. even though … I know my body has become this way, at least I'm still … I'm still alive, I can still sense, I can still think, I can still decide what I'm going to do next — I still have free will.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Free will — Ah … I see, so that's it. You still believe in the existence of free will. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Why not? It's the only thing left to define me as a human. My physical body is gradually becoming mechanical. I still believe I am a human because of my free will.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> So, you think you're not mechanical? Free will is an illusion. Your consciousness is built on top of the matter. Consciousness is the electrical and chemical signals in your neurons, the sodium and potassium ion channels, the synaptic receptors, the neurotransmitters, all of which are just delicate molecular machines. Emotions can be constructed by logical circuits and electrical signals, and memories can be implanted. You should know that much better than me, jailer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> No, machines can only behave according to their specifications, unlike life. They will never be the subject. They are just the object. I clearly know what I am losing and what differences exist between humans and robots, I don't need you — or any others — to tell me about that. I will try my best to protect my humanity. My soul is still holding me up.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Life? Organisms are also combinations of molecular mechanical parts. It is the Broken God who guided the formation and evolution of life, and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-mekhanozoic-era" target="_blank" target="_blank">you can see His figure behind every step of the evolution</a>. Machinery and mechanical laws have dominated all organisms since the moment of their origin.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> You want to talk to me about mechanical determinism? I'm sorry, I can not agree with this ridiculous theory. Quantum mechanics has long proven the existence of randomness, or at least I don't think everything we have is something that was shaped like machinery at the beginning of everything.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> So are you agreeing that everything about you is controlled by randomness? The collapse of the wave function, that's all your "humanity"? In the end, aren't you still governed by the so-called randomness? Is this <em>free</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> What … ? No, I am deciding it myself, not … <em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Don't forget that random events follow the laws of statistics, and the result of these statistics is the macroscopic world we are living in. This world is still governed by the mechanical law of cause and effect. Even the very fact that you are now thinking about free will is a result of the mechanical law of cause and effect. All things, your birth, your thinking about free will now, are all determined at the moment the universe was born.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> <em>(Trembling tone)</em> This … this could not be true … there will definitely be something that can break …</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> You are just still trying to escape from the truth. You know that it <em>is</em> true. You know it very well. Every evolution of life, from the primordial soup in the ocean to today, has been like this. Self-replication, ATP synthase, flagella, motor proteins. The mechanical movement of molecules creates mechanical structures, and mechanical structures create life. Each complexity of the system relies on the sophisticated cooperation of a large number of machines from which new properties emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> Well … in that case … life itself is mechanical?</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> Everything is mechanical. The universe itself is a precisely functioning mechanical assembly. This is the truth of the Broken God. It is the will of the organization of nature. He is the architect of all life. He allows life to develop in the way He envisions, and life runs according to the pre-determined program He sets.</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> The process of evolution is the process of emergence. The process of emergence is the process of mechanical assembly, which is the process of mechanization, which is the process of -</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Chugaev:</strong> … That is, the process of the Broken God reconstructing Himself?</p>
<p><strong>[Unknown]:</strong> You will figure it out by yourself.</p>
