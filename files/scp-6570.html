</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6570 is to be contained in a standardised Biohazard cell and should be accompanied by SCP-6570-1 whenever applicable. Staff that SCP-6570 is particularly fond of are encouraged to interact with it socially outside of medical examinations, on at least a weekly basis.</p>
<p>As of standard cross-containment policy, 24hr surveillance must be maintained on SCP-6570 and SCP-6570-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6570 is an amorphous mass comprised largely of muscle and flesh, covering an approximated 12m<sup>2</sup> area when stretched. X-rays have revealed bones and organs to be absent, aside from a single pair of lungs.</p>
<p>Despite this, SCP-6570 has demonstrated a limited degree of sentience and can recognise faces, retain memories of positive and negative stimuli, can perceive visual stimuli,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and is believed to enjoy social activities.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> SCP-6570 was initially reported to police by civilians off of a Rural roadway in Tasmania. Both witnesses received class-A Amnestics, with the cover story of an animal collision being provided.</p>
<p>Upon SCP-6570's recovery, blunt force trauma consistent with that of a vehicle impact was noticeable. After arrival at the nearest Site, medical teams were noted to have difficulty in treating its wounds, due to its unclear anatomical structure and unstable form.</p>
<p>After a recovery period of two weeks, SCP-6570 was deemed eligible for discharge and subsequentially transferred to a permanent containment cell, on the condition of bi-weekly check-ups for the foreseeable future</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1: Mild Fungal Infection:</strong> Approximately a week after SCP-6570's transfer, a fungal infection located in a wound site was recorded by Dr Blure. SCP-6570, while initially appearing to enjoy Dr Blure's presence, was notably hesitant in allowing antifungal treatment, recoiling from Blure after administering an IV.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1.1: Update:</strong> Upon a follow-up exam, SCP-6570's infection appeared to have lessened in the treated area, though was noted to have appeared around other wound sites, in addition to underneath skin folds.</p>
<p>Considering this, Dr Blure brought in the co-head, Dr Refles, to distract SCP-6570 while treatments were applied. Despite SCP-6570's attempts to play with Dr Refles being largely disregarded, the attention split allowed treatments to be applied much faster.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2: Medical Wing Transfer:</strong> In the weeks following its initial treatment, SCP-6570 has been moved back into the Medical Wing for staff's ease of access, considering the severity of its infection. At this time, 5 medical staff have been allocated to treat SCP-6570's condition.</p>
<p>Procedures will include, though are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tissue removal</li>
<li>Intravenous injections</li>
<li>Ultrasounds (if required)</li>
<li>Antifungal medication (<em>method of application to be at the medical head's discretion</em>)</li>
<li>Blood tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Dr Blure and Dr Refles will be present to distract SCP-6570 from treatments it would otherwise display distress in.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2.2: Update for Staff:</strong> Over the past few days, accounts from both Blure and Refles, in addition to medical staff, have that detailed SCP-6570 has begun to seek any attention possible.</p>
<p>Specifically, behaviours have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempts to move in front of the door when staff leave, especially in regards to staff it 'likes'.</li>
<li>Grasping staff's lab coats, or picking up (and typically hiding), medical equipment.</li>
<li>Pulling or dislodging syringes, bandages, or towels from itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly advised at this time that staff ignore these behaviours, rather than continuing to indulge them, as to not encourage SCP-6570 to engage further.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2.2: Declining Mood:</strong> In the days following the implementation of Addendum 2.2, SCP-6570 has become less enthusiastic in either Blure or Refles, and started to refrain from attempts to gain attention. This resulted in it beginning to 'sulk', and shift away from staff when attempts were made to play with it.</p>
<p>SCP-6570's mood did not improve over the next week, and upon being put under a respirator due to worsening conditions, largely ceased its efforts to play with the medical staff who applied treatment. It was also noticeably less interested in engaging with staff it typically 'likes'.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Dr Blure brought in an array of soft toys, after working hours, to initiate a play session. SCP-6570 remained largely unresponsive to Dr Blure, and started to return the toys<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> after a few moments of dejectedly examining them.</p>

<p>Morning,</p>
<p>Over the last week, I've been growing more concerned about SCP-6570's condition, it seems to be going downhill rather than up. Especially so now that it's refusing to engage us altogether, which has been, disheartening to watch.</p>
<p>Seeing as a referral of this nature requires both heads to approve, I want to ask if we delegate this case to the Ecology Branch, in addition to the medical. From prior research, they've handled cases that fall into our situation on medical treatments before, and I believe they'd at least be worth a try.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Morning,</p>
<p>I want to make it clear I'm hesitant on this. The Ecology Branch, and furthermore, whichever department takes this on will have full jurisdiction over further testing.</p>
<p>If they accept this application, we can't take it back. Are you really sure you want to go through with that?</p>

<hr/>
<p>Afternoon!</p>
<p>I received an application from the Ecology branch earlier today, regarding SCP-6570. Since both our departments got pinged on this matter, I believe it's necessary to start discussing the next course of action.</p>
<p>I would propose to cross-infect SCP-6570 with an anomalous strain of Mycelium. It is known for destroying most other forms of fungi it comes into contact with, however currently it's still under trial and may pose unforeseen risks.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Afternoon to you too!</p>
<p>In regards to our options, I'm inclined to disagree with utilising the synthesised strain, as we're not aware of its impact on an entity such as SCP-6570 at this time.</p>
<p>With that development in mind, however, I did find 5566-ENTO was used in the synthesis logs to clean fungal remnants from test rooms. For what we're dealing with, I believe utilising 5566-ENTO will be a less risky option for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

<p>Evening!</p>
<p>After re-reviewing the logs, and speaking with the synthesis head, I believe this will be our best route forward. If the need arises, all relevant information regarding 5566-ENTO can be pulled from witness testimonies.</p>
<p>With that said, since 5566-ENTO's history is locked to your department, I'll assume you'll be able to take the case from here.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Myceil</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>NOTICE ON UPDATED PROCEDURES REGARDING SCP-6570’s TREATMENT</span></h4>
<p>Morning all,</p>
<p>The application regarding SCP-6570 was forwarded to both the <em>Department of Mycology</em>, and the <em>Department of Entomology</em>. The Entomology Dept will take priority on updated procedures, with Mycology taking a secondary role.</p>
<p>Regarding this, SCP-6570 will be cross-contained with 5566-ENTO (which, for disclosure, is a <em>pill bug</em> measuring approximately 1m in length and 45cm in height) to assist Medical staff in cleaning exterior infections. 5566-ENTO will be introduced into SCP-6570's cell after it has been acclimatised to the conditions it will be working in.</p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 22/01/31, 11:15AM</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Two weeks after the time the email exchange occurred, 5566-ENTO was deemed adequately trained for use on SCP-6570. Medical staff tending to SCP-6570 were put on a momentary standby in an observation room, so 5566-ENTO could be introduced without distractions.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>11:15:</strong> <em>SCP-6570, while displaying little interest in personnel beforehand, visibly attempts to grab at staff members lab coats as they leave the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:17:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 slowly moves back towards its pillow after waiting at the door for approximately 1 minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:20:</strong> <em>Dr Blure opens the cell door with 5566-ENTO in tow, causing SCP-6570 to perk up as Blure leads the entity closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:21:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 examines 5566-ENTO before attempting to touch its shell, subsequently causing it to curl up.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:23:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO uncurls itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:24:</strong> <em>Dr Blure leads 5566-ENTO to a wound containing fungi, which it begins to clean on sight. SCP-6570 flinches and begins to try shifting away, before being soothed by Blure.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:30:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 hesitantly tries to touch 5566-ENTO, again, resulting in it curling itself again.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4.1: Outside Enrichment:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 28/01/31, 10:36AM</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Despite 5566-ENTO being less enthusiastic than expected after one week, SCP-6570’s condition had noticeably improved, warranting Dr Blure to propose allowing it an hour-long session in the Site’s garden. In addition, it was proposed that 5566-ENTO accompany SCP-6570, to see how they would interact with each other in a different setting.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>10:36:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 is moved into the garden. Upon touching the grass, it begins to slowly roll over to scratch its back.</em></p>
<p><strong>10:38:</strong> <em>Dr Blure enters with 5566-ENTO. Noticeably excited, SCP-6570 makes its way towards Dr Blure and pets 5566-ENTO’s shell. 5566-ENTO largely ignores SCP-6570 and brushes past it at a brisk pace.</em></p>
<p><strong>10:40:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO makes its way towards a lavender bush. It attempts to reach the decayed flowers underneath but is blocked by the foliage.</em></p>
<p><strong>10:40:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 lifts the brushes enough for 5566-ENTO to reach the flowers, which it promptly picks up and begins to eat. SCP-6570 attempts to pick up some of the dead foliage too, though 5566-ENTO quickly blocks it.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-6570's excitement visibility diminishes in moments following. Noticing this, Dr Blure picks some of the fresher flowers and gives them SCP-6570 to examine.</em></p>
<p><strong>10:43:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO begins moving to the next plant. SCP-6570 looks for a place to put the flowers down, Dr Blure goes to hold the flowers, and walks to the middle of the grass patch with them.</em></p>
<p>[ <em>5566-ENTO surveys the shrubs for the next 20 minutes. While SCP-6570 attempts to help find decayed foliage, its efforts are largely ignored, resulting in it becoming progressively less involved in 5566-ENTO's activities.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>11:03:</strong> <em>SCP-6570 makes its way back to Dr Blure, who returns the lavender flowers. SCP-6570 begins to dejectedly examine the flowers.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:05:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO, while appearing disinterested in SCP-6570 before this point, appears to take notice that SCP-6570 hasn’t started eating its flowers, prompting it to pick them up and walk them closer to it. Upon SCP-6570 still not consuming them, 5566-ENTO walked into the shrubs.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:10:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO returns carrying a twig, placing it next to SCP-6570. After approximately a minute of waiting, it walked back into the shrubbery.</em></p>
<p><strong>11:12:</strong> <em>Dr Refles briefly enters the garden, and finds 5566-ENTO attempting to pick up a rock. He gives it a soft animal toy, which 5566-ENTO quickly picks up, and brings back to SCP-6570.</em></p>
<p>[ <em>5566-ENTO emerges from a large bush and brings back the toy</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>11:14:</strong> <em>5566-ENTO waited for SCP-6570 to consume the toy, though after watching SCP-6570 play with it for a few moments, started to redirect its attention to play as well.</em></p>
<p>[ <em>For the remaining 22 minutes of the session, both entities were playing.</em> ]</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-6570 went to sleep shortly after being returned to its cell. After 5566-ENTO finished cleaning, staff noticed it showed little interest in leaving, instead bringing another soft toy to SCP-6570’s pillow, appearing to wait for it to wake up.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 4.2 Minor Procedure Changes:</strong> While treatment relevant for 5566-ENTO's involvement has been considered complete, it has been voted by the relevant staff<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> to remain in cross-containment with SCP-6570 indefinitely, after both entities were noted to grow an emotional attachment.</p>
<p>Notable behaviours indicating an attachment included, but were not limited to:</p>
<ul>
