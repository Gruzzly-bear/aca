            <h1>SCP-3453</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3453</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-3453 is assigned a storage container in Site-11.</span><br/>
Special Containment Procedures for SCP-3453 have yet to be finalized. Past containment attempts are detailed below. MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") is to focus on keeping SCP-3453 away from the public eye with an array of containment equipment developed by the SCP-3453 Research Team.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3453 is 250mL of orange juice that is in constant motion. While SCP-3453's movements are unpredictable it has always been observed as a continuous whole<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SCP-3453 was first discovered at Bridgewater Elementary in Idaho Falls, Idaho, where SCP-3453 ejected itself out of its container through a straw and into a student's face. SCP-3453 then moved erratically for 2 hours before going down a sewer drain. 623 individuals were amnesticized with Class C amnestics and 15 video recordings of SCP-3453 were confiscated. SCP-3453 was later contained and transferred to Site-11, where it remained in its containment chamber for 1 month and 46 hours before breaching containment.</p>
<p>Since then, SCP-3453 has consistently escaped every containment chamber that has been devised<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-3453 will spend approximately 1 month, on average, in a given containment unit before breaching containment. Furthermore, SCP-3453 has a record of escaping from re-used containment chambers within a matter of hours. Tests into its sentience remain inconclusive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
1 month and 46 hours</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
Over the course of its containment SCP-3453 created and escaped through a 128nm crack in its container.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 was enclosed in a watertight containment unit capable of holding 500mL of liquid, with 200cm thick walls.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
1 months, 3 days, and 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 heated up to a sufficient temperature to cause its containment unit to explode.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> SCP-3453 quickly cooled down to room temperature and proceeded to wander around Site-11. This event also resulted in the breaches of SCP-████ and SCP-████ as well as 2 casualties of Foundation personnel. All three objects were later re-contained without any additional issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.5:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
2 months, 1 week, 3 days, and 4 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 teleported 1.5 meters outside of its containment unit. This is the first time that SCP-3453 has been observed to teleport by the SCP-3453 Research Team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.17:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 was enclosed in a 300cm thick airtight containment unit with the highest melting point available on-site. This containment unit itself is enclosed in a blast resistant room with a Scranton Reality Anchor, which could prevent teleportation from occurring.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
2 months, 2 weeks, 3 days, and 5 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 teleported 1.5m outside of its containment unit. After 3 minutes of circling its containment unit at 10kph SCP-3453 teleported inside of the Scranton Reality Anchor, which proceeded to short-circuit and explode.</p>
<p><em>Notes: The Site Director has banned the use of SRAs for containment purposes. They also banned the use of cross-testing with other SCPs. Given the <a href="scp-3127.html">morbidly interesting ways in which these tests have failed for other SCPs</a>, I can't say I blame them. The SCP-3453 Research Team is going to take a more conservative approach from here on out. Specifically, we'll be focusing less on a permanent containment solution and more on minimizing the cost and impact of containment breaches.</em><br/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.20:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 is to be transported to a different containment unit every 8 hours. 6 containment units have been created for this purpose. As a cost-saving measure, a containment unit will only be decommissioned and replaced when SCP-3453 has managed to escape it under 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
1 year, 2 months, 4 days, and 18 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 was contained successfully with an average of approximately 0.7 successful escape attempts per month. SCP-3453 has since then teleported outside of every containment unit devised in less than 48 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.49:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 is to be kept within Site-11 by MTF Beta-7 through an array of cost-effective and portable containment units and procedures. The SCP-3453 Research Team is to provide aid and support to MTF Beta-7.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
1 month, 4 days, and 18 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 eventually escaped Site-11 through a urinal in the men's restroom.</p>
<p><em>Notes: As of writing this, SCP-3453 has been re-captured and brought back to Site-11 no less than 4 times. Each time that it has been brought back it appears to make a mad dash to the men's bathroom. Its last escape involved teleporting into the urinal. The bathroom has since been closed down, but that's really more of a temporary fix.</em><br/>

<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.66:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
<em>ContAIner-3453</em>, a program dedicated to SCP-3453's containment, has been developed. <em>ContAIner-3453</em> is to assist in automatically producing self-driving containment units for the purpose of finding and capturing SCP-3453 in a safe and discreet manner. Since the artificial intelligence is a work in progress, MTF Beta-7 is expected to work with <em>ContAIner-3453</em> until it can be fully automated by the SCP-3453 Research Team.</p>
<p>This entry marks <em>ContAIner-3453</em>'s first successful containment attempt, which involved a derivative of Test 3453.14.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
1 month, 1 week, and 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 teleported 2.4m outside of its containment unit.</p>

<p><strong>Containment Strategy 3453.121:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Containment Procedure:</strong><br/>
The following note, copied verbatim, was written in a standard issue notebook:</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>I performed a statistical analysis of</em> ContAIner-3453's <em>containment efforts, and I'm seeing a slow but significant downward trend in average containment time. If my calculations are correct, I don't think that this program will last more than a decade at best. Eventually, this skip will just get bored of us all and leave The Foundation forever…</em><br/>
<em>I have an idea.</em><br/>
<em>Let the records show that SCP-3453's container is Reality. As long as SCP-3453 exists, it is contained.</em><br/>
<em>~Junior Researcher Fine</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>3 hours after this note was written SCP-3453 disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Time:</strong><br/>
N/A</p>
<p><strong>Containment Breach Record:</strong><br/>
SCP-3453 could not be found for 4 months, 5 days, and 3 hours. SCP-3453's state of existence during this period could not be determined. SCP-3453 was discovered 534km from its place of disappearance by a group of 4 citizens in [REDACTED]. The group was amnesticized with Class C amnestics and their video recording was confiscated.</p>
<p><em>Notes: Junior Research Assistant Fine has been demoted for making unauthorized changes to object containment.</em><br/>
