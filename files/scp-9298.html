<strong>Special Containment Procedures:<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></strong> SCP-9298 is currently contained within the thalamus of O5-4. As a result of his disappearance and the subsequent loss of SCP-9298, O5 operations have been limited. The collapse of foundation resources and control over personnel is expected should SCP-9298 remain inaccessible to the O5 Command. The result of this scenario being the complete failure of the veil and the breach of at least 13 anomalies capable of causing K-Class scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9298 is a gold sheathed cylindrical tube containing an anomalously enhanced processing unit known as the Advanced Cortex Operations Module. SCP-9298 was utilized by 11 of the 13 O5 command members and granted enhanced thought, eidetic memory, and nominal psionic abilities. Members of the O5 Council who have chosen to undergo the procedure associated with SCP-9298 were able to insert SCP-9298 into a Receptive Component Interconnect at the mid-point of their skull.</p>
<p>SCP-9298 and the associated procedure were created in 1918, with surgical implementations of the item occurring in Constantinoply<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> that year.</p>

<p>In the final year of the First World War, the location was besieged by Greek forces, resulting in the destruction of both the technology and research used to create SCP-9298.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> The fall of Constantinoply was considered among the final great losses of the Ottoman Empire before their surrender in October of 1918. Only the 11 instances utilized by the O5 Council would be produced.</p>
<p>With the exceptions of O5-1, who deemed his own abilities superior to the enhancements offered by SCP-9298, and O5-13, who refused the surgery due to concerns regarding their unique physiology and mythological role. SCP-9298 was adopted by O5 Command and utilized to great effect until 1938. At that time, an incident involving a hand grenade and an impassioned speech delivered at a social club in Dresden, Germany, resulted in the destruction of O5-6's implant along side 47% of his face and neck. O5-6 was declared dead by German authorities before Foundation personnel could recover his body with the incident resulting in confusion among foundation medical staff, as each member of the O5 Council, aside from O5-13, had both drunk from <a href="/scp-006">SCP-006</a> and engaged with O5-13 in a ritual to grant them advanced regeneration and longevity. Upon recovery of O5-6's body, it was discovered that while alive due to said regenerative abilities, the damage to SCP-9298 had caused him to enter a state of low brain activity.</p>
<p>The O5 Council was forced to enter a state of emergency following O5-6's incapacitation as methods of revival were determined. Following attempts at traditional and esoteric means, including replacing SCP-9298 with similar augments, the only effective means discovered to revive O5-6 was to place another member's SCP-9298 instance into his receptacle. With this realization, the O5 Council began operating with 12 members, rotating the incapacitated member regularly. A byproduct of rotating SCP-9298 between members was that the memories of each member were shared, allowing the maintenance of clerical efficiency.</p>
<p>The SCP-9298 implants of each O5 member, aside from O5-4's, would be destroyed over the following 87 years. Some incidents that resulted in the destruction of an SCP-9298 instance include an assassination, a failed thaumaturgic ritual, infection by a <a href="/scp-2718">DAMMERUNG</a> class cognitohazard, and mechanical degradation in a time-accelerating chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-9298-1:</strong> The disappearance of O5-4 and motions to recover the last SCP-9298 instance.</p>
<p>On December 13th, 2025, O5-4 attended a gallery hosted by anartist Lynette Orderly at Freeport <a href="/scp-6460">Nx-44</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Whether this event was designed with the intention of trapping O5-4, who has been known to attend similar events with relative frequency, has yet to be determined. Evidence both to support and reject the notion exists.</p>
<p>Lynette is a known member of the anart community with amicable ties to the foundation. On two occasions, having assisted Foundation operations against GoI-0267.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> Lynette is also considered an associate of O5-4 due to his attendance of several galleries, being the member of the O5 Council responsible for maintaining the foundation's relationships with the anart community.</p>

<p><strong>Operation Briefing:</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>From the desk of O5-1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>As of now, O5-4 has been missing for 8 hours following his failure to report after attending an anart exhibit on the Floating Island of Laputa. Yes, I am aware this may come as a shock to you. The notion that the O5 Council would send one of their own to formal events such as this would seem below our responsibility. These events, however, have become a meeting space for many members of anomalous high society, constituting the need for our presence at them.</p>
<p>For any matter in which an O5 member attends an event such as this, they are required to submit an operation report to be voted on by at least three other council members.</p>
<p>O5-4's stated goals for this operation were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the effects of all exhibits are contained to anomalous society.</li>
<li>Contact Ruprecht Sidereal Carter of GoI-012<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> to discuss the firm's recent action and its adverse consequences on the population of <a href="/scp-9601">Odocoileus Virginianus</a> in Virginia and the surrounding states.</li>
<li>Secure a land grant from the king of Laputa for the purposes of establishing a Foundation office on the island.</li>
<li>Maintain Foundation presence and authority in anomalous society.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently unknown if these objectives have been accomplished. Additionally, due to the complex relation between the Foundation, MC&amp;D, and AWCY? The involvement of either GoI remains a possibility. Travel reports have confirmed that no craft have left Laputa since last night, nor have any teleportation abilities been detected. This is expected as the gallery will remain open for a second night.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 has been assigned the following mission objective. Locate and secure O5-4 and SCP-9298 before the gallery can close. Secondary objectives to confirm the status of O5-4's operation, and if needed, complete his objectives have been authorized. In this scenario, two members of the O4 Committee will be present on the island to negotiate with the Laputan king and Ruprecht Carter.</p>
<p>Secure, Contain, Protect.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> 35°N 155°W, Current location of the Flying Island of Laputa.</p>
<p><em>The four members of Alpha-1 appear on a populated street roughly two blocks from the gallery location. Members of Alpha 1 have hidden their armor and equipment under traditional formal wear. Except for Warlock, who has opted to utilize personal attire of a similar caliber to Foundation-issued equipment.</em></p>
<p><em>Alpha-1-1 issues a series of commands to establish the group's positioning before they begin making their way towards the gallery. The decision has been made to appear as guests.</em></p>
<p><em>The streets surrounding the gallery have been filled with an influx of tourists and citizens of Laputa who have turned the event into a festival centered around the art installations. As such, Alpha-1 is able to move unabated to the entrance of the premises. The gallery is held in a Neoclassical-style building with modern elements.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon entrance to the gallery, it becomes apparent that the space is under the influence of an anomalous effect. The interior of the building appears as a forest clearing. This effect is in line with the stated themes of the gallery, which are connection to nature and art as a natural extension of the self.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2:</strong> I quite like this Illusion. I have some notes on the fake depth above us, but it's very well crafted. Warlock, this is probably your ballpark. Do you think it's one person maintaining all of this?</p>
<p><em>Within the clearing that comprises the interior of the gallery. Framing, walls, and dividers separate the space into distinct areas and act as mounting for paintings. Crowds of people occupy the clearing, viewing the exhibits.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-3:</strong> Possible. Look at this scaffold here. There's a seam on the ground running from its edge to that wall over there. [Alpha-1-3 points to a large wall where a painting of a reclining man hangs.] I would say that implies a group that has divided the work amongst themselves. It's far easier to maintain something of this size by dividing it into smaller chunks. It could also stand that a skillful illusionist knows the interaction between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a> and the energy required to maintain illusions as they increase in size. If it were left to just me? I could probably divide an area like this up in a similar way.</p>

Warlock, is there a distinction between its function if we are inside or outside of the illusion?</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-3:</strong> To my understanding, Asymphony is unaffected by magics.</p>
<p><em>Alpha-1-4 makes note of a signpost in the center of the room while establishing a rough layout of the space. It has several signs pointing to various exhibits, including one called "A Jailor's Two Steps Forward."</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> I don't think that will be a concern, sir. It looks like the Ambassador is likely part of an exhibit.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> [Alpha-1-1 regards the sign] Serpent's hand? Good catch, Conspirator. We have been told to expect members of several groups in attendance, hostile and otherwise. It is entirely possible that the reference was created for them instead of by them.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2:</strong> That said, the existence of this sign implies that the individual or organization responsible is in direct contact with Lynette Orderly, if she's still the one responsible for the upkeep of this event.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> Let's head that way. If we are incorrect, we can attempt a divination ritual, get a locale on him.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Attendant:</strong> Hello, visitors. You are now approaching one of our most prestigious exhibits. We are required by request of the king to inform you that if you have any major aversions, the exhibit is not recommended viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2:</strong> We appreciate the warning, but it's quite all right. We both know that.</p>
<p><strong>Attendant:</strong> I do, yes. I am bound to ask if you will allow me to catch you unaware, despite the difficulty it would take to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2:</strong> Sorry, I already declined.</p>
<p><strong>Attendant:</strong> I would ask that you not do so, but it has already been taken out of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2:</strong> Engineer, this attendant has precognitive abilities. On behalf of the gallery, he is about to request a duel with me.</p>
<p><strong>Attendant:</strong> You also have precognitive abilities, psionic in nature. You are about to accept the offered duel for the following reason. I offer the opportunity to engage in combat that will have a notable impact on your mission's success, without putting any guests at risk. I also do not have any traps planned. It is objectively better for your mission to deal with this now than for us to engage each other in 15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> Will we be permitted to continue while this occurs?</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-2 and the Attendant nearly simultaneously:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> So be it.</p>
<p><em>Alpha-1-2 and the Attendant walk off the path and enter another seam in the illusion that makes up the gallery as Alpha-1-1 answers. As Alpha-1-2 exits the illusion, she flashes a hand sign associated with assurance.</em></p>

<p><em>The exhibit contains several artifacts, paintings, and demonstrations centered around a spiraling tower of cables and screens.

<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> Please be careful when touching the exhibits. They are incredibly fragile.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> That is why they sent me. Do not attempt to stop us.</p>
<p><em>Lynette Orderly appears from around the backside of the exhibit utilizing SCP-9298.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> Do not move!</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> Relax, I am simply just trying to make sure he doesn't break the thing. They aren't exactly common.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-3:</strong> As that may be, you are still coming with us; you are encouraged not to resist.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> I'm sorry, but my work is not done.</p>
<p><em>Alpha-1-4 approaches Lynette and attempts to grab her arm. His hand passes through.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> If you aren't here yourself, how can you expect your men to fight on your behalf?</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> First off, I… ahh, nice try, but I'm not telling you how to find me. Secondly, no one is going to fight. I've already gotten a damn good show from this exhibit and the one with precognition.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> I find it hard to believe it's that easy.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> That is because of your perspective. I am not your usual target. Assassin.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> Anomalous terrorists? That is our usual target, even those who think they have some grand ideal.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> We each have our own standards and ideals. You do as the foundation asks, do you not? The foundation has been sitting on a wealth of knowledge and technology that could benefit everyone for years. I am doing a public service by gaining access to that for even a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> You've done a good job wiring this together, but what have you accomplished with it?</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> Some good. More than can be said of its usage before now.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-3:</strong> In what way? Do you even know what disabling one of the foundation's highest offices could result in?</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> I can admit that the Foundation serves a purpose occasionally, but if the leadership hasn't changed since they acquired these modules, then I can't imagine any good has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> SCP-9298 was the result of a deal with a friendly state to make the Foundation more effective in protecting the future. I would say there's a hope for good baked in the very object I am touching.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> SCP-9298, I guess it would be. I'd also guess that any information on how the foundation acquired it would be there as well. It would not include the foundation affairs throughout World War I.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> What point would there be in recording the common knowledge of World War I in that report?</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> I doubt it is common knowledge that Constantinoply existed, let alone wished to enter the veil with its marvels.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> The Foundation would oppose that, and yet they would still work together to make SCP-9298. Though I can acknowledge it was part of a deal with the Foundation to hasten the veils' removal.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> Working together? The Foundation had no hand in the modules' creation. We had thought the deal was accepted, at least a little. Until the Greeks dragged artillery in.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> The Foundation has never been obligated to protect a states soverignty. We do not attempt to interfere with any actions that wouldn't result in damage to the veil.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> But you would act to protect the veil, using connections in the Greek military, Bombing a city to ensure they could not bring their marvels to the people. It was enough to destroy their writings and exile the people to never practice in the anomalous again, at risk of what you would do to them.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> The veil must be protected; if they refused to keep their activities within their city, then it was necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> And now what has it led to? When I built this piece, I saw the truth of the O5 Council. You doomed yourself to stop progress.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-4:</strong> It's not progress, it's a threat.</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> A threat we all make use of, on an island propelled by it? You are a hypocrite.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha-1-1:</strong> Hypocrite or not, your actions here are beyond what's allowable. How did you even come to know of this, Lynette?</p>
<p><strong>Lynette Orderly:</strong> It's time I retire that pseudonym. Call me Lina, Lina Atlas, please.</p>

<p><strong>Three steps back:</strong></p>

<p><strong>From the desk of O5-1</strong><br/>
<strong>To the desk of O5-4</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Welcome back,</p>
<p>In addition to the clerical work that needs to be completed by each member due to your extended absence. The incident on Laputa has raised several matters of concern related to individual security and the ever-present risk of SCP-9298's destruction. The risk of the O5 council's dissolution that it's destruction could result in are more obvious than ever.<br/>
Attached are operational documents and an additional proposal for the re-examination of the ruins of Constantinoply.</p>
<p>Our primary concern as of now is the establishment of past state imaging in Constantinople, hopefully we can put this shared brain nonsense behind us.</p>
<p>Lina's "ideality" is beginning to appear at odds with the maintenance of normalcy. She has certainly been a split personality with her assistance. I believe it is likely that while her intentions are disruptive, they are well-spirited. As such, while you should exercise additional caution in the future, you will continue to attend events as the Ambassador. Ensure that whatever good or bad she attempts is contained far from the veil.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is likely that due to her apparent knowledge of how to manipulate SCP-9298, she is equally capable of creating additional instances. Should the opportunity arise, you are expected to utilize your security detail to detain her.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9298, updated 12/16/25.</li>
<li>An establishment of fault discussed by Director Calvin Bold with Ruprecht Sidereal Carter.</li>

<li>Motion: The extension of the O5 guard program.</li>
<li>Proposal for the usage of past state analysis in the region of Constantinoply to witness SCP-9298's creation and requisite research.</li>
