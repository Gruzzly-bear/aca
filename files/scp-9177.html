<p>SCP-9177 instance in its dormant state</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9177</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9177 instances are to be placed in a bee skep within a standard apiary enclosure at Humanoid Containment Site-06-3. SCP-9177 instances are to be identified via colour-coded bio-safe marker matching their linked SCP-9177-1 instance. A file is to be kept, displaying the SCP-9177 instance colour designation along with their corresponding SCP-9177-1 instance.</p>
<p>SCP-9177-1 instances designated SCP-9177-1A through SCP-9177-1G are to be individually housed in standard humanoid containment cells at Humanoid Containment Site-06-3.<br/>
SCP-9177-1 instances are permitted a collective meditation period of one hour per week. This session must occur within a secured communal chamber, under observation of at least one Level-2 researcher and one member of security personnel. Participation is voluntary but must remain limited to designated times and locations.</p>
<p>In the event of an SCP-9177-1 casualty and commencement of an SCP-9177-A event, a member of D-class personnel is to be escorted by two guards in full body protective suits into SCP-9177’s containment enclosure. The SCP-9177-A event should be allowed to proceed without interruption. Once the D-class subject is fully converted it is to be designated as an SCP-9177-1 instance and escorted to the assigned containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Updated procedures as of 28/11/████:</strong> Interviews with SCP-9177-1 instances are currently suspended indefinitely. For further notice, any questions pertaining to SCP-9177-1’s faith have been determined to be unproductive and detrimental to employee mental health, and are therefore to be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9177 refers to a collection of 7 deceased European honey bees <em>(Apis mellifera)</em>. Despite the deceased nature of SCP-9177 instances, no decomposition has occurred in any of the specimens for the entire span of its containment.</p>
<p>SCP-9177-1 are a group of seven male-identifying human adults claiming to be part of a medieval monastic order, originating from ███████, Germany. Subjects display fluency in Middle Low German, Modern German and Latin.</p>
<p>When any SCP-9177-1 instance experiences clinical death, a corresponding SCP-9177 instance will reanimate through currently unknown means. The reanimated instance will then initiate an SCP-9177-A event.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-9177-A event progression:</strong></p>
<p>- SCP-9177 instance exits the skep of its own locomotion.</p>
<p>- The subject engages in aerial searching behaviour, ceasing its search when it locates a human subject of physical maturity.</p>
<p>- The subject stings the located human subject.</p>
<p>- The subject returns to the skep.</p>
<p>- The subject expires.</p>
<p>A human subject stung by SCP-9177 will undergo full cognitive replacement over the course of 2-3 hours.<br/>
The process initiates with notable disorientation and mental fog in the afflicted subject. Its condition will then progress to loss of personal memories, followed by rapid acquisition of linguistic, behavioural and psychological traits consistent with the deceased SCP-9177-1 instance. Upon completion, the subject fully identifies as the deceased SCP-9177-1 instance. The subject retains all prior knowledge, habits and monastic discipline consistent with the deceased SCP-9177-1 instance, while expressing no awareness of its previous identity. Regardless of the sex of the subject, it will always identify as male after the completion of the cognitive replacement process.<br/>
The subject is now classified as the previously deceased SCP-9177-1 instance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1 instances show the following traits:</strong></p>
<p>- Consistent autobiographical recall spanning the course of multiple natural human lifespans.</p>
<p>- Immediate recognition of other SCP-9177-1 instances, regardless of physical appearance, with no observable uncertainty.</p>
<p>Psychological testing has revealed extremely stable self-concepts that persist across SCP-9177-A events, suggesting continuity of an integrated identity rather than basic memory implantation.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Discovery of SCP-9177</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-9177 was first discovered after locally implanted Foundation personnel received intel pertaining to a mass disappearance in ███████, Germany. MTF Epsilon-6 (“Village idiots”) was deployed to investigate the disappearance of five residents of a local rural town who had collectively left their homes at approximately the same time and had not returned.</p>
<p>MTF Epsilon-6 tracked the POIs to a remote, partially collapsed medieval monastery located approximately 11 km outside of town limits. Upon arrival, agents observed the five missing individuals dressed in monastic garb alongside two additional unidentified individuals, collectively engaged in the clearing of debris from the collapsed wing of the structure.</p>
<p>When questioned, none of the POIs were able to correctly identify themselves, instead providing names that did not correspond to their legal identities. All subjects insisted they were members of the same monastic order and did not acknowledge their civilian lives. At this point, Foundation command authorised the detainment of all seven individuals for further questioning.</p>
<p>Subjects offered passive resistance when agents attempted to remove them from monastery grounds, verbally objecting but making no overt attempts at violence. During the ensuing detainment attempt, Agent M. █████ (newly transferred to MTF Epsilon-6 after completing precursory MTF training) discharged their weapon without authorisation, fatally wounding one of the unidentified monks (later designated SCP-9177-1G).<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Within approximately 30 seconds of SCP-9177-1G’s termination, a single European honeybee emerged from a bee skep located nearby on monastery grounds. It exhibited an unusual, direct flight path towards Agent I. ███ (The human in closest proximity to the bee skep at the time) and stung him on the base of the neck before returning to the hive where it disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>After approximately 36 seconds, Agent I. ███ reported feeling dizzy and exhibited severe disorientation. Over the following 2 hours, the agent displayed increasing cognitive impairment, including trouble recalling personal memories, aphasia and the inability to recognise fellow agents. The subject was sedated and transported to Foundation medical observation.</p>
<p>Upon awaking from sedation, the subject underwent the acquisition of uncharacteristic linguistic and behavioural patterns. At the conclusion of this period, the subject no longer exhibited any recollection of its identity and self-identified exclusively with the name previously provided by the deceased SCP-9177-1G instance.</p>
<p>Following this incident, seven deceased bees found within the bee skep were recovered from the monastery site and reclassified as SCP-9177.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 9177.1</strong><br/>
Below are several interviews with SCP-9177-1 subjects, conducted by Junior Researcher Castaigne, with the purpose of ascertaining the nature of SCP-9177-1’s immortality. Interviews originally conducted in modern German, translated for ease of staff review.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emil Castaigne</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-9177-1A</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Castaigne questions SCP-9177-1A regarding SCP-9177 and its function.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<p><em>(SCP-9177-1A is seated across the table from Castaigne.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, SCP-9177-1A. For the record, can you confirm your identity within your order?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> I am Brother Albrecht. I have always been Brother Albrecht</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> <em>[…]</em> You are referring to continuity across incarnations here, yes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> I am referring to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Fair enough. Let’s begin with SCP-9177, the bees. Were they a part of your monastery before the re-manifestation process began?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> How long have they been with your order?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> Since before my first death. They were still alive then, participating in the hive.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> And the process by which your consciousness transfers to a new host via the bees, was this intentionally developed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> We prayed to the Lord to continue. We were answered.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Answered how?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> Through the bees.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Castaigne is silent for approximately 5 seconds)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Was there a ritual involved? A consecration of the hive? Any specific prayers, substances, or preparations?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> There was only prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Okay. Why did you pray to return to life after death?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> So that we may endure in our faithful vigilance.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Brother Albrecht, what you describe violates multiple laws of neurophysics and biology. I would need more than a faith-based explanation to properly document your condition.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> You need what your work requires. We need only what we have been given.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Let me rephrase. At the moment of your death, did you expect to return?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> I expected to continue, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> That is not an answer to my question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> It is the only one I have.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> After your first re-manifestation, did you experience memory loss? Confusion? Disorientation? Any period of psychological distress?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> No. I had died, I was again. The work continued.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> You have mentioned several times now that you continue after death. Continue <em>what</em>, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> Our vigilant watch.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Vigilance against what?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9177-1A remains silent for approximately 14 seconds, frowning.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Brother Albrecht, I cannot document “vigilance” as a containment relevant activity unless you explain what the object of that vigilance is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> The Great Evil.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> The what? What is that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> That is not a question we answer. Apologies sir.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> Because to know is to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> In what?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9177-1A closes its eyes)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> In burden.</p>
<p><em>(silence for approximately 30 seconds)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Very well then. Answer me this: how do we guard against something you refuse to describe?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> By remaining</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Remaining how?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1A:</strong> As we are.</p>
<p><em>(Castaigne stands up from his seat, raises his hand to SCP-9177-1A in greeting, and leaves the room.)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Dr. Castaigne has been reminded of his professional duty to end interviews in an official, and respectful manner.</em></p>

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-9177-1C</p>

<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> For the record, state your name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> I am Brother Conbert.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> One of your brethren has referenced something called the “Great Evil.” Is this a term shared by your entire order?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> He should not have spoken of that to you, but yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Is it an abstract concept or an actual entity?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> It is what we guard against.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Brother Conbert, answer me. Does it have form?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> Not in this world.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> A location?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then in what way does it pose a threat?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> By being known.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> You’re saying that knowledge of it increases its influence? Then by speaking to me, you are drawing it closer to me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> Knowledge is proximity, yes. It is why we do not disclose of its nature in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Okay. How many people have ever known of it in detail then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> Too many.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then why not induct more members into your order? Surely more people to be vigilant would help you keep it at bay, why limit yourselves to seven?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> Because seven is already too many.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Do you expect the Foundation to aid you with your vigilance?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> We expect nothing of you.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then why cooperate with me at all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> Because you already know enough to be a risk. My brother never should have told you anything, that was foolish of him.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Castaigne is silent for a moment and begins wringing his hand together as he speaks to SCP-9177-1C)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> A risk to <em>what</em>, Brother Conbert?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> To us, to you, to everything. We do not believe there is a distinction. The more that know of its being, the more vigilant we must be.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> You speak as though this were an infection.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> You speak as though this were not.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Castaigne begins to speak more rapidly)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Has this thing ever harmed anyone you know off? Do you even have any proof of its existence?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> It has not, as we have guarded against it dutifully. We live on, that is all the proof we need.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> SCP-9177-1C, you have invoked an undefined anomalous threat, and are now insisting that my documentation endangers this world. I’m going to need you to be more concrete than this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> no.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> <em>no?</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1C:</strong> You asked why we do not induct new brothers. This is why. Curiosity is not a virtue, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then let me ask one final question. If knowledge of this entity were to come out, and your vigil fail, what would change?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9177-1C looks away and does not answer)</em></p>
<p><em>( Dr. Castaigne leaves the room, slamming the door behind him. The recording microphone picks up muffled, agitated yelling directed at an unknown target from the hallway.)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Following the interview, Dr. Castaigne was approached by Senior Researcher Schwarz to access his condition. Dr. Castaigne maintained he was “perfectly fine” and declined further psychological assessment.</em></p>

You’re stuck being alive forever and you have no purpose so you spend eternity driving everyone else nuts with your poetic bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1E:</strong> It is a presence.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> <em>Where.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1E:</strong> In questions like yours.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Castaigne laughs breathlessly)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> You die and you crawl back like the insects that facilitate it, and I’m supposed to stop at poetry? I need <em>proof</em>. I <em>need</em> to see it. If your “vigilance” fails and we all die in a K-class, who do you think the Foundation will blame? A bunch of innocent holy monks, or the stupid junior researcher who was supposed to just talk about bees for an hour, and ended up unleashing some uncontainable threat? What is it? Tell me, show me!</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Castaigne bangs his fists on the table)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1E:</strong> Knowing is how it spreads</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then maybe it should spread. Maybe I’m tired of being afraid of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Schwarz (over the in-room intercom):</strong> Please calm down, Dr. Castaigne.</p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> Tell me what it is, please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9177-1E:</strong> I will not, nor will my brothers.</p>
<p><em>(Sound of a chair overturning)</em></p>
<p><strong>Castaigne:</strong> Then I’ll make you. You-</p>

<hr/>
<p><em>26/11/████.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Incident Report ID #:</strong> 9177.1</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> During interview log 9177.5, Dr Emil Castaigne displayed a severe increase in hostile behaviour towards SCP-9177-1E. Approximately three minutes into the interview, Dr Castaigne left his chair and advanced on SCP-9177-1E in a manner that suggested intent to assault the subject. Security personnel stationed outside the interview chamber intervened within 10 seconds of the escalation, restraining Dr. Castaigne and removing him from the chamber without injury to SCP-9177-1E.</p>
<p>While being escorted to a secure temporary holding chamber, Castaigne continued to exhibit extreme agitation and repeatedly demanded SCP-9177-1E be allowed to “finish [it’s]<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> answer.” An immediate psychological evaluation determined Dr. Castaigne to be temporarily unfit for duty. Subsequent examinations have ruled out the possibility that the outburst was caused by anomalous stimuli. Castaigne has been placed on mandatory psychiatric leave, possible site reassignment is pending.</p>
<p>All involvement of Dr. Castaigne with SCP-9177 has been suspended indefinitely.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE REGARDING STATUS REVIEW</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>27/11/████.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>A complete, comprehensive review of all data relating to the Castaigne incident has yielded no definite evidence of any external anomalous activity beyond those typically expected of SCP-9177 and SCP-9177-1 instances. Accordingly, the “Great Evil” described in interviews is, at present, regarded as a non-verifiable belief system internal to the subjects. Nevertheless, continued psychological monitoring of personnel assigned to this file is advised.</p>
<p>The classification of SCP-9177 remains unchanged.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Foundation analysts note that, following the previously mentioned incident, SCP-9177-1 instances have increased their daily meditation periods for the first time on record.</p>
