<h5 id="toc0"><span><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span></h5>
<p>SCP-7486 is to be kept in a steel-encased containment chamber, and must remain suspended via magnetic levitation within a 10T<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> magnetic field at least 2 meters above ground to prevent accidental contact.</p>
<h5 id="toc1"><span><strong>Testing Protocols:</strong></span></h5>
<p>Only one item may be brought into SCP-7486's chamber at a time. All tests involving SCP-7486 require written approval from at least two level 3 personnel, and must be monitored via closed-circuit cameras to record the merging process. All personnel leaving the containment chamber must undergo decontamination and may need to attend a psychological evaluation should compulsive behaviour be demonstrated.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7486 from the Owner's perspective</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 id="toc2"><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h5>
<p>SCP-7486 is a black cube measuring 50 cm on all sides made of an extremely dense unidentified alloy, weighing approximately 3500 kg. Its surface is marked by geometric engravings that faintly glow when active.</p>
<p>When two objects simultaneously make contact with SCP-7486 within a 30 second timeframe, three things occur simultaneously:</p>
<p>- The two selected items are conceptually fused into a "merged entity", sometimes displaying engravings similar to SCP-7486. Merged entities vary in complexity and may adopt behaviours from one object over another, but all instances disintegrate within a day.<br/>
- SCP-7486 temporarily loses all engravings and releases a grey pulse, inducing a compounding effect towards a compulsion to continue merging items.<br/>
- SCP-7486 enters a cooldown period during which it loses all anomalous effects.</p>
<p>If SCP-7486 is moved over a distance of at least 500 meters through any means, it randomly allocates an "owner", selecting from any person starting from 500 meters and increasing in range every 10 seconds until someone is reached. It is believed the owner can see a persistent glow being emitted from SCP-7486, but this has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<h5 id="toc3"><span><strong>Recovery Information:</strong></span></h5>
<p>SCP-7486 was discovered at an Army Reserve in Ontario, Canada during an inventory check, attracting attention due to its weight. Foundation agents arrived under the guise of Federal Inspectors and secured SCP-7486 after nine merges, where a Lieutenant mentioned "a glowing blue light" across SCP-7486’s surface and claimed the object had been "responding to me, wanting me to touch things to it." No corroborations were recorded, and shortly afterward, SCP-7486 ceased exhibiting anomalous effects entirely for unidentified reasons. The Lieutenant later retracted his statement under questioning, stating that he didn't believe what he saw.</p>
<p>Witnesses were amnesticised and the object was relocated to Site-43 for containment. SCP-7486 only regained anomalous effects when Dr. Emily Zhang entered the chamber for standard material testing.</p>
<p>At this stage, Foundation researchers noted a possible correlation between the object and a specific individual, though the method through which this happens remains unidentified. Internal personnel files noted that Dr. Zhang had recently returned to work following an extended leave of absence due to the death of her spouse of twelve years.</p>

Camera footage determined that the facial expressions changed from one frame to the next. Dr. Zhang remained seated within SCP-7486-15's chamber throughout its 21-minute manifestation, watching it in silence. She declined to speak during debrief and did not submit her own notes.

The doll emitted vocalisations calling for Dr. Zhang and whispering phrases described as 'disturbing' and 'personal' when in her near vicinity. Dr. Zhang also reported feelings of dread as the doll's voice grew louder. SCP-7486-20's vocalisations culminated in a scream before it disintegrated into a pile of ash after 23 minutes.</td>
<td style="border:1px solid white;padding:.3em .7em;color:white;">Dr. Zhang did not submit a report. Surveillance footage shows her making repeated contact with SCP-7486-20 over a 22-minute span before SCP-7486-20 curled into a ball and began to disintegrate. Dr. Zhang restricted personnel from entering the chamber during the test. External observers via closed-circuit systems noted her expression was "more grief than just scientific interest".</td>

<em>Remaining tests have been redacted for brevity. Contact Dr. Blaine for any questions regarding these tests.</em>
<p>As a result of Attempt 020, no further merges were permitted for a period of 36 hours. During this time, Dr. Zhang submitted additional item pairings to the testing schedule, including biological samples and personal memorabilia. Several of these requests, noted for increasing personal significance, were flagged for review.</p>
<p>On 17/2, in the absence of Dr. Zhang, Dr. Patel resumed testing, the results of which are documented in Addendum 7486-03.</p>
<h3 id="toc6"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-02: Psychological Evaluation 1</strong></span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conducted by:</strong> Dr. Nhung Thanh Ngo - Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology Section<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Emily Zhang<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 16/2/2020</p>
<p>Dr. Ngo is performing a psychological evaluation following concerns raised over Dr. Zhang's merges involving personal items. This was conducted approximately five hours after test 020 due to concerns around Dr. Zhang's choice of items.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Good afternoon, Dr. Zhang, I hope you're doing well. I want to start by saying my main concern is that you’ve been involved in over 20 merges since SCP-7486 entered containment, which puts you significantly above baseline testing hours.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Mm. I would imagine so. It’s been very productive however, all these tests. I would be concerned if they weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Perhaps. But volume alone isn’t all I'm concerned about, Dr. Zhang. Your logs are for the most part on par with expectations. That said, some of your recent merges involve items with less… clear value towards research and more towards you as a person.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Are you referring to Attempt 020?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Among others, yes. That test in particular involved a personal item and a biological sample, I believe your own blood and a doll retrieved from your quarters. Do you believe you kept clinical detachment when selecting those items?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang leans back slightly in her chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I chose those items to test material familiarity and any emotional effects it would have on me. Nothing else. You’ve seen the results, Ngo. The cube responds better when the input has an emotional meaning to it. I’ve noticed the glow’s stronger afterwards too, sometimes it doesn’t even stop.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ngo pauses, adjusts her glasses, and looks at Zhang with curiosity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> We didn't see anything on the recordings. What exactly are you seeing?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang pauses for several seconds before answering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> It's glowing Ngo. I don’t care what the tape says, it's glowing at me.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ngo nods slowly and shifts in her seat. She makes a small note in her notebook before replying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Hm. I’ll ask the tech team to review the recordings again, just in case.</p>
<p><em>She pauses briefly before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> I’ve also seen you spend almost ten hours inside the containment chamber over the past few days, with only two merges completed in that time. What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> You think I’m lingering, just doing fuck all?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> I think it’s worth asking, especially given the potential risks involved.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang exhales sharply and looks away briefly. She lets out a long sigh, appearing reluctant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I'll admit I’m fascinated. I’ve worked on a dozen anomalies, and none respond like this cube. There’s something intentional about it, I almost feel drawn to experiment on it. It's hard to explain.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Hmm. Fascination is part of the job, but having compulsive urges is interesting.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ngo is silent for a moment before speaking again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> I want you to start taking steps away from the cube. I'm not punishing you, I just want to keep you as healthy as possible.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang lowers her gaze, speaking more softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Four days?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> You can assign the team something simple in the meantime. Patel’s capable. Just try out a couple of simple merges.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I’d prefer to finish a few more trials before I take leave. I have something more adaptable in mind next.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang pauses then leans forward before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Something a little more… deliberate. I’m wondering if there might be a threshold we haven’t crossed yet because of what we're testing. Not just in terms of materials, but in terms of meaning as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Meaning?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Intent. Expectations. Maybe even how your brainwaves flicker. I just think the cube reacts differently when the merge… has a purpose. Like it knows it's being watched - and if you want something, it might just give it to you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ngo’s pen stops mid-sentence. She leans forward slightly and looks up without speaking. She pauses shortly before replying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> You're talking about him, aren't you?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang pauses for two seconds before replying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> If your intention or purpose changes the outcome, then maybe the cube needs to have some kind of context inputted into it, like an AI. Or attention. Focused attention on one specific thing as you merge two items together. I just don't know how yet.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ngo gives a brief smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> One more session, then you take your leave. Just as a precaution. Agreed?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Fine. Just keep the item queue stable while I’m out. I want plenty of items to test when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ngo:</strong> Deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note from Dr. Ngo:</strong> No acute cognitive distress (e.g. disorientation or delusion) was observed. The patient additionally perceived an anomalous effect ('it's glowing at me'), though no glow was detected via thermal imaging or surveillance footage. Dr. Zhang's concern has however been documented for future monitoring.</p>
<p>The patient showed a low baseline level of emotional reaction during the session and displayed an elevated defensiveness, including labelling Foundation policies as 'roadblocks to discovery', further suggesting a possible progressive dependency to SCP-7486. Recommended taking steps towards less interaction with SCP-7486 over four days, effective until 20/2.</p>
<p>My own thoughts? She’s not just analysing the cube, testing it for Foundation use. She’s overdosing herself with it. The problem with that is, you always need just one more dose over and over, and it doesn't stop.</p>

<p>Later that day, Dr. Zhang repeated the same test under standard procedures. SCP-7486 produced a merged entity: a multicoloured ball of yarn fused to a white plastic spoon protruding from the yarn's core, allowing continuous unravelling of the yarn through a pinhole. Dr. Zhang gave no comment.</p>
<h3 id="toc8"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-04: Incident Report 7486-24</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 18/2, while Dr. Zhang was on temporary leave, SCP-7486 underwent a spontaneous merging event during a scheduled test, marking the first successful merge conducted in her absence. The event followed a mechanical fault in SCP-7486's levitation system, leading to momentary contact with the chamber floor. The behaviour of nearby staff as a result of this merge suggests SCP-7486's influence may extend beyond its owner, or that something of her had been left behind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 18/2/2020<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 12:17<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Site-43, SCP-7486 Containment Chamber<br/>
<strong>Reporting Staff:</strong> Dr. Patel</p>
<p><strong>Timeline of Events:</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:17:22</strong> Standard chamber preparations are initiated by Dr. Patel. Dr. Zhang remains off-site on temporary leave.</p>
<p><strong>12:17:24</strong> SCP-7486 slips from its magnetic hold due to misalignment in Magnet B in the levitation device. Object makes brief contact with the chamber floor on its corner before tilting onto an unattended clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>12:17:25</strong> A merging event occurs. SCP-7486 emits a standard grey pulse. The resulting entity (hereby SCP-7486-24) is a flat steel sheet appearing distorted and malleable, with unreadable cursive text throughout. No anomalous properties noted.</p>
<p><strong>12:17:27</strong> Three nearby staff members (Research Assistant R. Benitez, Junior Technician A. Rana, and D-4223) exit the containment chamber and attempt to re-enter with personal belongings, but are denied entry by Dr. Patel.</p>
<p><strong>12:17:46</strong> Low-level lockdown initiated. Magnetic levitation was re-established using the secondary suspension system. SCP-7486-24 disintegrates after 349 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Note from Dr. Patel:</strong></p>
<p>"It worked without her. I could have sworn it didn't last time, I don’t know why it works now. Maybe something carried over. But what’s more concerning is how quickly Benitez and Rana changed. They weren’t just curious. It was almost like the cube was in control of them, forcing them to keep merging.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve been doing this shit long enough to know when a room, especially one like this, is not safe. And I don’t think it’s the cube anymore. I think it could be the idea of it, just thinking of it could trigger the effects perhaps? Or maybe the cube still senses her presence, thinking she's here"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately following the events of Addendum 7486-04, all affected personnel displayed an elevated desire to "see more" for up to six hours post-exposure, despite being unable to recall what the merged entity looked like in detail.</p>
<p>Additionally, 24 hours after the events of Addendum 7486-04, the Department of Containment distributed an email to all staff assigned to SCP-7486, including Dr. Zhang, with the following rules to be placed into effect immediately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Merge frequency is restricted to one (1) event per day, unless written authorisation is provided by Site Director James.<br/>
- Dr. Zhang's temporary removal has been extended by an additional 24 hours, subject to further changes if required in the future.<br/>
- All chamber operations require confirmation from two Level 3 non-research personnel. Continuous visual monitoring is to be maintained during merging events until five minutes following entity disintegration have passed.<br/>
- Designated personnel have been assigned to monitor the item documentation queues for unusual compulsive tendencies and repeated object pairings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Staff have raised concerns that the revised protocols, while necessary, might worsen Dr. Zhang’s growing disregard from standard containment procedures. Dr. Ngo has recommended further monitoring.</p>

<h3 id="toc11"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-05: Private Log – Dr. E. Zhang</strong></span></h3>
<p>The following is the contents of a log recorded on Dr. Zhang’s on-site workstation. File was deleted but recovered from local storage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 21/2/2020</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> The team has yet again adjusted the procedure. The merge limit, dual authorisation, all these extras. From the outside, I assume it looks like I'm being hysterical. Like a researcher in over her head. But they haven’t been in the room. Not really, not like I have.</p>
<p>They clearly don't feel this same way, this constricting addiction I have to this cube. I can feel the cube's reactions, the way it slows, almost like it's waiting for me to realise something. The Foundation thinks these stupid barriers and red tape will explain it, but they’re just scared of whatever they can’t box up, classify and dissect like animals. They’ve made the cube harder to reach, and they keep calling it protection, but it honestly feels like starvation. Nothing even matters unless I’m in the room working with the cube.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang looks at the North camera and makes an "I see you" motion before clutching her left temple in pain for six seconds. She readjusts her bangle and beings to spin it around her finger as she continues.</em></p>
<p>I have a theory: It responds to ideas. To your actual intention. Almost like it *watches*, like it's waiting for the right merge. The right idea, the right something. It'd explain why these basic merges fall apart after not even a day. There's no structure or thought to them. I bet if this cube finds something with sentimental value, it might just do something, maybe even last a bit longer. Maybe the longer an item lasts the more it approves of it.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang yawns.</em></p>
<p>I've asked it many questions but it's given not one sufficient answer. But I think it’s trying to.</p>
<p>I’ve cut out most of the noisy shit from the queue. Only five items left now. Just five. If I’m asking the right question now, if I do this right, it’ll show something. And if not… then maybe I misunderstood the question more than I thought.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind though. I am certain. More than these clueless bureaucrats filling out report after report pretending they understand it. If anyone's going to bring him back to life, it will be me.</p>
<p>Wait Christ was there five things? No that doesn't make sense because each merge takes two-</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang is silent for 23 seconds, yawning midway. She then sighs and admits defeat before exiting.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After recovering the above log, internal audit staff identified a number of other irregular access patterns by Dr. Zhang's keycard. An internal review confirmed multiple unauthorised attempts to gain access to restricted document files and access permissions from 01:00 to 04:00. The data contained in the recovered document, accompanied by the persistent violation of set research standards, led to a referral for a disciplinary review by the Site Director.</p>
<h3 id="toc12"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-06: Administrative Notice – Dr. Emily Zhang</strong></span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/2/2020<br/>
<strong>To:</strong> SCP-7486 Research Division<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Site Director Dr. Allan McInnis</p>
<p>Following the recovery of an unauthorised file recorded by Dr. Emily Zhang, an internal investigation has determined that her recent conduct both in and out of her field of work demonstrates a breach of Foundation expectations, notably ones related to professionalism, Operational Security, and cooperation within her department.</p>
<p>After discussion with the relevant Site Director, the following are to be implemented, effective immediately:</p>
<p>- Dr. Emily Zhang's Level 3 security clearance is reduced to Level 1 until further notice. Dr. Patel is temporarily given Level 3 access.</p>
<p>- Dr. Zhang is suspended from all SCP-7486 research activities, and is prohibited from conducting any further merges pending a mandatory psychological evaluation for signs of obsessive compulsion. However, as per Dr. Ngo's request and suggestion, Dr. Zhang is to be granted limited observational access to SCP-7486, and is to be supervised at all times whilst viewing SCP-7486 by Dr. Patel or another level 3 researcher.</p>
<p>- Following further review, Dr. Zhang is to be transferred to administrative duties with SCP-████. Dr. Zhang will have 72 hours from that point to pass over administrative duties of SCP-7486 to Dr. Patel or additional action will be taken.</p>
<p>Increased disciplinary action, including the possibility of amnesticisation and dismissal upon recovery, is under consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a response to this, Dr Ngo submitted a request for limited observation for Dr. Zhang over Dr. McInnis' suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While disciplinary action is necessary, I have also advised Dr. Zhang be allowed limited observation of SCP-7486 without interacting with it. Forcing a sudden and complete withdrawal could result in a psychological breakdown and more severe withdrawal symptoms, which would defeat the purpose of trying to protect our Foundation members.</p>
<p>I am also aware that multiple personnel are taking this opportunity in order to observe the long-term effects of SCP-7486. Whilst this was not what I intended, I approve of this measure so long as Dr. Zhang is not engaged with unless strictly necessary, and is to be removed immediately if she displays further signs of compulsion, in which case I wish to be contacted as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the log recorded in Addendum 7486-06 was delivered, surveillance monitors flagged Dr. Zhang attempting to access prohibited floors. While no containment breach occurred, the following exchange was recovered from hallway surveillance and added to the official file during review.</p>
<h3 id="toc13"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-07: Informal Interview Transcript – Dr. Patel</strong></span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/2/2020</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> You know you're not meant to be on this floor Zhang.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I’m just reviewing documentation. I’m not touching a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> You literally deleted an important file, as least I think it was, I was never told. You think no one’s watching you anymore? You think you're anonymous?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> No. I think the Foundation's watching the wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> This cube, it doesn’t care about things like gloves and distance and dual authentication. It never did. The only thing it cares about is structure and meaning. About your purpose in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Hmm.. Ngo said you mentioned a question it might answer. What question?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang pauses for a moment before replying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> It's a question that I can answer with five objects. That’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> What objects?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> For now, you don't need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> And this.. question, is for the cube?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang quickly meets Dr. Patel's gaze and returns a slight nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Uh, okay. What do you think the cube will answer then?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang again pauses and stares at Dr. Patel for a moment before replying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> Something I've been asking for a long time.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Patel sighs and shifts uncomfortably. Dr. Zhang begins to whisper to Dr. Patel</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I just need a few more merges. I could maybe get in but I can't do the merges. You could authorise them. It wouldn’t even take that long. Please Rohan.</p>
<p><em>There is a lengthy pause. Dr. Patel leans against the wall, deliberately avoiding eye contact.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Emily, you're asking me to help you hurt yourself even more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> What? No, I'm asking, no I'm begging you to help me finish this, to help me get what I need. You don't understand, I can barely even think straight when I'm not by it, it's almost cru-</p>
<p><em>Dr. Patel interrupts Dr. Zhang.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> It's not going to answer you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang doesn't reply, instead just looking all around Dr. Patel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> I can't let you do this. I really am sorry, but I don't want you getting hurt. You've seen the email Allan sent right? I could get done for helping you, you know? Plus you clearly have an addiction to it or something, you just said you can't even think right when you're not by it. And it's only been what, 24 merges?</p>
<p><em>Zhang says nothing for several seconds. Surveillance shows her tightening her grip on the strap of her satchel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Zhang:</strong> I thought you of all people would understand.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> I know but-</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang scoffs and walks away. Surveillance shows her brushing roughly past Dr. Patel. She apologises but does not look back.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Approximately two hours after this exchange, surveillance review confirmed that Dr. Zhang had unauthorised use of Dr. Patel’s keycard within the SCP-7486 containment wing.</p>
<h3 id="toc14"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-08: Final Merge Log – Event 7486-FINAL</strong></span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/2/2020</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An unscheduled merging event was carried out by Dr. Emily Zhang, directly violating restrictions laid out in Addendum 7486-05. Incident was recorded during a low-security rotation window.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1:</strong> A human head. Facial reconstruction determined a 93% probability of it being Dr. Zhang's deceased husband. The body was preserved cryogenically as part of a grief response study led by the Ethics Committee, a study unaffiliated with SCP-7486.<br/>
<strong>Item 2:</strong> An unmarked envelope</p>
<p><strong>Timeline of Event:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>00:00:00</strong> – Dr. Zhang enters SCP-7486's containment using Dr. Patel’s Level 3 keycard. Surveillance cameras later confirmed Dr. Patel was unaware of this use and was off-site at the time.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:00:14</strong> – Both objects are placed simultaneously on SCP-7486. No usual pulse or glow resulting from a traditional merging event was detected.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:00:15</strong> – A merging event occurs. The resulting entity (SCP-7486-A) is a smooth grey sphere, 50cm in diameter. Note that SCP-7486-A rotates slowly. Dr. Zhang noted a warmth to SCP-7486-A. Engraved faintly across its surface are the same geometric glyphs observed during SCP-7486’s first documented merge. Subsequent analysis concluded no other significant deviation from SCP-7486’s original state at the time of containment.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:00:32</strong> – Dr. Zhang exhales. No change to SCP-7486-A observed.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:01:17</strong> – The sphere ceases rotation and remains stationary, as does Dr. Zhang.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:01:49</strong> – Zhang sits cross-legged on the chamber floor, silent and motionless.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:05:15</strong> – The entity disintegrates, leaving behind no residue. Zhang continues to sit for an additional 18 minutes.</p>
<p>- <strong>00:23:32</strong> – Zhang leaves the chamber without interaction. Surveillance logs show she paused at the door to look back once before exiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Post-Event Notes:</strong><br/>
Later analysis of the event footage confirmed no anomalous activity occurring during or after the merging event beyond the formation of the merged entity. No significant deviation from standard containment levels were observed. Thermal and electromagnetic readings both remained within a normal range.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang has not submitted a post-merge report and has yet to acknowledge or act upon any entries. She has not spoken to Foundation personnel beyond acknowledging basic instructions since the events of 7486-FINAL.</p>
<p>Over the following days, Dr. Zhang has since begun to frequent Observation Wing 3, spending up to nine hours at times seated at the SCP-7486 observation window. She does not bring other possessions, nor interact with others during these visits. She maintains consistent eye contact with SCP-7486 during these sessions.</p>
<p>On 24/2, Dr. Patel attempted to initiate conversation with Dr. Zhang while she was seated in the Observation Wing.</p>
<h3 id="toc15"><span><strong>Addendum 7486-09: Observation Wing Log – 24/2/2020</strong></span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-43, Observation Wing 3<br/>
<strong>Subjects:</strong> Dr. Emily Zhang, Dr. R. Patel<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> This is the first documented attempt by Foundation personnel to engage her in personal conversation following the events of Addendum 7486-09.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Patel brings a chair next to Dr. Zhang. Dr. Zhang does not react.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Hey Emily. You’ve been here a lot haven't you?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang remains seated. She does not turn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Hey, I figured you may just want some company, even if it ends up me just sitting here close to you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang does not respond. Dr. Patel stands up and leans on a wall beside her. Dr. Zhang adjusts her chair, slightly moving it away from Dr. Patel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> They haven’t said it aloud, but I’ve seen a half finished template letter. You know they’re probably going to reassign you? And maybe me too - Ngo already got sent for a review, and I’ve had my clearance level reviewed twice now for each time I've covered you. That’s what this stupid cube has done to us.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang exhales softly, eyes remaining fixed ahead.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Look, I think most of these people higher up just don’t know what to do with it. Or with you, Emily. You've changed after all. You were friendly and helpful once.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Patel pauses for a moment before smiling and continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Do you remember when I joined three years ago? I had no idea what the hell was going on, or why I was tasked with looking after a fishtank with disappearing fish. They gave me a clipboard and told me to watch this fishtank for any anomalous changes. No context, no purpose. Just… watch the damn tank and don't put your hand in there.</p>
<p>I thought that was going to be my life from now on. That joining this Foundation was a waste of time, and I took this jump for nothing. That was until you barged through my door. You said that you were looking for someone who was curious, not cautious and worried about "every little pissy thing". God knows I didn't have the slightest clue what you were talking about. But you spoke like someone who has a plan better than watching a fishtank. You didn't need to keep going on, I just said yes and followed suit.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang displays no movement aside from a slight shift of the hands in her lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> I didn’t really understand what was going on at the start when you introduced me to this cube. I thought it was just some object with a gimmick. I was even a bit scared of this thing at first, what with this massive cube flying in the sky. But you breathed meaning and fun into it for me. It was almost like we were discovering some kind of ancient language hidden in each pulse the cube did. You gave me belief that there was a beauty to all this madness going on around me.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang's eyes remain forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> Emily, I know you think that this cube was trying to tell you something. Maybe with the right question, the answer might be good enough for you to be content with.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Patel sits back down and moves her chair next to Dr. Zhang.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> I'm telling you, that thing is not listening to you. I'm sure it never was. It's almost like a free being, trapping you in it and forcing you to believe something might just happen.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang looks at Dr. Patel for a few seconds, who smiles at her. She sighs and continues looking at SCP-7486.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patel:</strong> No matter what the answer is, I want to know if Emily Zhang, my one real friend here, still exists. The one who remembers working on something enjoyable, someone who knew what to do at every stage. Or if it's just Dr. Zhang that's here to stay.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zhang does not respond. Dr. Patel stares at SCP-7486 for 3 minutes and 48 seconds<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> before saying goodbye and hugging Dr. Zhang. Dr. Zhang remains seated and does not move through this entire period.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 11:57am on 31/5/2020, SCP-7486 developed a faint, persistent glow. The cause of this change is unknown. However, initial research indicates that a likely cause may be derived from emotion. It is presumed that SCP-7486 has identified a new target.</p>
<p><strong>Edit - Dr. Patel - 23/2/2020:</strong></p>
<p>"I don’t know what she thought it would do. She just sat there, waiting. Maybe she thought it would react. Maybe she thought it saw her.</p>
<p>"She keeps staring at it like it would answer her wish.</p>
<p>"It didn’t. It won't.</p>
<p>"I doubt it even heard her. It just let her think it did.</p>
<p>"Perhaps to break people down and make them keep coming for more. Or to force someone to depend on them, make it an addiction and then cruelly force a detox for the pain.</p>
<p>"Maybe that’s what it was made for; it doesn’t want anything except someone to believe it wants something, keeping it up just long enough to break you down."</p>
