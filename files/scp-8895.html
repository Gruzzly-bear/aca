<p>SCP-8895 in evidence (2008).</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8895</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8895 is stored inside a standard containment locker at Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Further testing has been banned indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8895 is a 1m retractable USB cord with one standard and one mini connector. It is unbranded, but its design matches those produced by the American company E-Tech in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>When the mini connector is inserted into the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of a human being, and the standard connector to a computer, an .adx image will be generated. This process takes around thirty minutes and results in a file of ~200 GB. The file will be named 'FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_######.adx', with the third field being a randomly generated number. Any deeper significance to this number, aside from identification, is unknown. If the connector is separated from the CA1 subfield before the process is complete, an image will still be generated. These corrupted images follow the same naming format, but are of a much smaller size (2-30 GB).</p>
<p>.adx images can be opened in any piece of software regardless of size or format requirements. Doing so produces unclear results that, in the case of corrupted images, can contain disturbing imagery. For example, opening an .adx image with image editing software results in seemingly random, highly abstract 'rolling' patterns. Corrupted files produce more abstract patterns that are often so distorted they become nearly unintelligible (<a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8895/image2.jpeg">See attached</a>). Despite this, researchers who have studied .adx images rigorously claim these results are not random. Rather, they are direct visual interpretations of something intangible from within the human mind. What this thing is (memories, emotions, something collective, etc.) is unclear, and theories on its origin or purpose vary.</p>
<p>When a commonplace program is used to open an .adx image, a small amount of data will be permanently lost. This always happens in increments of 500-600 MB regardless of the program used, the length of use, the amount of outputs produced, or the completeness of the original file. Results produced by heavily damaged .adx images occasionally contain hazardous material, and as such testing is heavily regulated.</p>
<p><em>bunbun.exe</em> is the only known computer program capable of running .adx images, in their entirety, without loss of data. It is automatically installed the first time an .adx image is generated onto a computer. When ran, <em>bunbun</em> will display a small window with a gray background and a button in the center which reads, 'Select File.' Choosing any file other than an .adx image will cause <em>bunbun</em> to immediately crash. Thus far, every .adx image tested using <em>bunbun</em> results in a nearly still frame of bright red, along with audio. In the case of complete images, this audio appears to be howling wind with distant animal sounds described as similar to pig squeals. In the case of corrupted images, the audio appears as a loud drone described by some as a kind of 'electronic groan.' This audio does not loop, nor does it change from user input. The video will continue playing until <em>bunbun</em> is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery and McKnight Incident:</strong> SCP-8895 came into the Foundation's possession in 2008 after being confiscated from an esoteric doomsday cult. Initially deemed benign, or even non-anomalous, interest began to gather around the object when a lengthy text document was found on the suspect's personal computer. This document was a mostly accurate description of the object's properties, but held strange, often contradictory connections between the object and several post-judgement interpretations in the Abrahamic tradition. The object was then transferred to Site-19 for preliminary testing, where it came into the possession of Brett McKnight (February 6, 1975 - July 7, 2013).</p>
<p>Brett was enlisted into the SCP Foundation in 2007 as an investigative researcher. During this time, he and his wife Adrienne McKnight (September 12, 1981 - July 6, 2013) married. They had two children: Sarah McKnight (August 1, 2008 - July 6, 2013) and Cathryn McKnight (March 27, 2010 - July 7, 2013). The catalyst for the incident occurred in September 2012, when Brett began an affair with Site-19's research administrator, Émelie Blanc.</p>
<p>This affair continued until June 2013, when it was discovered following a search of Blanc's personal devices due to an unrelated investigation. It was found that Blanc had broken numerous containment protocols during their relationship — including allowing Brett to take SCP-8895 home with him several times for personal study, even while her investigation was ongoing. Authorities suspended Brett from further duty until his and Blanc's investigations concluded. On July 8, 2013, Brett failed to appear at his scheduled disciplinary hearing. Local police were then dispatched to his home.</p>
<p>Adrienne was found in her bed with numerous stab wounds to her head and upper back. The skin on the back of her head was scraped away, with numerous dents found on her skull. This appears to have been a crude attempt to access her brain by digging a kitchen knife into the bone. Sarah was found in a similar state, though her brain was successfully accessed via a hammer. This destroyed the majority of her hippocampus region in the process, but Brett still managed to produce several images, all corrupted.</p>
<p>Cathryn's body was found face-down on Brett's desk, with a hole drilled into her skull and SCP-8895 inserted into her brain. Her hands were bound behind her back, and she had additional injuries to her arms, ribs, chest, and face. Her hippocampus region was destroyed partially, but still intact enough for complete .adx image generation. Medical examination determined that she died several hours after Adrienne and Sarah, via several intracranial hemorrhages, in the early hours of July 7th.</p>
<p>Brett's body was found inside of the bathtub of the master room's bathroom. His cause of death was determined to be a single self-inflicted stab wound to the heart.</p>
<p>Analysis of Brett's computer found 22 deleted .adx images of various sizes, 15 named after Sarah and the rest unnamed. It appears that these files were used to aid Brett in writing <em>Report_on_retractable_usb_cord_anomaly.doc</em>, a Microsoft Word document that describes in detail the properties of SCP-8895. It later served as the framework for the description section of this document. Near the end of it is the following, believed to have been written minutes before Brett's suicide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigation halted due to realization by researcher. Therefore, deeper analysis for signs of memetic influece [sic] on any part of this were not conducted. This will need to be done later. I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the unnamed deleted files is unique. It was produced in the early hours of July 7th, likely using Cathryn's material, and is especially notable for being over twice the size of a usual .adx image (473 GB). It appears to have been the last image produced during the incident. A screenshot, timestamped at 4:01 AM, was taken of this image being accessed by <em>bunbun</em> (<a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8895/image3">See attached</a>).</p>
