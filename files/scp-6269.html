<h2 id="toc0"><span><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES — USAGE:</span></span></span></h2>
<p>To ensure its proper usage by trained personnel, SCP-6269 may only be operated in accordance with the rules and regulations stipulated in the <em>Department of the Multiversal Claw Machine: Ethical Acquisitions Training Manual,</em> referred to as the "DotMCM:EATM."</p>
<p>Personnel assigned to SCP-6269 found not adhering to the DotMCM:EATM may be subject to termination, dismissal from the SCP Foundation, suspension of duty, or temporary loss of claw operation privileges depending on the severity of their violation.</p>
<p>All individual components and personnel assigned to SCP-6269 are to remain in universes -Prime and -SubPrime as identified in the DotMCM:EATM. Regular examination of SCP-6269's components within universe -SubPrime are to be taken bi-monthly to ensure the continued, uninterrupted operation of the machine.</p>
<p>For ease of reference, a selection of key criteria outlined in the DotMCM:EATM are appended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only approved personnel, who have completed the "MCM Ethical Acquisitions" online course — and achieved a correct response rate of at least 50% — are permitted to operate the components of SCP-6269.</li>
<li>D-Class Personnel must be acquired from non-Prime universes; SCP-6269 and its operators reside in the following universe: -Prime &amp; -SubPrime.</li>
<li>Only one operator is allowed to control the primary acquisition module of SCP-6269 at a given time; other operators must abide by the predetermined schedule.</li>

<p>SCP-6269-CLAW.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="toc2"><span><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:</span></span></span></h2>
<p>SCP-6269, colloquially the "Multiversal Claw Machine," is a Foundation-developed, coin-operated, eigenmachine<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A non-militarized equivalent of an 'eigenweapon:' whereas an eigenweapon denotes an anomalous weapon of mass destruction, an eigenmachine is an anomalous machine of mass <em>production.</em></span> utilized for the ethical acquisition of D-Class Personnel.</p>
<p>Due to the mechanical, technical, and ontokinetical complexities of SCP-6269's machinery, the vast majority of the device is contained within an allocated universe: -SubPrime. Due to thaumaturgical time-dilation and entropy-reducing counter-measures,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Including, but not limited to: alchemical processes, non-Newtonian physics field generators, atemporal calculating systems, and the copious application of WD-40.</span> mechanical devices within this universe experience minimal wear and decay. The components comprising SCP-6269 located in -SubPrime are monitored by <span class="st">Logan.aic</span>, which ensures the continued operation of SCP-6269 through the construction of additional system redundancies. This is achieved through the conversion of matter within -SubPrime into additional mechanical components integrated into SCP-6269.</p>
<p>A subset of SCP-6269's mechanical components are located in -Prime: the home-universe of the SCP Foundation-Prime. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SCP-6269-CLAW:</strong> The primary physical acquisition component, SCP-6269-CLAW is utilized to seize targeted persons or objects, and is capable of precise maneuvering in diverse environments.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-6269-HOLE:</strong> A self-stable multiversal aperture, SCP-6269-HOLE is an adjustable multi-badgerhole.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Whereas a wormhole links two locations within the same universe, a badgerhole links two locations between distinct universes.</span> In regular operations, SCP-6269-CLAW is inserted into SCP-6269-HOLE to retrieve a targeted acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-6269-SCREEN:</strong> Denoting a complex series of monitors and controls, SCP-6269-SCREEN includes the physical control systems for SCP-6269-CLAW and -HOLE, as well as providing visual feedback for the -CLAW operator. The integrated Hunter-Catcher system allows for the monitoring of up to 15,000 distinct individuals prior to their acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-6269 has proven to be exceptionally successful, ethically acquiring nearly 85% of the Foundation's current D-Class Personnel in the 5 years of its operation. For additional information, please consult <span class="st">SCP-6269 — ACQUISITIONS LOG</span>.</p>

<div class="ethics_memo">
<p>I've heard some folk asking "how do we <em>know</em> that SCP-6269 is ethical?" Well, I'm going to take a moment to allay any such, unnecessary, concerns.</p>
<p>In the entire multiverse, the SCP Foundation-PRIME is the only iteration of the SCP Foundation to operate SCP-6269; no equivalent project exists in any other universe. This implies that <em>every</em> other SCP Foundation resides in a less ethical universe because they have not developed SCP-6269 for their own ethical acquisition of D-Class personnel. Therefore, using SCP-6269 to acquire D-Class from those non-Prime universes is entirely ethical, as any non-Prime individual resides in a less ethical universe than their -Prime Universe counterpart.</p>
<p>I hope this explains it. If anyone has any further hesitations, they're welcome to request permission to view SCP-6269 in operation, to see how ethical it is themselves.</p>

During routine post-acquisition surveillance, it was noted that D-453234 had been shouting requests for acquisition through SCP-6269-HOLE.</p>
<p>During a post-acquisition interview, D-453234 reported that he was content in the manner – and ethicality – of his acquisition.

<p>The operator was lauded for their cost-efficiency, however it is not recommended that this maneuver be attempted by most operators, due to the difficulty associated with safely and ethically grabbing fifteen personnel at once.</p>

<p><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SITUATION:</span></span> During a routine sweep, SCP Foundation-Prime webcrawlers identified an account on the social media platform Twitter that had been routinely sharing covert information regarding the existence of SCP-6269. This account: @mcm_worker — detailed the operational capacities of SCP-6269, its employment for the acquisition of D-Class Personnel, and the personal information of technicians and operators assigned to SCP-6269. Due to the strict confidentiality clauses laid out in the DotMCM:EATM, it was assumed that these 'tweets' were not produced by any personnel within the Department of Acquisitions; as such, the most likely explanation was the complex machinery composing SCP-6269 had become self-aware.</p>

<p><strong>Dir. Place H.:</strong> What the hell, where am I?! Hey, someone let me down from this thing!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> No can do. The DotMCM:EATM states we aren't allowed to do that until we're certain the acquisition was successful. This is Dir. Place H., I assume?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place H.:</strong> The… acquisition? Wait how is this thing holding me like this? It's only got, what, two prongs?!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Put him down, Evan; good work there with the claw, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Okay, Dir. Place H., welcome to universe-Prime—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place H.:</strong> "Universe-Prime?" Isn't that a little egotistical of you guys?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> I don't make the names. Speaking of though, mine is Dir. Greeboni, and that's Evan over there.</p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Hi. Thanks for leaving your food on the table when we grabbed you, it can make a mess going through the universe hole.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place H.:</strong> The wha—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Let's cut to the chase, alright? We brought you here because we need your help. It's the first time we've done something like this, but we're pretty sure it's all ethical, so no worries.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Anyway, we've been watching you through the monitor, and of all the Dir. Place H.-s out there, you're the most impressive we've come across.</p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Loved seeing that thing you did with the machine!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> That's enough, Evan. We need to stay focused. <em>[Pause]</em> As I was saying, you've already been introduced to SCP-6269-CLAW. It's apart of a complex eigenmachine developed by the SCP Foundation-Prime that's recently—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place H.:</strong> Started to do weird, unexpected things?</p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah! How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place. H:</strong> Call it a hunch. So what, is it unravelling the fabric of reality? Creating new meta-narrative layers? Maybe expanding into a new axis of time?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Not exactly. It's tweeting.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place. H:</strong> <em>Tweeting?</em> Like… Twitter tweeting?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Precisely. We're working through a complete diagnosis. Our most likely assumption is the machine's become sentient, but we've yet to locate where that intelligence has become centralized or how it's accessing the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place. H.:</strong> Wait, how do you know it's SCP-6269? Have you reviewed the internet access of your personnel?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Well, that would be pretty unethical wouldn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place. H.:</strong> …no?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Hm… you're right. Actually, I'm pretty sure the DotMCM:EATM <em>does</em> mention something about that—</p>
<p><strong>Dir Place. H.:</strong> The what?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> —I'll have to go get my copy.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Place. H.:</strong> Okay… sure, whatever. Look, are we done here? Cause I'd really like to go back now.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Go back where? Evan, proceed with the acquisition.</p>

<p><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOREWORD:</span></span> Following a review of on-site internet usage and activity logs, the identity behind the @mcm_worker account was identified, and an interview was held between them and Director Greeboni. In accordance with the DotMCM:EATM, the employee was afforded anonymity in records during the investigation, and is identified in the following log as “Bluebird.”</p>

<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> So you have a problem with me?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Bluebird, we don’t have a problem with you. We have a problem with your social media… habits.</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> I’ve been reaching all my targets this month. So what if I spend my downtime on my phone? The DotMCM:EATM cites enjoying downtime as an important facet of employee mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> I should have been more specific. The Department has a problem with your Twitter account. You’re posting confidential information about SCP-6269 online. It’s not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> Dude I’m literally just hanging out on there. People like hearing about it. They think it’s neat.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Frankly, the opinion of outsiders isn’t a major concern for the Department. The fact that they even have an opinion <em>is</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> Alright, well, have it your way. But I’ve been keeping track of anyone who supports the Claw, anyone who understands just how ethical it is. Everyone who follows me <em>loves</em> the Claw. Take a look at this and tell me what I’m doing is a “Harmful Breach of Confidentiality” as defined in Section 2B of Chapter 12 in the DotMCM:EATM.</p>
<p><em>Bluebird slides their phone, unlocked, across the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Are you really citing my own manual to me? I know what’s defined as– wait. You only have twenty followers?</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> Yeah, not bad, huh? Got them all in only a month.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> That’s… that’s not even a single crate’s worth of amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> Well there’s no need to be rude. Twitter’s a hard place to build a following for a guy like me.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> I apologize, I wasn’t trying to be rude. I’m just shocked. This was reported to me as a massive breach of security. I recognize more than half of these names from <em>inside</em> this department!</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> Yeah, some of my friends here like to hear my thoughts on what we do. They say I have a “unique way of seeing the world,” which is pretty cool, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> Well. This certainly changes things. I came in here expecting to have to shut the account down and ethically fire you. I was even considering termination.</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> I’m sure you’re aware that Section 1L of Chapter 12 in the DotMCM:EATM specifically and ethically prevents, except in cases where unethical events have occurred, the restriction of the social media activities of employees.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Greeboni:</strong> I’m aware. That’s my point; there’s no breach of ethical guidelines here. There’s hardly any suspect activity to speak of, this is a drop in the ocean! How amenable would you be to something of a compromise?</p>
<p><strong>Bluebird:</strong> What do you have in mind?</p>

<p><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AFTERWORD:</span></span> During the subsequent discussions between Director Greeboni and Bluebird, it was deemed permissible for the @mcm_worker account to remain active. However, this was permitted with the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>The account be made private, thus accessible only to whitelisted employees of the SCP Foundation. <span class="bigtext">[ENACTED]</span></li>
<li>All non-Foundation users whose accounts came into contact with the @mcm_worker account be located and amnesticised. <span class="bigtext">[ENACTED]</span></li>
<li>The content of the account be exhaustively scoured for unethical material. <span class="bigtext">[ENACTED]</span><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">During this investigation it was found that, due to the focus on the topic of SCP-6269, no such material had existed on the account since its inception.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A follow-up report identified that this intervention was successful; no mentions of machinery similar to SCP-6269 have been found online, and employee morale was found to be ethically augmented by the existence of the account.</p>

<p>There are those who look upon <a href="/admonition" target="_blank">the grandest works of our Foundation, and see only the propensity for failure.</a> They conceive of our greatest achievements, our noblest pursuits, as expressions of our hubris; they foretell our impending doom.</p>
<p>But there are <a href="/scp-6659" target="_blank">no gods to punish us for ascending beyond our station.</a> We will not let others <a href="/scp-6747" target="_blank">dictate our limitations upon pen and paper.</a> Nor shall we <a href="/scp-6820" target="_blank">cower to the beast that screams 'be not.'</a></p>
