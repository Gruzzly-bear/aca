<p>Beach near SCP-7607.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The stretch of beach currently occupied by SCP-7607 has been purchased under a front organization (Sandwich Coast Preserve) under the guise of protecting a habitat for leatherback sea turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>).</p>
<p>Foundation guards disguised as local law enforcement are to patrol SCP-7607's stretch of beach at all times in order to prevent potential trespassers. Should a trespasser evade security measures, they are to be escorted out of the premises and amnesticized appropriately. Testing on SCP-7607 must be first approved by personnel with clearance level 3 or higher. SCP-7607 is to be covered with a tarp to prevent any potential sightings from the public.</p>
<p>The nearby boathouse is to be occupied by at least one "accompanying" individual at all times. Under no circumstances must individuals assigned to accompanying SCP-7607 leave the designated "safe zone" perimeter surrounding it, presently twenty meters. SCP-7607 is to have monthly physical status checks to track its rate of decomposition.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7607 are the remains of an <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unidentified</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> humanoid male, aged between 30-35 years old at its time of death, which are presently located on a stretch of beach in Sandwich, Massachusetts. SCP-7607 is positioned face-down, partially immersed in sand, and is clothed in a beige sweater, beige pants, and Nike-brand sneakers. SCP-7607 and the land surrounding it are unable to be moved by any means. X-rays of SCP-7607 show that its lungs hold a large quantity of sand, and its cause of death has been determined to be asphyxiation.</p>
<p>Despite being dead for upwards of forty years, SCP-7607 is only in a moderate state of decomposition, with most decay being concentrated towards its extremities. Presently, SCP-7607 shows signs of decay which are normally present with cadavers that have been deceased for one week. Advanced observations of SCP-7607 have determined that its rate of decomposition is directly correlated with the proximity of the closest living sapient organism, slowing significantly as one approaches it. If an individual is within twenty meters of SCP-7607, decomposition will slow to a rate of one second<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> per calendar year. This will further abate to approximately one second per eight hundred thousand years once within one meter's distance.</p>

<p>A physical inspection during a routine status check of SCP-7607 revealed a previously undiscovered set of items found within SCP-7607's right sweater pocket. These items included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A folded note</li>
<li>A silver ring adorned with two 10-carat diamonds</li>
<li>A small gilded statuette of an eagle</li>
<li>A pin bearing the flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the note revealed information including SCP-7607's name first name—Robert—which was used to trace back to a 1986 disappearance in Providence, Rhode Island of one Robert Revello, whose physical description at the time of disappearance matches that of SCP-7607. The note also contained the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This note is for Agnes, and is the last thing I'll ever write.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Agnes, if you are reading this, you've read the note I left in your apartment. I want to explain some things. You are, more than likely, wondering what has happened to me. I've had a <em>lot</em> of time to ruminate on this, and yet, I am still not sure of the answer. This whole thing could just be a delusion in my mind. I'm half convinced that once this is all over I'll just wake up at home in my bed. I'm not sure if I even want that at this point though.</p>
<p>To put things short, I messed with something I really shouldn't have. I got desperate and resorted to buying some of those shady third-party pills, the kind that keep you all awake and energized. At least, I <em>thought</em> that's what they were for. Whatever, I took them. Wasn't a good idea in the long run as I have come to figure out. I took them at around 8:45, and they really kicked in at 9:08. Well, to be exact, 9:08:30—the second I have spent an utterly unfathomable amount of time within since. The entire world very suddenly became frozen except for me. Well—I say the world was frozen—in actuality, I'm fairly certain that it's <em>me</em> who is going <em>incredibly</em> fast.</p>
<p>It would be useless for me to try and remember the first few moments. All I can really recall is an intense feeling of dread, and then boredom, which languidly transformed into a rotten thrill after the first few "years". As I quickly found out, not much functions as it should when everything is frozen in place. I couldn't sail a ship or fly a plane across the sea, but that wasn't a worry, as the water's surface tension didn't even break beneath my step. Combustion engines don't quite work either, so walking and cycling it is. It did make travel quite slow; however, I happened to have all the time in the world.</p>
<p>I believe that, by now, I've probably stepped foot on every square meter of land on the entire planet. I've learned every language that I could to fluency, and I could tell you the exact top secret coordinates of NATO and the Soviet Union's entire nuclear arsenal. I won't though, don't worry. If you gave me a bit of time, I could probably recite the entire 200 some-odd million items kept in the British Library from memory. I even had a running gag where I'd correct every single clock I could find to be exact to the second, and there came to be a moment where I couldn't even find any more clocks to fix.</p>
<p>If I had to estimate, I'd say I've been in this state for 500,000, maybe upwards of 900,000 "years". It's been at least 100,000, that's for sure. I'm not positive that I've hit a million yet though.</p>
<p>The gold eagle statuette I've left for you is an item I took straight from the oval office desk, right in front of the eyes of Reagan. The flag pin was unfastened straight from the coat of Gorbachev by yours truly. And the ring, that's a very special gift that I got just for you, since I never got the chance to get one for you before this whole deal. I know you were never a fan of expensive gifts, but hopefully you make an exception just this once.</p>
<p>After the era of thrill came the epoch of loneliness, which I find myself in now. Highways filled with still cars, shopping malls packed with motionless crowds, and the incredible silence, it all gets to you. I could write another 100 pages on the silence, but I'll save you the hours of reading. Astoundingly, I hadn't even thought of suicide until relatively recently. I think I've simply ran out of things to <em>do</em>. Long ago, I had this mentality that at some point, time would begin to resume—maybe slowly at first—but I'd eventually find myself living a normal life once again. This never came though, and ultimately, I ran out of hope, and if it <em>does</em> come, I'm not sure I'd want to stick around for it anymore. Even despite the mental toll, I'd probably be killed anyways because of how much I know. Especially after rifling through Reagan's desk and reading away at all those juicy top secret documents.</p>
<p>For a while I wondered how to do it. A gun wouldn't work, it would take far too long. Even after the hundreds of hours I would spend just waiting for the bullet to connect with my skin, I'd have to patiently sit and experience the excruciating pain as the hot bullet slowly drilled its way into my skull. No thank you. Bleeding out would probably work given everything inside of me still seems to function as it should, but I'm way too squeamish for that. Ultimately, I think suffocation is likely going to be my method.</p>
<p>So, after all that, just know, as I am sitting on this beach—the location of our first date—that I am ready, and I will have escaped painlessly. I want you to know also, that I never stopped thinking about you. I've spent countless hours just staring into your eyes. I wish I could have spent more.</p>
<p>Until we meet again, know that my love for you will endure, unchanging and eternal. I hope that we can one day spend eternity together—I am waiting for you.</p>
<p>I check my watch one last time.</p>
<p>9:08:31.</p>
<p>I love you,<br/>
Robert</p>

<p>"Agnes", as specified in the note, was ultimately inferred to be Agnes Hamilton, the partner of Revello. Attempts at contacting Hamilton, designated PoI-7607, proved unsuccessful, as she had died in 1991 as a result of pneumonia.</p>
<p>No supplementary message relating to SCP-7607 as implied in the note was found in the apartment previously inhabited by PoI-7607, nor in the possession of any of her family members. Records indicate PoI-7607 was otherwise unnoteworthy.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Following the previous discoveries of the note and its accompanying paraphernalia, various tests were approved in order to further inspect SCP-7607's remains. One of these deeper analyses included an experimental method of field fMRI<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, which revealed that numerous parts of SCP-7607's brain were still active.</p>
<p>Further scans show that the active areas of SCP-7607's brain include regions which are generally involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, and processing emotions such as loneliness, sadness, love, and others. Further tests revealed more activity within the cerebellum and other regions, which, together, are associated with the feeling of pain among similar sensations.</p>
<p>It is currently inconclusive whether SCP-7607 is conscious and if it is still under its previous temporal effects.</p>
