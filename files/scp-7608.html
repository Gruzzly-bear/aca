<p>An SCP-7608 device in its dormant state</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7608</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7608 are to be contained in standard anomalous item lockers with their associated discs. Discs are only to be removed from SCP-7608 in the event of testing. SCP-7608 is not to be handled by personnel with previous or current musical or theater backgrounds.</p>
<p>In the event of an SCP-7608 activation, staff are to be monitored for exposure to cognitohazardous material, and are to affirm that the songs of their youth have long since ended.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7608 refers to a collection of anomalously modified Panasonic SL-S250C Portable CD Players and discs. Although inert while dormant, when activated, SCP-7608 plays a pre-recorded track, prompting the listener to repeat a collection of instructions.</p>
<p>Digital analysis of the recording has led to the theory that SCP-7608 acts as an aid to the listener's musical ability. This theory is based on the patterns of distribution surrounding SCP-7608, and the mention of an upcoming concert or musical production in a majority of collected instances. Further analysis has revealed cognitohazardous distortions, in the form of background noise, that directly affects areas of the brain responsible for self-identity and memory.</p>
<p>SCP-7608 was distributed from the late 90s to the early 00s by a company known as Syncope, a reputable seller operating beyond the Veil. Devices recovered prior to distribution include discs labeled with the name of the destination school, followed by 'rehearsal tape'. It is theorized that SCP-7608 has the potential to affect upwards of 1 in 9 individuals under the age of 18 in the United States. At the time of this article's creation, only 1/3 of distributed SCP-7608 devices have entered containment.</p>
<p>The first recovered footage of SCP-7608 in use was a Youtube video flagged by MTF ETA-11 "Savage Beasts" Euryd.AIC for anomalous content. Although the name of the channel was corrupted, the video, titled <em>The Curtain Call Never Came</em>, was uploaded as part of a series of song covers and monologues. The video had around 23 views before it was removed— few will remember it existed at all.</p>

<p><em>&lt;A hand is moved from in front of the camera. A girl sits at her desk, leaning forward and muttering to herself. After a moment, she leans back and smiles.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Hello, everyone! My name is [DATA CORRUPTED], a rising senior at Kendale Lakes High, and this is my last video before auditions. &lt;She sighs.&gt; Now, I was talking with Ms. Rickers, and she could tell I was… nervous.</p>
<p><em>&lt;She laughs awkwardly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I mean, how could I not be; senior year and the best I've done is ensemble. This is the only chance I have left to show everyone how hard I've been working. <em>&lt;She clears her throat.&gt;</em> Anyways, she gave me this—</p>
<p><em>&lt;She holds SCP-7608 up to the camera.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> — she said it would help guide me, said she used it when she was the star of her high school's show which, don't get her started on. I barely made the bus in time; she would have told me about every single scene if I didn't stop her.</p>
<p><em>&lt;A pause.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> But time goes on; she had her chance, so now it's my turn to be remembered.</p>
<p><em>&lt;She sets SCP-7608 on the desk and presses 'play'. After a moment, it creaks and whirs, before softening to a crackling noise.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> Repeat after me.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Alright! <em>&lt;A pause.&gt;</em> Oh, my bad. <em>Repeat after me.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> [DATA CORRUPTED].</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-7608 goes silent, the soft, steady sound of snare drums is heard. [DATA CORRUPTED] shakes her head. Her pupils dilate, and the music stops.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> When the year has ended, where will I remain in their memories?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> […]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> A name in ink in a yearbook? An example of a shining student in class or theater? Or will I leave entirely without making a wave?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Guys, isn't this so—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> I said. Repeat. After. Me. Again.</p>
<p><em>&lt;She tenses her shoulders and looks into the camera.&gt;</em></p>
<p>???: […]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> When these halls empty in May, fleeting friends and teachers gone, what will be left to see?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> […] (Whispering) Geez, what a bummer.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> There will be nothing worth seeing, for you never saw what you had.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> […]</p>
<p><em>&lt;The camera glitches; when the picture returns, [DATA CORRUPTED]'s eyes are blurred. She does not react.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> When the encore ends, faceless audience clapping, what will be left to say?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> […]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> There will be nothing worth saying, for you have wasted your words and your time on a juvenile dream.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The camera glitches; [DATA CORRUPTED]'s mouth is blurred. She does not react.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> And under the flood lights, when the home team triumphs, and the band plays its victory tunes, what will be left to hear?</p>
<p><em>&lt;All ambient noise goes silent. An instrumental version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kne52cbPHho">The Four Seasons' "December, 1963"</a> begins to play softly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> Only then will <em>we</em> crowd the field, singing all at once in remembrance of the best night of our lives.</p>
<p><em>&lt;[DATA CORRUPTED] sways at her desk. The sound of casual conversation can be heard from the tape; voices talk about half time, the quarterback, seeing a movie in town. [DATA CORRUPTED]'s voice can be heard on the recording, rehearsing lines and warming up with scales. This goes on for approximately 4 minutes and 30 seconds until the song ends.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7608:</strong> And we will live on in <em>your</em> memory forever more.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-7608 goes silent as [DATA CORRUPTED] begins to cry. The recording continues for an additional 5 minutes before ending.&gt;</em></p>
