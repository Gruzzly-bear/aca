<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6642 is housed in a standard humanoid containment cell. Any changes in its appearance should be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6642 is a metamorphic entity of extraterrestrial origin. It is able to take a form similar to that of select species that it views; however, it cannot change its coloration or the size and shape of its eyes. Although it is able to return to previous forms, these forms will often possess distortions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-6642 possesses six eyes arranged in an irregular pattern. Testing has shown that it is unable to change the arrangement of said eyes. Its skin remains green in each form, and its hair or fur is black.</p>
<p>When SCP-6642 takes the form of an intelligent organism, it will gain an understanding of the languages known by the individual it copied.</p>
<p>Known forms taken by SCP-6642 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extraterrestrial species possessing six legs and a thin abdominal region. Its head was similar to that of <em>Eurypharynx pelecanoides</em>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Sabrina Kaye</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview was conducted following initial containment of SCP-6642.</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Kaye. Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> No, not really. Most of the things people call me are insults.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Oh, uh, alright. Mind if I call you 6642?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> As good a name as any. With that out of the way, why have I already been arrested? I haven't done anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Yet? Okay, it doesn't matter. Where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Some planet called…</p>
<p>[SCP-6642 makes strangled noises.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Uh, okay, I'm not gonna be able to pronounce it with these vocal cords. Big volcanic planet; not really suitable for your species, given your fragility.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> So why'd you come here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Same reason I go to every planet; I needed to leave the last one.</p>
<p>[A pause.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Turns out I'm wanted by some interplanetary police or something? Anyway, doesn't matter right now. No one ever comes here, so I'm probably safe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Right… How do you travel between planets?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I usually steal a ship. They don't… usually crash so easily.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> And how many planets have you been to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Lost count a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Look, it was believable up until the interplanetary police part. Why did you really come here? How do you know any human language, anyway?</p>
<p>[SCP-6642 shrugs.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I really am seeking safety here. You don't need to believe me. As for the language bit, I dunno. I just learn languages as I take forms.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Oh, right, your abilities. Can you show me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I mean, not right now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> I'd assume the restraints wouldn't stop you from-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> No, I'm injured, dumbfuck. I don't really wanna make that worse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Didn't you take the form of a human after you crashed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Yeah, and now it hurts to move.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Eh. I don't really feel like talking today.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> I'll make this quick. What'd your original form look like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> It's pretty simple. I've been taking other forms for as long as I can remember. I don't know what I was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> That doesn't bother you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I mean, it does a little bit, but there's no use in worrying about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Alright, then. What-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Hey, I have a question for you. Why am I here? You didn't answer me last time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Well, uh, the short answer is that you're not normal.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> Kind of a shitty reason to imprison someone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> It's more complicated than that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I'm sure it is. Look, all you have to say is that my kind isn't welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> For what it's worth, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> [sarcastically] Great, thanks. I feel so much better now.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Great. First, did you have any family? Are there more of your kind out there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> I was… abandoned as a child. So, uh, I don't really know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kaye:</strong> Do you know why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6642:</strong> People tend to dislike me. It is what it is; I can't change it now.</p>
