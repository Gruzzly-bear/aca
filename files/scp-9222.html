<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Divorce proceedings are to continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>As SCP-9222 died in 1933, containment is no longer necessary. Further details on its life may still be reclaimed from the diaries of SCP-9222's manager, 'Mr. Altair'. The Rising Sun Opera House has been condemned and is currently being exorcised by the Traumatic Place Task Force (TPTF).</p>
<p>All efforts are to be made to recover exactly which anomalies were contained by SCP-9222 and any possible effects it may have had on them. SCP-9222's technology is to be reverse engineered and integrated with existing Foundation containment processes when safe and prudent. In the event an individual previously staffed to SCP-9222 is discovered, Class-Z mnestics are to be used to restore their memory of the facility.</p>
<p>Until Captain Altair returns from SCP-9222's core, nothing about the anomaly can be confirmed. However, in the likely event that Altair is unable to disprove the ANEMOIA conjecture, Foundation publicists are to determine a way to inform the anomalous community that space has always been screaming.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-9222 is Alice Starr, a non-anomalous human being related through unknown means to SCP-9222-1, an anomalous event/killing that occurred on June 4th, 1929. The victim, an as yet unidentified woman, was found brutalized in the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge in New Orleans. Her eyes were noted to be heavily damaged, though other traumas were additionally present. The primary suspect is a Mr. Adam Altair, director of the local 'Rising Sun' opera house. Altair reported the body within 2 hours of death, despite its remote location, and refused to explain why he was in the refuge. Notably, Altair died in 1955. SCP-9222 possessed some known relation to Altair, though it is unknown if she was involved in the murder.<br/></p>
<p>SCP-9222 is Foundation Blacksite L13, a blackbox facility in New Orleans built in/under the city proper. A relevant excerpt is attached below.</p>

<p><strong>Structure:</strong> The above-ground section is built out of the destitute 'Rising Sun' Opera House, which closed in 1935. The building was abandoned and eventually condemned. At some point after this, it was purchased by the Foundation and renovated. The above-ground section is constructed primarily of offices.</p>
<p>The below-ground section is built under and into the sewer system, which was meticulously cleaned and transformed into a containment apparatus. No contained anomalies remain, nor do any records of containment. 360 Containment Chambers are visible and fully functional<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Covers:</strong> The above-ground section likely masqueraded as an opera house, potentially commissioning anartists. The Foundation has reached out to both Pseudogenisis Productions and Are We Cool Yet? Both organizations vehemently deny any interaction with or knowledge of the site, however.</p>
<p>The below-ground section likely did not need a cover.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong> L13 was never officially founded, and no records of it (prior to its rediscovery on June 4th, 2025) exist. The Overseer Council denies any involvement in the creation of the site.</p>
<p>It is unknown how long L13 has been abandoned, estimates range from 3 to 60 years.</p>

<p>Cecilia Borres (1993 - Present) is a famed journalist and news anchor. She rose to prominence by writing economic articles in New York, but ultimately abandoned her column after the 2008 financial crisis. She subsequently moved to New Orleans and began writing for the local news while working on a fantasy novel in her free time.</p>

<p>Famed singer Alice Starr was reported missing last weekend by her partner, who has asked to remain anonymous. Starr frequented many local bars and restaurants; most notably Pensa's Place in downtown New Orleans; in order to study human behavior and get inspiration for her songs.</p>
<p>In her free time, she was getting into painting, often visiting local workshops and learning different styles. She could also be seen at various parks and trails walking her dog, Anemo.</p>
<p>According to her partner, Starr was last seen visiting the Audubon Planetarium, and left the following note before leaving:</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="width: var(--thinWidth); margin: 3rem;">
<p>To whom it may concern,<br/>

<strong>Captain:</strong> Adam Altair<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> June 4th, 2929</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
<p>Day 1.</p>
<p>I have officially taken control of the Sunrise. It is meant to crew eight, today it crews one. I am alone. The purpose of this was not explained to me, though I might guess: they don't expect me to survive.</p>
<p>I cannot in good faith say this is an incorrect assumption.</p>
<p>So, if I am to die, let the purpose of my death be explicitly clear. Here's everything we know about SCP-9222:<br/>
- It was discovered in the early 2500's by Foundation exploratory vessels.<br/>
- A 2000 AU zone of restricted space was created around it as a temporary containment measure.<br/>
- This subsequently became the permanent containment measure.</p>
<p>And so it remained for half a millennium, snatching up the occasional poor stargazer, but never doing any real damage. That is until it started to scream. A monitoring station, L13, had been built on the edge of the restricted zone to ward off any ships that approached or to prepare them for the journey if they chose to continue. L13 recently began receiving radio signals from the star, it sounded like a woman screaming, however, there were patterns, meaning, the messages were decrypted.</p>
<p>I've attached these messages (there have only been two so far) for posterity.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="strongtext"><tt>COULD YOU LOVE YOURSELF IF YOU HAD TO?</tt></span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="strongtext"><tt>WHAT DID YOU DO TO DESERVE THIS?</tt></span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Any anomaly, however insignificant, would raise concern if its behavior changed after nearly 500 years, not to mention the most powerful cognitohazard ever known. It is no surprise that they sent me to investigate, frankly I'm surprised they didn't send an army.</p>
<p>I am leaving this message, and the prior details specifically, in case I fail. For my successor to know that I underestimated 9222 and paid dearly. If you are reading this, then I have failed.</p>
<p>To my successor: If I have failed, and you have in some stroke of luck discovered my body, please take me back to Earth. Bury me in New Orleans. I always wanted to go, I guess I never found the time.</p>
<p>On a more pleasant note, the amount of board games in the ship borders on the absurd. There are probably more games than actual machines. They have all my favorites from childhood, even Catan, there's even a little AIC in the game that can play with me. This, coupled with my actual duties of scrubbing rusty metal and lashing pipes together ensure I will not be bored.</p>
<p>I am quite certain I will be lonely.</p>

<h1 id="toc7"><span>Medical Report</span></h1>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>On June 4th, 2025, Department of Astronomy Researcher Dr. Adam Altair was found in his office, unconscious, slumped over his desk. He was holding the day's newspaper and was covered in his own blood. The following items were found in the room with him:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>One copy of 'The New Orleans Herald', headline: 'FAMED SINGER MISSING'.</li>
<li>An uncut record.
<ul>
<li>Of note, no record players exist within the office.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A game of settlers of Catan. Almost complete, however the 'Robber' piece is missing.</li>
<li>A broken ruby wedding ring, smashed beyond repair.</li>
<li>A teaspoon, with which Altair attempted to remove his own eyes.
<ul>
<li>This has been deemed the primary source of the blood.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Altair was quickly brought to the nearest Foundation medical facility and treated with epinephrine, opioids, and depressants. An invasive scan was performed on his brain which determined that while he was <em>not</em> under the influence of a cognitohazard, he <em>was</em> afflicted with a powerful antimeme, requiring a CRV of <span class="strongtext"><tt>1929</tt></span> to resist (Altair did not possess this).</p>
<p>An untested treatment plan was proposed and performed in which Altair was continually sedated and exposed to increasing doses of mnestics. This plan persisted over nearly 2 weeks culminating in a dose of 3 parts Class-Y and 1 part Class-Z Mnestic. After this, and the stabilization of Altair's vitals, he was allowed to awaken. A trusted figure was brought in to interrogate him, his boss, Charlie Laplace, was selected.</p>

<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Okay. Question 1: Why'd you try and scoop out your own eyes?</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Come on, Adam, do you really expect me to believe that? You've taken enough mnestics to choke a horse, you haven't forgotten shit.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I'm not hiding anything, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Can you explain the copy of Settlers of Catan on your desk?</p>
<p><em>Altair takes several seconds to realize that she is serious, before laughing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about, I haven't played Catan since I was twelve.</p>
<p><em>Laplace nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> What about the wedding ring?</p>
<p><em>Altair laughs again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I have never been married.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> What <em>can</em> you tell me about that morning?</p>
<p><em>Altair shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Not much, it was routine. I got up at six-fifteen, went for a swim, got dressed, grabbed a macchiato and a newspaper, and drove to the office.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> And what was on the newspaper?</p>
<p><em>Altair pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Think harder.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I can try.</p>
<p><em>Altair closes his eyes, concentrating. Within a few seconds, his body begins to shake. A trickle of blood runs down from his nose, he doesn't notice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Adam, are you okay?</p>
<p><em>Altair nods, but does not speak. He grips the bed's sidebar tightly and squeezes. He shakes more violently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Let me know if you need something.</p>
<p><em>Several minutes pass, during which Altair's body continues to seize and gyre.</em></p>
<p><em>Altair looks up, his eyes watering. He abruptly ceases motion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I remember, kind of. It was about this missing girl, the headline, I mean, it was about her. Her name was… Alice, I think, Alice Starr.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Why would that headline make you pass out in your office?</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I don't know. I just remember reading the article and… missing her. I still do right now, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I don't know. I've never met her.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Okay, then. Maybe I'll try this again tomorrow. Sleep well, Adam.</p>
<p><em>Laplace stands to leave.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Wait. I remember something else. A name, a facility, 'Blacksite L13'. That's where she is, she was kidnapped.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> I see. Do you know who took her?</p>
<p><em>Altair nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Yeah. We did.</p>

<p><strong>Altair:</strong> So I built this place brick by brick, but it wasn't the first. The Rising Sun Public House, in London, built by my old man. It was a place of debauchery, worse even than this. He'd turn people's vices against them and milk em' for coin.

<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Alright, I'm here. Traffic was hell. What can you tell me about this place?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Really? You had 24 hours and you found nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> I checked the DEEPWELLs, the AIC logs, I even asked the library, not a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> The Foundation can't fuck with DEEPWELLs, so we know this place wasn't buried on purpose. This is the work of an anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> How many anomalies can overwrite a DEEPWELL?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Not many. Less than ten I think. Most of them were above my clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Altair</strong> Fun.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> What's the view on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Boring, actually. I'll send a proper report soon.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Alright. One last thing.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> I did ask a few of the more powerful AICs we have, and they were able to corollate the phrase 'Blacksite L-13' to 'Project ANEMOIA'. Of course, no records of that exist, but I'd reckon it's what you're looking for.</p>

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>The parking lot is expansive and in abnormally good repair. There are a few cracks, of course, but nothing to suggest the profound disuse the place doubtlessly suffers from.</p>
<p>The lot itself is abandoned, but the surrounding area isn't. There are many businesses (and many cars) around the place, it is only the lot itself that's empty. I must wonder if this is due to an antimemetic effect (I have taken additional mnestics in preparation of this eventuality) or if it is simply an urban myth that keeps people away. This place surely has picked up a couple rumors over the decades, after all.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>There are no signs of any anomalies yet, but something is off. I get the distinct feeling that I am being watched. Additionally, I parked near a streetlight and heard quite the racket coming from it. I broke open the plastic shell around the internals with my car-jack. Inside, I saw many many gears, churning noisily (I am grateful this place is abandoned, or a civilian would certainly have heard them at some point). I cannot guess as to what purpose the mass of machinery could possibly serve, but I am certain it is not to power a streetlight. Of note, once they were revealed, the gears powered down and came to a still. I doubt they were truly reacting to <em>me</em>, though I admit I found it disconcerting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>The fence, if that's what you choose to call it, has become rather ineffective at keeping people out. It is tattered with holes. This is clearly not the first time it has fallen into disrepair. At some point the old fence became too damaged (it is a simple, short thing with limited barbed wire, perhaps security needs simply increased), and they replaced it with the second fence. This too has become damaged with time.</p>
<p>I did a brief perimeter sweep to see if I could find any easy entrances to the compound, and from there a side entrance to the facility proper (I suspect walking in the main door would be a terrible decision). I was presented with a great number of choices to make my entrance, the fence is ravaged. People may not come here, but animals certainly do. That said, I have not heard any birdsongs or other signs of life since I arrived.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>A few things of note. One: I am over 3 kilometers from my car. The path from the parking lot to the facility was disturbingly long. I monitored for signs of non-Euclidean geometry but came up blank. That said, I am certain the original opera house would not have been built this way. Even if the geometry is now stable, something must have altered it. The surrounding forest of the path is clearly ancient, however, so surely the facility was not moved recently.</p>
<p>Two: I did find a single sign, the only writing in the surrounding area. It was unique and heavily damaged. It read: '<strong>Keep Out. Nothing you can do here is as important as returning home. People love you. If you enter these premises your life and soul are forfeit. No known religion is capable of protecting you from what's within. You are not exempt from suffering.</strong></p>

<p>I have entered the facility. I don't really know what to call the place I'm in now. I'm going with 'mudroom', since it has benches and coat racks and closets, though 'entrance hall' could work just as well. I have, accordingly, taken off my coat and my muddy boots. I see my error, of course, it is entirely possible that I will be leaving in a rush, through some other entrance, and therefore not be able to recover my items. That said, when entering places like this I find it better to follow the customs, as breaking from them often results in far worse things than a lost coat (and a subsequent trip to REI).</p>
<p>What's strange is that the lights are still on, and the place is by and large clean. I'd do the car-jack trick again on the walls but I don't want to make too much noise. I have no way of knowing if I'm truly alone, and, judging by the sign outside, I'm not.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>I am now faced with the opportunity of going up, or down, knowing full well that I will probably not be able to return here, if prior experience is anything to go by. I feel very strongly that I should go up, it is brighter, less damp, and I can escape through a window should the worst come to pass. This is the tactical choice, it is not the one I am making.</p>
<p>I will go down. I am searching for a secret, and those tend to be buried in the deepest possible places.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>I find myself at a nursery. This is not altogether unexpected. Large Foundation sites, which L13 certainly was, very commonly contain nurseries. Researchers live on site, have kids, stuff happens. The oddity comes from this particular nursery. It is profoundly old, decades older than the site. Older than the original opera house itself. The place stinks to high heaven, something is rotting but I cannot guess what. I cannot imagine why this place was created in its current state. It contains capacity for only 4 children, the average Foundation nursery should be able to hold over a hundred.</p>
<p>Stranger still is that 3 of the beds have severely decayed, but one hasn't. The sheets are ruffled and dust has not settled in. Someone has slept here recently.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>I pried further into the used bed. Didn't find much at first, until I checked under the pillow. There was a human eye, severed violently. I am leaving this room, something in my gut finds it deeply uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Once I closed the door, I heard the brief wail of a baby come from within. I did not hear this when I first approached. It was quickly silenced. I could have sworn I heard a 'shush'. I think I made a good choice by taking off my shoes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none">

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>I am in an armory. It is very standard, exactly as you'd expect. It's maybe the first thing I've seen that is as I'd expect. It is this prospect I find the most unsettling. It has all the standard munitions, though no records. I can't find any mission case files, nor any inkling of the men who used to use this room. In a place so otherwise untouched, it seems strange that the files specifically are what has been taken.</p>
<p>I am sorely tempted to use this opportunity to arm myself. I, of course, am armed with a standard Foundation handgun, though that is a small ordinance compared to what I find on these walls. I cannot tell if taking a gun would upset this place, or if it would simply be following the customs as I did in the mudroom. This is a dilemma, there is no right answer, but only in one answer do I get a gun, it hangs now from my belt.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>In terms of oddities, there is one, the bullets. Almost all the heavy weapon ammo is gone (though mercifully not that of the high caliber pistol I selected), the casings remain, piled up in drawers, but the payloads are gone. It is like every bullet has been used.</p>
<p>Stranger still is what accompanies the casings. Crosses, Stars of David, and other assorted religious iconography, enormous amounts of it. It is like after the bullets ran out, they tried turning to these symbols as surrogates. It is possible that this explains the religious connotations of the sign outside, though I somewhat doubt it. My gut tells me that that sign warns of something I have not yet seen.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> June 11th, 2929</p>

<p>Day 8.</p>
<p>To my successor (I have less and less doubt that there will be one),</p>
<p>I can confidently say you do not need to worry about other ships. I encountered the <em>Laplace</em>, but they did not try to board me.</p>
<p>They never could have, they were already dead. Protocol HOTSPOON was sent to them, and they used it. I toured the vessel (after donning a blindfold, to be safe). Every crewman was dead. The protocol had been done to the letter. I will spare you the gory details (read the protocol yourself if you want them), but suffice to say: I will never forget the image. Two dozen hollow sockets for a dozen hollow men.</p>
<p>I left the damned ship and resumed my voyage, but I grow fearful. I see now the trap they've put me in, why they did not send anyone else. I am a sacrifice. I do not know if they (our Foundation) have fallen under its influence, or if it is simply a test, a human experiment to see what happens when human makes physical contact with the star. I do not know which answer I'd prefer.</p>
<p>Either way, the plan is clear. If I look outside, if I learn anything of my surroundings, I am doomed. I cannot even know when I approach the star, and I cannot turn around. Thus, my fate becomes evident: I am to fly into it. I see now why such powerful energy shields were built around the vessel. Why the cabin is so small compared to the hull. They want me to respond to its signals, and the only place where that can be safely done is inside it (under the assumption that it will not harm itself just to get me, in the same way a person would not tear through their own ribcage to catch a bug inside).</p>
<p>If you are reading this, then I am dead. Whether I have failed or not is immaterial, if I lived to tell the tale they would not send someone to retrieve this log. So take my advice: If I have failed, if 9222 still exists and you are on a mission to it, turn back. It is not worth it. You are a sacrifice. There are people that love you, go be with them.</p>
<p>As for me, I have made my peace. I have not been loved in a very long time.</p>
<p>Godspeed.</p>

<p>PS. I have attached HOTSPOON to this log for you. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.</p>

1. Obtain acceptable spoon implement (see <tt>FIGURE 1.1</tt>). Alternatives include but are not limited to: fingernail clippers, lemon juicer, melon baller, scissors, kitchen knives, twine.<br/>
2. Immobilize target using non-lethal methods (expiration must not occur until after protocol).<br/>
3. Using pliers, bend back and fold the targets eyelids, tearing is acceptable.<br/>
4. Apply eyedrops to moisten and lubricate the eyes for ease of extraction.<br/>
5. Apply implement to eye socket. For most implements, slip them under the eyeball until they make contact with the optic nerve. Apply torque until you hear a <em>pop</em>. In special cases, (such as the lemon juicer), simply penetrate the eye and churn its interior until it releases its fluids.<br/>
6. Cripple the optic nerve<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup>.

<p>I wish I'd kept my fucking shoes.</p>
<p>After the armory, I descended further, down the next staircase. I'm sure I'm missing huge swaths of the site, but my goal is at the bottom so that's where I'm going.</p>
<p>Eventually, that staircase dropped off, and here I am in this flooded tunnel. It is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere, but it also the first time that I don't feel watched since I entered the site. This has two disturbing implications. One: The feeling was something actually watching me, and it refused to follow me down here. Was it maybe too big? Or was it afraid of something else down here?</p>
<p>The second possibility is that I was being watched by the site itself, if that's somehow possible. This would explain why the gears stopped when I looked at them. If so, why'd it stop looking? Maybe I took a wrong turn, and left the site? I haven't seen any turnoffs though. Maybe I went the totally wrong direction, and it thinks I won't be able to make it back and find its secrets. I do not know, I am not sure I want to.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>As for the hallway itself, it is extensive. I have easily been walking half a mile. It is dark, too, thank god for my flashlight. There is writing on the walls, I'll attach a list below, not much of it means anything, though of course the big question is there too.</p>
<p>What springs to mind the most is the source of the flooding. I can guess from the smell: its sewage, but why is it here? Why was that even a possibility? This wasn't meant to be a sewage tunnel, it was connected directly to the other floors, it was even listed on signs as 'path to bottom section'. Who builds their site connected to a sewer system?</p>
</div>
<p>Phrases on the walls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="strongtext"><tt>WHAT DID YOU DO TO DESERVE THIS?</tt></span><br/>
<span class="strongtext"><tt>COULD YOU LOVE YOURSELF IF YOU HAD TO?</tt></span><br/>
<span class="strongtext"><tt>WHAT HAPPENED TO ALICE STARR?</tt></span></p>

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>I have officially transferred from confused to baffled. I have found the boiler room. It is enormous, dozens and dozens of machines. One of them pumps water.</p>
<p>It pumps water. Into the tunnel. On purpose. That means they intentionally built the tunnel into the other half of the facility to be flooded with water.</p>
<p>Neat.</p>
<p>I'm way too scared to touch anything here, though I did find a map of the underground. Almost all the water is pumped through the tunnel into an absolutely enormous chamber about another quarter mile from here, but one single pipe shoots off into an area I've no idea how to access. It's labeled "Director's Office".</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>Now, I haven't seen any keycards anywhere, but I figured the director's office would probably be locked up, so I decided to check. I found a computer terminal and asked "is the directors office locked?"</p>
<p>It responded "Yes. Director Keycard Required."</p>
<p>Now, I haven't seen any bodies from which I could liberate a keycard, but in case it comes up, I wanted to know who to 'look for'. I asked "who's the director?"</p>
<p>"Adam Altair, Containment Specialist."</p>
<p>This is odd for several reasons. One, why am I the director of the site? And two, why am I a 'containment specialist?' I'm a researcher at the Department of Astronomy, I've never been on the containment team for an anomaly, and I'm certainly no director. It is deeply disconcerting.</p>
<p>At least the feeling of being watched hasn't returned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none">

<div class="genbox highlight" style="margin-left: var(--docHighlightMargin);">
<p>I found what the water is going to, and I found out how L13 contained its anomalies.</p>
<p>It's basically a lazy river, huge in scope I'm sure. It must stretch for miles. Most of it not human accessible, or at least I couldn't find a way. Floating on the river is 360 (trust me, I counted) big glass tubes. They are a little bit shorter than the average person, but much wider. They're labeled "Generalized Containment Chamber".</p>
<p>We have our own version of these. We've been trying to make them work for a while now, and they do, but only a little. Our top-end ones are designed to handle virtually all Safe and Euclid anomalies, and some Keters, but not much else. These ones can handle seemingly anything, Safe, Euclid, Keter, Tiamat, and this one weird esoteric class called 'Salem'. I'm sure they can handle more than just these, but those are the ones explicitly listed.</p>
<p>I don't know where they got them but, judging from the size of the circuitry alone (via a quick estimate of the chip size and Moore's law), they're at least 200 years more advanced then our own.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>This at least answers one of the most burning questions I had about this place. It bears all the signs of a research and containment facility, but seemingly lacked the actual containment part. There were so many corners that I should have turned and found myself staring at a immense steel door labeled 'Containment Zone', and instead met benches, potted plants, and, if I was lucky, a water cooler.</p>
<p>There are no signs of any anomalies ever actually being contained here, of course. No records, no refuse, no scratches. No dust. Nothing to indicate these machines aren't straight from the box, bar one: a small wooden piece in the corner of one of the tanks, it was pure luck I spotted it. I didn't get a great look, but I think it was a robber from Settlers of Catan, weird.</p>
<p>The only left for me to do now (without turning back of course), is to check out the director's office. Hopefully, the prior director kept good notes.</p>

<p><em>Altair shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I guess.</p>
<p><em>She nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Let me tell you a story. Before I was a singer, I was a cloister girl. Lived in a convent. Never took the nun vows, of course, but I was still 'holy', if that's the word you want to use. I prayed for hours every day, and you know what? Never got anything to show for it. God never stepped in. Didn't stop my dad from working himself to death, stop my mother from being hit by that car, my brother from getting stoned and then shot.</p>
<p><em>She gazes briefly at the officer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> I went to three funerals the year of my 20th birthday, and something inside me broke. I left the cloister, shopped around for other gods, tried the hits, I just wanted an explanation I think. None came, ever.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> You saying you don't believe in god?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> I'm saying it doesn't matter. If there are any gods, they're way out there in the void.</p>
<p><em>She gazes up at the stars.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> They can't hear us, and they sure as hell don't talk back.</p>
<p><em>Altair laughs a little.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Are you trying to comfort me?</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> My point is: I went to those funerals, I lost myself in it, I lost everything, and I went to bed on a shitty ash-stained waterbed, and then… I woke up. Life happens, nothing can change that. But then the sun still rises. Tomorrow still comes.</p>
<p><strong>Laplace:</strong> Go to your show, Adam. Maybe it'll be shit, maybe it'll be art, but then you'll be done with it. You will have done <em>something</em>, however awful, and then the sun will rise, and you'll start again.</p>

<p>I have ejected this at the point of no return. If you are reading this, then either the star is dead, or it is too late for you. If the latter proves true, then I am sorry.</p>
<p>I do not know if the star has continued to communicate, I cannot check until I am inside. I must simply pray the ship's armor holds.</p>
<p>If I have succeeded, then I assume this rust bucket is still floating out there, and on-board you will find my body. I have changed my will. Do not take me to New Orleans, I am not strong enough, I think. I don't care where I end up, so long as it is not there.</p>
<p>I can feel the heat building. I am entering the corona now.</p>

<p>I expected security, I can't say I expected this. The door is huge, monolithic even. You could drive a car through it. I don't really know what I expect to find inside.</p>
<p>One silver lining is that this part of the underground is not flooded, it's maybe the only part, but it's nice. My feet aren't dry and prune-y anymore.</p>
<p>Of additional note, when I was walking down the tunnel to here, I heard the sounds of machinery, but they don't seem to be present anymore. It is almost upsettingly quiet.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>As for the lock on the door, it is unpickable, at least in the time I have. An alternative is necessary. There is a keycard slot, but I still haven't found any bodies from which to take one.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You are fucking kidding me. I held my own card up to the reader, as a gaff, and it unlocked. Made a horrible sound too, the same machinery I heard earlier. The massive doors are being slowly opened by a system of enormous gears, but they are taking a frustratingly long time. I estimate it will take over 5 minutes for the doors to open.</p>

<p>It's not an office. Well, kind of, its a post office, I don't really think that counts.</p>
<p>None of the PO boxes are locked, that's kind of unsurprising given how restricted the office itself is. What's stranger is that they all share the exact same number: PO #1929.</p>
<p>I am working up the courage to open them. The machinery is silent again, but only briefly. The feeling of being watched is back.</p>
<p>It feels… this sounds dumb but I'm gonna say it anyway… it feels like the whole world is holding its breath.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="genbox highlight">
<p>I opened one of them. There were two pieces of paper inside (yes, I tried another box after the first, and a few more after that, they were all empty). One of them was titled 'Project ANEMOIA', I have not read it, I will attach it below.</p>
<p>The other was a letter, addressed to me, from Alice. I still don't know who she is. I am going to read it now, it may shed some light on things.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I remember.</p>

<h1 id="toc21"><span>Project ANEMOIA</span></h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>Author: [unknown]</em><br/>
<em>Date: June 4th, [unknown]</em><br/>
<em>Department(s): Astronomy, Tactical Theology, Memetics, [unknown]</em></p>
</div>
<div style="padding: 2rem">
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> On [unknown date], a asynchronous transmission was detected passing by Earth by the Department of Astronomy. It was found to be flowing backwards in time. It was quickly decrypted, but found to be not only incredibly cognitohazardous, but emitting vast amounts of Akiva Radiation, Tactical Theology and Memetics were brought on to investigate.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Memetics discovered that the ideatic makeup of the message was directly interlaced with that of over 200 other anomalies. A site, L13, was formed for the comprehensive and express examination of the transmission (at this point officially classified as 'SCP-9222'). 9222 was found to be deeply conceptually related to the city of New Orleans, hence, this was chosen as the location for the site.</p>
<p>All related anomalies were relocated to L13 and research came into full force.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>FINDINGS:</strong></p>
<p>Memetics performed a biological analysis, and discovered that the root of the cognitohazard was in the human eye. From this they developed Protocol HOTSPOON in order to counteract it. Additionally, the primary vector for contamination was found, the sentence: '<span class="strongtext"><tt>What happened to Alice Starr?</tt></span>'. This phrase was isolated and detoxified, these combined to form the primary containment method for SCP-9222.</p>
<p>The Department of Tactical Theology focused on the source of the transmission, a distant star, and were able to confirm that SCP-9222 was a quasi-god. While it did possess considerable influence, it was not actually sapient, and could only exert will in the form of repeated patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>The Department of Astronomy performed a historiographic analysis, comparing the 9222 signal to their own data. They found that the signal had been broadcast multiple times, most recently on May 20th, 1964, where it was mistaken as the 'Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation'.</p>
<p>They further broke down the signal, using increasingly sophisticated analysis techniques. They found that it was 98% comprised of human screams (primarily the voice of a man and a woman), and 2% comprised of a song. The song was isolated and found to have been a known recording from July 4th, 1929. They were unable to make further progress on the timeline of SCP-9222.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>END OF PROJECT:</strong> Project ANEMOIA was never officially concluded, and continues in some form to this day. Its current priority is neutralizing a second 9222 related cognitohazard.</p>

<p><strong>Individuals Present:</strong> Mr. Altair, Alice Starr<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> June 4th, 1929.<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> The Rising Sun Opera House</p>

<p><em>Altair is marching upstairs to the main floor of the house. He is muttering under his breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Goddamn [indecipherable].</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Whole fuckin' thing's a [indecipherable].</p>
<p><em>Altair approaches Alice's door.</em></p>
<p><em>He presses a piece of paper onto the door, it sticks there, it reads 'you're fired.'</em></p>
<p><em>He clenches his fists, and then smashes his head into the door.</em></p>
<p><em>It opens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Is everything alright?</p>
<p><em>Altair jumps back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> You… what?</p>
<p><em>She glances at the sign.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> You don't really mean that, do you?</p>
<p><em>Altair shakes his head, still speechless.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I.. uh.. I couldn't find you.</p>
<p><em>She tilts her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Really? I'm not exactly a hard girl to spot.</p>
<p><em>She gestures to herself.</em></p>
<p><em>She is wearing an ruby dress, which shines painfully against the harsh lighting of the backstage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I looked everywhere. The bar, the woods, and further, couldn't find you.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Really? I've been here the whole time, rehearsing. Haven't left once tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Bullshit. I must have knocked on that door a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I don't know what to tell you…</p>
<p><em>She smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Are you sure you were looking for <em>me</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Doesn't matter, the shows about to start! Wish me luck!</p>
<p><em>He smiles, it does not cover his entire face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Altair:</strong> Luck.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> And remember… you've worked really hard to get me here, you've earned this, you deserve it.</p>
<p><em>She smiles before running onto stage.</em></p>

<p>There is a house in New Orleans<br/>
They call the Rising Sun<br/>
And it broke the heart of many a girl,<br/>
And God, I know I'm one</p>
<p>My mother was a traitor<br/>
She sold out to the west,<br/>
My father was a rock star,<br/>
Still wore his Sunday best.</p>
<p>Well the only thing a rock star needs<br/>
Is a million beady eyes<br/>
And they'll say they love him on and on,<br/>
Won't notice when he dies</p>
<p>Oh, mothers, tell your children<br/>
Not to do what I have done<br/>
To spend your lives in sin and misery<br/>
In the house of the rising sun</p>
<p>I got one foot on the platform<br/>
And another on the train<br/>
And I'm going back to New Orleans<br/>
To wear that golden chain</p>
<p>There is a house in New Orleans<br/>

And it broke the heart of many a girl,<br/>
Good God, I'm sure I'm one</p>
