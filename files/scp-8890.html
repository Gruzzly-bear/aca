            <div class='text-content'><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> There is no known way to prevent the manifestation of SCP-8890.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8890 is a shape-changing entity; its known forms include Sus domesticus, Felis catus, and Canis lupus. There have been no sightings of SCP-8890 assuming the form of a primate. The anomaly has been noted as the Beast of Gévaudan, and has been on record since at least 1764.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Howard Smith, currently designated SCP-8890-1, has noted that the aggression of the anomaly is focused on one individual at any given point.</p>
<p>SCP-8890 appears to target a singular individual for long periods of time, during which it will intentionally target persons who have a mutually agreed upon "close relationship" with the individual, in an apparent attempt to cause psychological stress to the targeted individual. SCP-8890 will manifest exclusively when the targeted individual, which is designated as SCP-8890-1, is either in a state of emotional breakdown, or when the targeted individual is isolated. SCP-8890-1 has currently attempted twelve terminations on SCP-8890, sanctioned by Containment Area-112 Directors.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> None have been successful.</p>

Smith, were sent to dispatch SCP-8890, which had manifested as a boar-like creature near a small settlement in rural Arkansas. Eight members were killed by the Beast without it being located, leaving Sgt. Smith and one other member of the squadron. The other member was killed, with Sgt. Smith witnessing the killing and entering a heightened state of rage. He reported to shoot it in the right eye and has reported it having a scar from that experience. It is unknown why this event left a tangible scar on SCP-8890, and none after. After this event, Sgt. Smith left PENTAGRAM and joined the Foundation, being stationed as an MTF Commander in Containment Area-112.</td>

<p><strong>Addendum 8890.2:</strong> Interview With Dr. Adelaide Magdalene</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>MAGDALENE:</strong> Hello, Howard! What's up?</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Gotta ask you a favor, if that's alright.</p>
<p><strong>MAGDALENE:</strong> Of course, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> I need you to anoint me.</p>
<p><strong>MAGDALENE:</strong> I mean… Uhm, what do you need it for? Is it for—</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> I've been doing research. A lot of research. I know this is going to work, Addy. I know it. It's supernatural, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it has a connection to folklore and such— So, this is going to work.</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Magdalene sighs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>MAGDALENE:</strong> Okay. I— I'll help. I'm just not sure about this. What if this doesn't work, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> It will. I know it will. Don't worry a bit, Addy.</p>
<p><strong>MAGDALENE:</strong> Alright… but please, promise me something. Promise me you'll stay safe. Don't be reckless, I don't want you getting hurt.</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Don't worry a bit. I can do this, it'll be done, and everyone will be happy.</p>

</table>
<p>Following Attempt VIII, Dr. Lilyann Sophia, under the guidance of the wider Ethics Committee, has mandated a halt on all experiments with SCP-8890, until the time when Sgt. Smith has been cleared by the Site Psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8890.4:</strong> Sgt. Smith's Psychological Evaluation</p>
<p>The transcripts of Sgt. Smith's therapy sessions can be acquired on request to any Site Command personnel. The final session, and likely the cause of Incident 8890/1, can be found below.</p>

(<em>Sgt. Smith enters, taking a seat.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Gray smiles.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>GRAY:</strong> Hello, Howard. How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Fine. It's just been a boring shift but thank God for that.</p>
<p><strong>GRAY:</strong> Well, that's good. I was hoping we could talk about… SCP-8890, is it?</p>
<p>(<em>Sgt. Smith clenches his fists.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Yeah. That's— That's it. Have you— read the file?</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Gray nods.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>GRAY:</strong> Only parts, but enough to know your connection with it in the past.</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Then I don't need to explain why I need it dead— do I?</p>
<p><strong>GRAY:</strong> Not if you don't want to, Howard.</p>
<p>(<em>Sgt. Smith stares, his breathing slowly accelerating before he shudders and weakly smiles at Dr. Gray.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> I— I have to go, Doc.</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> It's going to come here, now. I have to—</p>
<p>(<em>Crashing noises can be heard in the distance.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Run! Go!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8890.5:</strong> Incident 8890/1</p>
<p>Coinciding with Sgt. Smith's final psychological evaluation, and its abrupt end, SCP-8890 manifested inside of Containment Area-112. While personnel were able to secure the halls and avoid any casualties, SCP-8890 still caused significant damage to the halls of the Safe and Euclid level containment area walls and doors. SCP-8890 spent a majority of Incident 8890/1 trying to forcibly enter Dr. Gray's office. It was not successful in destroying the magnetically locked door or surrounding walls, and de-manifested after thirty-two minutes.</p>
<p>Site Command, in light of this Incident, decided to vote on whether or not to resume Termination Experiments. Director Clifford has explained their view that the Experiments distracted Sgt. Smith, keeping SCP-8890 from manifesting inside of Containment Area-112.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8890.6:</strong> Site Command Vote</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>Proposal to Site Command: Allow Sergeant Howard Smith to continue SCP-8890 termination attempts.</p>
<p>Explanation: SCP-8890 has recently rampaged through Containment Area-112, causing damage to the locking mechanisms of Safe and Euclid hall doors, as well as being a threat to personnel. This did not occur when we were not mandating Smith's psychological evaluation or allowing him to conduct termination attempts. He will succeed, or he will not.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8890.8:</strong> Incident 8890/2</p>
<p>Following the denial of Termination Attempt XII, Sgt. Smith returned to Containment Area-112 and took a shotgun from the armory without supervisor permission. He would immediately leave the Area again; his body camera being turned on to record his movements. The log can be viewed below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>(<em>Sgt. Smith ensures the shotgun is loaded. He cocks it once, and a sigh can be heard.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Alright. Come out. Come fuckin' get me.</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Just going to give up now? Scared of a little gun? I know you can take it. I've seen you take worse than this.</p>
<p>(<em>Pause.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> I just want to see what I can do to you before you kill me. I want to put some lead in your fucking skull before I die. Just let me do that and I'll die happy.</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> To prove that I can do something in this fucking world.</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> You killed the people I was meant to lead—</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> You took <em>years</em> of my life trying to kill you.</p>

<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> I'll get you back to 111. You're going to be okay. I'm not going to let you die. Not like this— Not like this.</p>
<p>(<em>He pants heavily.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SMITH:</strong> Ever since that thing showed up, I wanted it dead.</p>
