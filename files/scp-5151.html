<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5151 is to be housed in a large humanoid containment cell at Humanoid Containment Site-06-3. No electrical devices are permitted inside of the cell except for an audio-recording device. All lights in the containment cell have been replaced by oil-fed lamps built into the walls.</p>
<p>Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, MTF Pi-7 ("Honor Bound Knights") is to enter the containment cell to train and spar with SCP-5151 for 7 hours. Every Sunday evening, a wooden table with eight wooden chairs of are to be placed in the center of the containment cell. All members of MTF Pi-7 are required to seat themselves with SCP-5151 at the table. Personnel is instructed to prepare and serve various types of bread, pies, roasted pig, poultry, stews, and soups along with a variety of wines and ales to those seated at the table.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> MTF Pi-7 is allowed to leave the containment cell after SCP-5151 becomes incapacitated from the alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5151 is a male humanoid covered in a chain mail hauberk of Polish origin from the medieval era with a laurel wreath<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> around its head. It identifies as "The Black Knight," although it references having many other names and titles in the past. SCP-5151 does not require rest, food, or water for survival, although it consumes food and beverages for pleasure. When SCP-5151 deems a subject dishonorable, SCP-5151 will stab through the subject's aorta with its longsword, and then proceed to anomalously drain the victim's blood from their body completely.</p>
<p>Despite the appearance of having clothing and armor, every aspect of SCP-5151's body, garments, armor, longsword, and other adornments is made up of the same composition. This composition can pass through material objects and is impervious to physical damage. The entity has the capability to adjust this composition as it desires. These anomalous characteristics make containment of SCP-5151 through conventional means difficult.</p>
<p>During its discovery, the entity was found to be capable of forming an anomalous mark onto a subject's hand when said subject forms a blood-pact<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> with the entity. This mark is referred to as SCP-5151-2. When forming a blood-pact, SCP-5151 can establish an SCP-5151-2 instance with several subjects at the same time by creating a pact with their leader. SCP-5151-2 causes a mild burning sensation that varies in strength based on unknown factors. Affected individuals have had a noticeable increase in feelings of inadequacy and dread, as well as an increase in stress levels. It is unknown at this time as to whether or not SCP-5151-2 possesses any mind-affecting properties or if these factors can be attributed to the nature of this assignment combined with frustrations due to the current inability to remove SCP-5151-2.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5151.01:</strong> Initial Discovery Log</p>
<p>SCP-5151 was discovered after the Foundation received reports of anomalous vigilante murders across the Alsace, Lorraine, Champagne, and Orléanais provinces of France. MTF Pi-1 ("City Slickers") were deployed to investigate the separate murders of E████ ██████ and G█████ ████████, two out of three men responsible for the murder of 4 adults as well as the kidnapping and trafficking of 18 children into child slavery from an orphanage in █████████, France. MTF Pi-1 agents found that each man had recently expired due to exsanguination.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Both men possessed large stab wounds through their aortas; however, each man's body and clothing, lacked any visible or forensic traces of blood. This description followed the same pattern of the previous vigilante murders, and the MTF agents apprehended the third man responsible for the orphanage incident, R██ ███████, following a brief search in the region.</p>
<p>On 08/08/2019, at 03:17 AM, during the transport of the subject to Site-06-3, MTF agents encountered SCP-5151 standing in the path of their vehicles. SCP-5151 began walking towards the vehicles as MTF agents attempted to make contact with the entity. The entity continued walking towards the vehicle despite warnings from the MTF agents. MTF Pi-1 proceeded to open fire on SCP-5151 to no effect. When the entity began to approach the vehicle which contained the subject, MTF agents attempted to restrain the entity physically; however, the agents were unable to grab the entity due to its ability to pass through matter. SCP-5151 stabbed the subject through his aorta with a longsword. After killing the subject, SCP-5151 proceeded to stare at MTF Pi-1-█ before lunging toward and killing him with the same process. SCP-5151 proceeded to sheathe its longsword and raise its hands in a submissive manner while the MTF agents continued to discharge their weapons in the entity. When MTF Pi-1 ceased their fire, SCP-5151 proceeded to greet them, "<em>Brave fellows, do not worry about him. I disposed of him as I have with others of his lot. Loyalty is a virtue, and the lack of it will lead to the death of chivalry. My presence is a testament that chivalry will never die. With this being said, I understand you have been searching for me. Pray tell what you might need of me?</em>" This statement led to MTF Pi-1 surrounding SCP-5151 and contacting Site Command.</p>
<p>After MTF Pi-1 contacted Site-06-3 concerning the entity, Site Director T███ ███████ decided to send Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau along with site security to speak with the entity. After his arrival, Dr. Moreau proceeded to conduct an interview with SCP-5151.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-5151</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/08/2019</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>This interview was conducted on a deserted roadside 3 km from Site-06-3. This interview was conducted in the presence of Mobile Task Force Pi-1 along with security personnel. The following interview has been translated into English for convenience.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 03:58 AM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> (<em>in French</em>) Hello, I am Dr. Moreau.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>in French</em>) Ah, a doctor, I see. I presume you wish to ask me some questions then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> You are correct. I would indeed like to interview you. Would you first explain your reasoning for why you killed one of our agents despite sparing the remaining agents who were attacking you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly disgusted</em>) Good Sir, you must seek out better company than filth such as he. This "agent" as you called him was worth less than the ground he stood upon!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I do not understand. How exactly did he differ from the others?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Oh, I see. Well, I suppose even doctors struggle to see the hearts of men. Allow me to provide a hint for you, good Sir. As a good man once said, "<em>there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Aeschylus, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly excited</em>) Well, not only a doctor but also a historian! What a lovely find! Aeschylus, the father of tragedy, but as such, I never cared for his work. It was a bit too depressing, and all the while bland for my taste. Nevertheless, he was a good man. But enough of that, I do assume that you have more to ask of me than a mere conversation about old times?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Yes, I do have many questions for you, so I must ask, are you willing to stay with us for the time being? To help us further our understanding?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> I will gladly keep you and your fellow acquaintances' company, as I have been searching for company myself; however, I do have a few conditions concerning my stay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> We can make certain accommodations. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> I will need plenty of space to practice my swordplay. I will also need a retinue to train. Provide me with your seven best 'agents' as you call them. Men of virtue, brave, and those with reactions of a white eagle. I do not intend to deliver my second-best on any soul during training. We will train every Tuesday and every Thursday. We will have a grand banquet to celebrate our training every Sunday. The other days, you may use my men as you see fit, good Doctor. Comply with my requests, and you shall have a deal, good Sir!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I am afraid I do not have the authority to agree to terms such as those. Please allow me to confirm this with my superior first.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) At times, one man's best effort is to call upon the aid of another. Go on, good Sir, and discuss this matter with your superior.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 04:04 AM&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>After gaining approval to SCP-5151's requests with Site Director T███ ███████, SCP-5151 requested to make a blood-pact with Dr. Moreau to seal the agreement. SCP-5151 informed Dr. Moreau that it would not agree to stay unless Dr. Moreau made a blood-pact with it for himself and his assistants. After informing the site director of the situation, the site director allowed Dr. Moreau to make the decision on whether or not to accept. Due to the nature of SCP-5151's capabilities, it was agreed that containment would be challenging without a degree of cooperation involved. After gaining permission to do so, Dr. Moreau complied with the request by slicing his hand before proceeding to shake hands with SCP-5151. A mark labeled with the word "honoris" appeared on the top of Dr. Moreau's right hand as well as the right hands of his assistant researchers.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon approval from Site Director T███ ███████, MTF Pi-7 ("Honor Bound Knights") has been formed to accommodate the current containment procedures of SCP-5151. These seven agents were chosen based on their skill in hand-to-hand combat as well as on their character compatibility with SCP-5151. After investigation of Pi-1-█'s belongings after the events which occurred, it was found that Pi-1-█ had several classified SCP documents as well as a note instructing him to steal SCP-████. It is believed that Pi-1-█ had a connection with the Chaos Insurgency.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 10:29 PM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Good morning, Dr. Moreau!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Good morning, SCP-5151.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) I see that you are a stickler for your designations, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> You are correct, 5151. If you are willing, I would like to conduct an interview with you this morning.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Please continue then, Dr. Moreau! I would be glad to answer your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Very well, my first question concerns the agent you killed the day we met.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly disgusted</em>) Oh? And what of that disgrace of a man?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Later that day, we found out that the agent in question happened to be working with a rival organization to ours. Were you aware of this man's affiliation with this group?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> No, not particularly, good Sir. I am certainly not all-knowing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Then why did you kill that man thinking that he had betrayed us? It certainly was not a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) Why, of course, it was no coincidence! Good Doctor, it surprises me every day to know that the common man can not see into the hearts of men. It was as clear as day that the man you call an agent was betraying you. And betrayal, that is a sin that only blood can forgive.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Why does betrayal bother you so greatly then? I am sure some of the other agents in that room were guilty of other sins in their lives? Why did you choose to not bother with the others?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Doctor, it may be that those other men had failed in their lives; however, betrayal goes against my very nature. That man, such a lack of honor, he was pure cowardice. And here am I chivalry incarnate! I could not allow such a man to live in my presence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Very well then, moving on. What about the nature of this mark on my research team's hands? What is it exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> That is a simple one, Doctor. (<em>gestures toward Dr. Moreau's hand with an instance of SCP-5151-2</em>) This is a sign of our pact. It is common knowledge that a blood-pact is the greatest of all promises. Blood represents the life a man lives. If a man's blood is pure, so will be his heart. But if man's blood is tainted, his body will rot and decay until he can no longer be called human.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> And what of this burning sensation it emits?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) I would not worry about that insignificant sensation. Only liars and thieves have reason to worry about such matters of the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I see, well then, what is the significance of the word honoris? I understand that it is the Latin word for honor. With that being the case, what is the significance of honoris being written on the mark, and why is it in Latin?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Honor describes my being. As for the mark, It would serve us well to remember that we are both honor-bound together after the signing of our pact.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I believe I understand. And why is it in Latin, again?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (visibly concerned) If it really matters, Latin is a preferred language of mine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Oh, is that so? Care to elaborate on why that is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) Good, Sir, perhaps I should write an autobiography so that you may know which is my preferred taste of wine!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Alright, 5151, we will touch on that subject again another day. I believe those are all of the questions that I have for today. Do you have anything you would like to add?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Why yes, good Sir! I do have a request.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Which is what exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> You see, I am not a believer in electricity. All it serves to do is corrupt the hearts of men. I would greatly appreciate it if you would remove the electrical lights from my room and replace them with more appropriate lighting. Also, could you tell my men to leave their devices in your office?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I believe we can manage those arrangements. I will contact my superior. Do you mind if we continue recording our interviews with this? (<em>holds the audio-recorder device</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> That would be perfectly fine, Dr. Moreau. I simply detest seeing electricity for all hours of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I understand, 5151. Will there be anything else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> No, good Sir. I am otherwise perfectly content here. Thank you, Dr. Moreau.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 10:36 AM&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>SCP-5151 has the ability to view people differently than humans. This ability grants it knowledge of whether or not this person is honorable by SCP-5151's standards. Along with this information, we have learned more about SCP-5151's fascination with blood as well as the purpose of SCP-5151-2 being a reminder of our promise to SCP-5151. The last topic of note is SCP-5151's request to distance itself from electricity. Although this is peculiar, I do not believe it is a weakness of SCP-5151, but rather a nuisance or hindrance to it. I'll leave this topic until we learn more about SCP-5151 and SCP-5151-2's nature. - Dr. Moreau</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several experiments were conducted to remove SCP-5151-2 from the research team members. Each experiment resulted in failure; however, several aspects concerning the nature of SCP-5151-2's nature have been discovered. SCP-5151-2 can not be removed from the subject's hand by physical means. This includes removing the appendage in which SCP-5151-2 is attached. Due to the incident surrounding the detachment of Junior Researcher Damien Dupree's right hand, SCP-5151-2 was found to have relocated to his right arm. It was also found that researchers who demonstrate higher stress levels due to the existence of SCP-5151-2 were susceptible to greater burning sensations emitted by SCP-5151-2. Further research concerning SCP-5151-2 will be delayed until the nature of SCP-5151 is better understood. - <em>Dr. Moreau</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Hello, 5151, I will be conducting an interview with you today.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly excited</em>) Ah, Dr. Moreau again! Please, call me Black Knight. That is the title I have gone by for a while now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I'm afraid that will not be possible. I have been instructed to address you as SCP-5151. However, that does pique my interest. Please elaborate on your title. Have you had different ones in the past?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>chuckles</em>) Yes, Dr. Moreau. I have had several names and titles given to me over my time in this fine world.

I understand that you and your team do not seem to speak Polish, so you may address me as my title, although I understand if you have been told not to do so. Please continue to follow the instructions of your superiors.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Thank you for your understanding, 5151. I understand that you are from Poland then? You speak superb French to be from the other side of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Oh, that is where I was last given a title, Sir. I have been given titles from all manner of places across Europe. And as such, I have gained proficiency in many different languages such as Polish, English, Spanish, French, and as we previously established, I know Latin as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Ah, I see. Well, if that is the case, would you mind elaborating on some of those names and titles?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Certainly. My most recent name was Zawisza. But I have also been given many other names such as Edward, Rodrigo, and Charles. The titles I have been given along with those names include The Black Knight, The Black Prince, El Cid or El Campeador depending on whom you asked, and The Hammer. I have had more names and titles in the past, but it would be laborsome to list every single one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I see, thank you for providing what you have to me. Did you happen to list your first name and title given to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly concerned</em>) No, I did not.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Would you care to provide those then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> I apologize, but I would prefer to keep that to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Very well, what name and title were you given when you became familiar with Latin?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> I once again apologize, but I am not willing to share that information.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Is there any particular reason for this that you would be willing to share?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly agitated</em>) Dr. Moreau, I would prefer not to talk about this any further.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I understand, 5151. I believe this interview is complete. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 12:34 PM&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>It is apparent from SCP-5151's agitation and resistance that it is hiding a key aspect concerning its past. I have assigned part of my research team to conduct historical research on Zawisza Czarny specifically as well as the other names and titles SCP-5151 provided in this interview. I have also assigned the other researchers on my team to search for historical figures from Roman times that match the characteristics displayed by SCP-5151. - Dr. Moreau</em></p>

<p><strong>Research Log 5151.RL.01</strong></p>
<p>SCP-5151's appearance replicates the known records of Zawisza Czarny. From the fact that SCP-5151 relates Zawisza Czarny to be one of its previous names, it can be inferred that SCP-5151 has a strong connection to this figure. This information can mean either SCP-5151 replicates this figure's appearance and nature or that SCP-5151 was this figure in history.</p>
<p>In Interview Log 5151.IL.02, SCP-5151 mentioned that it knew several languages and that it had the following names and titles from the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zawisza Czarny (1370 AD - 1428 AD), "The Black Knight", Polish</li>
<li>Edward Plantagenet (1330 AD - 1376 AD)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, "The Black Prince", English</li>
<li>Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (1043 AD - 1099 AD), "El Cid" or "El Campeador", Spanish</li>
<li>Charles Martel (688 AD - 741 AD), "The Hammer", French</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures in history were all famous military-minded men who performed some great feat for their people or made some great cultural impact on their people. Another similarity between these men is their respectful nature. Each of these men was respected for holding to their values, and Zawisza Czarny specifically is known to have been the epitome of a chivalrous knight in medieval history. This information correlates with what we have already discovered concerning the nature of SCP-5151.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 5151.IL.04</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> MTF Pi-7-1</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/13/2020</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>This interview was conducted inside Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau's office.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 08:46 AM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> (<em>in English</em>) Good morning, Captain. I trust that you have enjoyed your stay at Site-06-3?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> (<em>in English</em>) Yeah, Doctor. Things have been going well for myself and my men here. Our assignment, SCP-5151, has been a fairly enjoyable one thus far. Of course, I would hate to get on his bad side.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Captain, please try to refrain from referring to SCP-5151 as anything but an "it." SCP-5151 is anything but human.</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> I understand, Doctor. Please continue with the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Of course, Captain. How would you say that SCP-5151's training sessions have been going?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> It hasn't been too difficult. In one sense, it is very tiresome. In another sense, it is rather rewarding. I will say that my team has become even more adept at hand-to-hand combat as well as combat involving primitive weapons such as swords, spears, and bows. Of course, training only lasts a couple of days a week, and you guys furnish those big meals on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> How does 5151 act during these meals?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Well, if I may say this, the meals are quite enjoyable. 5151 is quite the storyteller. My guess is that it has been around for a long time. It has a story for just about every point of time in history.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I instructed you to figure out what 5151's relation to Latin, the Romans, or simply that time period, in general, happens to be. Did you learn anything?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Possibly, as you know, it doesn't like to talk about that subject. However, when it was drunk, it did open up to us a little bit. It told us that it used to be celebrated among the people at that time. It said they even made a shrine or something to 5151 along with its brother. It then went on a monologue about how its brother had this helmet that it was fond of all the time. The last thing it kept repeating to itself before it fell asleep was about how it missed its brother. I guess it had a brother at one point. Maybe something happened to its brother? I don't know. 5151 won't mention anything about it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Captain, did 5151 mention anything else about this temple or its brother? Anything specific about them or possibly any clue as to why it is hiding this information?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Oh right, sorry. He mentioned that he and his brother got along real well, about how they would watch their people together and their successes. He then became sad and began to sit quietly. Mahesh, I mean 7-3, asked him what happened back then. 5151 then went on to tell us that sometimes things just get so hard that you need to get up and leave everything. He went on to say that he is just tired of remembering. That was when he started to go on about his brother. The guys tried to talk to him, but he ended up falling asleep after a few minutes of saying he missed his brother.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> I see. That was quite informative, Captain. Thank you. Once again, do try to remember that SCP-5151 is an "it" and not a "he." Try not to get too attached while on this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Right, of course. I understand, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Are you doing all right, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Yes, Doctor. I'm fine. Sorry for my poor language earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> That is quite all right, Captain. I would advise you to move on from the subject of its brother for now. I doubt 5151 will reveal anything further. That will end our interview for today. Good work, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Doctor, can I mention one more thing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Of course, Captain. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Pi-7-1:</strong> Doctor, 5151 is enjoyable to be around. In fact, I believe it genuinely enjoys having us around. It is also very helpful in training, both in a physical sense as well as a mental one. That is all true. However, none of us have ever been able to lay a hand on it during our sparring sessions. It is almost like it knows how we will react to every situation. To be honest with you, we all understand that it has a tremendous amount of power that it chooses to hide. We can all feel it. My team is trained well, so we understand this and move on. If not for that, well, I think we would just be paralyzed with fear. We can tell that 5151 wasn't always like this. I don't know why 5151 suppresses itself, but it's like 5151 is just putting on an act most of the time. That is all I wanted to say.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Moreau:</strong> Thank you, Captain. That will be all for today.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 08:50 AM&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>Pi-7-1 was able to gather useful information for us regarding the nature of this entity. I theorize that SCP-5151 was worshipped as one of the deities found in the Roman Pantheon, or simply some lesser-known deity around the same time period and area. The part concerning the brother is interesting to note. I will have part of my team search Roman history for a deity that matches the description of SCP-5151. The findings of this interview, as well as the preceding logs, will be turned in later today to Site Director T███ ███████ for review. - Dr. Moreau</em></p>

<p>The following memo was sent from Troy Boucher's computer, the previous site director of Site-06-3, to Sylvain Moreau, the previous senior researcher responsible for study on SCP-5151.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Site-06-3 Site Director, Troy Boucher<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 03/14/2020<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Containment Procedure Changes For SCP-5151</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Moreau, effective immediately, you and your team are to stop providing weekly accommodations to SCP-5151. SCP-5151 has become an unnecessary drain on Foundation resources. This order is a direct mandate I have received from my superiors. You may take appropriate precautions, but do not allow MTF Pi-7 to enter SCP-5151's containment cell this coming Sunday evening under any circumstances. I expect a full debrief of your results from these changes no later than Monday afternoon. I trust that you will comply with this directive and trust your superior on this delicate issue. Remember, the Foundation knows what is best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 03/15/2020 at 10:53 PM, Site-06-3's containment breach alarm was triggered by Researcher Nathanael Namreg when SCP-5151 appeared in front of him in the western wing hallway adjacent to SCP-5151's containment cell. SCP-5151 lunged toward him and proceeded to kill him. The researcher's body slid off of SCP-5151's longsword and proceeded to burst into flames as it fell to the floor. SCP-5151 was then seen walking to the site cafeteria where Junior Researchers Damien Dupree and Abigail Jolly were located. Despite guards discharging their weapons into SCP-5151, SCP-5151 proceeded to kill the junior researchers in the same fashion as the previous researcher with their bodies also bursting into flames. SCP-5151 continued this process until Researcher Angeline Ponce, and Junior Researchers Alastair Lawrie, Helen Burrows, Michel Bisset, and Marvin Tendler were all killed.</p>
<p>At 11:33 PM, SCP-5151 walked through the locked door of Senior Researcher Sylvain Moreau's office. Inside of the office was Dr. Moreau alongside MTF Pi-7. SCP-5151 lunged toward Dr. Moreau and stabbed him. Pi-7-3, Pi-7-4, and Pi-7-5 proceeded to discharge their weapons into SCP-5151 to no effect. Pi-7-2, Pi-7-6, and Pi-7-7 proceeded to hit SCP-5151 with steel swords, also to no effect. Pi-7-1 proceeded to fire a taser at SCP-5151 causing it to convulse for a brief moment before slapping Pi-7-1 across the office. The senior researcher's body proceeded to slide off of SCP-5151's longsword before bursting into flames and falling to the floor.</p>
<p>At 11:37 PM, SCP-5151 became cordial before MTF Epsilon-11 arrived at Site-06-3. MTF Pi-7 informed MTF Epsilon-11 of the situation, and Epsilon-11 quickly secured the facility. The entire research team for SCP-5151 was found to be lacking any blood in their bodies or surroundings. The research team was also found to have third-degree burns across their bodies with their right hands heavily charred. The sole exception to this was Junior Researcher Damien Dupree, whose right forearm was heavily charred instead. It is believed that SCP-5151-2 was the origin and cause of the researchers' spontaneous combustion.</p>
<p>After the incident, Site Director Troy Boucher was found deceased inside of his locked office. The autopsy showed that he had died due to strangulation the day before his last memo was sent to Dr. Moreau. MTF Epsilon-11 also found traces of a large data transfer of SCP files from the site director's computer to a remote location off-site. It remains unknown as to why the site director's death was not discovered sooner as well as to how someone was able to infiltrate Site-06-3 as well as gain access to the site director's office and computer. Considering previous circumstances surrounding SCP-5151, an investigation into a possible connection between this incident and the Chaos Insurgency is currently being conducted by MTF Epsilon-11. SCP-5151 will be transferred to Site-54 along with MTF Pi-7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During this incident, 9 researchers died, an MTF agent was injured, a site director was murdered, an entire site was compromised along with several small breaches as well as a major one, and we found out that SCP-5151 can not be stopped by seemingly any force we can think of at the moment. As the commander of MTF Epsilon-11, I recommend the immediate transfer of SCP-5151 to a more secure containment site like Site-54. I also recommend someone to form a blood-pact with SCP-5151 to keep the entity from choosing to leave as this seems to be the only way to contain it to some degree. MTF Pi-7 should be transferred alongside SCP-5151 due to their familiarity with the entity. As for Site-06-3, I have never witnessed a greater breach in security at a Foundation site than what I have seen here today. This was negligence to the greatest degree.</p>
<p><em>MTF Epsilon-11 Commander, Mortimer Ward</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following memo is from Senior Researcher Herrmann Richter, the current senior researcher responsible for SCP-5151, to Site-54 Site Director Gerard Hansjörg.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Site-54 Site Director, Gerard Hansjörg<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Senior Researcher Herrmann Richter<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 03/16/2020<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Concerning the Incident and the Nature of SCP-5151</p>
<hr/>
<p>After being given SCP-5151, I conceded to forming a blood-pact with it on behalf of my research team as well as for myself per the request of the commander of MTF Epsilon-11 as well as your orders.</p>
<p>Noting the incident that occurred at Site-06-3, I recommend that SCP-5151's initial requests to continue to be fulfilled until we can discover the full extent of its abilities as well as its limitations. We learned that when breaking the terms of a blood-pact with SCP-5151, the entity gains the ability to locate the subject who bears an instance of SCP-5151-2 in which SCP-5151 will proceed to kill the subject. SCP-5151 will continue to teleport to and kill each subject who bears an instance of SCP-5151-2. After killing a subject with an instance of SCP-5151-2, the instance will proceed to combust and burn until the mark is no longer discernible on the subject's body.</p>
<p>Since my team and I now possess instances of SCP-5151-2, I have decided not to inform my team of the details of the incident. They are already under a great deal of stress from being linked to a powerful entity. The power this thing seems to possess can be frightening to imagine.</p>

<h2><span><span style="color: black">STATEMENT FROM THE OVERSEER COUNCIL</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: black"><br/>
<em>Per the events found within Incident Report 5151.IR.01, the Site Director of Site-06-3 was murdered by an entity believed to be connected to the Chaos Insurgency. This entity was not only able to escape the facility without being captured or recorded but was also able to escape with countless Foundation secrets and documents about the containment of numerous SCPs. In addition to this catastrophic failure of Site-06-3's security, a major containment breach occurred simultaneously, which resulted in the deaths of an entire research team. During this containment breach, several minor breaches also occurred, which resulted in only minor damage to the facility. As a result of this failure of security, Site-06-3 Security Director Oliver Albury has been administered a Class C amnestic and demoted to D-class. Upon the arrival of the new Site and Security Directors for Site-06-3, MTF Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox") will be relieved by MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") from the investigation of the entity responsible for this incident. In the future, harsher penalties will be administered if the Foundation ever witnesses a breach of security of this scale. This statement is the judgment of the O5 council.</em><br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 5151.06:</strong> Research Update</p>
<p><strong>Updated Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5151 has been moved to Integrated Containment Site-54. MTF Pi-7 has relocated to Site-54 to provide further accommodations to SCP-5151. All other prior accommodations to SCP-5151 are still granted; however, the walls of the containment cell have been constructed with a grid pattern of electrical wiring inside. This grid pattern aligns with the door to the cell when closed to complete the circuit. An electrical current of 1,000 amps is passed through this wire grid at all times. MTF Pi-7 will be armed with experimental Nemtyshkin EDA's<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 5151.IL.05</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Senior Researcher Herrmann Richter</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/18/2020</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>This interview was conducted inside of SCP-5151's new containment cell at Site-54.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 10:00 AM &gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> (<em>in English</em>) Hello, SCP-5151.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>in English</em>) It's a pleasure, Dr. Richter. I presume you wish to conduct an interview?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> Indeed. I would like to speak with you about the incident that occurred at Site-06-3.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>silence</em>) …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> You made quite the mess there, 5151.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> Dr. Richter, I understand that in the eyes of men, what I did may seem cruel. However, I purified their hearts. They were good people once, but they betrayed me. They broke their promise. They made their decision. They knew what I had to do.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5151 proceeded to avoid eye contact with Dr. Richter and began to look around the cell nervously.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> But something still seems to bother you, doesn't it, 5151?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly bothered</em>) They broke their promise. People always break their promises. They always break their promises and leave. Why can't they just keep their word? Why can't …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> Actually, 5151, it turns out that the research team did not have a choice. They were deceived by a rival organization of ours. Did you happen to be aware of this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>visibly surprised</em>) What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> Indeed. Someone infiltrated our site and acted like your research team's superior. This man specifically told Dr. Moreau not to allow MTF Pi-7 to visit you that day. Dr. Moreau had no choice but to listen to his superior.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5151:</strong> (<em>silent and visibly bothered</em>) …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Richter:</strong> 5151? Do you have any input? (<em>a silent pause</em>) Alright, we will continue another day then. Thank you, 5151.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 10:08 AM&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The following memos are correspondence between Senior Researcher Herrmann Richter and Site-54 Site Director Gerard Hansjörg concerning Dr. Richter's findings on SCP-5151.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Site-54 Site Director, Gerard Hansjörg<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Senior Researcher Herrmann Richter<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 03/21/2020<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Concerning the New Containment Procedures</p>
<hr/>
<p>After studying and furthering Dr. Moreau's research, I have concluded that SCP-5151's hidden identity belongs to Honos, the Roman god of chivalry, honor, and military justice. Honos was a war god who was celebrated among the Romans along with Virtus, the war god of virtue. These gods were given their own temple in Rome, where they were worshiped together until the temple was closed due to the persecution of pagans during the 4th century. It seems this event might be compounded with whatever trauma SCP-5151 appears to be experiencing. Knowledge of this entity's identity is useful since SCP-5151 seems bound to this nature regardless of its own desires. In the interview I conducted, I found this conflicting internal nature of SCP-5151. Although remorseful may not be the word, SCP-5151 had some degree of depression regarding the events that unfolded, which leads me to believe that this entity can not completely control itself when faced with an incident such as the one found in Incident Report 5151.IR.01. Dr. Moreau's team performed extensive research on SCP-5151's nature, so I do not see any more need to continue this line of research.</p>
<p>Although I appreciate the added containment procedures, I do hope you realize that these procedures will likely do little to prevent SCP-5151 from reaching myself and my team if it is angered. Concerning SCP-5151-2, as Dr. Moreau's team attempted physical removal, I would like to test the removal of SCP-5151-2 by using <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-500" target="_blank" target="_blank">SCP-500</a>. I believe that since it appears to be some kind of anomalous condition, it might be possible to remove it using the cure-all drug.</p>
<p>On a side-note, Site Director, my research team is having issues coping with being linked to this entity. If you would be willing to provide some accommodations that might help reassure them in some way, I believe our research on SCP-5151 will be dramatically aided.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Concerning the New Containment Procedures</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Richter, your input and concerns have been noted, and your recommendations have been granted for the time being. It is the Foundation's desire for you to focus your research on the capabilities of SCP-5151 to find ways to prevent it from being able to breach containment when faced with something as trivial as broken promises.</p>
<p>As for your request, I will provide your team with routine therapy checkups until the situation blows over, and they can stabilize themselves again. Concerning SCP-500, that will need to be discussed at a later time. For now, I look forward to hearing your future suggestions on how we should try to contain a god.</p>
