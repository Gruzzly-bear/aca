<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9575 is to be held within a Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber in Site-06-3, outfitted with 2 Scranton Reality Anchors. If SCP-9575 disappears from its cell, webcrawler I/O-CAPITAL is to be activated to monitor the web for any mentions of a human male appearing inside bathrooms. If the target of SCP-9575 is found, MTF Omega-12 (“Achilles' Heels”) is to be dispatched to their location to recontain the anomaly using the Mobile Reality Chamber and to amnesticize the affected civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9575 is an overweight, balding Caucasian human male in its 60s. SCP-9575 appears to be sapient, although it has not responded to any questions while in containment. SCP-9575 is capable of teleporting to any location on Earth and creating small invisible walls.</p>
<p>Should reality anchors fail, SCP-9575 will immediately teleport from its cell to a new location. After breaching, SCP-9575 will choose its target, based on unknown criteria and start teleporting to their bathroom each time the target wants to use it. After appearing in the bathroom, SCP-9575 will proceed to ask its target for a fee (which varies depending on the wealth of the target) to use it. If the target refuses to pay or otherwise attempts to enter the bathroom through any other means, SCP-9575 will prevent the target from doing so by generating an invisible barrier which will only be removed following the payment of SCP-9575's demanded fee. If the fee is provided, SCP-9575 will allow the target private use of the facilities and return upon the target exiting the bathroom.</p>
<p>The maximal duration of the hunt has not been determined yet, as the assigned MTF unit has been able to recover SCP-9575 in all recorded cases before it could end by itself. The longest recorded hunt up to date lasted for approximately ██ years before the anomaly was first discovered and put in containment by the Foundation teams.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9575.1:</strong> Series of logs from a bathroom belonging to a retired Foundation employee, Dr. Engström (at the time, target of SCP-9575). Installed by the target himself.</p>

<p><em>Camera turns on. Dr. Engström is standing right in front of it with a screwdriver in hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Okay, It should work now. It's day… 6, I think. For the past 6 days SCP-9575 has been occupying my bathroom. In the past I heard that he disappears after I leave him here. I wonder how it looks… Well, tomorrow I will find out.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström proceeds to turn off the camera, turning it on again after about 2 minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> I don't know who came up with the idea of putting sockets inside bathrooms, but they really saved me some logistical issues.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström exits the room. Shortly after that, SCP-9575 comes inside, closes the door, and disappears.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> 10.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström proceeds to quickly pay the required 10 dollars in cash before quickly making his way inside. SCP-9575 proceeds to then exit the room and closes the door behind himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> I'm down another 10 bucks. It doesn't matter though, since I've got some recording to watch. I heard that one time this guy hunted someone for more than 10 years… I don't know how long exactly though, since my clearance wasn't high enough… Okay, let's see.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström moves his phone closer to the camera which briefly freezes. Shortly after that, Dr. Engström moves his phone back to him and proceeds to watch footage registered from the previous day.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> That's… Disappointing. It just poofs out and that's it. Would be a whole lot more interesting if it cast a teleportation spell here or something.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström proceeds to turn off the camera, turning it back on after about 14 minutes. Shortly after that, Dr. Engström proceeds to exit the room. After him doing that, SCP-9575 enters the bathroom. SCP-9575 disappears shortly after closing the door.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-9575 appears inside the bathroom and once again proceeds to move towards the door at the exact moment it began opening. Dr. Engström is visible outside the door with his hand gripping the handle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Your presence is starting to piss me off.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Are you going to pay or just complain?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Very funny.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström grabs a jar full of pennies from a shelf outside the door and proceeds to lightly throw it at SCP-9575. The jar shatters, causing the money to drop all over the nearby floor. SCP-9575 starts slowly picking them up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Oneeee… twooooo… threeee…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> For God's sake. You are now going to count them all!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Can you remain silent for a second? I lost my count and have to start all over again. Oneeee…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Did I tell you already that you piss me off?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström pulls out a 10 dollar banknote and drops it in front of SCP-9575's face. SCP-9575 proceeds to pick up the 10 dollars and exit the room. Dr. Engström then enters the bathroom, closes the door, and moves closer to the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Those recordings use A LOT of memory. Even though I keep only the encounter parts of the recording, it's still somehow like 2 GB's per day. I will probably have to start deleting days that are just uninteresting, but let's get to the point, I'm really worried on what will happen if I get food poisoning or something. I will probably bankrupt myself on that. Welp… that's it for the day. I don't have anything else to say.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Engström proceeds to turn off the camera for approximately 17 minutes. After turning it on again, Dr. Engström proceeds to exit the room. Shortly after that, SCP-9575 enters the room, closes the door and disappears.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> It happened! It fucking happened! I have diarrhea! I knew that this would happen one day! It's weird that this didn't happen earlier. I don't know what t-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575 (from behind the closed door):</strong> I have no clue who are you talking to in there, but you know that you could have just bought insurance?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> What? Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Yeah. You pay an additional 50 cents per day and you get an insurance in case of an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Why didn't you tell me that on the first day?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Why would I? It's not very money-making-friendly of me to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> You like suffering, huh? You like to earn money from other's misfortune, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9575:</strong> Are you done in there?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> You stole all of my money and now you are calling me poor!?</p>

<p><strong>An interview following Dr. Engström sending his findings and recordings to the Foundation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Greetings, Dr. Engström.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So, why did you choose to suddenly report this to us? I mean, you didn't do that for over 200 days, so why the change in mind?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> It was the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hmm… I can say that the recording that you gave us was really useful, but I hope that you understand that we will now have to amnesticize you, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Just like the last time when you forgot to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Very funny. Do you have anything else that you want to tell us before we let you go home?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Actually… Yes. After the last thing I thought about everything that happened during this year.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> Well… Could I potentially be rehired?</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> You want to return to us? I thought that we were stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> You know how it is. That last experience kinda changed my mind about some stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I hope that you know that I, myself, can't do anything about that. However, what I can do is I will repeat your request to someone who deals with stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Engström:</strong> That would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Then we are all set. For now this interview has ended, though, so go to your old quarters. I'm pretty sure that we will get a response by the morning.</p>
