            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9057</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Ticonderoga<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Staff are to report any signs of SCP-9057 manifestation to their Site's HR department. These signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>sudden interest in subjects commonly viewed to be uninteresting.</li>
<li>sudden lack of interest in subjects commonly found as exciting, intriguing, or otherwise captivating.</li>
<li>speaking mostly with a flat affect or monotone voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reports will be investigated via several interviews with the suspected individual. If it is confirmed that the individual is afflicted, they are to be administered Class I amnestics<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, and then assessed again afterwards. In all documented occurrences of SCP-9057, this has been enough to end the manifestation.</p>
<p>In accordance with Researcher Conway's instructions, all research into SCP-9057 is ceased for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9057 is a phenomenon that interferes in the perception of an individual's speech. It does not have an effect on non-verbal methods of communication. Anyone hearing this altered speech will perceive it as uninteresting in both content and delivery. Due to this perception being subjective, different individuals will perceive this speech in different ways. Individuals afflicted with SCP-9057 are not affected in this way, but suffer from other effects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent, mild forgetfulness.</li>
<li>general confusion in day-to-day life.</li>
<li>sudden isolation due to others' avoidance of social interaction with them due to the anomaly's effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not known to affect more than one individual at a time and lasts, on average, 2-3 weeks before demanifesting. It is currently unknown if any time passes between manifestations. Statistics suggest that individuals with prior exposure to cognitohazards and/or antimemetic phenomena are more likely to be the target of SCP-9057 occurrences. Otherwise, the anomaly is largely random in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> A series of experiments were conducted with individuals afflicted by SCP-9057, wherein they were instructed to communicate with others through various methods.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;">“Pottery was something my mother and I bonded over in my youth. When I was about ten, I remember catching a glimpse of her in the garage, bent over a wheel, hands dyed from the clay. She was focused, even enamored by the shapes she was carving, and I was too. She made it all look so easy to make, even the complex patterns.”</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">“My mother always used to tell me this, and I think it holds true. There’s nothing like the feeling of finishing that first page and then flipping it over to see the second. You’ve found your taxable income, even your W-2 Forms got to join in on the fun. And then you’re on to the Tax and Credits section. Only a little more, then you get to give that 1040 your signature and start getting excited for next year’s. Every February, like a migratory pattern.”</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">“I inherited my mom’s tastes on this. She believed that bread could go anywhere. Rye if you’re having corned beef… whole wheat if you’re having peanut butter and jelly… sourdough on the side with breakfast… oh, and always use brioche for your French toast. But the sandwich, that’s the most versatile thing in the world. All you need is bread, something else, then bread again; it’s a beautiful pattern.”</td>

<hr/>
<p>When I was assigned lead researcher for SCP-9057, I was pretty annoyed. Quite literally a boring anomaly. Whoever was in charge prior had already done every brain scan that exists and come up with nothing. I was to figure out how it spread, what amnestic made it go away, and then I’d get to call off for a day. But I didn’t find those things. SCP-9057 doesn’t spread by any means we can find, it doesn’t have any lasting effects, it barely does anything at all. After a month or two of testing, I was half-convinced the whole project was some prank. I was ready to throw in the towel when Alan accidentally left steno.aic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> running in the interview room.</p>
<p>I still know SCP-9057 doesn’t do anything to us. But after reading that transcript, I don’t think its ineffectiveness is inherent.</p>
<p>As lead researcher on SCP-9057, I have decided the best course of action to maintain normalcy is to cease all research and efforts into containing this anomaly. The document that led me to this conclusion is attached.</p>

<h1 id="toc1"><span>LOG #1/9057</span></h1>
<p>| DATE/TIME: 01-25-26 / 1429 GMT |<br/>
| LOCATION: Site-93 (Testing Chamber 08) |<br/>
| PRESENT: Researcher Kit Conway, D-20974 |</p>
<p><em>The room is empty for four minutes and five seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>Researcher Conway enters, with D-20974 following. She is mid-sentence and holding a notepad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> … and you're just gonna answer the questions like you would if this was a job interview or something, okay?</p>
<p><em>D-20974 nods their head silently and sits in a chair in front of the interview table. Conway sits down on the opposing side and clears her throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>D-20974:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> Thank you. When and where were you born?</p>
<p><strong>D-20974:</strong> So, so very long ago. Never at all.</p>
<p><em>Conway writes the name "Marlon Wu" and the date "June 3rd, 1983" in her notepad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> What's your favorite color?</p>
<p><strong>D-20974:</strong> Purple.</p>
<p><em>Conway writes "khaki".</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> What was it like where you grew up?</p>
<p><strong>D-20974:</strong> Beautiful. I touched stars. I would glide through nebulae and hold ionized hydrogen atoms in my hand. I was midwife to the birth of planets. I knew everything and everything knew me.</p>
<p><em>Conway writes "suburban Wisconsin, middle class", then yawns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> Sorry, long week. Ahem, uh… where have you worked in the past?</p>
<p><strong>D-20974:</strong> I used to live. Somewhere, I did live. I know I must have, because I remember pieces of it. Only pieces, like a frayed rope coming apart in a storm. A great tempest tore through me, then through everything I knew. It all died, or was destroyed, or undone or erased or made into nothing. I thought the same fate had come to me until I heard a voice. I knew it was a voice, though I had never heard such a thing before. And I realized I had a voice too.</p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> Okay… 'the office'. What organization did you work for specifically?</p>
<p><strong>D-2074:</strong> I spoke to you, to all of you. I spoke in whispers on the wind and mutters from the mouths of caves. You heard me and you cried, then you screamed. I apologized, I told you that something had happened that nobody quite understood and I just needed directions to get back. But you gave me none. You ran from me and I followed you and when you realized you could no longer run, something changed.</p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><em>Conway writes "accounting for 'business firm'?", then sighs for a moment before speaking again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> If you were trapped on a desert island by yourself, and you could choose five books to have while on the island, which would you choose and why?</p>
<p><strong>D-204:</strong> The next time I spoke, you could not hear me. I could not make you hear me. You forgot I had ever been there, forgot how you abandoned me and you left me to rot, except I couldn't rot because I had already decayed and depleted away into nothing. And so I hated you. I hated you like nothing has ever hated anything else before. I waited and waited and waited until something would come and you would hear me again. I began to scream. I screamed for so long, but my screams did nothing. I needed more. I plucked the screams that you had once given me and I stitched them together into a pattern of neverending noise.</p>
<p><em>Conway drops her pen, which she had been fidgeting with, then waves her hand apologetically.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-04:</strong> This pattern made it through. This pattern taught me that even though you could not hear me, I could hear you and you could hear you. But again, you ran. Something about me, my nature or lack thereof, serves as an antithesis to everything you are.</p>
<p><em>Conway has begun creating small drawings in her notebook. There is a moment of silence in the room that she does not seem to notice.</em></p>
<p><strong>-04:</strong> Once more, you all changed. I spent so long searching for someone who would not flee, but there was none, and then it happened. Just as you once learned to block out my voice from your ears, you learned to unweave what I had done to yours and then I was left even worse off than before. You cast a tremendous curtain over yourselves, all of you. Your speech was muffled and mine was silenced. I could not hang onto your words for support in the waters, instead I was cast out to sea and sent tumbling from nothing to nowhere. And now I am not here.</p>
<p><strong>Conway:</strong> Right, okay. Sorry. What about movies?</p>
<p><strong>-0:</strong> I'm sorry. Truly, I am. If I could be anything else I would. If I could be anything I would. If I could be.</p>
<p><em>Conway yawns once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>-:</strong> Now, I only slip through to you all in bits and pieces. Like a faulty satellite receiving a transmission. Sometimes the words of one are louder than the words of the others, then they slip back behind the wall and are muffled to me once more. I try to use these words, as I am now, I try to reach you all. I've raged against you, I've tearfully begged. I have made your sounds into my screams again. There is nothing I can do. I'm not sure why I keep speaking, only to be met with indifference. Not fear. Not anything.</p>
<p><em>Conway appears to fall into a light sleep, sitting up in her chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>:</strong> I'll be around as long as you are. I only come close to existing in these moments. I'm only the gaps in between your sentences, the pauses, the silence that gets caught in your throat after a sob. Somewhere in my nothing I refuse to dissipate fully. I don't know why. I don't…</p>
<p><em>There is silence in the room. Conway stirs but does not wake. No one speaks for three minutes, after which Conway wakes up, mutters an apology, and escorts D-20974 outside.</em></p>
