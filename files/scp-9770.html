</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <span class="normal-font">I was seven years old when my dad told me I was going to grow up to be one of the richest men in the world. He sat me down on the shiny white balcony of his favorite London penthouse, with all the people of the Earth beneath us like ants, and said to me I was going to inherit a spot within the company he worked at when I became of age, the place he was devoting most of his life to.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Back then, I saw it as a really big company that ruled the world and made all kinds of bizarre things. My dad was always coming back with proof of it from his business trips—eggs that hatched into ten-headed snakes, plants that could sing barbershop quartets, diamonds from the fifth dimension, stuff like that. It was all magic, he said, magic nobody else got to have, magic nobody else could <em>hope</em> to have.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He wasn’t just in the business of selling the arcane, but dealing with the darkest corners of the world to find it.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I guess it helped my mind then that this company was called “Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.”. That really does sound old-fashioned; unreal, even, if you think about it hard enough—hearing it at the time, I swear I could taste the royal blue blood staining the utterance of every syllable, coating the gilded walls and tiger-skin furniture so pristine.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t really remember the rest of the conversation. There were cars and buses honking, and I was eating some petit fours with gold leaf on top. My dad was rambling on about our CEO and her daughter Iris, the auction arm of the business, eventually going on a tangent about beautiful women that looked like dragons he said would be perfect for me when I was older. I thought nothing of it then, even though I’m pretty sure he showed me pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m still not sure how he expected a child to care about all of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Actually, I do remember one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And it wasn’t something he said, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I felt…relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I felt relief, relief as a seven-year old, like I had just dodged a hollow-point bullet because what he was telling me sounded like it could fix what happened earlier that morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It sounded like it could fix the fact my day started out cold, and and blustery, icy winds shearing my cheeks in sandpaper flurries. I had just come back from boarding school for winter break; the valet dropped me off at the mansion steps with everything blanketed in white, and there was not a single face ready or happy to welcome me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Not a single one.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I waited for a bit, shivering until I realized all our house and wait staff were on holiday too. I was annoyed by this because everyone else’s parents made theirs work the holidays, so why didn’t Dad?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Biting my lip raw, I trudged up the stairs and unlocked the door myself. It shocked me when I opened it and nearly tripped over my shoes that I was greeted by my mum passed out on the couch, with a bottle of Xanax on the coffee table and some shot-glasses half-full of whiskey next to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That was how she had spent the morning? I remember thinking, <em>How could an adult need so much medicine?</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But it was just me, that thought, my runny nose, and my bleeding lip. I could do nothing about the scene but walk in, knowing she probably didn’t want to be woken up. She always got snippy when I woke up her early.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">To my room I went, my suitcase too heavy to carry by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I told none of this to my dad, only staring at him as he finished his speech and smiled. He was looking at me with eyes that told me I was everything he was pinning his hopes on, that I was a man he was looking forward to in eleven years and this was merely the first of many welcoming parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He has deep brown eyes, just like me—we get a lot of compliments for that. Percival says they make us look human, trustworthy—it’s the most common color after all, and how can you be personable with clients if you don’t ape the common denominator just a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Marshall, Carter, and Dark…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It was going to make everything perfect, for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #12b509">HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL? WHEN THEY BROUGHT ALL OF THAT SPARKLING CARBON FIBER AND SLEEK TITANIUM TO YOUR LONDON ESTATE?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Kind of ecstatic, honestly. I already had ninety of them, and now I’m counting my hundredth. Do you know how crazy that is, to have that at this point in my life? Do you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">IT IS A NOBLE GOAL TO HAVE ACHIEVED.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Isn’t it…?! God, thinking about it makes my heart race! Them all lined up in sick rows, so polished and pristine…!

<p><span style="color: #12b509">SIT?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Let it marinate, I guess. I’m not good with words—you know what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">I WOULD HOPE I DO.</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Yeah, well, that’s what hiring people is for. Next time I’m getting someone else to manage the whole thing for me—I don’t wanna miss my favorite Vtuber streams anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">WHICH IS WORTH MORE? THE STREAMS OR THE CARS?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #12b509">UPON MY PRECIOUS LITTLE CHILD I BEQUEATH A TROVE OF SPACE WHICH SHALL NEVER END, A COLLECTION OF ROOMS THRICE THE SIZE OF THE SET OF INTEGERS. A PENTHOUSE UNENDING TO YOUR HUMAN MIND THAT WILL NEVER BURST FROM FULLNESS.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum.9770-01:</strong> <span class="normal-font">Today my coworkers Iris Darke and Robert Carter started an uproar about being able to cook.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Cooking isn’t something most people at my work do. Take-out is easier, and we have three different magic restaurants on speed-dial, so why bother?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Well, Robert knows because he’s from Karachi. He joked about how hard it is to find good food anywhere but home—said he had seven dragonling chefs make chicken biryani and none of them were as good as what you could get from a vendor’s stall. (And I get it, honestly, the stuff in England is way different from out there!)</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Iris—her tastes are a little bit…eccentric. See, her best friend Chaz runs this restaurant called Ambrose, where everything on the menu is often <em>really</em> weird. Weird as in it comes from fairies or from outer space type-weird. She’s his most frequent taste-taster, so he caters for her as a favor, and she can never get enough of it. The problem is that their schedules conflict so much that she eventually gave up trying to get him in the office twice a week and just learned his techniques herself. Smart, yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It then came my turn to tell everyone why <em>I</em> can cook and…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I’ve been doing it since I was six.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>Six.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">No, I wasn’t taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">No, it wasn’t part of my schooling. They don’t teach boys how to cook there. That’s not a necessary component of good manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I taught myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Because I kind of just…had to.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Mum never hired help around the house, not for the food anyway, not until I was about ten. Cleaning, sure, but chefs have to live in, I think, so whenever Dad got onto her for it she just screamed at him that she’d do it whenever he spent more than a day with her. She wasn’t going to tempt herself with someone who showed her more affection at breakfast than he did in an entire month.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">She was better than that. Better than him.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Now that I’m older, I think her bitching is kind of stupid. Well, not really. On a practical level, yeah. She was yelling at the man who made her one of the most important women in the world while the most she ever did was shop for ugly little purses and designer shoes. That’s dumb as hell, because he could have divorced you, Mum. He could have divorced your useless ass, and even though your family wouldn’t have liked it, I was already born, so Dad had all the heirs he needed. Marshall, Carter, and Dark’s succession requirements were met. Fuck you.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But…on an emotional level…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I burned myself a lot trying to learn how to use the stove. She didn’t teach me how to turn that blasted thing on, and Dad didn’t either. The scars have all completely healed, but nowadays I feel like they’re still gnawing at me. Spreading over my skin while I work like nauseating patches of misery, like worms eating me alive. Drawing me back into a quiet darkness that tells me it was all my fault, that I should have read the instruction manual. Because I <em>could</em> read at that age, you know? Why didn’t I?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">One time I spilled so much boiling water all over the floor that I thought I was going to die, trapped between it, the steam and the cabinets. I couldn’t see for what felt like hours, my tears bleeding into scalding vapor.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I screamed for someone to help, for anyone really. I screamed so hard my throat gave out and the water ended up finally cooling off. I didn’t know that though until I stood up and slipped—the entire time, I thought the wetness in my pants was me having peed myself in fright, making even more of a mess than I already foolishly had.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Nobody came. I was soaked, cold, digging my nails into my skin, and…nobody came. I think I was bleeding by the end of all of this, but I’m not sure how. Maybe I hurt myself in some other stupid way, like somehow I managed to find a knife and I cut myself trying to do something even more desperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You know, when I think about this, I’m pretty sure I’m exaggerating. Because there’s really no way that all could have lined up so horribly, there’s no way that there was just <em>nobody</em> at home for someone like me, there was just…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">No way, right…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I must…I must be making this up…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">No. Mum’s words were pretty clear when she did finally walk into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>“You’re filthy. Go to your room.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">At that command, I protested, and she shook her head in response. She pushed me away as I went to hug her, leaning down with tears in her eyes. They were so dilated I almost forgot they were green.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>“Do what Mummy says, Chrysophilius. Okay? That’s what good boys are supposed to do. You can change out of your clothes there, you’ll be fine. I…I need to call your father.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I asked if I could try hugging her again. I must not have known what else to do. My skin was freezing, my body was aching, but finally someone was here to look at me. To see me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please, Mum, why can’t I hug you…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>“If your father…If he answers his phone tonight, maybe…”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">If Dad calls I get a hug…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>“Stop looking at me like that, please. You…You have his eyes. I can’t take it.”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Wait, what’s wrong with my eyes…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When I asked her that, she threw her keys at me. They hit my cheek and left a bruise she told me to lie about afterwards, especially if Dad came around (he didn’t). She didn’t mean it after all, she really didn’t mean it—she cursed under her breath as she picked them up, saying I should go to bed before I caused any more problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>“I’m sorry. Don’t make me hurt you again, sweetie, please, Mummy doesn’t want to hurt you. Mummy doesn’t want to hurt anyone… Not her precious little baby…”</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wasn’t sure why I remembered all of that as I stared at my employees. At all of the people who had been told I was invincible, that my word was immutable, absolute.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I had to stop my hands from shaking, from my vision going double as it all replayed in my mind, over and over and over again in piecemeal. I had to bite my tongue and make up some story up as Dad walked by, with a tired, ragged look in his eyes that hung heavy like briefcases.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That night was the first in years I stayed up until morning.<br/></span></p>

<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You think your precious little company’s magic is going to protect you, huh? <em>Huh?!</em> Protect you from all the germs in the weird vaginas you’re shoving your dick into— Why the fuck are you so into animal bitches?!</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Those are people, Olivine, you know this—people who are—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I know what they are! What’s a snake-headed woman got sucking you off over me, anyway? You want the fangs to puncture your balls or something?! God, you’re going to die an embarrassment to your entire family if you keep this up.</p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> You told me you wanted to be at home with your friends, in London…</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I don’t want that anymore. They all think I’m a freak now.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> You need to go back to rehab, Olivine—you need to get better, for our son, because I can’t, I can’t travel with you if you’re still—</p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I…</p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Olivine, please, I can’t take it when you get like this—</p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Please, you’re better than this!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> …Am I?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Y-Yes, you are. You…You’re…This isn’t the woman I married— You were so kind back then—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> …You thought I was kind?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Of course! Remember when we first met in the Caribbean? When I…tripped over all my luggage and you were the only passerby who helped me pick it all up…?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Ha. You’ve never gotten over that clumsiness.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> H-Hey, I have—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You tripped on the stairs when you were walking up them just a few hours ago.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Dad’s eyes glisten, and he pulls his arms in, looking down to the floor.&gt;</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I…I shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It’s fine. I think it’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> …You say that like I’m not a grown man. You shouldn’t have married someone who trips over himself, especially after all these years.</p>

<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Mum pauses for a moment.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Who makes all her friends think she’s crazy so easily. Would marrying a “normal” woman have been so hard for you?</p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> You were so much more genuine than the socialite girls she wanted me to marry… Girls who only knew how to put on airs for me and say yes all the time… I know I…I know I made the right choice with you.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Now that’s what I wanted to hear. I’m smarter than their coiffed-collar asses, too, by the way. I didn’t bust my ass getting two PhDs for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Precisely…I, yeah. So, Olivine…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Seventeen seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;After that, they slowly but tepidly embrace. Two tears fall down Dad’s face he definitely thinks nobody sees, and he looks at peace. I find this strange, but wonder if this is just part of having a wife.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I do love you, more than…more than anyone else. You’re the only one who could ever put up with me…</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I’m tired, Amos. My head hurts. I hate when you make me talk like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Yes, I’m sorry, I'm sorry… Do you want to…?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Fuck me and promise you won’t do it again.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.9770-02:</strong> <span class="normal-font">I’m having nightmares now.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I haven’t had these since I was young. Since I…became a teenager, I think? Which is much longer than most people have nightmares, but I was a stupid kid, so it makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">The one last night was so…vivid. I didn’t think dreams could make you wake up wanting to claw your own eyes out. I thought I was actually back there, again…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It started off with me at home. For my eleventh birthday, something that is <em>normal</em> for most people. But for me, I got the short end of the stick, which meant mine always landed in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why is this important? Because I never got a birthday celebration at school like the rest of the boys. When they had those, you’d get a teacher to come out and sing for you, either in the dining halls or in a classroom somewhere, and if you were <em>really</em> lucky, you’d get a cupcake, or a sticker of some kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wanted a cupcake. I wanted a sticker. I wanted the boys to have to actually pronounce my name instead of calling me “Scooter” all the time. That’s my middle name, you idiots! My real one is long, and Latin, because our money is older and better than yours, dumbasses!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I wanted those things because when I was home for the summer, I never got parties. I got plenty of gifts in the mail, so much I could barely open them all, but…no parties. No cake, no candles, nobody coming to tell me how cool it was I turned a year older…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My face burned whenever I attended Robert and Iris’s birthday parties. I’ve never told them how mortifying it felt standing in their living rooms while dozens of cheery, cherry-faced adults gathered around them and congratulated them on how tall they were getting. How mature they were sounding, how they were on track to becoming coiffed, productive members of society ready to take on the world and everything the company expected of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And these parties weren’t just for the families, no. They were for Marshall, Carter, and Dark’s employees too. Lucas Monaco, Hogarth Cartwright, Alphonse Redheath, Silas King…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">They wanted to see the children their bosses were so lovingly raising. The crown wasn’t long for their heads, after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Did any of them ever notice I was missing?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Did any of them really care? That I was a Marshall going to lead them but I was just…absent? Gone? Without gatherings held in my own namesake? Did they just assume I was fine, that I was having fun elsewhere, or were they also like Dad and working a lot?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m really good at hyping people up at parties, at making sure the auction floor is having fun and that everyone is smiling and paying attention to me. There’s absolutely nothing better than seeing all those faces on me, waiting, drooling with anticipation, a lust over the magic I hold in my hands I can give them only on my approval…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Maybe I should have planned my own parties as a kid? It’s not that hard, honestly. Or I could have just found a party planner and paid them. I had a phone when I was eleven! Maybe I could have done it…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…The reason I remember my eleventh birthday was because for the first time in my life…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My Dad was home on the right day.<br/></span></p>

<span class="normal-font"><br/>
Why, I’ve never really known. I imagine he probably had a meeting cancel on him he couldn’t fill, so it was to London he went. He got in around the time I was so obviously supposed to have been sleeping, so I shut my door as soon as I saw his shadow, and locked it.<br/>
<br/></span>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m pretty sure he heard, because his footsteps closed in on me afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Chrysophilius?”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Nothing. I jumped into bed and pulled the covers over my head.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">His feet pounded louder and louder.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Chrysophilius Marshall, where are you? Have you seen your mother?”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I didn’t want him to find me. I had been a bad kid the past week, raiding the pantry in-between the hours of when I thought Mum wasn’t downstairs and stashing the trash in whatever wastebaskets that weren’t empty so she didn’t notice too much. I was also ordering takeout from places I wasn’t I supposed to, putting daiquiris on the counter when she came home that she always drank… A few times, I even found myself sampling them when I got curious. The taste was always bad, but it made me feel lighter, and sleepy, so I kind of just…did it whenever the guilt didn’t eat me alive. And whenever it was bedtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Chrysophilius!” It was difficult to hear him with how sluggish I felt. “Please, where are you? I—I’m sorry for waking you up, but I won’t be here for very long. I just wanted to say happy birthday, because I have to get back to—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">We have three mansions in London and after all this time, Dad still didn’t know which room was mine in each one.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But he figured it out eventually by going down the halls and opening each of the doors. When he found mine and he struggled, a yellow light crept around the handle and…twisted? Snapped? I’m not sure what he did to the lock to break it. I just know I stayed deathly still, like the Grim Reaper had been summoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Chrysophilius Scooter Marshall, why is your door loc—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">The light turned on. I gripped the covers around myself as hard as I could. I could feel his shock seeping through the sticky carpets, through the thick fabric cradling my face. I could feel his shame burning and seeping without looking, because mine was eating me alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He knocked a bottle of soda over on the carpet. It made the wettest noise, like someone drowned a starving rat.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“What the—!” His voice went deep with disgust. “What are you doing drinking that?! That’s so much sugar—!”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My entire body seized with fear. Tears burned my eyes as I felt the imprint of the room suffocate me, the bags of chips and snacks I’d left on the ground haunting me with their greasy crumbs. I didn’t realize how much the room smelled until fresh air rolled in, especially because I could hardly see the floor from my dirty clothes, controllers, and game disc cases littering it.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It was at that point I felt like I was on TV being made fun of. You know the American channels that people pay to watch that always made fun of hoarders? Showing off their sloppiness and slovenly behavior like pigs for the whole world to gawk at?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“What on <em>Earth</em> has happened here, young man?!” he yelled. “Explain this mess to me. Now!”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My dad yanked the covers off me so hard I nearly fell off the bed. I cried, and tried to run under it, but he grabbed me by the back of my shirt. He looked primed to yell at me more until he saw how mussed up I was and how red my eyes were.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I screamed for him to hug me. I screamed some babbling nonsense even though I knew he was angry and I had been stupid. I screamed so hard my chest felt like it would break—no, so hard that <em>I</em> felt like I would break.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Chr-Chrysophilius—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I kept crying even as he took me in his arms and sat down on the bed with me soon after. He smelled like fancy cologne.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“C-Calm down, please—shhh, there, there. I—I’m here…”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He moved a bunch of wires with his feet as he held me tight. As I let the relief of his presence wash over me like warm water.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“What—What is going on?” His voice was shaking. “Why didn’t you call me? Or someone? Anyone?”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I didn’t answer. I just kept hugging him, digging my hands into his suit. The answer was simple (Mum hadn’t called on the housekeepers yet), but a simple answer would have made him leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He rubbed my head gently, shaking himself. He was always a thin man, and I felt it as he was gasping and his eyes were getting wet. It wasn’t hard to tell from the way his voice tottered into breaking,</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“Wh-Where is your mother? Chrysophilius—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He pulled me away for a moment to make sure the question set in. Whining, I rubbed my face, wanting to go back to that comforting darkness, but he made me answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“<em>Chrysophilius. Tell me where your mother is.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">His eyes burned into me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Was I to tell him the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Was I to lie?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Something explosive was going to happen either way so I—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“M-Mummy—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He wiped my cheek with his finger as his eyes went wider. Deathly wide, graveyard wide—he was tracing bags, after all. I had gotten the taste of staying up late far too young.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“…I haven’t seen Mummy around—”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I looked at him with a similarly somber expression, going to my fingers to count the days.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“…Since…last…”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I think I saw his heart snap in two when I held both hands up.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“…I haven’t seen her in ten days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">There was nothing I could do to stop my dad’s psyche from breaking in that moment. I don’t know how I remembered that expression, but even if I forgot the form, I’d never forget how it made me <em>feel.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I felt like I had ripped open a cavern of something we were falling into with no way to climb back out. The tide was coming, the entrance had caved in, and now it was just the two of us, struggling with our heads down and our torsos unable to move as the rushing water climbed higher and higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He pulled me in so close after that I thought he’d crush me. I would have been okay with that an hour before, but as his sobs wracked his body and became one with mine, I could only describe feeling a warmth that stuck to the inside of my skull that began to rot me from the inside out.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">To see one’s dad cry…it was a sign things were…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Were…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I leaned in despite everything. I leaned in because he was there, and because he was all I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That was the earliest I ever remember my Dad hugging me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And that night was the loudest I’d ever heard him yell at my mum.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Turns out the reason I’d been left alone was because she was having the longest, worst acid trip of her life in Dublin.<br/></span></p>

<p><strong>Dad:</strong> L-Look, he’s your kid too—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You’re not going to guilt me into putting someone above my own needs again.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Olivine—why can’t you just congratulate him on his progress within the company? He’s doing so much on his own. It’s…really impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> On his own?! The best for him and not for me?!<br/>
Do you think about me at work at all? Do you think about the fact you only call me when you want to talk about <em>him?!</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Olivine, I—We’ve talked about that, you know I don’t <em>just</em> call you when I—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Listen, Amos, I know you’re proud of him. I know you love him. I want to be proud of him too. I just really wish you’d understand he’s not the only person in your family, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I know, but he needs a guiding hand where he is right now more than ever—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Yes, because he needs all the more reason to act more like you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Five seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> More like me?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Would it kill you to notice something for once in your life, Amos?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I am doing my best here—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Then please, try harder, okay? I’m not mad at you for not noticing, I promise, I’m just…concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Concerned about…?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> He dresses like he knows more than me, giving me the cold shoulder like he’s throwing a tantrum all the time. He doesn’t call, he doesn’t send me flowers on Mother’s Day, doesn’t send me anything for my <em>birthday</em>— He lacks a sense of respect for the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> His work performance doesn’t seem to be too badly affected—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Work, work, work—oh my god, is that all he’s worth to you?! Did you marry me just so you could have an heir, like I’m some kind of concubine?!</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> N-No, I—!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Then do something for once like the father you’re supposed to be! Please! Put a stop to his stupid fancies, tell him to put down those children’s cartoons and grow up. Your genetic material is in him too, you know. Is that why he cuts his hair in that godawful way he does? In that stupid little bob he dyes too yellow that makes him look like a f—</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Don’t you dare finish that sentence.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Seven seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> …I’m just scared. I don’t like having a son that looks like my friends from the salon.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Then tell that to him yourself. It’s not against company dress code, so there’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Can you have him call me?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> That’s his decision.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> So he hates me.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I would hope not.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You don’t know that. You don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Olivine, I have a performance review in ten minutes, can we talk about this later?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Can I say I’m disappointed in him?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> He’s a walking disappointment. Brings shame to the rest of us because he’d rather bury his nose in foreign picture books over something more sophisticated like polo.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I know you think that.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You know that’s corrupting him, right? He better not be scared of horses like your sissy little cousin.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I need to go. Talk to you later.</p>

<p><span style="color: #12b509">I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN ANY MORTAL EVER COULD BECAUSE I WAS BORN TO MEASURE THE FAULTS IN THIS WORLD. I WAS BORN TO WITNESS THE FLAWS OF THIS REALITY’S FUNCTIONING, THE MISTAKES WHICH PREVENT YOU FROM ETERNAL ELATION.</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">…Never be able to hurt me?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TOO, IF THAT HELPS YOU.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">How? Why should I care?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">IT WOULD PUT HER IN LINE. HUMILIATE HER WITH WHAT SHE HAS LOST BY NOT DOING HER DUTIES AS A PARENT. THE EXCHANGE OF CURRENCY, DEFINED AS STABILITY, WOULD BE SOMETHING SHE WOULD HAVE TO GROVEL TO EARN FROM YOU.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD GROVEL BEFORE YOU AND YOUR FATHER IN FACT, JEALOUS OF WHAT YOU HAVE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">EVERYONE WOULD KNOW YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT, THE MOST SPECIAL, THE MOST SAFEST. THE ONE WHO OWNS THE MEANS TO TRUE STABILITY, FOR YOUR EXISTENCE HAS FULFILLED ALL THE PROPER LABORS AS COMPARED TO THE PAUPER MASSES.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What about Iris and Robert? Would…Would they benefit from this too? I know Iris’s mother has more than all of us combined, haha. I would hope she would be okay as well…and that she wouldn’t hurt me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">THEY WOULD BE ECSTATIC. THEIR HIDDEN PROBLEMS WOULD FADE TOO.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Oh. I…I didn’t realize— Wait, you’re serious? What’s wrong with them? There’s no way they’re—Iris’s mum loves her! Robert’s dad loves him too!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">YOU DIDN’T KNOW?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Know what?! You’re telling me <em>they’re</em> miserable too? Bullshit! Bullshit! I call bullshit! They have perfect lives! Perfect everything! Everyone loves them, don’t tell me otherwi—</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE SPECIAL IN SUFFERING FROM THE DECAY OF YOUR TREASURES?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT IRIS WILL WATCH YOU DIE SOMEDAY? BECAUSE HER LIFESPAN STRETCHES A MILLENNIUM?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…No…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT HER MOTHER GRAPPLES WITH THE PAINS OF LOVING HER SO MUCH? BECAUSE SHE IS HER ONLY CHILD, HER MOST PRECIOUS, MIRACULOUS CREATION?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Uh…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED WHAT ROBERT FEELS WHEN HIS FATHER YELLS AT HIM UNCEASINGLY, UNCARINGLY? HE STOPS BEING ABLE TO BREATHE IN PRIVATE, TOO. IT TAKES A TOLL ON HIM, THE RIFTS HE DOESN’T SPEAK ALOUD.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What? You…He… No way…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">THEY TOO ARE MISERABLE IN WAYS THEIR EARTHLY ACCUMULATIONS CANNOT FIX.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">AND WHAT A SHAME IT IS, FOR THEY DESERVE SO MUCH MORE FOR ALL OF THAT WHICH THEY HOARD AND PROTECT, GOOD MASTERS OF THE POWER THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…And you’re saying you can make them happy too? That they’ll…forget everything wrong with them, that we’ll get to live the way we were promised?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">YES.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Jeez. You’re giving me a bloody headache here with this.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I can’t believe you’re…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I can’t believe I—</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #12b509">COWARD. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SAVE THAT LITTLE WHORE YOU FANCY SO MUCH? IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE TURNED HEEL AND ARE HIDING?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Hey pal, what the fuck has gotten into you—!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">DO NOT CURSE ME, HUMAN. FLESH AND BONE ANIMATED BY NEURON RECEPTORS AND RECEIVED INPUT. YOU HAVE GOTTEN DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING TRIVIAL. BY A WORTHLESS PATCH OF DRY SOIL, WHOSE FRUIT DECIEVES YOUR PRESENT MOMENT. HER NET WORTH IS ZERO; SHE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE NEW WORLD.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Wow, you know, I think I’m starting to get tired of this high-concept philosophy trite you’re spouting—buzz off! Buzz off, idiot!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SAVE HER?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Doesn’t matter!</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Maybe they should. Sex is pretty fun, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">AND SO THE TRUTH COMES OUT. ARE YOU INCAPABLE OF CARING ABOUT OTHERS IN ANY WAY DEEPER THAN SUPERFICIALITY? WILL YOU REALLY LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN MISERY BECAUSE EPHEMERAL TEMPTATIONS SPEAK LOUDER TO YOUR IMPERFECTIONS THAN REAL CHANGE?</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Hey Mum, it’s me.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I…I wanted to tell you something cool.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Spit it out.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I got a girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Oh? Really?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Y-Yeah. I wanted to tell you…because I knew you were worried about me. I heard…what you told Dad a while ago and—</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I was, yes. Oh, Chrysophilius, I…was, actually.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Y-You were?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Yes, I was.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Th-Thank you…I was…really afraid you…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> That I what? That I don’t love you?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Never…! I just…I—I—</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Good boys tell the truth, Chrysophilius Scooter Marshall. Your mum did not raise a liar.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">She didn’t, I’m just—I—I-uh…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Oh, what’s with the sniffling? My poor baby, you know I care about you deeply, I really do. I can definitely be heavy sometimes, but I only do it because I know what’s best for you and want a son I can be proud of. Your father’s not your only parent, you know that right?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I do. I appreciate you looking out for me, I…I needed it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> <em>Need</em> it. Present tense. And indeed you do—did you cut your hair when you met this girl?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…No…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> She’s a keeper, then. And hopefully she’ll keep you in line, haha. Lord knows men like you and your dad need that kind of thing.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Is that a genuine question?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…You did say you…knew what was best for me…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> What a good boy you are, Chrysophilius! Mummy loves you so much. Okay, so let me teach you something important.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m listening…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> People like you and your father are…prone to certain tendencies. Two types of tendencies. Happens with most rich men, you know?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What…What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> The first tendency is getting bored easily. You’re on top of the world, which means people are willing to do whatever you want, and won’t want to tell you when you’re making them uncomfortable.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Oh…Really?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Ugh, only a man could ask that. Yes, it’s true. You most likely make people, especially women, uncomfortable unintentionally. When men like you get bored, they start…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Start…what?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Experimenting. Subjecting the women around them to uncomfortable thoughts through their actions.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">W-What kind of thoughts?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Think, Chrysophilius, think. What do you imagine a wife must feel when she sees her husband spending more time with his male coworkers than her?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I don’t know. That he values their friendship?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Ugh, I wish men didn’t have friends, honestly.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But everyone needs friends, don’t they?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> They do, but you men…you…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…We what…?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I’m sorry, Chrysophilius. I really wish you had been born a girl sometimes, because you don’t deserve to suffer under the temptations you’ll face.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Tem…Temptations? Mum, I only—I only said men need friends—</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> That’s the problem, you know? Women can have friendships with each other just fine, but when men get <em>too</em> close…<em>too</em> close in their boredom…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What are you talking about…? I don’t…I don’t understand…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Your coworker Robert is a perfect example, isn’t he? I know he’s a dirty little faggot, spending all his time at parties and clubs with other men’s naked bodies close to him. Imagine what all his female coworkers must think of him, being in the same room as a <em>pansy.</em> I’d be ashamed that he thinks he’s worthy of being in proper company.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is this about…Dad?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Please don’t tell him we had this conversation. But…yes. Office work must be boring as hell, right? I’ll bet he fucked that Carter he works with…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">So if I’m getting this right, I need to not be bored to not be…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Your father takes vacations more than he does any real work.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> Charisma <em>is</em> his job—so yes, make something with yourself besides a pretty face for political gain. Or else you’re gonna end up a dirty faggot and your girlfriend will leave you.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Thanks, Mum.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You’re welcome. The other thing I wanted to tell—no, teach you about—was selfishness.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I, uh, have an appointment in fifteen—</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I’m more important than your work, Chrysophilius. Listen to me.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Okay.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> The other tendency men like you are prone to is selfishness. Once you climb the mountain of boredom, you’ve got the obstacles of selfishness to overcome. You know what makes men like you so selfish?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…No.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Your money. You’ll throw it at <em>anybody</em>. Any pretty woman, any new and shiny experience you come across. You’ll treat girls like toys, like objects, like something to be eaten like chips, wherever you go, unless you learn to control your selfishness.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Oh.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Not saying you do that, by the way. But your father does it, my friends’ husbands have done it—ugh. S-Sorry, this is…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Are you okay, Mum?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I’m doing my goddamn best to be a good mum, feeling like you’ll just end up like him anyway. It’s hard. I…Are you really listening to me, Chrysophilius?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Yes, I am.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Good. Good! I’m still a…<em>fuck,</em> I’ve still got this. Okay, so your money will cause you to see women as objects, and you have to resist that urge, you know?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I will…</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Remember they’re humans, with feelings, wants, and dreams, Chrysophilius. They need love, they need validation, they need…a husband to keep their promises. To not chastise them in their darkest hour.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’ll keep mine. I won’t chastise her.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Good. Because you know what happens if you fail at those things?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You’ll ruin other people.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Ruin?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You’ll ruin perfectly good girls into dishonest whores, who will become so addicted to the sex and money you give them that they’ll be empowered to run off and seduce more men into being homewreckers. And if those men haven’t gotten over their boredom, do you think they’ll be strong enough to ignore their selfishness?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…N-No?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> <em>Exactly</em>. They’ll ruin these girls, turning them into entitled little <em>bitches</em> who grow fat from not doing any real work, because they know rich men can’t contain themselves. They <em>know</em> they’re weak. All women know this, and a lot of us use this knowledge for good—but prostitutes use it for evil.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Evil…?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Yes, evil. Evil that infects their bodies, infects others. Causes them to do drugs and die young. These girls will go on to inevitably fuck up all their protections and have whore babies who will grow up to be just like them, because why not? Why not emulate their mother’s behavior? She made her bank. It’s likely she’s some kind of activist too, because a lot of these hookers demand they be taken seriously by the rest of us good people instead of being valuable members of society, like engineers, business owners, or scientists. No—they just want to fuck rich men over and over again. It’s a vicious cycle that doesn’t end once it’s started, Chrysophilius.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is it now?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It is! London is full of these degenerate pigs, out on the streets, prowling for their next meals. All coked up because it makes the performances better, makes their holes tighter. Makes the money come in faster.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You’ve really seen this?</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I have! And I know it personally too. Your dad has ruined so many girls because he couldn’t get over his selfishness. Instead of saving himself for his wife, like God intended, he enabled a cesspool of seedy behavior. He taught them to be greedy whores. He and all of his friends now are out filling Britain and the rest of the world with these useless little heathens, who deserve to be shown what a breeder’s life is really like, raped for it in dirty basements until they bleed. And that’ll be his fault, you know?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I see. I…I will keep that in mind.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It’ll be his fault they’re gonna deserve this rape. It’s gonna be his fault they’ll die alone screaming, and violated by what is just. You better listen to my advice, Chrysophilius. Because there’s still time for you. Your girlfriend deserves a good husband—date to marry, don’t fuck around!</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I will. I’ll…make sure she has a good husband.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> That’s my boy! I’m proud of you for this, you know? I…I thought you’d forgotten your mum, honestly. You’re so busy with work that you don’t call me anymore, just like him… It…I…This made me feel appreciated.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…You’re on my mind more than you know. It’s hard to forget you, really.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mum(?):</strong> Mm, I’m glad. I hope you never, honestly.</p>

<div class="blbf-name-4 blbf-colors-4">
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Mrs. Marshall! I’m so glad we could find a time to sit down with each other. My wife is in love with your clothing line; all of the models at our agency have been buying from your brand for years.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Is that true Mr. Hoffman? A pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you for agreeing to meet me at my residence; I find I do my best work from home.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Absolutely no problem. I’m surprised your husband is okay with this, though.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> He knows I keep everything professional. What, are you Americans that entranced by classic British beauty?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> I know our clients sure are! As for me though, I just feel like I can’t listen to the news anymore without some kind of celebrity cheating scandal making headlines.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It’s so trashy isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Without a doubt. Now, tell me about what you had in mind for our collaboration. I’m surprised you’re not contracting with your usual contacts.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Well, your agency has some very special bodies I’m looking for. Slender legs, small buttocks, natural bust sizes—you have more of these types on your books than anyone else. I’m attending September’s London Fashion Week next year, and I want that kind of display for my designs.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> That sounds <em>wonderful,</em> Mrs. Marshall. I assume you have a concept in mind?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> A very cogent one, yes. Since the theme is about “purity in simplicity” I was thinking about garments styled around wedding dresses. Much more practical to wear casually, but a reminder to the world about the importance of sacred beauty and unity.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> A fantastic theme, to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It is, even if it doesn’t fit the people staring at the women that’ll be wearing them.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Most men wouldn’t know what purity means if it screamed at them in the face. It’s an irony that the committee that picked the theme out is a bunch of suits, no?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> A little prickly today, aren’t you? Do you need to fix yourself a cup of coffee, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Absolutely not. I’m as lucid as I could be. Don’t you know how seriously women need to take clothing?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …When will you have designs ready for us to work with?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Now, actually. What models do you have available tomorrow? I know it’s not typical procedure to jump into things like this so soon, but I have money to spare and I want to see these pieces on flesh as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>Tomorrow?</em> Ugh, that’s going to be—give me one moment.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Hmm…seems like the only one we have available with your preferences is Lilith Elstrom.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> …Lilith Elstrom?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Girl from Oregon we brought on two summers ago. She’s got a great smile, and charity promo people love her especially. She jokes her mom misspelled her name and meant to put down “Lily”, haha.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> …Now why on earth would I want <em>her</em> to test out <em>my</em> work?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I know that tart. You keep her around not just because she’s good looking but because she pleasures everyone else for some greasy kudos in the back room.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …Mrs. Marshall, you can’t be that ignorant as to what our industry asks of women.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> I’m not ignorant, Mr. Hoffman. I’m forced to look the other way most of the time, a magnanimous gift those sods will never appreciate. <em>No,</em> what I cannot ignore about this little whore is—</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Isn’t it wonderful? I found out my husband’s been hiding this kind of thing from me for years <em>again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> I—Mrs. Marshall, I don’t know where you got these pictures, but I’m not sure what you want me to do about this—</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It should be obvious. Fire and blacklist her.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>What—</em> No, you can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> It’s industry practice.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Doesn’t mean I have to oblige you.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Are you threatening me, Mr. Hoffman? Threatening <em>me,</em> the woman who’s been disgraced by your loose cattle’s little side hustle? Think of <em>my</em> feelings, here! He didn’t even take her out to dinner!</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Your marital problems are not my agency’s issue, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> But I can <em>make</em> them your problem. Ignore me at your own peril.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Lob all the empty threats you want, I’m not sacking Lilith.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You little— I’ll make sure your wife knows about all your affairs then. I know what kind of flowers you like to rub your nose in.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Go ahead! She knows about them and is fine with it. Neither one of us really cares about the sex; it’s what we understand about each other that counts. Can’t get that from anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> <em>Whoremongering bastard—!</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Good day, Mrs. Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Don’t you know who my husband is?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Not sure I want to, really.</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You should. You should, and you should be very afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Leaving now, Mrs—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Six seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …What are you doing with that photograph?</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> That’s you, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> W—Is that Malibu—?!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Uh-huh. And you weren’t in Malibu when its Statue of Liberty replica was erected, were you? They only put it up last week.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>What in the goddamn—</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You said you don’t care about who my husband is. But oh, Mr. Hoffman, you sure as hell are going to care about what he makes—</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Wha—Witchcraft! Witchcraft! What in the name of—why is it—why is that—?!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> These pictures can be anything, you know. Look, there’s you fucking a man.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>I would never—</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Really now? Not what the evidence says. Here, now I can make it—</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>Good God, what in the world is th—?!</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> The man you actually are. The man the press will learn you are very, <em>very</em> soon, if you don’t do your due duty.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> You’re sick!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> No, I’m just tired. Tired of this, of men like you acting like you can <em>enable</em> each other—</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> <em>What would even inspire you to think of me doing—?!</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Hm? What, the pig? Your wife’s a fatass, why are you surprised? I’ll bet you would like doing this anyway, with all the worthless <em>sow</em> your agency employs. Why not try a twelve-boobed titjob? Why not shove your dick down their shit-eating mouths, because that’s probably exactly what your cum smells like.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> I hope the Lord curses you and your entire household!</p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> Believe me, he has. He <em>has,</em> Mr. Hoffman, because I am forced to resort to <em>this</em> to keep men like you in line! Can’t you understand how <em>I</em> feel, having such an out-of-control husband that he <em>fucks</em> any kind of meat he can get his hands on, even after all these years? All these goddamn fucking years?!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Twenty seconds of altercation.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum:</strong> You’re going to fire that bitch. You’re going to fire her ass and toss her out on the street so that she will <em>never</em> see the light of day in any good dress ever again. You’re going to do this lest the entirety of London, no, <em>everyone in the world</em>, find out you’re a dirty animal fucker, who gets his balls wet in the mud and vaginal mucus of a pig like a deranged psycho.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Please, Mrs. Marshall, I-I can’t—! She needs the money, she was escaping her boyfriend— H-He’ll find her again if she—</p>
<p><strong>Mum(?):</strong> Oh boo-hoo! Is that why you signed her on?! Not even because of her talent, but because you felt <em>sorry</em> for her?! God, you really are worthless. Consider it a mercy I’m giving you the option to stay in this industry.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Ten seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Mum(??):</strong> Going once.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> Please. Don’t make me do this. I don’t know what she’ll do if I let her go. She has…She has <em>issues,</em> you know…?</p>
<p><strong>Mum(???):</strong> <em>Going twice.</em> And it’s not our fault, I hope you know. What these irresponsible skints make of themselves shouldn’t matter to the better of us. Our pillars of greatness will last without them—and if they get mad about that, too bad! They should have worked harder to become the chosen few.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Twenty seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoffman:</strong> …Okay. I…I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Mum:</span></strong> Thank you. I knew you were a good man, Mr. Hoffman. Dare I call you a good husband, too? Imagine what these pictures would have done to your poor wife.</p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Is there a reason you want to know, Mr. Marshall?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…No. N-Not really. I…just want to know, you know? I was serious when I said I…had never done this with a human girl before.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Please stop asking me these questions, Mr. Marshall.</p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> …Yes.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">For what? To be an engineer?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> What makes you guess that?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You replaced a N64 cartridge battery. You know how to code in C, which I’m assuming is because you wanted to do hardware mods. You know how to <em>build</em> a fucking R4000 microprocessor of all things, and you taught all of that to yourself, yes?</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;Twelve seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I don’t give a damn if you didn’t go to high school. If you can do all of that shit, you belong in university. Tech building is hard enough as it is, and my boss burns herself a lot in her lab fucking around with magic microchips you’ve never even heard of.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Microchips with huh—?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’ll forge a transcript to whatever university you want to go to, just name it.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> …I need to get my GED first. I…haven’t pursued it yet but…</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Okay, I’ll wait on that. What university do you want to go to?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> NYU.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Ah, local. Whew… U-Uh anyways—when you want to start, just let me know. I’ll get someone to have your application approved.</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Then what do you want to be?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> A marine biologist. Because I want to save the manatees…or do you British people call them sea cows? Y-You guys have so many different words for everything…</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">How much am I actually going to escape, if I do what it wants? Our hoarding is the <em>point</em>. The broad swathes of power and people we can influence with our words and treasures is why we’re all here; this “money-to-happiness” pipeline is bullshit. Why run from it?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">How is getting rid of all of that going to make us any better? Do I want to know what I’ll look like when the chase is made necessary, and not a choice? To sow and till as we desire, in the great luxury we have when we inherited the world, that’s free will. That’s who we are. It shouldn’t be changed; don’t fix what isn’t broken, as the Americans put it.</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t get it. Mothers are supposed to love you forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">A lot of the games I played as a kid had your mum in them, sending you stuff as you went along your adventure. I remember those games more than any of the others because during breaks at school I’d often make up video games where your mum was nice to you. Different ones had different mums, with some giving you healing items, others stat buffs, and a few even had her as a summon that made sure you didn’t die in combat…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Shit.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wish I could make all the thoughts in my head stop. It sucks, because peeking begs to be necessary until you find yourself connecting things that are weird and you don’t want them anymore, but there’s no going back once that lightbulb has been clicked on.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Like…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I think of mum, and for some reason I think of Zelda soon after. And when I think of Zelda, I can’t stop thinking about my work. About all the men I see, all the business we do together, all the parties we throw over good times. Maybe it’s her dress? The women at these parties have on such nice dresses. It’s so hard not being overwhelmed by how pretty they can be…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And nothing I’m attending is a sordid affair, you know? Dinner parties, industry parties, cocktail parties, birthday parties. We throw parties like we’re all going to die tomorrow and then make stuff happen over smiles and faces that hold the keys to everything else. To contracts, inventory, brand deals, licensing agreements—I’m usually the one holding all the cards. It warms my chest so much, strikes the wickedest smile across my face.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I signed an enthusiastic man a fortnight ago to a bunch of old Anderson lots we had. Turns out I knew him from boarding school, and as he spoke to me about his new wife and child, I remembered all of the stuff I grew up hearing him say.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He was the kind of guy who snuck in porn magazines a lot, especially into chapel. Porn tapes too (VHS, then DVD). As he grew up, he started talking like he’d had actual sex. Said he fucked every teacher in the school, made them cum on his dick for good grades and the pleasure of him being their student. Because that was the best they were going to get, and the best they ever going to deserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">He was expelled when he was caught in the bathroom trying to get a blowjob from his friend’s younger sister. He nearly choked her half to death, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Does his wife know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When she gives him a handjob beneath the table, does she know his hands nearly killed a little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why…is that suddenly bothering me?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why is it making me feel weird, comparing him now to the faces of everyone at the parties I’ve been to?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It’s all just stuff! Inane stuff, stuff that—that doesn’t matter! It’s all just—senseless violence, girls passed out in side rooms that just get ignored, tablets slipped into drinks that I think are meant for the man but then he passes them to the woman besides him instead, who’s been saying no the entire night, but now suddenly wants to go home with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It doesn’t—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That’s so scary…</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">How…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">At an auction once I watched a man fuck someone after we dimmed the lights for a ritual. He nearly destroyed the magic circles we set up, getting his jizz all over the modules stored <em>specifically</em> in that room as to keep the incantation ink intact.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">The woman…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">She…wasn’t moving. Her eyelids were open, and she was drooling, but…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t know what happened to her. She wasn’t… I didn’t see her after the show. She wasn’t even a person on the guest list…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">The guy was also someone Dad was friends with…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Yeah, that’s right. I hardly recognized him in the dark but…</span></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> <span class="normal-font">When I was sixteen, near my dad’s office.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;It’s almost midnight. My dad has asked me to wait outside amidst a bunch of winding, serpentine offices until he can take me home. He has one more thing to do before he can leave.&gt;</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Mr. Marshall, you cannot tell me you’ve never wanted to try it.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Please sign the papers, Mr. Yamada.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Your tastes are already beyond regular humans, no? That cobra mistress of yours has quite the rack and cloaca.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I am not particularly in the mood to discuss my private life. The <em>papers</em>, Seiichi, the papers—</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Where is that small talk face I saw last night? If I wanted strict business, I’d go to Mr. Carter. Besides…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Sounds of paper shuffling.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> The tastes of men <em>are</em> related to this piece of business here. I’m not being supplied enough bodies for this to be favorable.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Succubi. I want twenty of them, with high regeneration capacities.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> That’s tacking on an extra three million to this—</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Two.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> One and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> One and seventy five.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Walking away now, Mr. Marshall.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Ten seconds of silence. I see Mr. Yamada’s horned shadow loom heavy in the hallway. He was my first exposure to a modified hellspawn.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> …Two is the lowest I can spare for this project.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Oh, don’t play hard-to-get with me. Every good deal needs an allocation for pleasure, mm?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Just <em>what</em> are you planning with them this time? I do not want Eisheth Zenunim complaining again. You have a habit of going overboard, Mr. Yamada.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Overboard? You bow to that clam-faced bitch and her spawn?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I care that her hysterics can sway large swathes of the Sitra Achra<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> into snubbing us.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Fine. Since you are so <em>persistent</em>, why don’t you listen to me? I’ll tell you why I want them, and you can make the call on if I’m worthy for this contract or not.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I hear Dad moving things around, like I’ve seen him do whenever he’s closing. He likes a clean desk to think.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> …Go on. I don’t have all day.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> How often do you bed succubi?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Not as often as I did when I was younger. I was never a fan of the biting, and I don’t particularly care for their “life-leeching” gimmick anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Shame. They’re so durable and willing—you never went farther?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> What is your point here, Mr. Yamada?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> You tell me Mr. Marshall. For someone who slept with one of the Great Dragons, you’re acting so ignorant about what the anomalous world offers to men like us.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> …Eisheth isn’t going to object to you having an orgy with these girls, if that’s what you’re trying to tell me you want.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> She better not! No, no—</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I turn to the lit room. My heart races as I watch Mr. Yamada spread red wings with a wide, wild grin on his face. He reminds me of the demons from Devilman, a VHS that scared me when I was seven. Dad bought it for me without checking what it was, and I couldn’t sleep for three days straight because of the nightmares.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I can’t read my dad’s face. It’s blanking with a stony expression, and he is still, hands firmly clasped as he looks up into Mr. Yamada’s eyes. I’m expected to do the same one day. Is Mr. Yamada trying to intimidate my dad right now…?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> I want something far wilder. More fitting to their nature, to the sin that they were meant for. Watching their skinny little bodies squirm under your member, with their crazed, fanged gazes staring into your soul—it’s beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I prefer my girls with regular teeth, usually.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Ah, but those can’t draw blood, can they?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> You say that like such is desirable, and like people have not tried many times.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Ha, don’t I know how true that is! The succubi actually quite like it though. Mutilation and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> …I hesitate to believe such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> They exist to please <em>you</em>, whatever <em>you’re</em> into. They’re hardly sentient when a man’s semen is splashing all over their face—it’s the perfect opportunity to get experimental.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Mr. Yamada looks like he’s about to start talking for a while. Dad is most definitely going to let him, as I would have had to as well, because the longer a client talks, the more they’ll think you care. And the more they think you care, the more they reveal their own desires. That’s Sales 101.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> A woman’s blood and a man’s semen mixing is about as divine as their clitoris against your mouth. They like it when you take a knife and cut into their baby-smooth skin—they’ll start wiggling and getting so wet you can barely focus.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I shiver, my nails gripping into the doorframe. My stomach hurts listening to this.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> You turn then to the essentials, no? Drag the knife down their cheeks, across their jaws and over their nape— The blood is so delightful smeared across them. It’s like silk, the way it clings to them and flows.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I think to myself for a moment if what he’s saying is true. Would girls really be into something like that?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> And with a few more cuts, you finally get to the meat you came for. Human breasts will never fuck knives as well as a succubi’s, Mr. Marshall, they just won’t. It’s like watching a dog being shot as compared to a steak being cooked—the choice you pick for dinner is obvious.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;My dad is silent. I turn away, shaking as I plug my ears, but Mr. Yamada’s voice runs through my body anyway. My palms are hot against my earlobes.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Splitting open the those sacks of fat as they scream is a joy every man should experience at least once in his life. The blood is warm, cloying, and when their bodies switch on the regeneration it <em>squeezes</em> like the softest, plushest hole you could ever hope to find—it’s hard staying limp in something like that. The desperation the wound has to close makes the orgasm better, keeps you going for longer.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Hot tears begin to streak down my face, because there are images flooding into my head now that won’t leave. Images that make my crotch hot, that make me want to cut myself in shame, in sorrow, in feelings I don’t know how to process.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I want to leave.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> …You look unconvinced.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Seven seconds of silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Everything you’re saying is perfectly within allowed bounds, Mr. Yamada. Please, continue—I will stop you if there is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> And we’ll discuss from there?</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I can’t stop my erection. I want to, but blood is surging all over my body. Please, this isn’t me, this can’t be me—why? My dad told me these are normal for boys my age, but aren’t they supposed to come from things that feel good?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> I like to cut the eyes after that. An under-appreciated area—though I find chaining the girls up at this stage is necessary, because they’re liable to go limp and ruin the best part.</p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> The best part?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;For thirteen seconds, I hold my breath. I nearly bite my tongue off through blurry eyes.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Yes, the best part. The vitreous humor that dribbles out of those membranes is <em>sensational.</em> Absolutely sublime. So clear, and slick, and tasty— You will not find a better lube anywhere else. It’s almost indistinguishable from your own semen—and it’s perfect for when you want to slide from the fucking the eye socket to their mouth or their back door.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;My toes are curling in on themselves now. I can’t stop anything, I can’t stop crying, I can’t stop being evil. My body is doing an evil thing, not listening to me, not listening to how my head is saying this can’t be sex. This can’t be what sex is like. Is it?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I’m hoping my dad can’t hear me, that Mr. Yamada can’t hear me, that nothing in the world knows what I’m going through in that very moment.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Are they conscious while you’re doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> Succubi don’t sleep or faint, do they?</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;I want to die. Right then and there, I want to die more than I ever have because everything Mr. Yamada has said is replaying in my head in anime cel quality, running on an HD 4K fancy flatscreen TV because my Dad noticed a lot of the stuff I watched. He was keen to shower me in gifts when I was a teenager and he was gone for long periods of time. A lot of it was good anime, but a lot of it was hentai where the girls were fucked to death by robots or giant penis monsters that came all over their bodies afterwards in victory. Eight, eleven, thirteen, sixteen—those are the years I remember his gifts scaring me into wanting to castrate myself, but I had to smile and nod and tell him thank you. Thank you Dad, for thinking of me. It’s nice you cared, that you tried to understand what “anime” was. I should be grateful, right? Mum never bothered. Never. If she knew, she would have probably told you the stuff you bought me was too scary for a kid to watch, like a loser.&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>Dad:</strong></span> …Here. Sign at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Yamada:</strong> I assume this means I’m cleared on Eisheth’s boundaries?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>Dad:</strong></span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Why didn’t he know? Why wasn’t I told what not to look at?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;Does that make him a bad dad? I couldn’t tell him afterwards when he took me home. I was lucky I hadn’t cum all over myself, because I’d have been truly irredeemable then. He told me all the time I was free to tell him about all of my adolescent boy issues, but what child could have ever hoped to explain to his father the sequence of events I just went through? What sixteen year old can ask their dad about distinguishing arousal from unwanted erections? If it’s a good thing to be scared of girls being hurt?&gt;</em></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>&lt;But why would he even care? This was clearly the kind of clientele with money. Better to be scared now instead of when it actually mattered and their wallets were open.&gt;</em></span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I think that’s all I can vomit out.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It’s all over the floor. My hands are soaked. I don’t even care about my suit anymore, or my tie—damn all this cashmere to hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Look at them. All these <em>things</em> in my room, with their fish-eyed plastic faces, vacant smiles, and tits, reminding me of—</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I-I haven’t mentioned them to her yet because I-I thought they were a fluke at first— B-But the longer this goes on, the longer she goes on, the better she gets, no—the <em>healthier</em> she looks—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">They’re gone now. Almost all gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I—Did she—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What…did she do to deserve that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What do <em>any</em> of those girls do to deserve that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">God, fuck, dammit, fuck all of this shit to hell—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is that what I’m supposed to grow up to be? Is Mr. Yamada someone I’ll grow up to be? What about those two jackasses?</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Can I do anything to change this?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Aren’t those people’s daughters?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Aren’t they people’s roommates?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Aren’t they some of our teachers, when the stars line up just right?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Maybe even our nurses, once they wash their hands?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #12b509">AND SO THE PEASANT FINALLY CRAWLS BACK.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Shut up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HAVING FUN WITH THE FILTH OF YOUR WORLD? ITS CHAOS, ITS DESPAIR?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Shut the fuck up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">CURSE AT ME ALL YOU WISH, HUMAN, BUT YOUR WORLD IS UGLY. VILE. RULED BY VIOLENCE AND THE DESIRES OF THE SKIN.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Leave me alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HOW LONG WILL YOU KEEP SUFFERING, CHRYSOPHILIUS?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HOW MUCH SQUALOR MUST PENETRATE YOUR MIND FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE INEPTITUDE OF THIS FAILED REALITY, OF THE SOCIAL ORDER ENTROPY CREATES?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Spare me your philosophical platitudes. I’m done. I won’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">VILE, WORTHLESS MAGGOT WORM. YOU POISON THE WELL FOR YOUR MORE WORTHWHILE COLLEAGUES, WHO LANGUISH IN THEIR SORROWS AND TIES TO THIS UNIVERSE’S MAKEUP.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Iris and Robert don’t need you. They would fucking <em>hate</em> you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">IRIS IS A GOURMAND FOR THE VIOLENCE YOU SO DESPISE; HER MOUTH IS BLACK WITH THE BITTER WEAVINGS OF A SERPENT’S SHADOW WHOM SHE CAN ONLY PATHETICALLY EMULATE. SHE WOULD LOATHE TO DISGUST AT THIS—SHE WOULD DO WHAT IS RIGHT.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Well it’s a good thing I’m not her, hm? “Yeah, I should have picked the crazy cannibal over the guy who jacks off to anime.” That’s really helping your argument here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">YOU ARE A PATHETIC, MEANDERING, UNGRATEFUL LITTLE CHILD. BOUND BY THE CYCLES OF LIFE, YOU WILL REFUSE TO RISE ABOVE THEM AND KILL YOURSELF.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Fine by me. Maybe Zelda will live happily ever after then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">SO YOU ARE CONTENT WITH BECOMING YOUR MOTHER? WITH THE PEOPLE YOU ARE DESTINED TO DO BUSINESS WITH?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>You little fucking—</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">YOU HAVE HER HANDS AND HER HAIR, BOY. HER DNA SWELLS AND FLOODS WITHIN YOUR BLOOD VESSELS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">AS FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES, YOU STILL REFUSE TO WEAR A LAYMEN’S SUIT. WHY SHOULD A COMMONER NOT ASSUME YOUR POWER IS THE SAME AS THE REST OF THEM?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m still a person at the end of the day—</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">AND THUS THE OUROBOROS CLOSES IN ON ITSELF. TO HUMAN IS TO BECOME HER, TO REMAIN HUMAN IS TO MORPH INTO THOSE WHO EAT FROM THE BROKEN SYSTEMS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO YOUR FAILING LUNGS IN FIRST PLACE.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>Shut up!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">REFUTE ME THEN. MAKE AN INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENT WORTHY OF COUNTERACTING ME. BUT YOU CAN’T, BECAUSE THERE IS NO EARTHLY WAY FOR YOU TO BE HAPPY. YOU ARE BROKEN BY YOUR NEUROSES AND NOW THAT YOU’VE DISCOVERED THIS TRUTH, I HAVE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT IN MY HYPOTHESES.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Zelda. I…I’m refusing this for…Zelda…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">FORGET HER. YOU WILL NOT WIN FAVOR WITH ANY FORCE SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU REFUSE MY OFFER.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font"><em>How dare you say that—</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">DO YOU SPEAK FROM LOVE, OR MORALITY CHRYSOPHILIUS? ARE YOU REALLY UNDER THE BELIEF SHE CAN LOVE YOU WHEN YOU PAY HER THE WAY YOU DO? DO NOT DELUDE YOURSELF.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">I AM RIGHT, YOU KNOW.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please, stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">How? How can you call this caring? You want to give me a world where everything I care about will <em>perish</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT SO DEFINITIVELY? DO YOU NOT LOVE IRIS? ROBERT?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Stop invoking their names.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND. LOOK TO THE CLOUDS, NOT THE GROUND. GAZE UPON A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY, STITCHED IN MARBLE AND GOLDEN CASTLES THAT WILL FEED YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">THERE IS NO NEED FOR WORTHLESS TRIVIALITIES IN A UNIVERSE WHERE EVERY SECOND MATTERS. WHERE YOUR FLESH IS WOVEN INTO THE ELEVATION OF YOUR STOCKPILES, OF THE CAPITAL YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED.</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Please…stop…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">DO YOU <em>WANT</em> TO FAIL?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t want to be a bad person—!</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">You still haven’t said what will happen to them! To people like her! I’m not about to create a world where they’re going to be trapped forever—at least here, they can get lucky…!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #12b509">WILL YOUR LIFE BE WORTH ANYTHING IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY?</span></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> <span class="normal-font">During a meeting yesterday.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>Chrysophilius, honey, it’s Mum. I’m sorry I missed your call last night—I really am—please, you know I don’t miss those like your father does. I had something really important I had to attend to—please call me back at your earliest convenience. Please.</p>
<p>I want to know about your new girlfriend. I want to meet her, actually. Where did you two find each other? Is she British? American? French? What is her mum like? Her family? Does she know the blissful feeling of a good vacation in Milos? If not, let’s take her there.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be pushy, but I would really prefer it if you married a nice girl from London, you know. Someone who knows her way around good manners, around the culture and etiquette, who can play nice with your father’s family. They’re a bunch of snobs, but they’re looking for someone to make them proud, you know? For a Marshall who will actually step up and be worth something. Someone who will be better than your father, who can actually bring them around the table again like old times.</p>
<p>Christ, I can’t believe everyone’s scattered across the globe now—it wasn’t like that when you were born—</p>
<p>That’s most likely not who you ended up actually with, I know you after all, but I promise I’ll be nice. I promise I’ll be happy for you. I promise I’ll talk you up to everyone and rub her in the face of anyone who doubted you. A Kennedy, a Mulliez, a Hilton—whoever she is, just tell me. Send pictures! Please.</p>
<p>Please, Chrysophilius. I want to be a part of your life now. It’s my duty as a mother, especially to someone like you. I know you lived with your father for a lot of your formative years, but you’re still someone who has time left, you still have the time left not to become a—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Five seconds of labored breathing muffed by a phone speaker.&gt;</em></p>
<p>…Call me back as soon as you can. Please. Mummy loves you. Mummy misses you. Bye.</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I just do. That’s why I’m the guy who usually meets people first at my company. You sure like to wear purple a lot—I like it. It matches your eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> What am I doing now, exactly?</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Oh? I…I do have them. Do you have a preference?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> …Gameboy Advance. I carried one with me until I was sixteen, in which it broke.</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">W-What can I say? I…love the color gold.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Is it custom fitted or the genuine deal? You know, the one Nintendo handed out in a magazine contest.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Genuine. I have like ten others made as replicas though, with the real metal obviously.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> …Yeah. It is. My uh, first game actually. I found it in a box when I was…uh…out, somewhere.</p>
<p><span class="normal-font">A box? Who would leave a box of games around for people to steal?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> People throw their stuff outside when they’re done with it.</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Sure. Part of your payment. I’m…not in the mood for sex, really, haven’t been for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> I see. And yet I’m here because…?</p>

<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> What…does that mean?</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.9770-05:</strong> <span class="normal-font">I didn’t go to university either, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">People are surprised when they hear that from me (from Iris and Robert too), but that’s how being an heir works at Marshall, Carter, and Dark. Degrees are ultimately certification you can learn by someone <em>else’s</em> rules—and universities are sure as hell not going to teach you about how the stars influence the fae markets. You only learn how to put on an auction by listening to an auctioneer, only learn business etiquette by asking someone else how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That doesn’t mean I don’t know the principles of how to run a business—I’ve known about how private equity and artwork evaluation have worked since I was eleven. At nine, I met my first Dragon and found out how the supply and demand of magic services are marked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why am I thinking about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’ve been thinking about <em>everything</em> I am lately. That calf ripped a hole in my heart, and now that Zelda is in my life, my head is spilling into my chest and out onto everything else. Onto someone who has likely never <em>considered</em> someone like me before…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Actually, it’s a shared experience, isn’t it? I didn’t consider people like her existed either until now. Call me stupid, but I almost forget people were capable of paying rent. We as a <em>business</em> make people pay <em>us</em> to rent <em>things,</em> but who rents a home? Isn’t that playing pretend in someone else’s stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What even are landlords like? Not <em>being</em> one—dealing with one.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Does this make sense to anyone?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I ask that like I’m not alone in my penthouse right now. I took another vacation because my ears won’t stop leaking static.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">“I want to be a good person.” Why did I say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is there anything left for me to be besides that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">A good businessman, a good son, a good heir, a good worker…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">A good boyfriend, a good husband, a good father…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">A good person is about the cheapest thing I can be.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I dunno. That’s got to be something I’m able to be good at…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Something I can do right?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What did I do to deserve any of this? What I have? Like…I’ve thought about maybe it was putting up with my mum, but I think Zelda could do that better than me. She seems unfazed by everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Was it being born? No, that doesn’t compute, because Zelda and all the girls my dad pays for were born needing…well…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And I sure as hell didn’t do enough as a kid to justify all of my stuff…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Fuck! I hate this shit so much!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I want to go back! I want to go back!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I want to go back when everything was okay! Please!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">No calf, no mum calling me over and over begging me to answer the phone…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Maybe it was ignorance, but I want to be ignorant again. I want to be ignorant so I can pretend I can love, so I can pretend I’m smiling genuinely again all the time, so I can pretend Dad isn’t a flaccid piece of shit and that Mum is just someone who gave birth to me…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I hate this. I don’t want to be so miserable I can’t live anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Hey Zelda, do you like that I’m making your life better?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Does…that make me a good person?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I hope you’re able to pay rent by yourself. I’m sure you’re living with someone—give her a break. She deserves it. That’s how that works, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please, tell me that’s right. Tell me that’s right, that I’m getting something right, anything—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Maybe I can’t be a good person. If that’s true… Maybe I can be a little bit right…?</span></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> <span class="normal-font">After I finished calling Iris. I think this was a butt-dial.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Hey, woah, Zelda, you don’t have to—</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Please. I know you couldn’t get that abortion you wanted, s-so…</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> …Th-Thank you…</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Ah!</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> S-Sorry! I…I am just…Z-Zelda, I…</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> I-I told you to please ask before hugging me…but, yeah. I know you wanna be a good mom, so I…hope this helps. …Woah—are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I-I—P-Please don’t—you don’t have to watch me cry, y-you can leave—</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> You sure? I…</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I don’t know how…how to thank you enough, Zelda. I…I was afraid of being a bad mother to him, you know? Because of not having enough… Not…finishing college like I said I would, I…</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> You’re gonna be a good mom to him. The fact you don’t resent him at all…well, it’s more than I can say I’ve seen for people like us when this happens.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Even if I didn’t want him… It’s my responsibility now to step up to the plate now. I’m all he’s got in the world.</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Ha, you and your baseball metaphors. But he’s not <em>that</em> alone, you know?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> …Yeah, you’re right. Ah, speaking of that—will you be available to watch him next Tuesday? I gotta help my sister move out.</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> Sure! But it can’t interfere with my classes, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Look at you moving up in the world, girl!</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> H-Hey—!</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I’m just saying it like it is. I’m so happy for you! Paula and the rest of them are too. Just don’t forget about the rest of us and where you came from, yeah?</p>
<p><span style="color: #d175ff"><strong>Zelda:</strong></span> …I won’t. Lemme know if you ever need more cash, okay? I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<div class="blbf-name-1 blbf-colors-1">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> <span class="normal-font">After I got another voicemail from my dad.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>Ignoring me now, are you? <em>Are you?!</em> God, I do one good thing for you and you <em>fuck</em> it up just like him! Just him, you little cunt! That’s all you’ll ever be, huh?! Just the little miniature cunt of him, straight from his loins!</p>
<p>You are the curse of my life, Chrysophilius Scooter Marshall! Your father is a blister upon this world, as are you. I wish I had aborted you just like I did everything after so that at least then, he would have killed me for not bearing him any heirs—at least then, I would be free from my pain.</p>
<p>At least then, I would be free from this nonsense. His nonsense.</p>
<p>Your nonsense.</p>
<p>You are nothing to me. You will <em>always</em> be nothing, a nothing child, a child who will never amount to more than the stupid fucking bullshit you fill your life with. I purged all of it from our mansions, you know? I can’t believe your filth stuck <em>around</em> this long but now it’s all fucking gone. All of your horseshit crap is <em>finally</em> gone from my life, like it should have been years ago when I knew in my gut you’d abandon me just like him. Just like he has.</p>
<p>Why did I even bother? Why did I let myself get <em>try</em> with you again? F-Fuck…I…I…</p>
<p>I hope you bear his shame, and if he ever kills himself, his same fate as well. I look forward to the day when I am free from the both of you, when I do not have to consider divorce and estrangement like a common dowry whore. I hope you are forever miserable in that pithy little job of yours, playing with numbers while your godforsaken mother plays with the devil and a bottle of Valium.</p>
<p>No, I will not be that weak of a woman. I will not walk away from him as a broken trophy, a separated woman: worthless, unworthy, and deflowered. I will maintain my dignity even in death, even in my misery, because at least I know your father will not deny me that. He will at least grant me in all of his promiscuous deeds his name, his title, the shadow of the crown I was supposed to have, because he doesn’t care, he doesn’t goddamn care. I’m just a formality. I’m just the woman who lives in all of his homes.</p>
<p>He can do the least of that for me. What the hell have you done for me?</p>
<p>Do you know what that means, Chrysophilius Marshall? It means <em>you</em> made me into this. You forced upon me the yoke of being a bad mother. Your fated existence made him choose me to damage, and now I am going to hell because of it. Now I am going to hell because God hates me, because my husband is a faggot pansy cheater fairy who will fuck everyone in the world except me. Except the wife he fucking married. Loved, supposedly, too.</p>
<p>I hope you never find happiness. Because if you do, I promise I will haunt you until the end of your days. I promise I will haunt you forever, and destroy everything you ever love.</p>
<p>That includes this new girlfriend of yours, you hear me? You’ll end up destroying her too, this I promise with absolute certainty. I promise it with absolute certainty because I have seen how cruel you are, how men like you behave unrestrained and unrestricted—</p>
<p>There’s no cure for someone born to a father like yours. No cure for the unholy, selfish little abomination you’ll grow up to be.</p>

<p><span class="normal-font">I’m not stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You can call me many things—shallow, acerbic, cocky, arrogant, haughty, selfish—but the one thing I am not is stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I will not call myself that anymore, because I now know what true stupid looks like.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When I think about it, (and I have to think about it <em>again</em>, because fuck this entire situation honestly) people like Zelda have always existed. Escorts, though they have a lot of dirtier names. They’ve existed since the day humans invented money, maybe even a bit before that.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Knowing why many do what they do really bums me out. You’ll see a girl you think is awesome, cute, pretty, and sexy, with the best makeup on you’ve ever seen, and it turns out she’s doing it so she can keep up with her car insurance or put her kid through school. She’s doing it so she can afford groceries for the next few months, so her dog can see the vet, so she can pay for her sister’s funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I…Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why is <em>this</em> is the kind of world I’m living in?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What does Mum get out of hurting girls like that? Okay, sure, you wanna piss Dad off, but can’t you return the favor? Would he even care if you cheated on him? That’d certainly make him look at you in some new way, which is what I think you want, but what do you do then after? Is your charade part of the game? Is this parade of malaise all you think you’ll ever be? Living out of spite is one hell of a drug, but can it go on forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">There are some medications people will have to take for the rest of their lives to stay healthy…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Ugh, what am I <em>getting</em> for all this godforsaken thinking?!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I keep thinking, I keep thinking, and I keep thinking. Turn over a memory there, find it connected to something else broken. Toss a stone that way, and you’ll find what it skips over is four different things you think are embarrassing you. Double surprise—it’s all entangled, isn’t it? Wrapped around each other at odd, impossible angles, phasing into itself tersely, recursively?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When you start asking yourself questions, when you start putting all of the puzzle pieces together…it’s all wrapped in thorns, iron thorns that bleed you until you hit rock bottom and there’s just…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">There’s more nothing. More nothing thorns, more emptiness, more wondering what this all is for.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Your dad doesn’t talk to you like everyone else’s. You’ve never had a girlfriend before. You don’t get hugs and you want them like a stupid pansy loser, because Iris’s mum hugs her. Robert’s dad hugs him. You should be normal. You should be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You like things your coworkers don’t. Your penthouse is so greedy that fake plastic girls from filthy, dirty shows don’t mean anything at the end of the day. All your collections are worthless in the end because well—who cares? Who cares about any of these characters, who cares about any of these games?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Rabbit hole, rabbit hole, rabbit hole—does it ever stop? Do flaws work like a stock portfolio, do they accumulate dividends of infinite misery?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">How do I stop the payments? How I cash out? These assets are draining me, squeezing me, plunging me into a sea of red that tastes of ink and blood—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Who broke me?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My father? My mother? My own choices?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Was I meant to be broken? If it’s possible to be born disposable like Zelda was, can people be born broken too?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Our CEO…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">She talks about everyone at the company like it’s an ordained fate we were brought into the positions we have. Like we were all destined by something with sovereignty over magic and miracle, greater than the sum of any planet, sky, or ocean, but I don’t think I can believe it anymore. I can believe we hold the most goddamn power in the world, that we can control, destroy, and create anything that we want, but then, well, why don’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Why can’t Dad create a world where Mum isn’t so mean all the time? Is he avoiding that? How can he? How can he look at her and me and decide to be a coward? Do we not mean enough for him to care?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t understand how he can work at the office so casually and for so long, attending all his little charity balls and business meetings while she’s just…seething in her own shit.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…But am I any better when I can’t bring myself to confront that with real drive?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t know how to make him do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Am I any even better than him for hiring an escort and…liking her, just a little bit…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That’s so lowly, but… I can’t help it.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Does he even remember his?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wonder. I wonder because a lot of them are dead now. I wonder if he notices, if he knows how much of a game Mum makes out of tracking them down and humiliating them. Does he know? Does he think about that after he’s done finishing inside of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When you stop considering people in terms of money, what instead is the value of their life?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What am <em>I</em> if all of my money is gone…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">My chest hurts again. My heart, it feels like it’s collapsing. The pain is radial, snaking with violent teeth, like it wants to eat me from the inside out, I—</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I have to…I have to kill it.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Not…just for me, but for Zelda too.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Whoever that was on the phone with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…I’m not sure I could do that to them. This world-creating thing or whatever. Yeah, yeah, you can call me foolish for falling in love with the stripper now. Go on, do it, get it out of your system you containment fucks. I know you’ve been listening to me this entire time, hitting me with your beams and shit. Making me remember stuff that makes me want to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Go ahead and laugh at me. Have your fun because if there is nothing I can do besides saving you all…let that be my only accomplishment when I go. Let that be the silence that haunts the casket of whatever I end up becoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">May your bodies continue to live on while I rot, because it may be a thankless endeavor, but I want to do good things. I think. I think I want to be good, I think I want to make a mark on the world, I think I…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t know how goodness is distributed in the world anymore. It doesn’t seem like it has any real pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">And I could make it that way. I really could. I…I…I really do wonder what the new world would look like. Yes, I hate that calf and its stupid way of talking to me, but who would I be if I could if I could drown in elation, in contentedness, in peace? Would I finally find myself? Would I finally become whole? Would the world finally make sense again? Would I even need to think for myself anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Golden sunshine unending in a universe created specifically to please me…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It sounds like a world free of pain. Some say that’s what makes us human, but is it human to break over and over again by no fault of your own? Is it human to hate your existence and place in the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Besides, I’m pretty sure I’d be destroying Zelda if I did that. There’s a lot of ants when you look down from the ivory floors of your penthouses, over skylines so tall you can see mountains nobody else gets to. Do I want to be the one responsible for damning everyone beneath my feet to a life of workhorse misery?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Zelda…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You’re so pretty when you smile. It’s made me like seeing other people smile again, even if I’m just out getting coffee somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I love your eyes and your hands and your shoes—I actually really unironically liked seeing your older shoes, the ones you slip into when you leave at night. They come in so many cool shapes and sizes I’ve never seen before…!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is that…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is that something I want to throw away…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">For myself and other people…?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">If don’t stop it, it’ll tear everything apart. It’ll destroy all joy, and people who aren’t…rich. Me and everyone at the company will be the only ones who can enjoy ourselves, instead of the billions of other humans on this planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Yeah…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">God, saying it like that—how could I have ever entertained that stupid cow at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Nobody’s gonna thank me if I do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’ll be…doing it for a bunch of people who will never know I exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Who don’t really care for me at the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">What what will I even have if I don’t perish from my choice?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">If I don’t put a gun to my brain when this is all done, I’ll probably live long enough to marry a woman who doesn’t love me the same way Dad did. You know, due to the whole having an heir for the company stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I’m gonna have to have a kid…I don’t wanna be a dad, what if I fuck up the way mine did? What if I’m too selfish with all my anime to take care of my own kid? What if my wife hits them too? It’ll be my fault then! I’ll have…I’ll have brought another <em>me</em> into this world…!</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">It…It makes sense, though. I can’t imagine many proper women wanting to put up with someone like me. A stupid scaredy-cat nerd who gets happy when digital girls say they hope I have a good day to the fakest username ever. I’m a loser, I’m going to be miserable for the rest of my life, I’m only good for invisible kindness…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I don’t want my mum to be right. But I can only work like Dad does. I can only buy things to fill up an infinite penthouse. I can only go out and shake people’s hands, code at my computer, look at cool magic stock markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Is that living? Will that hollow me out like it did my dad?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Will it turn me into a monster like Mr. Yamada?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Zelda, I’m sorry you met me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I really need you to stay. I need someone in my life who understands me, who isn’t going to yell or throw things at me. I need someone who is going to hold my hand when I cry, when the day has been too much for me, who can watch TV on a couch with me while the dinner I cooked is on the stove (I’ve always wanted to do that for someone).</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">When you leave me, at least leave me happy. If you stop returning my calls, at least do so in Paris, in a nice bed with beautiful heels that match your gorgeous brown hair. You and whatever girl you were talking to.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Do it with a cart full of room service you’re not going to fully eat, because you deserve to waste food for once in your life. Do it with a beautiful sunset rising over the horizon, because waking up early makes the time worthwhile, makes the morning as sweet as cream.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Do you really think time can fix whatever is wrong with me?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Can anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Do you think I can make a world where I’ll be safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Do I have that power? Should I?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">If I destroy this…will I find another chance where I can have a home?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Am I strong enough to grab ahold of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Do I even fucking deserve it?</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I feel like there will be blood on my hands no matter how I live. Semen on my being no matter how happy I try to be, because in the end I’ll be back at my little plastic altars…trying not to think about Mum screaming or Dad being the way that he is, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dead-end-city" target="_blank">pathetic and a pushover.</a></span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">You and everyone you love seem to live more honest lives than me.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wish I could join you.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">But doing so would mean Marshall, Carter, and Dark would kill me for forsaking my duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…So…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…Take this as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">This world you live in.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Let this planet and all of its ugliness, scars, horrors, and possibilities be my gift to you—make of it what you will, do whatever you feel is right. I know you’ll do great, I know you’ll become something beautiful, I know you’ll succeed despite everything, in whatever it is you’ll be.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Because that’s…</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That’s all I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">That’s…all I can afford to give you right now.<br/></span></p>

<p><em>&lt;The air smells like tears. Salty, nauseating, feverish, and auric—but only for a little while, until they dry like plaster.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A tired face looks up at a large █████.&gt;</em><br/></p>

<p><span class="normal-font">Stop talking. I’ve never killed someone before.</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;A black room is impressed upon the viewer’s mind. Darkness envelopes, and it swallows, quite literally. Everything smears like bloody mucus.&gt;</em><br/></p>

<br/>
<em>&lt;The smell of boiling gold fills the air. It tastes like skin.&gt;</em>
<p><span class="normal-font">Ugh…</span><br/></p>

<br/>
<em>&lt;A hand is plunged into a chest. A heart is squeezed soon after. It beats with a chorus that bruises the mind like a breaking inkwell.&gt;</em>
<p><span class="normal-font">Bye.</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;Lit gas licks cardiac muscle as cut nerves short and sputter. There is no screaming, only the melting of brown eyes. <span class="normal-font">I have my father’s eyes.</span>&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Two minutes and forty-five seconds of labored breathing. The heat is toiling towards an ugly climax.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Please…</span><br/></p>

<br/>
<span class="normal-font">You…won’t…make…me…</span>
<p><em>&lt;More straining. The chest is tender, the most valuable part of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">woman’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Zelda’s</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span class="normal-font">my</span></span> body.&gt;</em><br/></p>

<br/>
<em>&lt;The sound of bones cracking crawls along the ridge of his back. A hot squelch of blood looses his body onto the floor, and he spasms, vomiting. All that comes out is AAA Grade ruby, valued at ██████████████GBP.&gt;</em>
<p><em>&lt;Each piece glitters like sin. Like wet shards of cheap glass. PoI-012-05 wails. He drops the blowtorch. The room shifts with every wavering note, every unresolved █████.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A hoof flails, but PoI-012-05 rips it out along with one of his ribs. His face is pale, pallid, his expression barely able to focus, but he stares deeply anyway without vocalizing for twenty-one seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Soon, he is ripping out body part after body part. Filet mignon, flank steak, liver, stomach, tongue. It all falls out slickly with spit from his cardiac vessels, and he stands up with his legs wobbling.&gt;</em><br/></p>

<p><em>&lt;Something is sizzling. It coats the mouth like a myoglobin flood, a myocardial infarction.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence for thirteen seconds.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Vomiting proceeds to occur again for three minutes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">…What’s the phrase? Whisper me sweet nothings…?</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;PoI-012-05 coughs, biting his lip. The color from his clothes is now staining the floor, unable to sustain itself by its own weight. His epidermis and skeletal muscle soon follow, collapsing into a moist heap. The parts he pulled out and scattered begin to melt, first into bars of gold, then multidimensional refuse.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">I wish I had nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;A piercing cry echoes through the listener’s skull, but not their ears. It is invisible, begging, croaking and shattering, howling for mercy on tendons that have shred themselves to shards in a desperate attempt at life.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="normal-font">Maybe…that would fix…</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;His body fully disintegrates after a half-minute more of consciousness. It burns with a yellow glow as a radiant bovine is hoisted high above his head by an unknown force.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A loud cracking sound. Emerald horns are split from a zircon skull and smashed into bits by a metal rod. A fang-like hook hangs above the scene with a singular, hungry patience as the sounds of an industrial meat grinder swell, gnash, and scrape, their tungsten teeth flooding the listener’s ears until they pass out.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The guillotine falls; the sacrifice has been deemed holy. A scarlet thread is thrown into the fire—unyoked carcass, fade to black: it’s time for you to go back.&gt;</em><br/></p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9770</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No containment procedures are needed at this time. A twice-annual Hume reading is to be conducted of PoI-012-05<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> at range by MTF Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”) until further notice at the discretion of the O5 council.</p>
<p>In the event of signs pointing to SCP-9770’s re-emergence, all Scranton Reality Anchors are to be activated at 300% power and directed towards PoI-012-05 (or whatever host it has latched onto) to create an inverse well of anti-reality centric forces. Should SCP-9770 resist these means, the Buffett Protocol is to be engaged, destroying all levels of constructed financial reality along with the noospheric notion of financial transactions, contracts, and currency. Reality template backups<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> are to be deployed once order is re-established to revert back to normality and allow for financial markets to emerge again.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9770 was an extradimensional, ontoemotive<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> parasite attached to the subendocardium portion of PoI-012-05’s heart. Its capabilities and nature are still poorly understood, but it is thought that at the peak of its parasitism cycle, it possessed a nearly limitless capacity to control consensus reality. This seems to have been accomplished by processing the emotional distress of PoI-012-05 into exponential levels of ontokinetic influence, allowing a negative feedback cycle to emerge as it induced further stress into his body to continue its parasitic processes.</p>
<p>Onto-noospheric theoretical models have postulated that had SCP-9770 been allowed to complete its life cycle, it would have caused a CK-Class Restructuring Scenario of an unprecedented scale that would have resulted in not just the cessation of financial concepts as they are known, but a complete collapse of the physics associated with the conditions for mortality. However, definitive conclusions are difficult to confirm, as it is unknown what the true motivations for SCP-9770 entering consensus reality was. Its tampering with documents destroyed 95.6% of the research that took place when it was active, and because its behavior followed patterns present in emotionally manipulative individuals, self-accounts are unreliable.</p>
<p>Whether SCP-9770 possessed a corporeal form is uncertain. Its projected depictions (towards PoI-012-05 and the Foundation) most often resembled a green-horned, golden-hided specimen of various domestic cattle species at all stages of its life.</p>
<p>It is also unknown what the long-term effects of SCP-9770’s parasitism are on PoI-012-05. Due to the highly dangerous nature of GoI-012’s anomaly trafficking and the number of direct interactions PoI-012-05 had with Foundation staff, this line of inquiry has been deemed unsafe to pursue. This extends to any requests for the PoI classification of the individual known as “Zelda” in tampered documents, despite the fact they continue to maintain a relationship with PoI-012-05 for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>I get a little bit more numb every time he calls. Like someone is putting anesthetic on my mouth—I know what that feels like now. Dentists aren’t as scary as child me thought they were—I’m glad my teeth are getting looked at.</p>
<p>And the numbing is supposed to be a good thing. He’s fine, really. It’s just a job, I’m out in two hours, and he doesn’t hit me or raise his voice at me. He even listens to all of my boundaries I set up beforehand—no deep-throating, I won’t pee on you, you always wear condoms—that’s really more than I can say for the rest of my previous clientele.</p>
<p>But I think he’s learning. Learning what, I don’t know. It’s just…these last few times he’s caught my face slipping and noticed my discomfort, and when that happens he tries to cradle me to ask what’s wrong.</p>
<p>That’s what scares me.</p>
<p>He is asking me what I want to do now, whenever I come over.</p>
<p>He looks at me quite deeply. I know that fondness in his eyes—it comes from someone who is growing something in his chest.</p>
<p>Whenever he grabs my hand—he holds it very gently.</p>
<p>When he asks me how school is going, I tell him it’s going fine, despite the fact I had a panic attack during my first class. Everyone was looking at me, after all, these students who deserved to be there so much more than me—</p>
<p>I see the ghost of him behind me in the halls. Cheering me on, throwing a safety net over my head that burns like pepper spray.</p>
<p>The others I’ve worked with, everyone else—</p>
<p>I managed to leave. Or they just left. You’re a favorite for a little while, but they get bored eventually. I’ve heard horror stories about the girls who kept being someone’s favorite for years—what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Everything I have—without him, I’m less than nothing. Back to square one.</p>
<p>A disgusting little…</p>
<p>There is gold dust on my hands sometimes after we fuck, which I’m sure must come from the magic he talks about.</p>
<p>I…</p>
<p>I’m going to live a normal life, right?</p>
<p>Will he eventually stop calling me?</p>
<p>Will he stop looking at me like he wants me to stay?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Am I going to succumb to his gravity?</p>
<p>This isn’t a romance novel or some kind of fairy tale…</p>
<p>I’m probably overreacting. Whining again. He gave me a life to live—I need to be more thankful for that.</p>
<p>And it’s improper to look a gift horse in the mouth…</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p>Whatever he does…</p>
<p>No matter what happens…</p>
<p>You know, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/all-that-glitter-s-is-fool-s-gold" target="_blank">I think I’ll deserve it.</a></p>
