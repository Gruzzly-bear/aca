            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5403</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Neutralized (see Addendum 5403-4)</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5403 has been removed from all civilian databases. Foundation webcrawler ALPHA-03-TYCHO is to monitor web traffic for SCP-5403-relevant keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Archived Containment Procedures (last updated 09/12/1998):</strong><br/>
SCP-5403's IP address has been rendered inaccessible via standard internet providers, with any unauthorized access redirecting users to the default front page for its hosting service.</p>
<p>Efforts to disable SCP-5403 entirely are ongoing. STF Chi-11 ("Don't Like Don't Read")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> are to execute weekly DDoS attacks on the address, and continue to monitor its content and report any unusual fluctuations in activity. Communication with SCP-5403 is to be attempted when deemed necessary by Site-15 directors. If content posted on SCP-5403 is an information security risk, compromised researchers below Level 4 clearance are to be administered Class-A amnestics and transferred to another team. Under no circumstances should STF Chi-11 be disbanded.</p>
<p>After review by the Ethics Committee, members of STF Chi-11 are permitted to request voluntary transfer after a minimum of two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5403 is a website accessible at the address www.g███████.com/██████/MyFandationWorld. Attempts at tracing the website's IP address have yielded invalid results; evidence<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> suggests that an artificial intelligence or some other sapient, non-biological entity is responsible for the site's content.</p>
<p>SCP-5403 has displayed the capacity to access comprehensive audiovisual surveillance of the Foundation through unknown means. The content of the site exclusively relates to observations derived from this surveillance. Despite the scope of SCP-5403's surveillance capabilities, it does not demonstrate awareness of its classification and containment by the Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-5403 is similar to a weblog in structure, including a "guestbook" where visitors can post public messages. These messages may be responded to by SCP-5403, deleted, or simply displayed without comment.</p>
<p>The posts made on SCP-5403 vary in content. The majority (approximately eighty-five percent) consist of commentary on current events relating to Foundation interests. SCP-5403 has not displayed the capacity to affect Foundation infrastructure directly, but it appears to have a vested interest in breaches of containment. Commentary posted on SCP-5403 is occasionally accompanied by photographic footage; metadata analysis shows that these photos do not originate from Foundation surveillance infrastructure.</p>
<p>The remainder of SCP-5403’s content is highly derivative in nature, generally presented in the format of a narrative. These narratives often depict Foundation personnel engaging in <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/duke-till-dawn">excessively dramatized</a> and <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation">unprofessional</a> behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5403-1:</strong> Since the formation of STF Chi-11 ("Don't Like Don't Read"), SCP-5403 has fixated almost exclusively on its members. Due to the high stress levels reported by STF Chi-11 and other personnel made aware of SCP-5403's nature, the Ethics Committee has permitted staff referenced in its posts to record personal notes regarding their mention in this documentation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 5403-2:</strong> The following is a log of excerpts from SCP-5403's posts, presented with commentary from the personnel discussed, if applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Six minutes after the post above was uploaded, Foundation webcrawlers isolated the address and automatically alerted Site-15 to a possible BK-Class "Broken Masquerade" scenario due to the extremely high keyword density. Emergency World Wide Web Suppression Protocol α-KALYPTO was enacted successfully, and no civilian information leak occurred.</p>
<p>Following a three-day period of study, it was determined that the event was an isolated phenomenon to the webpage. SCP-5403 was then classified and issued its current containment procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> Is that what they're calling it now? Stressful?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> Look, I know from the outside it must look like the stupidest possible situation for researchers to be dropping out like flies, but… none of this shit is easy. None of us talk to each other anymore, but that doesn't make a damn difference to this thing. <em>[Pause.]</em> Nothing's sacred.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> Could you… elaborate on what you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> Found one of the junior provisional researchers crying at their workstation for the second time last night, after that thing about 2678. He'd seen the video, heard the logs, apparently. Used to be assigned to it. Poor kid nearly lost his lunch seeing it again. I told him to take the rest of the day off.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> That's kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> <em>[Scoffs.]</em> It's <em>humane</em>, is what it is. That's how people are <em>supposed</em> to treat other human beings. <em>[Pause.]</em> Can I smoke in here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> No. You seem to be very concerned about your team.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> Shit. Well, we all found out A███████'s cheating on his wife the other night. 5403 posted all the juicy details. Like I said, nothing's sacred. We don't need to know all his personal shit, you know? Especially not written by a hyperactive—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> I'm asking about you, Doctor. How this is affecting <em>you</em>. I know you care about your team, but…</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> Like I said, Simon. How do you think? I'm at the epicenter of all this bullshit. I'm just keeping my head down, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> <em>[Sighs.]</em> You've been the head of Chi-11 for over a month now. You're well within your right to transfer out or take a break from the project if it's troubling you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> The thing is, I don't <em>want</em> to. Everyone here is—they've… they've been in the field at some point. Seen shit. Not that I haven't, but… I'm just straight out of MIT, holed up in Site-15 in my cushy little cubicle, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Glass:</strong> Well, that isn't necessarily—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> So I can put up with this stupid website taking pictures of me, and ignoring what I have with Dr. Nyota so it can pretend I hook up with every man I work with. I can live with it, because it's even worse for the people who've actually <em>been through</em> the shit 5403 thinks is funny, or sexy, or <em>cute</em>, or whatever. If I'm not around to understand how this thing operates, and to give it someone to obsess over, then they'll have to get someone else to do it.</p>
<p><em>[A chair scrapes audibly, and Dr. Laraskë sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laraskë:</strong> And, Simon, this sucks. I'm not putting anyone else through this.</p>
