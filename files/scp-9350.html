<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Warwick Castle has been purchased from Merlin Entertainment Limited (its previous owner) by Foundation front companies, and the location closed under the cover story of becoming a private events space.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Bodycam view of an SCP-9350 event's aftermath. Agents only now able to safely access the site due to the sheer scale of the prior night's kegger.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All roads leading to the structure are now private, and additional trees have been planted to prevent the structure being viewable from the River Avon. Both the castle and grounds are to be continuously monitored via audio-visual feed, and the perimeter guarded by agents from Site-44.</p>
<p><strong>Updated Containment Procedures:</strong> As of 05/11/22, a detachment of MTF Epsilon-6 (“Village Idiots”) is to be permanently stationed outside of Warwick Castle, within the newly constructed Outpost-1068. Epsilon-6 is to conduct nightly patrols of the castle, and during “revelry events”, guard all exits to prevent egress of partygoers.</p>
<p>During daylight, Epsilon-6 is to clear-away detritus from prior revelry events. Recovered anomalous items are to be shipped to Site-44 for testing and archival.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9350 refers to a phenomenon affecting Warwick Castle, in Warwick, England. Exclusively during night hours, approximately once per 10-21 days, an SCP-9350 event will occur within the castle and its grounds (hereby dubbed a “revelry event”).</p>
<p>During revelry events, Warwick Castle becomes host to an immense, crowded and chaotic party, facilitated by the spontaneous appearance of ~250-1000+ inebriated, hyperactive party guests (collectively dubbed SCP-9350-1). Extensive genealogy has proved SCP-9350-1 instances to be corporeal manifestations of individuals than inhabited the castle, or Warwick, within the medieval period.</p>
<p>Additionally, during revelry events, Warwick Castle itself appears to possess a memetic property; outsiders spending more than 10-15 minutes within the castle-proper will become compelled to participate in the festivities. Afflicted individuals will not leave the castle voluntarily until sunrise, and will possess limited recollection of the prior night (beyond merely the effects of extreme drunkenness).</p>
<p>Also notable is the general atmosphere of SCP-9350 events, combining features of both modern parties (DJs, drinking games, raving etc) and cultural practices from medieval England. This extends to the clothing of SCP-9350-1 instances, with medieval dress typically supplemented with body paint, glowsticks, shutter-shades, and other party-wear.</p>
<p>Despite this, SCP-9350-1 instances seem unable to recognize the unfamiliar time period they inhabit, never questioning novel phenomena (or rationalizing them according to their original time period, such as referring to an assault rifle as a “breathlessly ornate crossbow of Yorkshire-make”).</p>
<p>Additionally, during SCP-9350 events, the castle itself exhibits anomalous behaviors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deafening music exuding from various points within the structure – most often techno, electronic, rap, or metal remixes of medieval bard-music, hymns, and folk-songs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The stonework of the castle “sweating” high-quality red-wine or hippocras.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The River Avon (nearby to the castle) being transmuted into ale or mead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The appearance of modern foods being cooked in medieval styles (e.g. various “Burger King” burgers rotating on a spit).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The castle’s portcullis independently “thumping” up and down, in time to music.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cheering and applause sounding from the castle’s dungeons and oubliettes, even if empty.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Warwick Castle is not believed to have possessed anomalous properties prior to October 2020. However, on 31/10/20, local police reported to the castle following reports of loud noises, strobe-lighting and smoke from within the structure, during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>An in-progress SCP-9350 event was subsequently discovered, with backup being called once orders to leave the structure were refused, and the first wave of attending officers joined the party. A Foundation asset within the Warwickshire Police service then became aware of the escalating situation, quickly contacting Site-44 regarding the potential anomalous activity.</p>
<p>During the subsequent Foundation response, all officers and witnesses at the scene were amnesticized, and a cover story regarding an illegal rave fabricated to local media organizations.<br/>
Following this, provisional containment was established, and subsequent observations quickly identified a potential culprit for the carnage (hereby designated POI-9350-A).</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>POI-9350-A:</strong> POI-9350-A is a middle-aged Caucasian male of unknown origin, most commonly dressed in a stereotypical blue “wizard’s robe”, with an accompanying beard and pointed hat.</p>
<p>According to POI-9350-A, his preferred name is: <em>“Aldathar Aethelwulf, Lord of Cups, Thrice Gelded, Warlock of Warlocks, Friend To All”</em> (or “Aldathar”, for brevity).</p>
<p>Through repeated Foundation observation, Aldathar was quickly discerned as the source, or at least a focal point, of SCP-9350. Subject possesses powers resembling common ideas of magic, able to control the anomalous properties of the castle at-will, end or resume revelry events, and perform a wide variety of other anomalous activities with no known limit.</p>
<p>Aldathar is universally known amongst SCP-9350-1 instances, considered an exceptionally generous host. His hospitality has even been cited as the reason SCP-9350-1 instances have “come all this way”, or “travelled far” to attend the revelry. Notably however, no SCP-9350-1 instances appear to know Aldathar on a personal level, only as a distant benefactor.</p>

</div>
<p>On 05/11/22 (Bonfire Night), a revelry event of exceptional intensity took place.</p>
<p>Approximately four hours into the event, Aldathar was seen to vanish from a mosh pit towards the castle’s eastern wall, before emerging, thirty minutes later, riding a dragon (to the great amusement of revelers). The dragon then began a low altitude flyover of Warwick, stunning civilians and singeing multiple houses.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Foundation disinformation campaigns were able to successfully convince witnesses that the “dragon” was actually part of a nearby drone show, and that the fires throughout the city were the result of unrelated fireworks misuse. Still, the severity of this containment breach prompted the creation of Outpost-1068 and the deployment of MTF Epsilon-6.</p>
<p>Other notable revelry events are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>12/07/21</strong> – several SCP-9350-1 instances, alongside Aldathar, successfully teleport to a nearby “Bargain Booze” store, ostensibly to pick up alcohol. CCTV footage shows the cashier initially assuming the group to be costumed partygoers, but the situation degenerates after several revelers attempt to pay using gold coins, or trade using live chickens and geese. Foundation personnel subsequently collect SCP-9350-1 instances, with Aldathar responding “mead maketh the merriment!” when challenged.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>03/02/22</strong> – whilst investigating the memories of SCP-9350-1 instances, Samantha Dubois of the team’s security detail communicates to another member via radio. Dubois’ French accent is immediately noticed, and she receives several “two finger” gestures from nearby revelers, alongside one yelling “Agincourt, wench!” from across the crowd.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite Aldathar’s repeated efforts to calm the situation, multiple personnel are struck by thrown beer mugs and rotten vegetables during the ensuing commotion.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>21/06/22</strong> - during a revelry event to celebrate 2023’s summer solstice, an abnormally large swan was seen arriving at Warwick Castle, dubbed "our lady of the lake" by Aldathar. Swan was approximately 21x the size of ordinary members of the species, yet was notably docile, offering rides to SCP-9350-1 instances throughout the night.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon agents attempting to interact with the creature, however, it reacted in a manner more typical of swans, injuring all involved personnel before escaping into the surrounding forest. Drone imagery reveals the swan did not dematerialize upon sunrise<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, persisting within the countryside surrounding Warwick. Recovery efforts are ongoing.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>27/03/23</strong> – at approximately 1AM, various "Viking"-style longboats were observed arriving from the River Avon, followed by disembarkation of many SCP-9350-1 instances in traditional Viking dress<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Aldathar initially reassured others that they were their “friends from beyond the sea”, but despite this, 17 separate confrontations occurred within the first 10 minutes of their presence, primarily over ale casks and food.</em></p>
<p><em>Subsequent recommendations for a fully British team of personnel were rejected, owing to the xenophobia of many revelers towards even Scottish or Welsh accents, and the impracticality of sourcing a team entirely from the English midlands.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>31/12/23</strong> – as this revelry event signifies a new year, Aldathar attempts to give a speech to all SCP-9350-1 instances present. However, this attempt is marred by a general lack of interest and attention from the crowd, and is ceased when a naked reveler leaps forward, shouting: “behold, mead AND meat!”, causing an uproar in the crowd. Throughout this, Aldathar looks noticeably deflated.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>13/03/24</strong> - at approximately 2AM, Aldathar conjures a large patch of bioluminescent blue mushrooms, consuming a small handful before lying down. Various SCP-9350-1 instances subsequently follow his example, yet seem reluctant to do so. Recovered samples reveal the mushrooms were chemically identical to Psilocybe cyanescens (a type of “magic mushroom”), however Epsilon-6 members reported feelings of intense melancholy whilst in the vicinity of the mushroom patch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>01/04/24</strong> – at approximately 11PM, Aldathar breaks away from a crowd of revelers and retreats to a nearby battlement. None follow him. Aldathar sits alone for 30 minutes before conjuring a cloud of will-o'-the-wisps, watching them fly away, then slowly walking back towards the fray.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>05/04/24</strong> - a record 1535 SCP-9350-1 instances are seen in attendance, including various creatures from English and Welsh mythology. Despite this, Aldathar mostly spends the night alone, partaking of River Avon’s ale.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>01/05/24</strong> – revelry event attendance once again breaks records, but Aldathar is not seen at all during the proceedings. During Epsilon-6 patrols the following morning, however, Aldathar is found slumped against the door of the castle’s primary keep, unspeaking. Subject's beard and robes appear unkempt, while his overall demeanor is despondent. This is the first instance of an SCP-9350-1 instance persisting beyond daybreak.</em></p>
<p><em>Following repeated questioning from Epsilon-6, Aldathar finally speaks up, requesting a “private audience with your liege”. Following deliberation at Outpost-1068, alongside confirmation that SCP-9350’s memetic properties were no longer active, Head Researcher Henrietta Thorpe was sent to converse with POI-9350-A.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transcript of this interview is as follows (with Aldathar’s words translated from Middle-English):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “It’s nice to finally meet, Aldathar Aethelwulf, L-“…</p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> "If it please you, my lady, “Aldathar” is more than enough."</p>
<p><em>Thorpe appears momentarily surprised, before resuming.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “So… Aldathar, you said you wanted to chat?”.</p>
<p><em>Aldathar remains silent, with a look of mild confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “My apologies, you… “requested an audience” with us? We have questions we’ve wanted to ask you too, Aldathar”.</p>
<p><em>Aldathar remains silent for another 15 seconds, gazing at the dawn sky.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “Does your work give you purpose, my lady?”.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “My… work? I’m not sure I understand… If you mean my research, well I’ve always wanted–“.</p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “So many have toiled in this domain, these fields, for countless years.”</p>
<p><em>Aldathar shifts in the light, and it becomes clear his eyes are red from tears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “To ease their worries, their fears, their long wait. To provide a sanctuary, of a sort. That was my goal.”</p>
<p><em>Researcher Thorpe glances at the grass surrounding the castle keep. Smashed ale casks, chicken bones, and what appears to be several dragon eggs and smoldering fires are still visible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “So this… revelry… of yours? It’s a distraction? A reward?"</p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “A reward indeed. But to my shame, too much of a sweet thing can still poison, my lady. I had shunned my purpose, but after so long, I find myself coveting it once more."</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “Your purpose?… Aldathar… just how old are you? These people you host, they’re centuries old, but we’ve never been able to figure out-“.</p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “[REDACTED]. I trust there you’ll find the answers you seek, my lady."</p>
<p><em>Researcher Thorpe appears momentarily stunned by the information.</em></p>
<p><em>Aldathar stands, appearing moreso at peace than the start of the interview. He turns to Researcher Thorpe, knowingly smiles, and bows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “I know not who you are or what you seek, but my lady-“</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Thorpe:</strong> “Please… call me Henrietta if you’d like”.</p>
<p><em>Aldathar chuckles and smiles again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aldathar:</strong> “I know not who you are or what you seek, Henrietta, but you strike me as a soul most-learned in the ways of science. I leave stewardship of this sanctuary to you”.</p>
<p><em>Aldathar begins to fade from the castle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Henrietta:</strong> “But Aldathar, I don’t… wait!”.</p>
<p><em>Five seconds later, Aldathar has completely vanished. The castle is silent and inactive. Henrietta slumps on the grass, defeated, for several minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>Henrietta radios Outpost-1068, instructing Epsilon-6 to travel to the nearby location: [REDACTED] and begin excavations.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excavations at the provided location revealed the skeleton of a male human, tattered robes matching Aldathar's outfit, plus a faded tapestry, depicting him in service to William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick.</p>
<p>Since incident 1068-B, SCP-9350 events have continued to occur, albeit more sporadically, with fewer SCP-9350-1 instances in attendance, plus noticeably less anomalous activity.</p>
<p>Aldathar has not been seen in attendance.</p>
