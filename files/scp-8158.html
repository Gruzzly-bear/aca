<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
As SCP-8158 has no known physical form or point of origin, it is impossible to be contained physically, and thus has been granted the containment class of <a href="http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/jiraku-mogana-s-proposal">Bakkhos</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Alternative entry methods into SCP-8158 that do not involve loss of life are currently being pursued by the Foundation.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel embedded in civilian medical and hospice facilities are tasked with identifying and documenting cases of civilians who are in conditions wherein SCP-8158 can manifest. All data is to be recorded and archived within Foundation databases for further cross-analysis. Psychological support is to be provided to affected individuals as necessary, followed by amnestization if required.</p>
<p>Usage of the Mk-XI 'Elyon' Neural Receptive Implant (NRI) has been <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tentatively discontinued</span> resumed. All personnel who have not had their NRIs installed are required to do so immediately. An investigation into the relation between SCP-8158 and the Mk-XI NRI is underway by Site-71’s Dept.- Paraphysical Sciences, under Project Trailblazer.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8158 is a metaphysical construct accessible only to sapient organisms who have disassociated from their physical bodies following a point of clinical death, during long-term comatose states exceeding 5 years, or upon causes that render the brain inoperable indefinitely.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Its exact location, if physical within Baseline Reality, is undetermined.</p>

<p>SCP-8158</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subjects describe SCP-8158 as a room resembling a typical waiting area, similar to those in office buildings, hotels or other commercial spaces, featuring beige walls, fluorescent lighting, and rows of plastic chairs. A reception desk, featuring non-operational standard office equipment, is consistently present. A series of 4 inactive elevators (designated SCP-8158-A) are also present within the far end of SCP-8158.</p>
<p>Upon entry to SCP-8158, SCP-8158-A instances are initially unresponsive to any input. Following a random period of time,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> further input would allow SCP-8158-A to open, revealing an elevator with a single button. The ultimate destination of SCP-8158-A is unknown, as all recovered audio/visual records thus far cut out within ~5 seconds after entering SCP-8158-A. Factors affecting the duration of time needed before SCP-8158-A instances are capable of operation are also unknown.</p>
<p>Personnel equipped with standard-Foundation issued Mk-XI 'Elyon' Neural Receptive Implant (NRI) are able to broadcast their experiences within SCP-8158 continually; however, communications by baseline Foundation forces to said Personnel is not possible. All other versions of the NRI are unable to perform this function; whether this is due to Anomalous phenomena or a design flaw in the NRI's Mk-XI iteration is unknown.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8158 came to the Foundation’s attention following Dr. Raphael Whitaker’s death in a car crash on Southwark Bridge, London, on 12/3/2003. Upon recovery of Dr. Whitaker's cadaver, his NRI was shown to have continued transmitting neural activity logs for a period of up to 38 hours after brain death</p>
<p>Later analysis provided the first insights into SCP-8158’s layout and properties. Since Dr. Whitaker’s case, several individuals, internal and external to the Foundation, who experienced temporary clinical death or comatose states have independently described identical features of SCP-8158 following interrogation. This recurring pattern has solidified the anomaly’s classification as SCP-8158, with Dr. Whitaker posthumously being acknowledged as its initial identifier.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following are NRI logs from Dr. Caele Yew, a researcher on the Dept.- Paraphysical Sciences' Project Trailblazer, aimed at further studying SCP-8158.</p>
<p>Due to Dr. Caele’s already-present liver cancer, Dr. Caele was granted surgery, relief from Foundation duty and associated Foundation Personnel Services.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Dr. Caele initiated surgery on [REDACTED]; however, due to a botched procedure leading to excessive internal bleeding and organ failure, Dr. Caele was considered an excessive constructive loss. Dr. Caele’s contract was terminated and he was euthanised via injections of neurotoxins to induce brain death.</p>
<p>Following his termination, Dr. Caele’s NRI continued to record audio/visual feeds for a period of time exceeding [REDACTED] before cessation of functionality. The following is a compilation of transcribed NRI A/V feeds for Dr. Caele's duration within SCP-8158.</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><em>&lt;A/V feed activates. A large, white space can be seen, devoid of any furnishings.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Uhh… Hello?</p>
<p><em>&lt;No response. Dr. Caele continues walking forward. After a short period of time, Dr. Caele's surroundings distort, slowly transitioning into SCP-8158&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> …Very well, then. I'm starting on SCP-8158 now… ahem.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele pauses, clearing his throat.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> This is Dr. Caele, researcher on Project Trailblazer. I am beginning investigative expedition [REDACTED] into SCP-8158. Current date and time, [REDACTED], planned duration of investigation around… three, three and a half hours. Proceeding to the reception desk now.</p>
<p><em>&lt;A 1990s-era CRT monitor is visible, with a desktop, keyboard and mouse arranged in front, and a desk phone nearby. The PC does not activate.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Guess that's a no-go. I mean, I could break it… maybe later.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele proceeds to investigate the remainder of SCP-8158 for five minutes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> What's the use of turnstiles if they don't even work… anyway. I've basically checked through the whole place, and it seems fine enough. I haven't checked the elevator, though - I'm not going to until I need to. I won't even have to press it, since they're gonna bring me back afterwards anyways…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele pauses.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Speaking of which, the elevators. I haven't felt the urge to go 'up' the lift yet. Not even a single bit. I can't even remember them being here unless I pay attention.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele presses an elevator button. No changes occur.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Hm. I guess I'm lucky. Or something. Whatever. I'm just gonna wait here a bit until they pull me back… There’s not much in here that’s not already pre-established, so I'm not sure why I'm here.</p>
</div>
<p>5 minutes after this point, Dr. Caele was euthanized.</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> They sure are taking a while to bring me back. Hmm.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Roughly an hour passes. Dr. Caele begins pacing around, his breathing uneven.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;to himself&gt;</em> No… no, this isn’t right. They said I’d come back. It’s been… how long? Too long. Something’s gone wrong.</p>
<p><em>&lt;He looks around frantically, his voice rising.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Did… did they mess up? There’s no way… right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;A faint ringing noise begins, emanating from the phone on the reception desk. Dr. Caele hesitates before cautiously approaching it. The ringing grows louder, insistent. He pauses, before picking up the phone.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> <em>&lt;softly&gt;</em> Caele.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> …Wait, Yew?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> No… no, you can’t… you’ve been gone for years. The breach…</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> <em>&lt;calmly&gt;</em> Caele, you’re dead. It’s time to accept it.</p>
<p>Dr. Caele: No, no, no! This is a mistake! They were supposed to bring me back! I wasn’t ready! <em>They</em> aren't ready! They're just not done with, with the surgery! J-Just give them some time to bring me back… please…!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> You’ve been holding on too long, Caele. You knew this was coming. Let go.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele collapses into the chair at the desk, the phone slipping from his hand. His breathing is labored.&gt;</em></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>At this point, Dr. Caele forcibly terminates his NRI'S A/V feed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<div class="notation">
<p><em>&lt;NRI A/V feed re-activates. Dr. Caele is seated on the chair, resting his head on the table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;whispering&gt;</em> Dead… I’m dead. <em>&lt;pause&gt;</em> No… no, that can’t be true. This is… a dream. It’s a dream. They’ll wake me up, they always do. The surgery is gonna work out, and I'll be in a hospital bed…</p>
<p><em>&lt;He shakes his head violently, pacing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> This isn’t real! I’m still on the surgery table, right? They’re fixing me, right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;softly&gt;</em> Right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence follows. Dr. Caele runs his hands through his hair, before he suddenly inhales sharply. His breathing rate calms.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Alright, focus. Focus on what I can do. Continue documenting – Standard Foundation protocol. I can — <em>must</em> — still be useful to the Foundation. Somehow.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele continues to speak to his NRI again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> …Location is anomalous in nature. Well, that’s evident… Walls…wood panelling, translucent glass… elevators… looks to be a more modern model, destination unknown. PC, phone and turnstiles have no branding, and do not appear consistent with known models…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele pauses, tapping his foot against the ground intermittently.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;to himself&gt;</em> Feels… sterile. Like a waiting room but stripped of any warmth and life. Oddly quiet. No staff. No signage. Just… empty.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Several hours pass in silence. A gradual transition in the room’s lighting is noted until it is pitch-black. Visual artefacts are noticeable due to the video feed adapting to the darkness. He sighs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> What’s the point of this? Who’s even going to read this? I’m not even sure I’m alive at this point. For all I know, I could be… I could be…</p>
<p><em>&lt;He sits against a wall and rubs his temples, visibly agitated. A long silence follows, broken by the sound of unsteady breathing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;yelling&gt;</em> This… This isn’t fair! I worked for this! For you! This was ALL FOR YOU, Foundation - everything I ever did! EVERYTHING! My life! My time! My family! And this is what I get? This empty void?!</p>
<p><em>&lt;He kicks the desk chair over, shouting.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> You bastards! You… liars! You promised me I’d come back! You promised!</p>
<p><em>&lt;His voice cracks as he slams a fist on the desk.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Years of work, sacrifice, for what? Nothing? To just, just-</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele approaches the PC unit, and begins smashing it against the table. Loud crashing sounds can be heard. Dr. Caele picks up a shard of glass from the PC casing and holds it up against his arm.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> If…If I'm not going to go back… If there's nothing left to go back to…I might as well just…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele violently slices the skin of his forearm with the shard. Despite a visible incision to the skin, no blood is produced.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Of course, there's no blood, of course I can't die, that would be too easy, RIGHT?! Just… JUST FUCKING LET ME GO BACK!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele pushes the desk phone aside, causing it to fall onto the floor. He laughs maniacally, before manually disconnecting his NRI.&gt;</em></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>Signal from Dr. Caele is interrupted.</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><em>&lt;NRI A/V feed resumes. Minimal visibility can be seen. Soft sobbing can be heard. The feed jerks, as Dr. Caele gets up.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> …Any moment now, please. Please? I…I’d do anything…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Pause&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> God…? Are… Are you there, God? Do you… exist?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> If you’re here, if you're listening… I don’t deserve this. I… I just wanted to make a difference. To matter. To… help. I…I’m sorry I didn’t believe you. Can’t you give me another chance? Please?</p>
<p><em>&lt;He clasps his hands together, voice softening.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Just one more shot. I’ll do better. You… you honour those who repent, right? Those who… who atone for their sins? I’ll do anything… I'll pray, I'll repent… just not this. Not this emptiness, this…purgatory.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence on recording&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Please.</p>
<p><em>&lt;No response is heard.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;softly&gt;</em> Guess you’re not listening. huh? Or maybe… maybe I’m not worth listening to.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele mutters more quietly, his voice barely audible.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m tired. I’m so tired. I can't do this anymore.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence on recording. Dr. Caele continues.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Maybe it’s better this way. Maybe… I was never meant to finish anything. Never meant to make it. I… I couldn't be the best at what I want to do. I couldn't save Yew from that hellhole. I couldn't fix my life, achieve something in the Foundation, something useful to humanity. I… I couldn't do anything right. I… I'm useless, a failure.</p>
<p><em>&lt;He sits in silence, the emptiness of the space weighing heavily. No change was detected, aside from occasional muffled sobbing and muttering.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Is this… Is this really all that there is to this place?</p>
<p><em>&lt;pause&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> <em>&lt;softly&gt;</em> Maybe this is all there is. This… This is it. The threshold. It's… right here. I never realised. Maybe… it’s time.</p>
<p><em>&lt;He stands slowly, looking at the elevators. His expression shifts from despair to quiet resolve.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> Yew… if you’re not up there, I hope you’ll forgive me. And if you… you are… I hope you’re waiting.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Caele takes a step toward the elevators.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Caele:</strong> To the Foundation… my time dying in the dark is done. I have to go to the light now. I'm long overdue by now. I hope you understand.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The elevator doors slide open, and Dr. Caele enters. The hum fades into static, then silence. The recording ends.&gt;</em></p>
