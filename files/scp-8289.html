            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8289</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8289 shall not be entered outside of testing. Site-70 administration has been instructed to never schedule meetings in SCP-8289 without authorization from the Indeterminates Research Group. In the event of a containment breach, enter SCP-8289 without scheduling a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> It is undefined behavior to reside within SCP-8289 outside of a scheduled meeting. SCP-8289 is formally designated Room-70-094-8289, a 12-person meeting room in Site-70. The SCP-8289 research staff has been optimized to an automated containment and calendar booking system.</p>

<p><strong>Containment Breach 1971-11-18</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is the Indeterminates Research Group? The personnel listing is empty. Nobody has been containing this meeting room for god knows how long? The automated calendar system has been scheduling meetings in the room! I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refuse</span> to enter the room as it says in the containment procedures. I blocked off access to the room and I'm escalating this matter up the chain of command.<br/>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>INTRODUCTION TO UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR</span></h4>
<p>The above document demonstrates the careless research undertaken when our understanding of undefined behavior - and semiohazards in general - was much more limited.</p>
<p>A reminder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undefined behavior does not happen.</li>
<li>Undefined test results are undefined.</li>
<li>Undefined behavior cannot be exploited for gain.</li>
<li>Undefined behavior is more common you know.</li>
<li>Many anomalies involve some undefined behavior or is caused by it.</li>
<li>Sanitization can prevent undefined behavior, before it occurs, with a defined failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your homework this week is to write four pages on the mistakes made researching and containing SCP-8289. Please don't be the research team that is optimized away by the universe like our former colleagues in the Indeterminates Research Group.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Lazar Xander Dudley, Undefined Behavior Sanitization, Department of Semiohazards</p>
