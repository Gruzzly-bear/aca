<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6160 has been acquired by the SCP Foundation, and all doors have been securely locked. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-6160 under any circumstances. The guest bedroom door and the basement have been sealed shut with concrete.</p>
<p>Any personnel who enter the basement are considered lost. No efforts to retrieve them will be made.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6160 is a two-story residential home located in Hexgan, Nevada. Although the property itself does not showcase inherent anomalous properties, it has been documented as being a hotspot for non-descriptive<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> anomalous phenomena to occur.</p>

</div>
<p>SCP-6160's non-descriptive anomalous properties manifested shortly following the purchase of its residing property by its owner, Agatha Blythe. Beneath SCP-6160 is an underground tunnel believed to extend several kilometers into the earth. The full extent of SCP-6160 has not been measured, as all personnel who enter it are eventually lost.</p>
<p>The corpse of Agatha Blythe was found near the entrance of the basement. Her body exhibited signs of extreme weakness, malnutrition, and dehydration, suggesting death via continuous, non-stop overexertion.</p>
<p>The initial investigation of her death by authorities led to the discovery of the tunnel system beneath SCP-6160. After several officers were lost, Foundation agents embedded within law enforcement reported the anomaly, prompting the implementation of containment procedures.</p>
<p>Agatha Blythe's mobile device contained several dozen audio files, many shared with her close family. Notable excerpts have been listed below, having been scanned and cleaned by both the Department of Infohazards and the Department of Tactical Theology.</p>

<p>Hey mom! Got that new place we were talking about. I know you've been annoying me about my old neighborhood, so I finally managed to move out.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Yeah, it's not exactly in the best state. But, I see a boatload of potential that more than makes up for it!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It's two bedrooms, one bathroom. Then obviously the kitchen, living room/dining room area, backyard, and a pretty big lawn!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It's perfect. No idea why the previous owners sold it. Again, great neighborhood, a bit spacious, and not that far of a walk from the store.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Gotta be ghosts. (Laughs) It's always ghosts.</p>

<p>Hey mom, it's me again. After a week of my own renovation, I finally managed to make the kitchen look great, the wallpaper you suggested really makes it pop.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
After that, I went ahead and cleaned up the bathroom, and then started on the basement. This damn- <em>darn</em> place was neglected for way too long, the drywall is chipping, some of the floorboards in the guest bedroom are dented.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Place used to have some bad termites. Remind me to replace everything in the guest bedroom. Looks like a tornado went through. Talk to you later, love you.</p>

<p>Christ almighty. The past tenants really messed this place up. Carved some stuff into the floor, had a ton of wooden figures, which, I just want to say, look really valuable to just leave behind, and this incredibly gross looking meat pile, I'm gonna send a pic real quick…<br/>

Picked it up with some gloves, then immediately chucked it in the bin. I would've called you earlier, but… yeah, you know why.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
If people did actually think there were ghosts here, I might have to actually hire a priest. Even through my gloves, it felt just… gross. Disgusting. Washing this place to hell and back.</p>

<p>Me again, went ahead and finished up the bedroom. Found this book under it, the last people who lived here were absolute lunatics, I tell you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Tossed it in the trash as well, tied up that bag and chucked it into the dumpster without a second thought. I'm not a skeptic, but it's like… you know? Just weird. Just <em>weird</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Contacted the dudes who sold it to me, they can't tell me about the last people who live here. Either they can't, or they don't want to admit they had a bunch of crackheads in this place until I came along. Hope that I scared them off.</p>

<p>Probably was just a weird fever dream, I didn't hear anything last night, which is certainly a low bar.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
In other news, uh… I went down into the basement again, realized I have so little room, and the walls are incredibly thin. Got some approval to extend it. Even if I've got another two years until that degree with engineering finishes, I'll be sure to put what I have to use.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Didn't actually <em>tell</em> you about the dream, it's starting to come back a bit.<br/>

<p>After chipping away from the walls, I heard that damn voice again. It felt like it was so weak, I couldn't help but feel bad for it. I can barely remember what it looked like, though. Maybe I'll take some lucid dreaming exercises…<br/>

I'm planning on working upstairs some more, but as it turns out extending a basement is a lot of work. Will keep you updated.</p>

<p>Oh god, oh god… I heard it, it was what I wanted, but… but… it felt so <em>real</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I… I was sitting, in… in a cave. It was so dark and damp, only light was a single, dying lamp. I saw <em>it</em> standing right in front of me; it was a rotting, dirtied corpse. thinking about it still makes me want to throw up. Worms were writhing out of its face and arms, god… I saw holes in its skin and legs, peeling away and filled with soil. Before I could even say anything it spoke to me, I swear I can still hear it ringing through my head.<br/>

(Pause.)<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
"Every waking hour, bugs, worms, all sorts of pests crawl into my every orifice and chew away at my flesh. When they are finished, it grows back hours later. I have no way to stop this. Please, please." It begged. Every goddamn word that came out was followed by a pained whistling as a giant hole was gaping in its throat.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
"They left me here to rot. They buried me within the earth as, they hated me. They thought I would grant them wishes when I was powerless. Please, help me." It extended a skeletal hand, roaches falling off of it and onto my feet. I was just paralyzed, and all I could do was raise my own. The second we touched, I woke up.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I knew it was just a dream, but it felt too real to not mean something. I'm going to work on the guest bedroom. I love you.</p>

<p>Went to expand on the walls a bit. Realized that I could spend the time I'm already down here to make a panic bunker.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Sure, it's going to be a bit more money. But, think about how much I'll save in the event of an apocalypse when I'm sure the big bunker industry will start charging everyone else tooth and nail for a bunker in their house.<br/>

<p>Another night, and I saw him again. It's been hours but I can't get him out of my mind. Woke up at seven, and its… its four. Fuck.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I was in that same cave again. And he stood in front of me. I- I fell to my knees, staring into his empty eye-sockets. Even in this broken, rotting state, he was still able to cry. His tears were red, small maggots fell out of it and into my mouth. I couldn't throw up, they wriggled and squirmed around, going down my throat. Eventually, he spoke once more.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
He gagged, and then said, "The soil around me has been forced into my lungs. I cannot breathe; fungal colonies have sprouted within my bones, their spores are infecting my flesh, my every organ."<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
After that, he coughed, spores fell onto my face, and almost immediately they started to grow. I felt as if I was him, every inch of my body was rotting against my will.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
"Please."<br/>

<p>(Singing off-tone) You can break a shovel when you break new ground…<br/>

You dig dirt up when you dig deep down. You should know… (Gibberish) that by now…<br/>

He can see it. Can you?<br/>

Out of tools, out of shovels, been using bits of the broken ones to keep going… they banned me, can you believe it? They.. they banned me from the Home Depot, cause I kept taking their shovels. If they would <em>get it</em> I wouldn't be having to steal more rock, more stone, more…<br/>

More, more rock.. it's just a tunnel of rocks, just more and more of this… how much longer? How deep…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The metal.. it's too weak, too dented. The pipes are good enough substitutes, though. They just… they work fine. They work just fine, able to dig through the dirt more than you would expect for metal pipes to…<br/>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On 10/11/2021, a minor structural collapse occurred within SCP-6160. The collapse occurred several miles from the previously believed end of the tunnel. The bodies of several missing persons who had entered SCP-6160 were discovered, along with various mining tools.</p>
<p>Despite the several-year difference between the disappearance of these personnel and their deaths, they appeared to have died due to the structural collapse rather than dehydration.</p>
