</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7226 is a 23 year old human male<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-7226 is capable of transporting itself into any form of digital media within six meters or less from its location. When SCP-7226 exits the media, physical distortions often develop both interally and externally. SCP-7226 will be forcefully ejected from the media it is currently in if the device is powered off.</p>
<p>At the time of discovery, SCP-7226 had the following physical distortions due to use of its ability:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-7226’s right forearm is difficult to perceive visually, and appears to constantly be in movement despite being stationary. It reports paresthesia in the effected limb.</li>
<li>SCP-7226 has cataracts that constantly change between the colors white, yellow, cyan, bright green, fuchsia, red, and blue.</li>
<li>Strands of SCP-7226's hair became permanently various shades of blue.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the below test results for more information on SCP-7226's anomalous properties.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>INTERVIEWED:</strong> SCP-7226</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Kenny Hart</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> The following interview was conducted with SCP-7226 before any testing was approved.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Hello, SCP-7226. My name is Dr. Hart. How are you this evening?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Do you have to call me that? My name is Virgil.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 slouches in its seat, crossing its arms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> It's protocol, I'm afraid. Now, I have some questions about your ability.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I know it's unfavorable, that's just how things are. I'm going to start interviewing you now, alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Kay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> When did you first realize you had this ability?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> You don't know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> I mean, I don't really know. I just had it one day. Do I have to answer anymore questions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I would appreciate you cooperation, SCP-7226.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> It's Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> If I use your name, will you cooperate?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>[shrugs]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> <em>[hesitates]</em> Virgil, how many times have you used this ability?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Why does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Well, you have physical distortions from using your ability. We plan to test your ability in order to learn more about exactly what form you take within different pieces of media. Though, we need to be careful as to reduce the amount of distortions you gain to be as minimal as possible.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 sits up in its chair.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> You're letting me go back online?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> For testing purposes, yes. I can tell that's something you appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> What? I've been really bored in my room. I've used it like, five times.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. I'm surprised you haven't used it more.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5272267:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> If I had that ability, I can think of a few reasons I'd be constantly using it.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 shrugs, turning away from Dr. Hart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> We're going to try to make sure you don't get many more distortions then you already have, as the distortions seem pretty painful. We want to see if we can find the cause, as well. Like, what media does what to you so we can potentially reverse the effects.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> You can reverse the effects?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Maybe. We'll see. We can do a lot of things that you wouldn't have thought possible. Our goal is to contain and protect anomalies.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 was silent for a moment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> I see. I'll do the tests.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Well, it's good to have your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> What other types of things can you do here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I'm not exactly at liberty to say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Come on, who am I gonna tell? I can't talk to my family, I definitely don't have friends, I don't even get to see my dog again, not that he can talk. So I have no one other then the staff here to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I apologize, but I'm not going to tell you classified information.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Anyhow. What did you use your ability to go into?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>[shrugs]</em> Social media, a song, once.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Ah, social media? What sort of things did you go into?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Pages of celebrities I like. Some songs I used to listen to years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I see. Well, thank you for your cooperation. You'll be notified once it's time for testing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Alright.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Following this interview, SCP-7226 frequently asked staff if it could learn about the other anomalous artifacts in the Foundation's possession. This request was denied.</p>

<h5 id="toc4"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test Results V1</strong></span></span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following is a summary of information discovered upon initial testing. The full test logs are available upon request.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-7226 only affects the copy of said media it enters, not appearing in other copies opened at the same time.</li>
<li>If there is not a place for SCP-7226 to naturally be inserted into the media, it will not be visible. Regardless, SCP-7226 can interact with the immediate surroundings in which an image was taken, even if said surroundings are not visible in the image.</li>
<li>When SCP-7226 goes within any media online, the page will appear in the device's history. If it does not go into online media, it has been unable to determine what media it enters.</li>
<li>SCP-7226 is still aware of its immediate surroundings within media, and is able to verbally respond to staff, even if it cannot be physically seen.</li>
<li>At this point, it is unknown what exactly causes SCP-7226 to gain additional distortions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following list what online pages SCP-7226 entered:</p>
<ul>
<li>An account on the social media platform <em>"Instagram"</em> under the username <em>"1nf1n1tyf0rev3r"</em>. The exact photos it entered are unknown.</li>
<li>A research article on the possibility of resurrection.</li>
<li>The Google Maps page for EverHaven park in Waukee, Iowa.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-7226 displayed a series of behaviors that were noteworthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>While SCP-7226 initially cooperated with staff, this cooperative behavior dwindled over the course of the tests.</li>
<li>SCP-7226 continued to ask staff about anomalies within Foundation possession. While it originally replied with understanding and vague dissatisfaction, it began to display aggression when not answered or denied information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="material-box">
<div class="title-style">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5 id="toc5"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test Results V2</strong></span></span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<p>No additional information on the inner workings of SCP-7226's abilities was gained from testing.</p>
<p>SCP-7226 returned with the following distortions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-7226 reported experiencing visual and audio hallucinations. When asked what it hallucinated, it refused to answer.</li>
<li>SCP-7226's speech began to audibly distort, causing syllables and words to be replaced by audio static. This effect worsens when the subject is emotional.</li>
<li>All colors on and within SCP-7226’s immediate vicinity will distort, causing nearby colors to bleed into each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing session was quickly deemed ineffective, as SCP-7226 continuously disappeared from the media it was instructed to enter, failing to respond to staff. When SCP-7226 was forcefully ejected from the media, it responded with verbal aggression, accusing staff of lying to it.</p>
<p>This uncooperativeness made it difficult to properly analyze the full extent of its anomalous properties, and unable to observe what may be causing the distortions.</p>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWED:</strong> SCP-7226</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Kenny Hart</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> During testing, SCP-7226 displayed a general uncooperativeness and behaved in a reserved manor. The following interview was conducted in an attempt to uncover the root of this behavior.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Afternoon, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> You remembered to call me my name. <em>[coughs]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Yes. I did.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Th-thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> You're welcome. Now, I would like to discuss your behavior during testing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> What, am I-[STATIC].. <em>[coughs]</em> in trouble? Is this grade school, or something? I'd actually prefer to be back there. Things were easier.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> No, you're not in trouble. But your behavior did leave us with many questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Questions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Yes. You continuously went to other pages that you were not instructed to go into.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Yeah, there wasn't really much you could do to— [STATIC]. <em>[coughs]</em> Do to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I would appreciate if you could enlighten me on why. You were rather cooperative the first time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Aren't you guys supposed to be-[STATIC] miracle workers?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Who gave you that impression?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>[shrugs]</em> Because you said you could help. When I first got picked by you guys I thought I was in legal trouble. But, the people who escorted me-[STATIC] assured I was in good hands. [shrugs] I don't know. I had hope. That something could… <em>[shakes head]</em> But you didn't help me. Things just got worse. You all made me worse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> We're trying to help you. But if we can't observe your interactions with the media, we can't help you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> I never actually cared about what happened to me, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> You don't care about getting hurt?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> No. It doesn't really matter what happens to me. I just thought… [STATIC] I could be less miserable. But I was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> That's not true.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 remains silent.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Virgil, I'm a psychologist. If you're hurting emotionally, I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>[Pause]</em> Are you gonna do more testing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Yes. In a few days, we're going to give you your phone for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Are you going to look through my phone?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Well, yes. We need to know what content you might go into.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 appears visibly distressed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Why? You don't need to know that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Yes, we do. In order to see how the content affects you. We're not sure exactly what interactions are causing these distortions. So we need to see if uncover the cause, if there's anything we can do to ease your symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> That's stupid. There's clearly nothing you can do to- [STATIC] help me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> You need to let us try. To let me try.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> Just let me back online.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> We will for testing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> And after testing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Only for testing. I've said we have to be careful due to your condition.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 remains silent.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Well, Virgil, I'll see you again, after testing.</p>

<p>SCP-7226 was given access to its cellphone for testing purposes. SCP-7226 appeared reluctant to enter the device, expressing discomfort with its whereabouts being known.</p>
<p>To combat SCP-7226's habit of going into unknown media, it was decided to review the contents of the phone first. This was done in order to uncover any files or applications in which SCP-7226 could be hiding so Foundation staff could check said media during testing.</p>
<p>SCP-7226 was discovered in the following media:</p>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> An image of a man<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> at a park, found in a photo album titled "Us❤️".<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-7226 hugged the man. It returned with worsening color distortions on its arms and chest.</p>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> An image of the same man from before sitting on a couch with a terrier on his right. Found in the same photo album from before.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-7226 sat against the man. The blue distortion on SCP-7226's hair worsened. It is noted that the man is wearing a blue sweater in the image.</p>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> A video of SCP-7226 and the man from before singing the chorus of <em>"I And Love And You"</em> filmed from SCP-7226's perspective.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-7226 sang along, causing its vocal distortion to worsen by a significant amount, with the majority of its spoken words being replaced with audio static. SCP-7226 returned from the video with tears in its eyes. When SCP-7226 cried, the secretions appeared to be digitally pixelated, and the subject reported discomfort caused by their unusual sharpness. Additionally, SCP-7226 reported that its vision had worsened significantly, being primarily unable to see.</p>
<p>It was discovered that SCP-7226 only gains distortions when attempting to physically interact with media that it has emotional ties to (ie. Hugging a loved one in a photograph).</p>
<p>Testing was brought to an emergency stop. It was determined that it would be dangerous to SCP-7226's health to allow it to use its anomalous properties again, as damage appears to progress at a quickening pace upon each use.</p>
<p>SCP-7226's containment team has begun to analyze what causes each distortion in order to attempt to reverse the effects. As of current, nothing has been discovered.</p>

<h5 id="toc9"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-7226 Psychological Testing</strong></span></span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<p>On 12/07/2022, a thorough psychological evaluation with SCP-7226 was conducted by Dr. Hart. The following are the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Foreword:</strong> As SCP-7226 has primarily lost the ability to speak and the ability to see, the following evaluation was conducted by analyzing past interviews and test results.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-7226 to suffer from the following behavioral disruptions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Poor self esteem</em></li>
<li><em>Post bereavement depression</em></li>
<li><em>A general disregard for its own well being and safety</em></li>
<li><em>Anger at staff for not allowing it to use its ability again</em></li>
<li><em>No longer being willing to discuss its feelings with others</em></li>
<li><em>A preference for social isolation</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>These behaviors have been worsened by the distortions caused by its anomaly. During the beginning of testing, SCP-7226 appeared to have a semblance of hope when informed of the endless possibilities of items within the Foundation's archive.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe that SCP-7226 may be afflicted by the following conditions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Major depressive disorder</em></li>
<li><em>Prolonged grief disorder</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I believe that SCP-7226's physical condition is worsening its mental condition. While efforts to cure its physical symptoms have been started, I believe that if we cannot find a way to reverse these effects within a timely manor, it may be needlessly cruel to keep it alive, especially if its condition continues to deteriorate at the current pace. Although, I don't favor this outcome, as I do believe that both physical and mental recovery is possible.</em></p>
<p><em>While communication is currently difficult for SCP-7226, I will provide therapeutic services for it in the best manor that I can.</em></p>
<p><em>I will be prescribing SCP-7226 20mg of Escitalopram (Lexapro) for its mental condition.</em></p>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWED:</strong> SCP-7226</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Kenny Hart</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> SCP-7226 communicated through writing due to its inability to speak.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Hello, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>what</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>dont talk about it</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> By not talking about it, you've been tearing yourself apart. By continuing to live in the past.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>dont act like you get it</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Usually, I don't share my personal life with my clients. <em>[pause]</em> But I can make an exception. Someone very close to me… <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4412" target="_blank" target="_blank">went down the same path that you did</a>. He's still around, but miserable. And it hurts my heart to see him suffer. Though, he's slowly been coming around again. It does get better, Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>you couldnt help me</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Have you considered that you haven't allowed us to help you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>I cant be helped</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> That's not true. <em>[pause]</em> The person close to me, he didn't have any anomaly deteriorating him. But, he used alcohol and cigarettes. To numb the pain. He didn't want to get better. He felt like it never got better.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>it doesnt feel like it gets better. once theyre gone life loses meaning</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> He felt that way, too. But in turn, he began to shut out everyone that wanted him to get better.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 pounds its hand against the clipboard, but didn't write anything for a moment. It then writes 7226 down, pounding its hand against the clipboard again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>I lied about using it five times</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> I figured. You've probably used it what, hundreds of times?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>[nods]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>like 50. I didnt have it for long till you guys found me</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> <em>[pauses]</em> This ability has just allowed you to hold onto the past more than a usual person in your situation would.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>the past is all I have</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> That's not true.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 was silent for a moment. It appears to be on the verge of tears, expressing pain due to the unusual sharpness of its tears.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>if I get better, will he know I miss him?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Of course he will, Virgil. Losing someone is one of the hardest things that one can go through. Part of the healing process is knowing that life does go on. By getting better, you're not erasing that they've existed, but acknowledging that change has happened. You have to live despite how hard it feels to move on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>he wouldnt want me to tear myself apart like this</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Of course he wouldn't. He loved you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7226 was silent for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>ill try. to heal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> That's good to hear.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7226:</strong> <em>thanks. for sticking by me.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hart:</strong> Of course, Virgil. And I'll continue to stick with you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Within the following months, as SCP-7226 began grief counseling, its physical distortions began to alleviate. It is hypothesized that as SCP-7226 continues to work on its mental health, its physical health will reflect this change.</p>
