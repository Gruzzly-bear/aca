            <h1>SCP-9144</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9144</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9144 is to be contained in a standard safety tank in Site-3. Testing, maintenance and research is to be authorized by Dr. Yule, the current research head.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9144 is a chemically unidentified viscous liquid with similar properties to oil. It generally appears red in colour. The item's main anomalous property is the capability to smooth human skin to anomalous extents with contact.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> This effect is progressive with contact, and It is unknown if there is a limit to which the fluids properties will scale to, for more information see Test Log A3/9144, attached below in this document.</p>
<p>SCP-9144 was originally found by the orthotan archeologist hive mind known as “Vagn”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> on a dig site of ruins associated with the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/second-hytoth-hub" target="_blank">Earthen Ortothan Kingdom</a>. After finding the anomaly, contained within pottery, PoI-9144 conducted an archeological study.</p>
<p>After performing a series of translations from inscriptions located on the premises of the archaeological site, Vagn contacted Site-3, specifically Dr. Hartog<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> in order to hand over SCP-9144 to the SCP Foundation. Vang claimed that the item “is undoubtedly some horrible ‘anomalous’ nonsense that is retroactively damaging the work of my life” (sic).</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9144.1:</strong> Expedition and Translations Made by PoI-9144</p>
<p>In January 2001, Vagn traveled with two other Canadian archeologists to Tyre, Lebanon, in order to conduct a dig on a recently discovered temple complex dedicated to the Holy Forth, of Orthothan mythos.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> The dig was sponsored by the Church of the Second Hytoth, which contacted PoI-9144 to lead the expedition due to his expertise in Asian anomalous cultures,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> and worldwide recognition.</p>
<p>PoI-9144 found a collection of minor anomalous artifacts alongside inscriptions registering an as of yet lost mythological background regarding the Holy Forth. The whole of SCP-9144 was also located in a single, fully inscribed and illustrated, ceramic jar. According to expedition documentation, site context indicated that this jar was not only in a position of worship on the temple's reliquary but was regularly worshiped.</p>

<p><em>The Holy Forth blessed, then, with a series of wonderful substances. His proficiency with the matters of medicine, the body and what can be done with miraculous substances is fearful. The Holy Forth is the master of alchemical medicines.</em></p>
<p><em>However, as high as his proficiency gets, a frightening madness extends deeper and deeper. The flavor of thoughts flowing through the powerful Holy Forth is the stupidity of a mad being, as secreted by the remaining Holy Seven.</em></p>

<p><em>The Holy Seventh ordered the decision towards the Holy Forth. Not a single of the one of the Holy ones opposed. “The Forth is not to be considered damned, the Forth is to wander the earth and learn.” The Forth knows much but is also mad.</em></p>
<p><em>The medicine provided by the Holy Forth is good medicine. The lives of many men were saved by his blessing. Enjoy the blessings of the Holy Forth, but also with care. The Holy Forth is both a genius and a fool.</em></p>
<p><em>In one day, the Holy Forth might decide to heal an ailment, and in the night may decide to drown a man in a terrible and unbearable illness. It is in his nature to provide and take, is it what happens in nature. What is provided can be taken, and what is taken can be provided. There is no greater reason than the cycle of health and illness.</em></p>

<p><em>In time pasts, the Holy Forth blessed the temple with four wonders. All of those proved to be dangerous, mysterious liquids and medicines. “You must trust the Holy Forth”, is what was said. The Holy Forth was changed.</em></p>
<p><em>The Holy Forth was, indeed, about to pass. The sacrifices of the Kingdom were not enough, and soon his knowledge of alchemy would be lost.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9144.2:</strong> Recovered Documentation</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I myself once had a run-in with a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dado-hub" target="_blank">parapharmacologist</a>.</p>
<p>He was a weird fellow, and his grammar was poor. Let’s just say the man had a bad reputation and quickly became known only for his incompetence. Let me explain for a moment how I met this idiot: it was a freelance job to solve a particular problem; me and my colleagues needed a solution capable of smoothing the skin. Circumvent problems an extraterrestrial friend was having.</p>
<p>This dado did provide us with said solution, and it really appeared to be a fine and good medical fluid. It wasn't. We tried to get a good solution from him, but he always shut us down with “u need 2 trust dado”, and eventually we moved on to get more competent assistance. The process of getting a refund from this fool was so troublesome I ended up giving up.</p>
<p>The fluid I was fortunate to find on the temple is very similar. In disbelief, I took samples for comparison, just in case. It was the same fluid. Not only a match, but the exact same fluid, down to age, composition and all other chemical possibilities. Then I started translating the text found, like I have done in many ways before. Then it started.</p>
<p>Mentions relating to the Holy Forth and his, to my absolute horror, beloved pet hamster. About his speech pattern. About his confusion towards being corrected on how to write properly. The Holy Forth on the tales, asking to be trusted, saying to othothans that they needed to learn to trust him.</p>
<p>For the first time I wished for nothing more than to set a blaze on my notes.</p>
<p>My friend, Roberto Hartog, my head is spinning like a tornado. I only ask that your Foundation take this away from me and the Church. Even if you do not explain to me, I believe you will find a rational explanation for this matter.</p>

<p>— Professor Vagn</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9144.3:</strong> Test Log A3/9144</p>
<p>The following are the results of a test conducted by Dr. B. Noculars, supervised by Dr. Yule. This was the first, and only, testing made with SCP-9144 after its acquisition.</p>
<p>The procedure consisted of exposing D-2209 to SCP-9144 and measuring the effects according to the exposure time.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>00:00:</strong> The subject makes contact with SCP-9144.</p>
<p><strong>00:15:</strong> D-2209 reports that the skin in the areas where the liquid was applied are notably smoother and softer than prior to the exposure.</p>
<p><strong>00:30:</strong> Dr. B. Noculars notices SCP-9144 applied to the subject drips on the floor. All SCP-9144 content applied leaves D-2209 skin and goes to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>00:32:</strong> D-2209 trips on SCP-9144. His body no longer produces any friction. Dr. Yule advises Dr. B. Noculars to terminate the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>00:35:</strong> D-2209 becomes unable to stand, hold any objects, or to produce any relevant friction with other surficies. The test is terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of yet, D-2209 has not recovered from contact with SCP-9144. Additional testing has been denied by Dr. Yule.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9144.4:</strong> Contact with dado</p>
<p>After testing of SCP-9144 concluded, Dr. Yule received an unprompted text message on his personal cellphone. The device has since been exchanged for a new model because of safety concerns. The sender could not be located.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>dado:</strong> hello. this is dado. u r mr. xmas?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Perry Yule. Don’t call me ‘xmas’.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> okay. mr. u have bad dado product. dado needs to see if its okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> How do you know this?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado learned this from a guy with denish name.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado needs 2 recall old product. its not good for dado. the product is bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> I would like to keep it. How come the product is bad?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado did not make it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Our mutual friend assured me it was made by you.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> oh. that is old dado. u dont need 2 worry about old dado.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado was 1 way before. now dado is not that way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Excuse me for a moment. You confirm being the Holy Forth?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> weird way 2 say dado.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> You made the lotion, yes?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado from the past. u need 2 understand.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> How does this work?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado is not this guy. but he was dado. dado was born later. but he was dado before. dado cant tell u 2 trust old almost-dado. but u need 2 learn to 2 trust dado.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> You are the same but different?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> yes. old-dado died, and new dado (me) lived.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Then, what happened to your old life?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> it does not mater. things changed a lot for old-dado. eventually old-dado needed 2 go. he left me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> What do you think about the Orthotans?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> they r no longer dados friends. they liked old-dado more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Yes, but what do you think of them?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado does not think about space. dado need 2 focus on earth only.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> So, you changed so much you just don't care anymore?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> yes. now. did u have lotion problems.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> One of our guys is still unable to get up because of it.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado can offer u a new lotion. things made by old-dado r not dado level quality.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> You will send a new one?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Give me a moment.</p>
<p>[Dr. Yule consults with Site-3 staff, the purchase is approved with the premise of apprehending Person of Interest dado.]</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> I live in downtown Liverpool.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> ok. no problem for dado. send details.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yule:</strong> Good.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9144.5:</strong> Recovered Phone Call</p>
<p>The following is an intercepted conversation between PoI-9144 and dado.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> hi mr. danish.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> I must ask, how do you keep finding my phone numbers? This body of mine is enjoying the best of life. Be brief, seeing your contact info appear in my phone makes me want to puke.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> ok. u need 2 trust dado ok. r u not working.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> I am working, yes.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> so u dont have time.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> I have time, but as I said my patience is in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> you magical.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> I have 4 bodies and you know that. We have already met once. We have already discussed this. I am getting the impression you are deliberately trying to insult me and my biology.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado is not doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> Okay, Dado, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> its dado.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> do u need more dado products.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> No. I already disposed of your medicine.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> dado means the one for alien friend.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> do u want 2 buy new dado product.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> We already solved that.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> ok. what do u need.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> u sure.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dado:</strong> do u need time to think.</p>
<p><strong>Vagn:</strong> Okay, Mr. Dado, I am going to not only block you, but destroy this phone. I do not wish to see you. I do not wish to talk to you. I am tired, exhausted and you are the greatest fool I ever met. I hope you have a good day.</p>
</div>
<p>After this exchange, Vagn immediately left the Tyre excavation team.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9144.6:</strong> Update 13/09/2001.</p>
<p>Person of Interest dado was not apprehended. Dr. Perry Yule later noticed an application on his Personal Computer called <em>dados medicine for the computer</em>, which worked as a poorly designed antivirus, that repeatedly crashed Dr. Yule's machine, culminating in the researcher throwing his computer out of the window. dado expressed being unable to provide the previously stated product, and then provided an “alternative” (sic).</p>
<p>No further information about dado and his role in Orthatan mythology could be acquired by Site-3. Further attempts to contact the parapharmacologist resulted in failure, and no other relevant information regarding the Holy Forth of the Koru-teusa are available for the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p>The Church of the Second Hytoth has not addressed any claims or information relating to SCP-9144 and dado and his connection to Orthotan mythos. PoI-9144 quit the archeological team in Lebanon and still sustains his claim about the dig site being compromised. No further contact between dado and the Group of Interest has been observed.</p>
<p>D-2209 is still under the effect of SCP-9144.</p>
