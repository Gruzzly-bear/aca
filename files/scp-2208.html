<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2208 is to be kept in a Level 4 secure storage locker in Site-57. Personnel wishing to access SCP-2208 must obtain permission from the Site Director. Instances of SCP-2208-A are to be cataloged and placed in non-hazardous storage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Full-body protection must be worn at all times when testing SCP-2208.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2208 is a 2-quart ██████-brand stainless steel saucepan. The inside is coated in a nonstick polymer believed to be polytetrafluoroethylene.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> The handle has been modified to include a USB standard-A receptacle, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the purpose of which has yet to be determined</span> investigation of which is pending.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> SCP-2208 does not transfer heat as a stainless steel saucepan should, and heat testing up to 2,300°C has been unable to warm its surface.</p>
<p>When a human subject makes skin contact with any part of SCP-2208, there is a 29% chance the subject will be transformed into a saucepan (SCP-2208-A) in a process that takes ~0.8 seconds. Instances of SCP-2208-A match SCP-2208's appearance, apart from the lack of USB receptacle; they are otherwise non-anomalous. Subjects unaffected by initial contact with SCP-2208 are able to safely handle it thereafter.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> A predictive pattern of SCP-2208's effects has yet to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Interview 2208-01</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> J██████ Nuñez</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Alvarez-Montaña</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-2208 was recovered from the home of J██████ Nuñez of Westway, Texas, USA, along with 145 other saucepans believed to be instances of SCP-2208-A. The home was raided after a four-month federal investigation into the disappearances of more than ███ individuals from the area. Foundation agents embedded with the FBI were alerted to SCP-2208's anomalous properties after 3 federal and 1 Foundation agent were converted into instances of SCP-2208-A. The object was recovered by a federal agent immune to its effects, and Ms. Nuñez was questioned by the Foundation. Interview translated from Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Alvarez:</strong> What can you tell us about the saucepan we recovered from your home? The one that transforms people.</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Nuñez:</strong> God created man in His own image.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Alvarez:</strong> I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Nuñez:</strong> God does not make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Alvarez:</strong> I don't know what you mean. Maybe you can explain why you haven't been changed? I'm sure you've touched it. Is there a reason why some are changed and some aren't?</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Nuñez:</strong> You and I, we are unworthy. I brought more and more faithful to him, yet still am I forsaken. <em>[begins to cry]</em> Why am I not worthy?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Alvarez:</strong> Make sure you tell the Bureau about that later. <em>[pauses]</em> Are you sure you don't know anything more about how it works, or why?</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Nuñez:</strong> God does not make mistakes, Mister Agent. If God were to change, His image would change, also.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Ms. Nuñez was remanded to FBI custody after a standard containment period and administration of amnestics. She cooperated with authorities in locating the remains of the ███ individuals not accounted for by SCP-2208-A instances and was charged in their deaths.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2208-02:</strong> On ██/██/20██, while performing routine testing on SCP-2208's USB receptacle, Junior Researcher L███ was simultaneously recharging an MP3 player via USB on the test computer, in violation of testing procedures. After testing was complete, Junior Researcher L███ discovered a new file on his device, named "un_w721g.mp3" and remanded his MP3 player to custody for study. A transcript of the audio file follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[File begins with 4 seconds of white noise, followed by a surprised feminine voice.]</em></p>
<p>Ow! What? What's this? Hello? Is that you guys? Listen, I haven't had anything to work with in like two months. Is that why you missed my last couple paychecks? It's been a while. I'm not a charity here! I've got expenses! And all these other people you sent in, they're starting to smell. It's been a while. Look, either you get me some new material, you pay me, or you find yourself a new employee. Once I figure out how to get out of here, anyway. It's been a while.</p>
