<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A symbolic identifier representing 'VOLATILITY', apparently abstracted from SCP-INTEGER's original Risk Class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">SECURITY MEASURES</span>:</strong> <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> must only be semantically identified using 'correct' identifiers, including '<span style="color: blue">NAME</span>', '<span style="color: blue">BEING</span>', '<span style="color: blue">ENTITY</span>' and others. However, '<span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>' is the suggested identifier, due to others being either redundant or only conditionally 'correct'.</p>
<p>Knowledge of <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> and its properties should be restricted to only the necessary personnel for containment, including Dr. Placeholder and one member of the Department of Miscommunications, enforceable via amnesticization. However, extensions for research purposes may be permitted by Dir. Forkley on a case-by-case basis. Note that this <span style="color: green">FILE</span> has been strictly organized such that non-abstract information concerning <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> and/or <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> instances is not directly communicated via identifiers. For the sake of clarity, correct identifiers for <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> and <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> have been made distinct via blue and green coloration (respectively). Updates to this <span style="color: green">FILE</span>, if any, are encouraged to remain consistent with these principles.</p>
<p><span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> instances that do not possess sapience are to be contained at Site-15. Access to such instances for research of semiontological anomalies (a.k.a. semiohazards) may be permitted to personnel possessing Level 4 clearance or higher. With regards to <span style="color: green">SCIENTIST</span> instances, <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> instances possessing sapience need not be contained unless, as a result of their properties or otherwise, they inhibit the containment of <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">EXPLANATION</span>:</strong> <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> is a <span style="color: blue">HAZARD</span><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A semiontological anomaly (semiohazard) is a disruption of the Semiosphere (the medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured) which results in reality's apparent adherence to some non-real axiom.</span> <span style="color: blue">COMPLEX</span> that simplifies 'incorrect' designations and classifications of itself and instances of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span>. In the event that <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> is 'incorrectly' designated or classified through any form of semantic communication, said identifier becomes abstracted<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Abstraction: The generalization of a concept.</span> by one Cuil.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The Cuil is a unit of measurement denoting one level of abstraction away from the reality of a situation.</span> The new, abstracted identifier is retroactively incorporated into the <span style="color: blue">CONSTRUCT</span> as 'correct'. Additionally, its respective medium of communication will become an instance of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong><span style="color: red">LESSON</span></strong></span></p>
<p>The consequences of <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>'s effects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> is, has always been, and will always be identified using names that it has retroactively caused to be factually correct, and the use of any other identifier is considered incorrect. This is also true of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> instances.</li>
<li>Incorrect identification of the <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>, from baseline perspective, has never occurred, due to retroactive creation of objective fact. However, the state of this <span style="color: green">FILE</span> indicates that it has been published with incorrect designations multiple times, and subsequently became an instance of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to its tendency to make useful labels and categorizations redundant, <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> poses significant nomenclative difficulties to Site-15 documentation and personnel. Due to its semantic nature, <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> shares similarities with memetic hazards, and a single incorrect designation could lead to the rapid propagation of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> throughout Site-15 and its documents, crashing file systems and potentially causing several other containment breaches by preventing effective communication.</p>
<p>Other known 'correct' identifiers for <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">THING</span>'</li>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">CONSTRUCT</span>' (when referring to semantics)</li>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">CHALLENGE</span>' (when referring to containment)</li>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">INFLUENCE</span>' (when referring to potential disruption)</li>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">VOLATILITY</span>' (when referring to immediate risk)</li>
<li>'<span style="color: blue">HAZARD</span>', '<span style="color: blue">HAZARD COMPLEX</span>' (when referring to semiontological phenomena)</li>
<li>[<span style="color: green">RESTRICTED</span> <em>PER PROTOCOL <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank">4000-ESHU</a></em>]<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong><span style="color: red">FORBIDDEN</span></strong></span> (when referring to narrative and/or pataphysical elements)</li>

</ul>
<p><span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> is the designation for <span style="color: green">THINGS</span>, including both <span style="color: green">ITEMS</span> and <span style="color: green">BEINGS</span>, that have served as a medium of communication for an incorrect designation or classification of <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>. Upon becoming an instance of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span>, its identifiers are similarly abstracted by <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>. Incorrect identifications of <span style="color: green">SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT</span> instances will be abstracted, but their respective media of communication do not become further instances.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Dr. Placeholder, this <span style="color: green">INQUIRY</span> is being conducted exactly fifteen minutes after you updated the <span style="color: green">SECURITY MEASURES</span> for <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>. We'd like to know exactly what the hell anything in that <span style="color: green">FILE</span> means.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> This <span style="color: green">INQUIRY</span> is going to look just as useless on <span style="color: green">FILE</span>. I already tried to tell <span style="color: green">SCIENTIST</span>, you can't [<span style="color: green">UNPROFESSIONALISM ERASED</span>] talk about it specifically.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> And why is that, might I ask?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> What part of, 'can't talk about it,' don't you understand? You have the <span style="color: green">PAGE</span> in front of you, right?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> I'm the <span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span> asking the questions here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> [<span style="color: green">ERASED</span>], fine. You see that list of terms? We can only talk about <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> using those terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span> examines the <span style="color: green">FILE</span>.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Okay… So, how did you become aware of the <span style="color: blue">HAZARD</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> All I can tell you is that I found — <em>&lt;groans&gt;</em> … I <em>said</em> something that I shouldn't have said. That should never be said. Ever.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Unhelpful, but duly noted. Could you attempt to somehow convey what <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span> does with a little more clarity? Try your best?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> <em>&lt;scoffs&gt;</em> If you use any other word than what's on that list, it'll take some general category that the word is in, and add the word for that category to the list.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> … Go on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> And, it'll do the same to you, and give you your own personal list. So I suggest you stick to the <span style="color: green">SECURITY MEASURES</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> I'm not sure I understand. So what if this <span style="color: blue">THING</span> attaches a list to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> Be [<span style="color: green">ERASED</span>] careful! Haven't you had a briefing on semiohazards? It's not just a list of words- it's a list of <em>facts</em>. There's no way around them, and there's no way of undoing them. You're lucky '<span style="color: blue">THING</span>' is on the list, or we'd be stuck calling you <span style="color: green">RESEARCHER</span> for the rest of time. And from the beginning of time.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Ah… well, this is quite the <span style="color: blue">ISSUE</span>,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong><span style="color: red">MISTAKE</span></strong>.</span> isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> Yeah, no kidding.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> <em>&lt;inhales sharply&gt;</em> Wait, <em>the</em> [<span style="color: green">ERASED</span>] <em>list!</em> I didn't write that —</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Woah, wait — <em>what</em>? It says <span style="color: blue">ISSUE</span> is a correct identifier for <span style="color: blue">SCP-INTEGER</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> <em>&lt;sighs&gt;</em> I really tried, <span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Wait, something doesn't feel right- why am I <span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. PhD.:</strong> Whatever you <em>actually</em> just said wasn't a correct identifier until <em>you</em> misidentified it. I've had to call you <span style="color: green">SCIENTIST-LETTER</span> for years now, and I finally know why.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">INQUISITOR</span>:</strong> Wait, but… that doesn't… that <em>shouldn't</em> be my name- <em>What the</em> [<span style="color: green">ERASED</span>] <em>is going on!?</em></p>
