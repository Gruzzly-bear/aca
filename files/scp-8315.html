            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8315</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Item SCP-8315 is currently contained within storage cell 3-10-005 at Site-41, pending a warehouse transfer.</p>
<p>SCP-8315 should not pose a threat to staff upholding the Standard Foundation Mental Regimen (SFMR). Exceptions apply to those with less than a year of continuous employment at the Foundation, unless interaction is ordered by Site-41's administration.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8315 is a Philips 20PT5441/37 CRT television exhibiting unique predatory behaviour. SCP-8315 demonstrates the ability to leech off electrical potential from the cerebrum of living humans within a 5 meter radius, this sudden change in cerebral voltage is invariably and instantaneously fatal to the victim. Although SCP-8315 should theoretically be capable of feeding off any part of the cerebrum, it displays a marked preference for parts associated with memory, imagination and critical thinking, often solely targeting them.</p>
<p>SCP-8315 was acquired by the Foundation under a containment contract by the H&amp;C Paranatural Office, the first to be awarded to the Foundation. It should be considered a baseline for staff's capability to handle psychophysical anomalies and the wider Foundation's competence as a contractor. Below is a list of notable incidents compiled by the Psychophysics Department to highlight the importance of proper containment:</p>

<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>Initial incident leading to the discovery of SCP-8315 by H&amp;C. A family of five was spontaneously fed on during Christmas festivities. Two additional H&amp;C staff were fed on before the item was identified</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>

<td>4</td>
<td>Poor psychophysical guidelines led to multiple H&amp;C employees being fed on while SCP-8315 was in their custody.</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>First Foundation incident. Inadequate application of the SFMR encouraged by Site-41's administration led to the deaths of two researchers and Site-41's director during testing of its capabilities.</td>
<td>Future administration is expected to comply with the SFMR, for the safety of all staff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A researcher was spontaneously fed on during testing due to inadequately dampened Hippocampus activity.</td>
<td>No fault found with site administration. The SFMR has been reevaluated to account for this incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Two junior researchers were spontaneously fed on during testing. Later investigation revealed that both had been discarding their prescribed SFMR medication within a hole in their dormitory wall.</td>
<td>Rollout of an SFMR powder solution has been moved forward to prevent similar incidents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>One guard hired from a security sub-contractor was spontaneously fed on due to their lack of adherence to the SFMR.</td>
<td>The remaining guard has been let go, citing breach of contract and assault on Foundation staff. Future security contracts should require adherence the SFMR.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A researcher was spontaneously fed on during testing due to a lack of memory retention control.</td>
<td>The SFMR has been reevaluated to account for this incident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A researcher under demotion proceedings for misappropriation of Foundation resources and workplace agitation was not under up-to-date SFMR procedures. This resulted in an incident where site security mistakenly escorted them near SCP-8315. The researcher was subsequently fed on.</td>
<td>Involved security staff has been reprimanded. Demotion proceedings have been cancelled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A researcher was spontaneously fed on during testing. All other staff in the vicinity of SCP-8315 were unaffected and lacked emotional response.</td>
<td>Despite this incident, the immunity and behaviour presented by staff is considered exemplary of the SFMR's increased effectiveness since its inception. Rollout to other sites is underway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>During a contractor showcase, a junior researcher entered the vicinity of SCP-8315, causing it to self-power on<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and feed on the junior researcher, greatly damaging its own internals in the process. Site-41's director proceeded to demonstrate their immunity to SCP-8315 to alleviate the fears of visitors. The affected junior researcher was later found to have falsified their mental screening results with the help of five other staff members. All have had their employment terminated.</td>
<td>No fault found with the SFMR.</td>

<p>Although severely damaged, SCP-8315 still functions but is not expected to recover as full immunity to its effects is now being adopted Foundation-wide.</p>
