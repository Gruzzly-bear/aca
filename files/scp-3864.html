            <h1>SCP-3864</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3864</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3864 is to be hung on a wall in a standard containment chamber. Outside of scheduled tests, SCP-3864 is to be covered with a thick black cloth at all times. Should SCP-3864 grow too large to be completely covered by this cloth, D-Class personnel are to be dispatched immediately with an appropriately sized replacement.</p>
<p>SCP-3864's containment chamber is to be kept well-lit and monitored via an infrared camera to ensure that it remains completely covered at all times. A decibel meter is to be placed no less than 15 cm from SCP-3864’s surface. Any changes should be reported to the researcher in charge, which is currently Dr. Taylor Itkin at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Entry into SCP-3864's containment chamber requires Level-3 clearance. All personnel are required to wear infrared goggles while in SCP-3864’s containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3864 is an <a href="/the-picture-of-an-unian">oil painting of an individual</a>. The subject, coloration, and size are all subject to change. The only constants in the appearance of SCP-3864 are that the individual in the portrait is always a human, and testing shows the paint to always be oil based. At no point has more than one subject been witnessed inside of SCP-3864.</p>
<p>SCP-3864 gives off a heat signature of 37° Celsius, similar to that of the average human body temperature. This heat signature is not centered on a certain portion of the painting (such as the individual inside), but rather is given off by the painting in its entirety. SCP-3864 is safe to view through infrared goggles or filters.</p>
<p>When a subject (henceforth referred to as SCP-3864-1) views SCP-3864 directly, within 15 minutes SCP-3864-1 will begin to gradually lose all pigmentation and most body heat. At this time, the likeness of SCP-3864-1 will begin to appear in SCP-3864. SCP-3864-1 will not be bothered by these processes. Within 30 minutes, SCP-3864-1 will become completely void of all pigmentation and have an average body temperature of 10° Celsius, as well as SCP-3864 showing a full likeness of SCP-3864-1. SCP-3864-1 will then die of severe dehydration and hypothermia. There is no recorded method of halting or slowing these processes.</p>
<p>Although the body of SCP-3864-1 will become inanimate and resemble a corpse, the consciousness of SCP-3864-1 is thought to be transferred into SCP-3864. This is evidenced by the likeness of SCP-3864-1 inside of SCP-3864 to be able to change poses and “move” – though no record shows the likeness of SCP-3864-1 to be moving while being observed – in ways that sometimes appear to be attempts at communication or escape from SCP-3864.</p>
<p>Likenesses of SCP-3864-1 inside of SCP-3864 also appear to be capable of verbal communication. It is unclear whether this is SCP-3864-1 communicating or simply an imitation by SCP-3864.<br/>
Attempts at communication are currently underway.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-3864 was recovered on 5/18 by <a href="/task-forces#eta-10">MTF Eta-10</a> from [REDACTED], Virginia. The Foundation became aware of SCP-3864’s existence when Foundation staff planted in local police units were notified of multiple missing persons reports supposedly linked to viewing a painting. Upon securing SCP-3864, members of MTF Eta-10 were able to confirm with neighboring residents that SCP-3864-1 was in fact the man who owned the house SCP-3864 was recovered from. All those who confirmed this later appeared in SCP-3864, having viewed it directly. A Class-C amnestic was administered to all neighboring residents to cover the disappearances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> D-3976</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> SCP-3864-1 (formerly D-3977)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Taylor Itkin</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Subject B has only recently appeared in SCP-3864. Subject A and Subject B are former cellmates. Subject A has been instructed to attempt contact with Subject B. A high-gain microphone has been placed in front of SCP-3864. Interviewer is speaking to Subject A through an earpiece.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Please approach SCP-3864.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> [INCOMPREHENSIBLE]</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> What? (To Interviewer) I can’t understand what he’s saying.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Then get closer. To <em>it</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry, are you there?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> [INCOMPREHENSIBLE]</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> I can’t understand him! The damn veil is muffling his voice.</p>

<p><strong>Muffled conversation between researchers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> You may remove the cloth from SCP-3864. Make sure your goggles are on.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy thud as the veil hits the floor</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Jesus, finally! I can’t breathe behind that thing.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Who else would it be, dipshit?</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Christ, I didn’t think I’d hear from you again!</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Is it the fact that I’m made of paint? It’s the fact that I’m made of paint, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ask it if it knows what happened.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Does, uh, does that mean you know what happened?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> If you mean becoming part of a painting, yeah, I know what happened.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why isn’t this fact alarming to it? Ask it that.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> You seem rather calm about it, you know.</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Lenny, in all honesty, if I had to choose between possible Keter testing and being stuck inside a damn painting? I’m fine where I am. It’s not that bad in here. I do kind of miss burgers, though.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Burgers?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I would <em>kill</em> for a bacon cheeseburger right now.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ask it if it needs to eat to survive.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Um, why? Are you hungry?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Not really. I just love fucking cheeseburgers, man. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Yeah, especially after you almost got killed after you mouthed off to that guard who wanted yours.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> <em>No</em>one messes with my fucking burger, Len. <em>No</em>one.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> I wouldn’t get between you and your burger if someone were pointing a gun to my head and telling me to.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> See, you know how to keep yourself safe then.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A and Subject B share a laugh</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Oh, man, do you remember that time Dug tried to bribe a guard to get out of Keter duty?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Yeah! Oh, man, he was so close, too. Too bad the guy’s supervisor came along.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Yeah, has that guy been back?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Who, the guard? No, my guess is that he got fired or terminated or some shit.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Bah, I feel no pity for him. Bastards are always shoving their guns in our faces, why should I give a fuck about him?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> My sentiments exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> …If only Kelly hadn’t actually gotten away with bribing <em>his</em> way out…</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Hey, something great came out of that, didn’t it? We-</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Alright, ask it if it’s comfortable where it is.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> …Listen, Terry… you’re not, like, you’re not in pain or anything, right? You’re okay?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I mean, I’m comfortable enough. I’m just… lonely, I guess. No one’s here with me and most of the time that fucking cloth is covering my face.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> I’m sorry, man… I miss you, for what it’s worth.</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I miss you too!</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> I’m sorry you’re stuck in there, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> It’s not your fault, Len. My goggles malfunctioned. No one could have called it.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Still…</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Well, maybe…</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Maybe what?</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Maybe… you could come in with me?</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Get out of the containment chamber. Now.</p>

<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry… I- I miss you, man, but I can’t.</p>

<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Why not? I’m so alone, Len…</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Get him out of there. End the recording.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-3864 was covered with the cloth and Subject A allowed to return to his cell to rest. Further testing authorized by [REDACTED].</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview B – 5/24/17</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> D-3976</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> SCP-3864-1 (formerly D-3977)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Taylor Itkin</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Subject A has been instructed to reestablish contact with Subject B. Interviewer is speaking to Subject A through an ear piece. SCP-3864 has already been uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Lenny! You’re back!</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> You can see me?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I may be in a painting, but whoever painted me was kind enough to give me eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Is SCP-3864-1 insinuating that another entity actually paints SCP-3864?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Someone painted you?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> You said whoever painted you gave you eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> It was a joke, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ask it if time is passing. We want to know how time passes in the painting’s world.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Uh, so, Terry, what have you been doing the last couple of days? Eating cheeseburgers?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Oh, yeah, because I have access to- wait, the last couple of <em>days?</em> How fucking long have I been in here?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> About a week, man.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> A <em>week?</em> Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> How could you not know?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I don’t know! I mean… the sun never goes down. At least not that I can <em>see</em>. I mean, there’s only 2 windows.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Can’t you go outside?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> There’s no door. It’s like- I can see outside, I can see that there’s this whole world, but… this room is all I’m able to be in.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Has it not attempted escaping the room?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Have you tried breaking the window or something? Getting out?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Either I’m really weak or everything is sort of, like, bolted down or something. I can’t lift <em>any</em> of the furniture. And I tried ramming the walls and stuff with my body but… nothing. That’s not even the weirdest part, Len.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Get it to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> What is, then?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I know they’ve said I’m in a painting, but everything here looks real. Until I look out the window. Outside is…</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Outside is what?</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Well, it’s paint. It looks like it’s painted on a backdrop.</p>
<p><strong>Several moments of silence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Do you remember that night?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Which night? There are a lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> The one a couple months ago. You were filling in for Kelly when he got out of Keter duty.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Oh… that night.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> After that day of testing, I was just happy to be <em>alive</em>-</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry…</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> And- and after you almost got hurt, I just-</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> <em>Terry</em>-</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I <em>felt</em> things, Len. I’ve never felt like that before.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> …I did too.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Lenny, I-</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Don’t say it, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I want to say it, Len. I-</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> <em>Don’t</em> say it, Terry. You know I do, too, but…</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> But what?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> You’re in a damn painting, Terry. You’re a piece of art and I’m… here.</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> I may be in a painting, but I still have feelings. I love you, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Terry…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> At this point, Subject A was showing clear signs of distress. Interview was ended by Dr. Taylor Itkin. Subject A was allowed to return to his cell and rest. Further testing authorized by [REDACTED].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A third interview between D-3976 and SCP-3864-1 (formerly known as D-3977) was attempted. Upon entering the containment chamber, SCP-3864-1 was able to convince D-3976 to “join” it inside of SCP-3864. D-3976 removed his infrared goggles, declaring his love for SCP-3864-1. Further contact between SCP-3864-1 and any person(s) to have been close to them is prohibited by order of [REDACTED].</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A group of 5 D-Class personnel<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> were given direct visual exposure of SCP-3864 at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-world-within">D-3975 was the only subject to appear as SCP-3864-1.</a> Communication with SCP-3864-1 was continuous for approximately 6 minutes before it was able to convince Dr. [REDACTED] to remove his goggles. Dr. [REDACTED] remains the current SCP-3864-1 instance at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SCP-3864 is able to loosely control or influence SCP-3864-1 to “lure” prey. Further testing pending O5 approval.</p>
