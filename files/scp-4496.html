            <h1>SCP-4496</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4496</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4496 is to be held in a secure anomalous item locker at <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-64">Site-64</a>. SCP-4496 should be stored in its "robot" configuration to avoid accidentally triggering its anomalous properties. Foundation web crawlers are to monitor internet traffic for activity under the username "MxMaster".</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4496 is a <em>Beast Wars: Super Lifeform Transformers</em> action figure representing the character ランディー ("Randy"), produced exclusively for Japanese markets. The toy, as with its non-anomalous counterparts, is built around a primary gimmick of converting from a representation of an organic wild boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) to a bipedal "robot" with the use of a spring-loaded trigger. SCP-4496 is anomalously durable compared to other "Randy" action figures, lacking the excess fragility that typically characterizes the toys.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-4496's active anomalous effects manifest when its spring-loaded transformation is triggered. On conversion to its robot form, intermolecular forces within approximately 4.550 meters of SCP-4496 will be instantaneously and significantly weakened, rendering solid matter significantly more brittle and liable to crumble or tear under pressure. This effect is a permanent, one-time alteration of the surrounding molecules rather than an ongoing effect; other matter surrounding SCP-4496 after its conversion into "robot" will not be affected, and transforming it back to "boar" form will have no impact on matter it has previously affected.</p>
<p>Gases and liquids are also affected; while liquids will be subject to a reduction in surface tension, there is little practical effect on gases due to their already-weak intermolecular force. However, testing has shown SCP objects of anomalous durability or fragility to be unaffected by the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-4496 was initially discovered by Agent Para of MTF Rho-40 ("Toys 'R' Us Kids") during routine surveillance of the dealer room at the 2004 Official Transformers Collectors' Convention in Rosemont, Illinois, after its activation during purchase from a dealer table caused the collapse of two tables and severe injury to the buyer.</p>
<p>Subsequent interrogation of the seller, Mr. █████ ████████, revealed that he was aware of SCP-4496's anomalous properties, having broken his right arm and leg as well as several other rare items in his Transformers toy collection after triggering it; he had been attempting to sell the toy purely out of desire to not be around it any more. The Foundation took SCP-4496 into custody, and administered amnestics and medical treatment to both Mr. ████████ and the purchaser, Mr. ██████ ██████, under the pretext of both men having undiagnosed osteoporosis. Convention organisers 3H Productions disseminated a Foundation cover story about a damaged table that collapsed and injured Mr. ██████.</p>

On my way to completing my BWN collection - just picked up the Randy and Crazybolt 2pack - but i'm worried about "Gold Plastic Syndrome". How to best make sure Randy doesn't shatter whenever i pick him up? Don't want to have to hunt down a new one.</p>

What the hell did you do? He's not crumbling sure but when I transformed him its like everything around me shattered instead. My toy shelves collapsed and i've broken my leg AND my arm. Did you use some fucked up chemicals or something??</p>
