<p>SCP-6747 necessitates the creation and indefinite maintenance of SCP-6747-A. Each member of SCP-6747-A possesses different (but substantial) computational and resource requirements unable to be properly accounted for/predicted by typical <em>n</em>-dimensional geometric formal logic systems. The Archetypicals Division's <span class="bt">STF-𐤌</span> ("Story-Tellers") is to remain situated about SCP-6747-A for their natural durations, editing them via fictional injection as required by SCP-6747. No member of SCP-6747-A should be allowed to end premature to its natural cadential movement, for potential risk of <a href="scp-2747.html" target="_blank">antinarrative</a> formation within SCP-6747-B.</p>

<p><span class="st">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-6747 is a theoretical process by which to reinstate deceased personnel: mesofictional injection. This process necessitates the indefinite maintenance of Causality Bubble-6747 (CB-6747), a pocket universe which would be manipulated through the shared imagination of fictional scenarios taking place within it. Fictionalized entities could then theoretically be retrieved and reinstated in baseline reality via ███X-MCD/II, a Foundation-made vessel for transport to alternate narratives.</p>
<p>SCP-6747-A collectively designates isolated micro-universes that have been created as candidates for CB-6747. To date, 3 such candidates exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-6747-A1: a nullspace void maintained at zero Daumals<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">One Daumal is equal to the average topological complexity of narrative-space-time in 1-1-1-space (ie. a space possessing exactly 1 narrative dimension, 1 spatial dimension, 1 temporal dimension).</span>, thereby possessing no physical, causal, or narrative potential<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Recent findings indicate that infokinetic interactions continue to occur at the quantum level, even in the vacancy of one or more dimensional categories.

<ul>
<li>SCP-6747-A2: a 1.5/2/1-space<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">1.5 narrative, 2 spatial, 1 temporal dimension.</span> methodological testing universe dedicated to the study of narrative, ontokinetic processes, meta/mesofictional interactions.

These entities were thereby obligated to cooperate with the Foundation in harnessing their universe's physics for the transfer of narrative energy to relevant personnel, achieving knowledge/aptitude in various subjects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-6747-A3: an <em>m</em>/3/1-space, where <em>m</em> is a rational number equivalent to log<em><sub>i!</sub>(<a href="scp-033.html" target="_blank">Θ'</a>)</em>. This is the theoretical lowest proportion of narrative dimensionality to typical 3/1-space in which any meaningful story-structures can be sustained; effectively, it is the minimum fictional complexity required for an arbitrary entity to achieve an arbitrary goal. Simple interactions within SCP-6747-A3 can be formally stated and computed using narrativic arithmetic (see <span class="bt">ADDENDUM 6747/IV</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-6747-B refers interchangeably to:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">Fictionality &amp; Physics</span></p>
<p>What does it mean for a universe to be partially or wholly fictional, from a physical perspective? The typical conception of "fiction" as non-real or pre-written is particularly misaligned from modern understanding; in the pataphysical sense, <em>fictionality</em> denotes the extent to which one reality can affect and/or be affected by universes to which it is <em>pataphysically-linked</em>, ie. it is imagined by a sapient entity as a non-real scenario.</p>
<p>In a similar sense, <em>fictionality</em> denotes the proportion to which any given event can be caused (ie. <em>inspired</em>) by the imagination of a sapient entity in another, similar universe. The antiquated terms for such entities are "authors" for higher beings, and "metafictional entities" for lower ones; the present pataphysical model views all entities as <em>characters</em>, each possessing its own <em>narrative potential energy</em> relating to its mass, velocity, narrative trajectory, latent Akiva radiation, and Daumal environment.</p>
<p>Every known functional reality-space (to date) possesses at least one narrative dimension. The simplest case is the narratively one-dimensional universe, which is wholly fictional, and only exists in the minds of its imaginers. <em>Characters</em> in this universe are one-dimensional, often called "flat" characters as they lack the narrative depth (on physical, metaphysical, and pataphysical levels) to make independent decisions from their author. Anything that happens in a narratively 1-dimensional universe is 100% tied to an event that a pataphysically-linked entity imagines simultaneously on another plane of existence.</p>
<p>The second-simplest case is our own reality, which is narratively two-dimensional; this universe-space is unique in its narrative balance, as it possesses 1 fictional dimension and 1 real dimension ie. it is 50% fictional and 50% real.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Semifictionality of known reality initially theorized by <strong>Sr. Rsr. Emeritus S. A. Swann</strong> and later proven by <strong>Sr. Archivist Emeritus I. H. Pickman et. al</strong>.</span> On average, across our entire universe, 50% of all events are caused/influenced by pataphysical transmission (imagining), while the other 50% are governed by our universe's laws of physics (determinism).<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Personnel are reminded that free will does not exist.</span></p>

<p>The "author-entities" (ie. hyperdimensional characters pataphysically-linked to our universe) exist in 3 or greater narrative dimensions, each increasing the extent to which its respective reality is "real". That is to say, a universe possessing 3 narrative dimensions (1 fictional, 2 real) is 33% fictional and 66% real; as such, narrative phenomena are significantly less prevalent. As narrative dimensions increase, this is hypothesized to cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>a greater proportion of inspiration to be derived from lower universes (ie. an author being inspired by a character's choices), and;</li>
<li>the reduced prevalence of narrative/imagined structures, including (but not limited to) physical, metaphysical, and Anomalous phenomena, resulting in;</li>
<li>hyperdimensional entities' desire to imagine non-real scenarios in which said phenomena are possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>These consequences of the universal tendency to become more "real" with additional narrative dimensions are thought to be responsible for most Anomalous phenomena in the Local Reality Group.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">Archetypicality &amp; Modern Ontokinetics</span></p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, what exactly does it mean for an event to be partially-fictional? To best understand this concept, we first must understand how, exactly, <em>inspiration</em> is transferred from one pataphysically-linked universe to another.</p>
<p>When a ≥ 2-dimensional character imagines a non-real scenario, its pataphysical intent becomes encrypted as narrative data. This narrative-intent-particle, dubbed the "imaginon", exists simultaneously in all narratively-lower dimensions, projecting into that universe's total imaginon-structure. Imaginons of different types<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">To date, 8 types of imaginon particles have been formally discovered, corresponding to the 8-step abstraction of <em><strong>α</strong></em>.</span> react to create narrative structures, which combine into larger narrative structures and so on.</p>
<p>A given universe's composite imaginon-structure is called its <em>Universal Narrative</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">(antiquated: <em>Alpha-Narrative</em>)</span> (<em><strong>α</strong></em>). In a sense, the <em><strong>α</strong></em> <em>is</em> its universe's one fictional dimension; it is tied to the structures of its universe at a physical level. This can be best understood by observing an approximation of our own <em><strong>α</strong></em>:</p>

<p>A common abstraction of <em>α</em>, utilised as a metafictional tool.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>At the simplest (read: quantum, atomic, molecular) levels, <strong><em>α</em></strong> manifests as a two-step abstraction, its pataphor of unknown becoming known realized as particles breaking apart and reforming again. On larger scales, the extent to which a given structure's behaviors imitate <strong><em>α</em></strong> depends on its <em>resting narrative potential</em>, corresponding to its likelihood to <em>inspire</em> hyperdimensional entities to imagine its existence. Generally, lower-entropy structures are more likely to function as central entities in story-structures, making them more <em>protagonistic</em>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>protagonist:</strong> an entity possessing above-average resting narrative potential ie. possessing local pataphysical topology greater than 2 (in local narra-space-time).</span> <span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Antagonists are a form of protagonist framed in opposition to another protagonist, and their perceived antagonism is inherently subjective.</span></p>
<p>Most humans (&gt;96%) fall within 0.01 dimensions of narrative baseline, and therefore are <em>generics</em>: the standard lot of characters not included in larger story-structures due to inherent disinterest. Approximately 1.88% of humans score below 2 on the PH Narrative Complexity Scale, ie. they possess below-average narrative potential. This indicates that they are more likely to be influenced/acted upon by the narrative structures around them, causing them to conform into <em>archetypal</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>archetypical:</strong> a character whose below-average narrative energy results in the tendency to conform to archetypes as required by local narrative structures.</span> roles. The standard Narrative-Space-Time model incorporates 12 archetypes, as based in Jungian pataphysics.</p>
<p>Briefly put: protagonists possess slightly more independence from narrative structures than average, as they are able to bend story-structures toward their goals, while archetypicals are slightly more suggestible to serving as vessels for <strong><em>α</em></strong>. Protagonism is viewed internally as a form of light reality-bending, agreeing with the modern ontokinetic conception that any and all reality-bending effects can be traced to a distortion of one or greater narrative/spatial/temporal dimensions.</p>
<p>This relationship is reciprocal; eg. a black hole significantly distorts narrative-space-time in its vicinity (a form of non-Anomalous reality-bending), granting itself both physical and <em>narrative gravity</em>. This entails that the black hole will draw other high-density characters (protagonists) towards itself, increasing the likelihood that they will engage in story-structures with it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Depicted in-frame are Directors Micheals, PHMD, Vemhoff, and Asheworth. Dir. Vemhoff clears his throat and chatter among the Council ceases.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> So, if I'm understanding everything correctly, you want to bend the universe itself to resurrect the dead, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> We're not <em>bending</em> anything. Our understanding of our physics has developed significantly enough —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> For Christ's sake. Don't lawyer me — answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> Come on, it's just not that simple —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> <em>&lt;raises his hand.&gt;</em> Yes, that's exactly what we want to do. We're bending the laws of physics to our whim, which humans have been doing for thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> &lt;scoffs.&gt; You're all insane.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Micheals:</strong> I-I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> You heard me: this is ludicrous. You're toying with forces you don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> Director, I personally guarantee that the Pataphysics Department —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> Pataphysics! Gah. We are but children glimpsing at the clockwork of our ticking reality. We know nothing; you know nothing; this is madness.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Micheals:</strong> Honorable D-Director, please. The… The theses and components of the project are f-founded upon decades of research — we… we know what we're doing.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> Micheals, I was <em>there</em> when the Department was founded. The motto was once, "killing our gods," freeing us from control. Now, we seek to become our own gods. You don't know <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Silence on recording. Dir. Vemhoff glances around the meeting room, observing each of the personnel present&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> Let's assume, for a second, everything works out fine, and you desecrate King's corpse, and then he comes back out of the machine fine and well. What then? Do you even comprehend how much it costs to maintain a local reality-space? The amount of precision, safeguards required? The personnel required to maintain it every single moment of each day, lest all progress be lost?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> It doesn't have to end, there. We could… we could bring back <em>anyone</em>, Vemhoff. Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> I <em>understand</em> what this thing can do —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> We could bring back Hannah. Or Raia,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Dr. Hannah Rivera and Dr. Raia Micheals, two deceased personnel responsible for <a href="scp-5292.html">Site-120's Founding in 1916</a>.</span> even.</p>

<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Revive relevant administrative personnel to a state preceding their natural death by injection into a mesofictional causality bubble and subsequent retrieval via ███X-MCD/II ("Paradox Exodus Engine").</p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> A member of <span class="table4"><span class="st">A-CLASS</span></span> personnel serving in significant administrative capacity perished accidentally, and requires revival to resume duty. Various other methods of resurrection<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Such as the utilization of <a href="scp-963.html" target="_blank">consciousness-trapping items</a>, <a href="scp-2718.html" target="_blank">quantum approximation</a>, <a href="scp-5572.html" target="_blank">natural phenomena</a>, or <a href="scp-6936.html" target="_blank">thaumaturgic rituals</a>.</span> have proven unsuccessful due to inherent imprecision in replication of consciousness-state, traits, and exact resting narrative potential/topology; as such, SCP-6747 is to be pursued as a method of reproducing heavily protagonistic characters.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong> SCP-6747's success is not dependent on the existence/maintenance of a resurrected entity's physical body. Coincidentally, late Senior Administrator Dir. J. A. King's brain possesses several Anomalous augmentations, granting it creative and interpretational capabilities far beyond human or computational capacity. As such, said brain (and associated nervous system) is to be excised and incorporated as the central computing system of SCP-6747-B, a pocket-universe creation/manipulation/maintenance engine.</p>
<p>SCP-6747-B (KING) will be used to study universes of varying dimensionalities, specifically those which are mathematically curious or possess behaviors yet undefined. Studied data will then be employed to generate a Causality Bubble (CB-6747) capable of fully replicating personnel in narrative and intellectual capacities, using as few resources as necessary. <em>m</em> is reserved as the theoretical lowest value of narrative topological complexity able to sustain functional narrative structures in <em>m</em>/3/1-space. In <em>m</em> narrative dimensions, CB-6747's <em><strong>α</strong></em> possesses a mesolinear structure that can be directly edited via injection of imaginon particle types:</p>
<div class="papernote">
<p>General 8-step cyclical <em><strong>α</strong></em> abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>a character rests in a known state;</li>
<li>is motivated to change its state;</li>
<li>enters an unknown state;</li>
<li>searches to enact said change;</li>
<li>locates a vessel to allow said enaction;</li>
<li>retrieves said vessel at significant cost;</li>
<li>returns to the known world;</li>
<li>having enacted its desired changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>corresponding to 8 categories of imaginon particle:</p>
<ul>
<li>(0) nullion: neutral narrative particle, zero spin;</li>
<li>(1) motivon: chain structure initializer, unidirectional spin;</li>
<li>(2) exploron: binds with motivons to yield resolvons, bidirectional spin;</li>
<li>(3) resolvon: bidirectionally motivates structural resolution, producing;</li>
<li>(4) macguffion: omnidirectionally-linked, high-density particles composed of complex motivon-resolvon chains;</li>
<li>(5) sacrion: bidirectionally-linked particle necessary for formation of;</li>
<li>(6) retournon: unidirectionally-linked, reintegrates imaginon structures with macro-narrative;</li>
<li>(7) cadential boson: theoretical particle responsible for the cadential field, through which narrative energy is released following the successful execution of <em><strong>α</strong></em>-aligned story structures.</li>

<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> On 2029/11/07, following the successful initialization of all <span class="bt">PROJECT X/MACHINA</span> sub-components, SCP-6747-B was used to generate and stabilize causality bubble SCP-6747-A3. To ascertain if the universe is sufficiently narratively-anchored and can be utilized for SCP-6747, the following tests were attempted.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">ATTEMPT A/13</span></p>
<p><strong>INTENT:</strong> Generate a simple narrative describing a single red apple (<em>Malus domestica</em>) and attempt extraction to baseline.</p>
<p><strong>REACTION:</strong> Pre-constructed narrative accepted into SCP-6747-A3's universal structure. Despite minor power and stability fluctuations observed shortly thereafter, the bubble gradually approached stability following the test's conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>OUTCOME:</strong> Retrieved item exhibits inexplicable narrative phenomena, simultaneously displaying characteristics of protagonistic and archetypical entities; various Site operations were impeded by said item's sudden relevance in a plurality of local story-structures. Research is ongoing.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">ATTEMPT B/27</span></p>
<p><strong>INTENT:</strong> Generate a minimal narrative describing a deceased canine<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The subject chosen for the experiment was <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-sparky" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank">Dir. Asheworth's deceased dog</a>, chosen for enhanced narrative potential and availability of relevant information.</span> (<em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>) prior to its death and attempt extraction of significant narrative density to baseline.</p>
<p><strong>REACTION:</strong> Pre-constructed narrative accepted. Over a seventy-two-hour period, SCP-6747 undergoes slight fluctuation in narrative topology, eventually stabilizing to manifest the expected outcome.</p>
<p><strong>OUTCOME:</strong> Following its extraction to baseline, the retrieved entity exhibited behaviors imitating that of clichéd protagonistic canine, disregarding all known pre-resurrection traits. Dr. Ngo's amnesticization request has been denied, despite heightened frequency of SCP-6747-B soothing duties.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">ATTEMPT C/30</span></p>
<p><strong>INTENT:</strong> Generate a static narrative describing a human male, working as an experienced technical engineer for <span class="bt">PROJECT X/MACHINA</span>, and extract to baseline.</p>
<p><strong>REACTION:</strong> Pre-constructed narrative accepted into SCP-6747-A3's structure. SCP-6747-B experiences a number of large power fluctuations and high temperatures over an eighty-hour period, as the reality bubble slowly approaches stability. Narrative structure eventually fully processed without exceptional complications.</p>
<p><strong>OUTCOME:</strong> Resultant entity, self-identifying as "Technician John H. Doe" exhibits a cooperative and cordial personality, and regularly performs repairs on secondary SCP-6747 equipment. Due to above-average intelligence, capacity for advanced problem-solving, and overall expertise, Tech. Doe has been granted official employment within the Foundation, and is presently assigned to <span class="bt">PROJECT X/MACHINA</span>.</p>

<p>SCP-6747-C is a pervasive hazardous antinarrative complex derived from, and manifesting as, a mesofictional caricature of late Senior Administrator J. A. King. For reasons yet to be fully understood, SCP-6747-C causes the disruption of large-scale imaginon-structures in universes to which it is pataphysically-linked, corrupting its own <em><strong>α</strong></em> while annihilating that of any higher dimension. SCP-6747-C appears primarily proximal to particular antinarremes including, but not limited to:</p>

</ul>
<p>SCP-6747-C resides within, and possesses ultimate control over, SCP-6747-A3, and has recursively manipulated its narrative structure to achieve antinarremic and ontokinetic abilities. All attempts to communicate with SCP-6747-C are complicated/obscured by poor imaginon-decryption, leading to its mischaracterization of the baseline Foundation as an antagonistic, deific force; manipulations are further hindered by frequent malfunction on behalf of SCP-6747-B, which has begun to demonstrate a tendency to inject SCP-6747-A with undesirable narremes.</p>
<p>SCP-6747-C regularly populates SCP-6747-A3 with SCP-6747-D: lesser mesofictional caricatures of other essential technical, research, and administrative personnel. SCP-6747-C and -D display varying degrees of cognitive and logical deterioration, often using their ontokinetic abilities to generate Anomalous weaponry far beyond baseline capability. SCP-6747-A3 now functions according to narrative logic that is fundamentally broken and chaotic; its inhabitants are granted varying abilities at non-intuitive intervals. The results of these abilities are directly prejudicial to baseline reality and its topological stability.</p>
<p>Any latent operational capacities within your SCiPnet Access Terminal are henceforth dedicated to computing counter-narremes to SCP-6747-C's degradational effect. <strong>Relevant storylines must be abandoned within <span class="cond"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> <span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="color: #22bb44">seven</span></span></span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> minutes.</strong></p>

<p>Following the narrative corruption of SCP-6747-A3, <span class="bt">PROJECT X/MACHINA</span> was immediately halted; all relevant resources and personnel were redirected to the prevention of the corrupted reality's influence on baseline. As a result, <span class="bt">PROJECT X/DIABOLOS</span> was officially approved, tasked with researching, analyzing, and eventually neutralizing the threat posed by the newly-antagonistic SCP-6747-A.</p>
<p>Despite several months of research and analysis, attempts to decrypt SCP-6747-A3's narrative corruption have proven nigh-universally unsuccessful; it is hypothesized the universe's imaginon-structures occupy a topology that remains foreign to the human Patasphere. The following transcript is the only encryptable portion thus far, due to its inclusion of relatively simpler narremes:</p>

<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> SCP-6747-A3 was observed to gradually gain narrative complexity over the following log's duration, nearing levels comparable to baseline; containment personnel were subsequently alerted to this deviance and attempted to focus measurement equipment on its source, resulting in SCP-6747-A3's rapid descent to its prior narrative topology. Research is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>CLF:</strong> <em>&lt;groaning&gt;</em> I <em>know</em> all that, King. My point was not that you're an idiot and a liar — which you probably are, let's be real — but that we're fucked. Because we <em>are</em> fucked!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;The recording starts, focusing on Asheworth, PHMD, and Vemhoff; all other personnel are engaging in smaller-scale and less relevant discussions.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> Don't make me say "I told you so" for a second time, for fuck's sake.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> <em>&lt;sighs exasperatedly.&gt;</em> Can we be constructive for a second, please? Focus on the fact that this pocket universe is a serious threat and we need to stabilize it, immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> Hold on a second — I'm still not sure I entirely understand what the stakes, are, here? What's "narrative integrity" and why are we worried about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> There's really no point in me sending out briefings beforehand, is there? <em>&lt;rolls his eyes, turning to Asheworth&gt;</em> 6747-A3 is engineered to have the lowest theoretically-possible capacity for narrative complexity. Inserting a high-density character like King into that universe caused some sort of collapse of its story-structures — it's recursively folding in on itself, becoming more and more narratively unsatisfying.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> Narrative complexity this, story-structure that — you speak as though you're not toying with the very nature of causality.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> <em>&lt;pointedly ignores Vemhoff&gt;</em> How… is a <em>pocket universe</em> threatening us, though?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> I… have to be careful describing this. There are certain sets of narrative elements, or <em>narremes</em>, that are particularly unsatisfying and antagonistic and, when brought together, form a <em>narrativohazardous</em> structure — some sort of story or story fragment that's actually hazardous to its characters, or others. <em>Pataphysics</em> discovered a particular narrativohazard a while ago — one that erases any story that it appears in. When we discovered what its specific narremes were, we accidentally almost formed it <em>here</em>, and had to amnesticize almost the entire Department.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> Whoof. What does this have to do with —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> I'm getting there. We can't confirm this, as it's too risky to try and search for directly, but evidence heavily suggests that some version of this same hazard has manifested in the pocket universe; however, instead of destroying it, it's… <em>reinforcing</em> the universe's structures, somehow. It's merged with the King-character, whose objective appears to be escape by inserting its corruptive version of the hazard into our universe. And, since 6747-A3 is more fictional than us, they have access to far greater Anomalous technologies with which to target us.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> What in the <em>hell</em> is the matter with you?! This procedure <em>can't</em> be worth the risk; you must shut this abomination off.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> No can-do. The pocket universes aren't <em>in</em> the machine, it just manipulates them, and it's been unresponsive since the corruption. And, even if we could terminate 6747-A3 prematurely, we have very little idea what risks are posed by terminating a narrative before its proper conclusion. It's possible that vacuum would lead to the formation of even more dangerous structures.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> I… imagine that magic won't work here?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> Afraid not; not even rituals as powerful as the <a href="scp-6936.html">Kodex</a> would do it. Thaumaturgy operates locally within a specified reality bubble.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Asheworth exhales, scratching his head. He scrolls through some of the papers present near the two personnel.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> Ontokinetics, then, I suppose? A sufficiently powerful reality bender could theoretically forever stall the progress of the —</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;PHMD sighs sadly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> Yes and no; the main problem here is that we know exactly of one general ontokinesis-bearer that can manipulate other reality-spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Asheworth raises his eyebrow.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> That, being…?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> <a href="scp-3812.html">SCP-3812</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> …Shit.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Asheworth:</strong> <em>&lt;sighs, tapping on the desk for a few moments&gt;</em> How about total reality alteration then? I'm sure -17 has things that could alter layers of baseline to protect us for as long as they work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Vemhoff leans toward the two, visibly angry.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> You… <em>&lt;sigh&gt;</em> It seems you've not learned a single thing, have you? If you can't be made to understand that manipulating the very structures of reality <em>is not a joke</em>, then we're doomed.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> What was that?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Vemhoff scoffs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> You are all insane, yet again —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> No, the other part.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Vemhoff raises his eyebrow.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Vemhoff:</strong> <em>It's not a joke</em> to make such drastic changes to our goddamn reality!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. PHMD:</strong> You're right, it's not…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;PHMD begins to interact with his worktablet, accessing relevant documents and beginning to sketch a diagram.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>INTENT:</strong> Maintain SCP-6747-A3's narrative dimensionality at a level which renders SCP-6747-C and its vectors ineffective. This requires the indefinite creation of fictionalized documents regarding SCP-6747-A3 possessing enormous volumes of narrative energy, an ongoing database of which is stored within an undisclosed Site-87 database.</p>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> By instating high-energy narrative structures within SCP-6747-A3, interest from hypernarrative entities will cause it to gain more narrative dimensionality and consequently become more "real". This will proceed until its deviance from normality is insufficient to allow for SCP-6747-C's internarrative capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Containment apparently successful; zero instances of <strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt></strong> detected since procedure, as it can no longer be transmitted via SCP-6747-C. Furthermore, it has been found that comedic and exaggerated narrative structures and caricatures have the greatest effectiveness in raising SCP-6747-A3's narrative dimensionality; the universe has since been redesignated TL-6747-A ("The 'LOL' Foundation").</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">UPDATE 2030/06/06</span></p>
<p>Regular monitoring of hypernarrative activity regarding <span class="bt">SCP-001-SWANN</span> reader-entities has revealed catastrophic damage to the structural integrity of a higher narrative universe partially responsible for imagining various timelines adjacent to baseline reality. Data readings consistent with <span class="bt"><tt>[<a href="scp-2747.html" target="_blank">DATA LOST</a>]</tt></span> were found, among this universe's narrative structures and subsequently expunged from all relevant documentation; the extent of SCP-6747-C's involvement, if any, is unknown. While this would typically be cause for concern, it appears that SCP-6747-A3 does not endanger internarrative relationships which are essential to the existence of the baseline Foundation as it is pataphysically-linked to, and therefore dependent on, baseline reality.</p>
