<strong>Subject:</strong> RE:Incident 7028-78</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>After the latest attempted breach of the Reliquary, I would like to take this moment to address the most common question of anyone new to Site-89 as this moment should serve as an important object lesson to the answer. “Why do we lock down the books 7028 creates to such a degree? Why the intense security and secrecy? Why would anyone care?” After today, I hope it is understood that many do care.</p>
<p>What we protect at this Site is at its core information; information that people can and will kill to get their hands on. Religious, cultural, or otherwise, 7028 creates information that has been lost to humanity. These pages might seem as niche academic interests to most, but in some cases what can be confirmed in these documents would overturn consensus reality in an instant or even destroy the Veil entirely. Man has killed fellow man for millennia because they believed that God had told them to.</p>
<p>Imagine how much worse it would be if they had proof they were right.</p>
<p>Secure. Contain. Protect.<br/>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the historical importance of SCP-7028’s location and designation as a World Heritage Site, containment is focused upon restricting access to SCP-7028-1 as well as ensuring that any documents which make their way into public circulation are confiscated and secured at Site-89 for further research and/or destruction if deemed necessary. Successful infiltration of the Zamani Project by Foundation personnel has erased the appropriate access tunnel from public records; however due to the apparent cognitohazardous effect created by SCP-7028-1, regular patrols amongst the tourists, pilgrims, and civilian researchers to ensure redirection as well as information signs with strong countermemes throughout the complex will be required. Class C amnestics are to be administered to any visitor who cannot be easily redirected from attempting to access SCP-7028-1 or at the Site Director’s discretion.</p>
<p>Embedded agents in various libraries in Europe, Asia, and Africa<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Specifically the British Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Vatican Secret Archives, The Balme Library (University of Ghana, Accra),, National Library of India, 中国国家图书馆 (National Library of China, Beijing), Российская государственная библиотека (Russian State Library, Moscow), საქართველოს პარლამენტის ეროვნული ბიბლიოთეკა (National Parliamentary Library of Georgia, Tbilisi), and کتابخانه ملی (National Library of Iran, Tehran).</span> will monitor collections directly for SCP-7028-3 instances, as well as smaller collections at nearby universities and historical sites when possible. To date, no documents have been found in libraries located in North or South America, but in order to ensure integrity of the Veil, monthly monitoring major libraries on both continents will be required.</p>
<p>All recovered instances of SCP-7028-3 are to be reviewed through the Department of Tactical Theology's 'Fourteen Holy Helpers' task force, in order to first check the document for cognitohazards, hostile meme corruption, or anomalous properties. After confirmation of the document's anomalous threats, Foundation historians, Department of Tactical Theology, and other researchers will then study the document for possible actionable intelligence regarding various GOIs or connections to other SCP anomalies. All SCP-7028-3 instances are to be stored in a secure reliquary room at Site-89 which will then be monitored twenty-four hours a day. Any unauthorized attempts at access will be met with appropriate force.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7028 resembles a small medieval scriptorium, although with varied items and details from multiple geographical and chronological points making exact cultural, chronological, or geographical determination impossible. Access is via an anomalous subterranean tunnel designated SCP-7028-1 beneath the Biet Giyorgis (Church of Saint George), Lalibela, Ethiopia. This tunnel terminates with a single dark wooden door with a small square peephole, which is typically covered by a sliding slat of matching wood. On the center of the slat there is a crude carving of what appears to be two snakes comprising an uneven circle. Within the interior of SCP-7028, four scribe’s desks are situated into a square in the middle of the room, each facing the walls with room to walk between the wall and the desk. The walls are made of hewn volcanic tuff matching SCP-7028-1, with a single iron grated window on the wall opposite the door. This window appears to look directly into interstellar space, showing unidentifiable constellations or other astronomical features not mapped within the current Foundation records.</p>
<p>Five humanoid entities inhabit SCP-7028, designated SCP-7028-2α, -2β, -2γ, -2δ, and -2ε, each resembling a human woman of varying racial heritage. Each carry an additional designation which they will use to identify themselves, see Addendum 7028.1 for further details regarding behavior and individual appearances. All five instances are rarely in SCP-7028 at the same time, however it is not clear how these entities are able to leave the scriptorium space as no other entrances or exits are visible besides SCP-7028-1. At least one entity is present at all times, with the exception of ten-minute sessions during the day that match five of the seven Benedictine canonical hours (at the appropriate hour in East Africa Time), specifically Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Compline. While empty, the main area of SCP-7028 may be entered and distant chanting is heard, although it does not match any known religious office and is in a language that is as yet to be deciphered. While audio monitoring is possible via remote recording equipment within SCP-7028, to date no successful video footage has been recorded past SCP-7028-1.</p>
<p>Crude wooden shelving has been set against the other wall with various manuscript-making tools and supplies, and completed texts without any apparent ordering or cataloging system. While no locking mechanism exists for the completed manuscripts on the shelving, as was common in some medieval scriptoriums, it is recommended that agents and researchers ask for permission from an SCP-7028-2 entity if present, before taking a book or item for further research. It is worth noting that nothing taken from the room will remain with a person once they exit out of SCP-7028-1 and will reappear upon the shelf or surface they were taken from. The mechanism for this automatic return process is unknown.</p>
<p>During occupied hours, SCP-7028-2 entities can be seen working on manuscripts in a manner of a medieval scribe, using feather pens, simple black or brown ink, and cured animal hide parchment (although the species of animal the materials come from have not been conclusively identified as no objects can be removed for further study). While in the process of inscription, the manuscript will appear to be a nondescript folio covered in simple light brown leather, regardless of what appearance that the resulting SCP-7028-2 instance takes on upon completion. At any given time, there is at least one SCP-7028-2 instance working as scribe with all four desks appearing occupied in roughly 27% of visits by Foundation personnel. The process of inscribing the text within the folio can take anywhere from two months to a full year, depending upon the length of the text. The scribe will continuously work on the manuscript, with the exception of the aforementioned religious offices, ignoring all questions and writing in an unknown language.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the SCP-7028-2 entity will place the manuscript upon a shelf where it will transform over the course of the next five hours into a visually distinct, specific textual work now designated SCP-7028-3. These texts have been found with content ranging from known works by historical personages, religious or fictional texts that have been theorized as having existed by historians and archeologists but never found in complete form, or a previously unknown work, typically associated with one or more world religions or anomalous religious groups. While most of these documents do not differ in meaningful ways from the copies that exist already within known collections (to the extent that the copies are indistinguishable from the originals), the lost and previously unknown documents are often either entirely contradictory to religious or academic understanding of the subject, include definitive mentions of various anomalous Groups of Interest and religions, and would likely result in either Veil disruption or societal unrest, particularly coupled with the instance in 77% of these documents of harmful cognitohazardous messaging designed to inflame the religious or political tendencies of those reading the document and those exposed to the information from a third party, as well as cause the viewer to never question its authenticity.</p>
<p>Seven days after its completion and transformation the book will vanish, no matter where it is placed in SCP-7028 or if observers are present. Of the 231 books completed during the Foundation's monitoring of the site, 187 have reappeared within the collections of major European, Asian, and African public and academic libraries, typically uncatalogued by library staff. See Recovered Item List for further details. The mechanism for this transfer is not understood, and will occur even if the instance is visually monitored at the time of disappearance.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> It is believed by Foundation archaeologists that the anomaly does not predate the construction of the Biet Giyorgis, however this has not been directly confirmed. Oral tradition places initial discovery by local Ethiopian Orthodox priests after construction of the monolithic structure was completed, typically dated to the twelfth century CE after the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin. Discovery of SCP-7028-1 resulted in the formation of rudimentary containment procedures by the resident religious authorities, consisting of primarily ensuring that pilgrims to the site were prevented from accessing SCP-7028-1 as well as confiscating and destroying any instances of SCP-7028-3 discovered outside of SCP-7028.</p>
<p>The Foundation became aware of SCP-7028 after an instance of SCP-7028-3 (specifically SCP-7028-3a) was discovered in the collections of the Bibliothèque nationale de France by a graduate student from the Sorbonne doing research for their dissertation on 6/18/1947. The discovery generated considerable excitement within both the academic and Jewish communities as initial analysis by codicology and paleography experts indicated the artifact's apparent authenticity. An article written by one of the archivists in the BNF Manuscripts Room in a trade newsletter about the improbability of finding an overlooked copy of a famously 'lost' document in a major library was picked up by JOVE (Joint Occult Venture of Europe) who contacted the Foundation for assistance in determining the source of the document. Over the next four years, three more instances of SCP-7028-3 were found in various libraries in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The connection to SCP-7028 was established in 1951 after the diaries of German explorer Freidrich Rohlfs (who was the first documented European visitor to the Labibela Churches) were discovered as an unconfirmed SCP-7028-3 instance in a Taiwan university library. The highly unusual discovery of the document by library staff caught the notice of Foundation assets in the area, and the diary was recovered, detailing the route to SCP-7028-1 and his meeting with an SCP-7028-2 entity and allowing the Foundation to investigate and secure the location. The Foundation then established Site-89 to secure SCP-7028 and other anomalies in the Horn of Africa region.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3a<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>The Book of the Wars of the Lord</em> (Hebrew: סֵפֶר מִלְחֲמֹת יהוה)<br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Lost biblical text that is referenced in both the Books of Numbers and Exodus, detailing various campaigns of the Israelites united under Moses and Joshua against the Amorites, Amaleks, and other Canaanite peoples.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 6/18/1947<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> Bibliothèque nationale de France (Paris, France)<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> First known document created by SCP-7028. Confirmation was made of its construction by SCP-7028-3β during a brief interview where the entity refused its return, stating that "this was not the purpose", presumably of SCP-7028. Of note, the work includes several verses dedicated to a violent conflict with the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140" target="_blank">Daevites</a>, containing multiple cognitohazards which compel the reader to prepare for an immediate threat or attack by any means necessary.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored within Reliquary 1 at Site-89.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3j<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>Bēowulf</em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Manuscript appears to be dated to the eighth century, making it a precursor to the Nowell Codex. Includes additional lines about other battles Beowulf waged in his service to Hrothgar and his rule over the Geats.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 7/15/1951<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Content of the text varies greatly from the Norwell Codex, with a much stronger emphasis on pagan religious elements and little to no mention of Christian worship. Beowulf also has an encounter with beings described as 'terrible, made of metal and shouting praise to their god of the shattered', but there is no further context to definitively associate this to a known GOI.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored within Reliquary 5 at Site-89.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note from Director Abebe: While the Foundation recognizes the historical importance of documents such as SCP-7028-3j, for the sake of Veil integrity these lost literary works must remain contained. The benefit of their 'discovery' by the academic world cannot counterbalance the risk that someone ends up asking the wrong questions about where they're coming from.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3y<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>Guide for Those-Who-Seek-Knowledge</em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> A small jar containing a papyrus scroll (3.5m in length, roughly 35cm in width throughout the roll), written in ancient proto-Hieratic script. The content is a dialogue between two unnamed figures, although one is strongly implied to be Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and learning. The dialogue outlines various ways the gods wield their power as well as specifics as to how, along with animal communication methods, alchemical recipes, and guides to thaumaturgic and ritualistic practices.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 6/8/1979<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> کتابخانه ملی , Tehran, Iran.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Testing has shown that many of the directions mentioned in these dialogues produce effective results with expected anomalous outcomes.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored in Reliquary 5 at Site-89.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3bn<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>The Complete Avesta</em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Manuscript is written in Avestan or Old Persian in a script no longer used by any modern Arabic populations. The paper and paleography used can date the document to roughly Second or Third Century CE, placing its theoretical creation in the height of the Sassanian Empire. Manuscript contains significantly more content than the K1 manuscript of the Avesta, and could possibly be the theorized 'Sassanian Archetype' of the document. The full history of the teaching of Ahura Mazda to Zoroaster is recounted in the first folio, with the usual place of Alexander the Great's conquest being replaced by an invasion of Sarkic hordes who inflict similar chaos without lasting occupation of Persian lands. The known texts mostly match known versions of the <em>Avesta</em>, but sections of the Vendidad include extensive additions of laws dictating the disposal of human remains as well as other restrictions not present in other versions.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 3/4/1981<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> Bodleian Library, Oxford, United Kingdom.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> ORIA has discovered the existence of this instance through unknown means and has requested its return, or at least the ability to study the text directly.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Internal investigations have not shown the presence of infiltrating third parties, an internal security breach, or installation of surveillance technology.</span> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/your-place-was-empty" target="_blank">O5 Decision is pending.</a><br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored Reliquary 11 at Site-89.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3ej<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>The Bir of Guru Granth Sahib</em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Document resembles an illuminated manuscript copy of Adi Granth (see notes) as it was finalized by the tenth guru of the Sikh faith, Guru Gobind Singh. Edition varies slightly from the original manuscript which is held at Gurdwara Thum Sahib, but is embellished with a high degree of artistic design and appears to be dated to the Seventeenth Century CE.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 3/19/1992<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> Hong Kong Central Library.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> This instance was later followed by five related documents, including copies of various hukamnama,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Edicts issued by various Sikh Gurus.</span> documents relating to the Indian Independence effort against the British Empire, and literary works believed lost in the burning of the Sikh Reference Library in 1984 by the Indian Army. This follows a pattern, although inconsistent, of SCP-7028-2 instances as replacements of lost literature or religious documents.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored in Reliquary 12 at Site-89.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3cz<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1425" target="_blank">Star Signals</a></em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Hardcover copy of SCP-1425, nearly exactly matching the copy stored at Site-40 (which remains in Foundation custody without any breach of its containment).<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 7/28/2008<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> Vatican Secret Archives, Vatican City.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Testing confirmed that the instance retained the anomalous properties of the original to an equal degree. However, this instance includes an additional appendix added to the end of the book which provides detailed instructions to reverse cognitohazardous infection by the text. These instructions have proven to work roughly 45% of SCP-1425 infection in controlled Foundation testing.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Instance was remanded to O5 Council custody at their request.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7028-3fa<br/>
<strong>Title:</strong> <em>Memo on Project Tsarina</em><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong> Printed document on 8"x11" copy paper outlining a detailed plan of attack against Site-87 Archeological Containment Unit with the express purpose of destruction of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1348">SCP-1348</a>. Instance appears to be an internal dossier on a SAPPHIRE raid planned to take place on 10/1/2020.<br/>
<strong>Date Recovered:</strong> 9/21/2019<br/>
<strong>Location Recovered:</strong> საქართველოს პარლამენტის ეროვნული ბიბლიოთეკა, Tbilisi, Georgia.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Based on the information detailed by the instance as well as informants within SAPPHIRE, a joint operation with the Horizon Initiative's Project Malleus and members of the Foundation's Tactical Theology Division were able to intercept the assault force prior to their arrival at Site-87 and protect SCP-1348 from attack. The day after the incursion, a member of C-1348-A found a small inscription, previously unnoticed on the exterior walls of SCP-1348-03, which translated out of Amharic simply read 'Thank you'.<br/>
This marks the first time that a SCP-7028-3 instance showed advanced information, although it should be noted that SAPPHIRE created the dossier several weeks before the planned attack per the document itself, and therefore should not be taken as evidence of precognizance. Per O5 directive, all currently stored and future SCP-7028-2 instances are to be re-examined for any actionable information.<br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> Stored in Reliquary 14 at Site-89.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, at least one SCP-7028-2 instance is always present within the main part of SCP-7028 with the exception of five apparent religious offices of an unknown provenance. While entities will acknowledge entrants to the interior of SCP-7028 and will nod in permission if asked about further study on a specific SCP-7028-3 instance, it appears that the entities have taken a religious vow of silence and will not answer direct questions. See Interview Log 7028.01 for further information.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-7028-2 are semi-translucent in appearance, suggesting a degree of incorporeality although collision occurs as expected if any attempt is made to touch one of the entities and they have no difficulty interacting with the physical objects within SCP-7028. Each of the instances do display expected coloration, if slightly muted and are capable of creating sound while walking or attending to various tasks, etc.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Admission Protocol:</strong> Visitors are to knock twice at the doorway found at the end of SCP-7028-1 and wait until one of the instances present opens the door, nodding their head twice at the visitor who should then respond in kind. The instance will return to their tasks without speaking to the visitor, but will not impede any investigation of the texts and objects on the shelving around the room.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">It should be noted that the texts and objects change at unpredictable intervals which, coupled with the inability to remove items from SCP-7028 itself, has made cataloging and further research of these artifacts difficult.</span></p>
<p>If the visitor attempts to read over whatever text the SCP-7028-2 instance is currently working on, the script will be indecipherable to the reader and the instance will continue to work without offering explanation. All instances except SCP-7028-2γ will bow as the visitor departs the main room via SCP-7028-1.</p>
<p>If the knock is not answered by an instance and the time period matches one of the expected religious offices, visitors may enter SCP-7028 directly, although permission by the Site Director must be issued first. If there is no answer outside the expected religious office hours, the Site Director is to be contacted immediately.</p>

<p>SCP-7028-2α appears to be a human woman, appearing to be roughly 30-40 years of age and of apparent southern European heritage.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Note that while SCP-7028-2 instances have distinct appearances, none have aged visibly during the time of Foundation observation.</span> It wears the religious habit of a typical nun of the Poor Clares Order with a black and white wimple and visible devotional scapular made of tooled leather displaying the fivefold design of the Roman Catholic Church attached to a leather cincture at the waist. Of note, they do not wear a visible crucifix or rosary.</p>
<p>Within SCP-7028-2α's apparent order they are referred to by the designation 'Sister Mary Celeste'.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">This information, as well as the designations of the other SCP-7028-2 instances, were disclosed by SCP-7028-2α prior to Interview 7028.1.</span> SCP-7028-2α speaks with a heavy northern Italian accent but understands English fluently. To date, SCP-7028-2α is the only instance to speak with Foundation personnel See Interview Log 7028.1 for further information.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none">
<p>SCP-7028-2β appears to be a human woman roughly 40 years of age and of apparent southeast Asian heritage wearing a traditional kāṣāya.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Buddhist religious garment, specifically the yellow shade of the Mahāsāṃghika order.</span> In addition to the triple robe, they also wear an ornate samakaksika which bears the Eight Auspicious Signs worked in gold thread. Their hair is shaved close to the scalp and they are never seen wearing footwear.</p>
<p>Within SCP-7028-2β's apparent order they are referred to by the designation Ani Chomden. SCP-7028-2β also has a visible tattoo upon their left leg of unknown significance that resembles two snakes in a coiled circle, one solid, one outlined. This tattoo somewhat matches the crude carving on the door found at the end of SCP-7028-1.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-3" style="display:none">
<p>SCP-7028-2γ appears to be a human woman, likely twenty years of age and of northern European heritage. Unlike other SCP-7028-2 instances, 2γ wears the white monastic habit of a Mendicant monk rather than nun with her hair clipped short, but not in the traditional tonsure against the scalp. They wear a devotional scapular at their waist with veneration of the Virgin Mary, specifically the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, and a short sword on the left hip. To date, SCP-7028-2γ has drawn their sword four times, specifically upon visitors to SCP-7028 who do not ask permission before entering, but have yet to injure any Foundation personnel.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Oral tradition of the local Ethiopian priests holds that SCP-7028-2γ has killed intruders in the past, but this has not been confirmed.</span></p>
<p>Within SCP-7028-2γ's apparent order they are referred to by the designation "Sister Vouthon." They are also the SCP-7028-2 instance least likely to be seen working as scribe, but often present within the main structure observing.</p>

<div id="wiki-tab-0-4" style="display:none">
<p>SCP-7028-2δ appears to be a human woman of roughly 40 years of apparent Asian heritage.

<p>Within SCP-7028-2δ's apparent religious order they are referred to by the designation "Ane Shinnyo." They have been noted to complete the most SCP-7028-3 instances of any of the five SCP-7028-2 entities. They also appear to conduct a ritualistic 'cleansing' of SCP-7028 on a semi-regular timetable which resembles Shinto purification rituals including salt and water, with a dried flowered plant stem place of a more traditional paper wand, which has yet been conclusively identified.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-5" style="display:none">
<p>SCP-7028-2ε appears to be a human woman of roughly 50 years of age of apparent African heritage, wearing a dark Άνάλαβος<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Traditional Eastern Orthodox religious habit, specifically showing the degree of Grand Schema, typically the highest rank of monastics within Greek Orthodox traditions.</span> as well as the καλυμαύκι headcovering favored by nuns in African sects.</p>
<p>Within SCP-7028-2ε's apparent religious order they are referred to by the designation "Sister Petros". singularly among the SCP-7028-2 instances, they can often be found standing in front of the window which appears to look out into interstellar space and to date are the only instance who has been found within SCP-7028 during one of the five times of religious office.</p>

<p>On 10/10/2019, after the discovery of SCP-7028-3fa and failed raid on SCP-1348, SCP-7028-2α approached Junior Researcher Walker Harwood and requested a meeting with Site Director Abebe. This marks the first time that one of the SCP-7028-2 entities was willing to speak with a Foundation representative. The interview was conducted within the Interior of SCP-7028 with no other Foundation researchers or SCP-7028-2 entities present at the time, although Director Abebe was able to record the conversation via remote transmission to Site-89.</p>

<h3 id="toc3"><span>Interview Log 7028.1</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7028-2α</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site Director Zala Abebe and Junior Researcher Walker Harwood.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 8:41 p.m. East Africa Time&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Director Abebe:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to speak with us, Alpha.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">This address was agreed upon before the interview by both parties.</span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> A vow of silence, however earnest in its piety, should not be used to avoid painful truths. I think that we all understand now that it is past time, don't we? Surely you have seen the signs yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Harwood:</strong> Could you elaborate? Signs of what, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> The signs of the absence, child. Surely you have watched as the threads of this world have grown ever more frayed? The rules begin to vanish, replaced by chaos in their absence, eating itself until there is nothing remaining.</p>
<p><em>Harwood mumbles to himself unintelligibly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abebe:</strong> Walker, <em>not now</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> I suppose that is a valid concern. You deal with so so many who fight the same battle that we are joined to, but do so without care. If you did not choose your allies carefully, you might easily <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-073">be led astray</a>, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076">as they were</a>.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7028-2α pauses for a moment, looking intently at both Abebe and Harwood per their notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α:</strong> We were once of your world, until we we were no longer. While full understanding eludes us, we five have moved from shadow to light. You have already learned that <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-093">there are so many other places</a> besides where you are now, this should not come as any great surprise to you. Nor would you be shocked to find there are forces far greater and far older than <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3480">than what we currently understand</a>, working in a cosmic dance we can merely guess at. It is not as simple as light versus dark, as well you know.</p>
<p><strong>Abebe:</strong> These are truths we are well aware of, yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> And that is why it is well past time, Director. You have found many relics from <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140">this conflict</a> for generations now, bleeding into your world and you have stood against their threats again and again. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1844">You have held the gates closed.</a> You deserve the chance to see beyond the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Abebe:</strong> Please. Describe this threat for us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> I am afraid that is beyond my ability, but not yours. There are worlds beyond the stars that you have <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2922">managed to glimpse</a>, and even here you have already noticed one of the patterns that will be of aid against what seeks to destroy so completely.</p>
<p><strong>Abebe:</strong> We've noticed many patterns, but it seems here that many of these things you create are replacing something which was lost?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> Indeed we are. For every act of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000">obliteration</a>, there is one who acts <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4001">to preserve.</a> We have been called to resist, and will continue to do so as is our charge.</p>
<p><strong>Harwood:</strong> If I can be honest, no you're not. You're just writing books. You're not resisting anything, not really. And you won't give us any straight answers about what's coming. If you could just explain…</p>
<p><em>SCP-7028-2α interrupts, her tone slightly clipped.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7028-2α :</strong> If you will excuse me, Compline is starting.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log, 8:58 p.m. East Africa Time&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>After Researcher Harwood and Site Directer Ababe were asked to leave SCP-7028, the next attempt to speak with SCP-7028-2α was met with silence. No further communication from SCP-7028-2 entities has followed, with the presumption that the vow of silence SCP-7028-2α spoke of during the interview has been resumed. Junior Researcher Harwood has been transferred at his request, pending reassignment.</p>
