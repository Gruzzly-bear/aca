<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>A testing attempt involving a wild southern elephant seal. Subject vocalized "Fuck off, Carl!" prior to SCP-3213 being removed from the area.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3213</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3213 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell on floor 20 of Site-88. Under no circumstances is SCP-3213 to be allowed unsupervised interaction with any member of any pinniped species (pinniped families include, but are not limited to, walruses, seals, and sea lions). Testing of SCP-3213's effects is to take place in the aquatic facilities on floor 21 of Site-88.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3213 is a 44-year-old human male named Carl Prosser. When SCP-3213 is in the direct line of sight of any member of any pinniped species, the animal will become sapient and capable of vocalization. SCP-3213-affected animals will then utilize this capability to direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213.</p>
<p>Affected animals appear to possess individual personalities and behaviors, though all share a common dislike of SCP-3213. Affected animals either do not comprehend, or do not care to respond, to any verbal requests from individuals who are not SCP-3213. Repeated interactions between SCP-3213 and affected animals has yielded no verifiable information relating to the cause of the anomaly.</p>
<p>When in the presence of pinnipeds, SCP-3213 is under constant danger of physical attack. Affected animals will attempt to inflict as much physical pain as possible on SCP-3213, although multiple tests in controlled settings have revealed that these attacks will cease if SCP-3213's life is in danger. All attacking animals will continue direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213 until removed from SCP-3213's presence.</p>
<p>SCP-3213-affected animals do not appear to retain their sapience or ability to vocalize once out of direct line of sight of SCP-3213. Examination of live, actively affected specimens has been unsuccessful due to their aggression. SCP-3213 has, however, been cooperative in continued testing of the anomaly.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="toc0"><span>Test 3:</span></h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Visual demonstration of described anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/30/17</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> SCP-3213 was given a video camera and told to enter a room with a tank housing two adult earless seals.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> A relatively docile interaction occurred during this test. This is believed to have been an attempt to make SCP-3213 feel safe. Two separate attempts were made to physically drag SCP-3213 into the water six seconds after SCP-3213 turned his back on the seals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Test 5:</span></h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attempts by Dr. Paul Clifford to communicate with affected animals while SCP-3213 was present.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/08/17</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals. Dr. Clifford was already present.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction Log:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> Go fuck yourself, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> Yeah, go fuck yourself. Long and hard, you fucking bastard.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clifford:</strong> Excuse me, can you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> Carl, how's it feel to know that even though you're going bald, you'll never get any uglier?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Clifford:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> What's the matter, Carl? Too much of a pussy to answer us?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Test 16:</span></h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attempts to glean more of the reason for the anomaly's existence.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 1/24/18</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals and to inquire as to the reason behind the anomalous behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction Log:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> Should've figured you'd come back, bet you like the taste of shit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3213:</strong> What did I do to make you so mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> Oh ho! This piece of shit wants to know what he did.</p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> You fucking know what you did, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3213:</strong> I never know what you're fucking talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> You're a fucking asshole. We fucking remember 'cause we saw you do that shit, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> You got all these people fooled. You thought just 'cause it was dark and raining on the beach that night, no one was gonna see what you did?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3213:</strong> Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> Coming back to you now, ain't it, asshole. Why don't you jump in here and I'll give you a taste of how it felt.</p>
<p><strong>Seal 1:</strong> Don't worry, we won't kill you. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3213:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Seal 2:</strong> 'cause then we couldn't hurt you any more, Carl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this interaction, SCP-3213 refused to elaborate on the incident described by the affected animals. It is also unknown why all members of pinniped species are aware of this triggering incident.</p>
<p>Investigation into SCP-3213's past has turned up nothing matching the described details. SCP-3213 testing is currently suspended, and daily interviews are scheduled to determine what events caused this anomaly.</p>
