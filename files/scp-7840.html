<p>SCP-7840 in 2022.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7840 is an animate wooden marionette answering to the name “Gizem.” The anomaly exhibits all the clear signs of sapience, even recreating human mannerisms and facial expression, despite being made of wood. Additionally, SCP-7840 exhibits all the neurological sensibilities of a human being – with the exception of pain sensations – including: reflex, tactile sensation, olfactory senses, and involuntary movements. Since containment, SCP-7840 has shown signs of senescence roughly paralleling a human being’s aging cycle – not weathering of its materials but loss of hair, additions of wrinkles, defining of features such as the nose and ears. Researchers have not been able to explain this phenomenon.</p>
<p>SCP-7840 can communicate and grasp abstract conceptual frameworks; however, it frequently fails to respond cogently to queries.</p>
<p>SCP-7840 does not need to eat or sleep, but it pantomimes the actions of human necessity – even to the point of bowel movements – on a consistent basis, frequently stating “I’m going to be a real boy.”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong>: In 1987, Foundation personnel were informed by an embedded agent within the Edinburgh Police Division of a marionette show exhibiting anomalous characteristics. During that year’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe">Fringe Festival</a>, Magnus Freely was performing biweekly shows in which he reenacted famous events from history with marionettes.</p>
<p>Members of the audience complained about the realistic cries of the marionettes in Freely’s shows, which were recorded by the authorities but not further investigated. An SCP agent observed several of Freely’s performances but did not initially note anything abnormal.</p>
<p>The agent investigated Freely’s backstage area after a performance, discovering SCP-7840 and the performer discussing the day’s performances. Freely told investigators that he inherited the anomaly from his grandfather but had only recently discovered it was animate. Because no connection could be found between him and the anomaly's origin, Freely was administered amnestics and the anomaly was taken back to Site-91 for containment.<br/>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Hello! My name is Gizem! I like to sing and dance. You can call me Gizzy!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Douglas</strong>: It’s nice to meet you, Gizzy. I want to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: A strong mind is a weapon finely honed! Where’s Magnus?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: He’s had to go away for a while, but we’re going to be taking care of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Oh good, I need to be watched after. Wouldn’t want to hurt myself before I became a real boy!</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: I wanted to ask you about that, some of the people who were transporting you here said you mentioned wanting to be a real boy. Could you tell me about that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: What’s there to tell, silly? My father told me that if I behaved then I would become a real boy. The Azure Pixie said so too!</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Azure Pixie! She’s like my mom, I guess. She knew my father was sad and lonely and wanted a son, so She stole into his workshop one night and gave me life. Praise the Azure Pixie!</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: I see. Could you tell me about your father?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: His name was Herbert. And he loved me very much.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: The Azure Pixie took him away to live with Her, waiting until I could be a real boy. He was old, and she wanted him to live long enough to see my purpose completed!</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Ah, I understand. When was this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Oh ages and ages ago. You would have shriveled up into leathery scraps and bone dust had you been around then.</p>
<p><em>[Silence for fifteen seconds.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: I bathed in the glory of the Azure Pixie’s light, and was found wanting. So, I had to stay around until I could prove I was worthy of becoming a real boy.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7840 pretends to cough.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Could I have some water, Rebekah?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: You need to drink water?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: Of course! I haven’t had a drink since 1943. How else am I going to be strong like a real boy? Hydration is important for growing organisms.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas</strong>: Right, of course it is. Okay, hold on one second.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Douglas rises from her chair and turns to the door of the interview room, exiting.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7840</strong>: <em>[Whispering]</em> [REDACTED]<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Praise the Azure Pixie. May my worth be found in the gleaming light of Her many eyes.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SCP-7840 pretended to drink the water, the liquid pouring out of its mouth. It then made gagging sounds and asked to continue the interview another day.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the intervening years since containment, SCP-7840 has exhibited only rare moments of coherence, despite its clarity upon the first interview. Below are some selected excerpts of its statements.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em><strong>04/12/1991</strong></em></p>
<p>I laid in that trunk for what seemed like centuries.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> I would count the dust motes, crumpled up with abandoned toys and wondered when I could be a real boy. Finally, I realized patience was what I lacked. Patience and the fortitude to do what was necessary.</p>
<p>Would you like to sing a song with me?</p>
</div>
<p>Based on SCP-7840’s statements, “Breslau” was cross-referenced with locations in Germany and Breslau Hall was identified in the city of Cologne. Originally built in 1485, the Hall was a meeting place for the local woodworkers guild and was actively used for that purpose until the mid 17<sup>th</sup> century. The Hall was built outside the old city limits and next to the remains of the Eifel aqueduct built in the Roman era.</p>
<p>Initial exploration of the structure did not reveal any workshops under the building, but an investigation of the aqueducts revealed a door hidden behind a brick wall that led to an abandoned space filled with woodworking tools and half-finished projects.</p>

</div>
<em>On 2 December, 2021, <a href="scp-6602.html">Agent Gamma</a> was dispatched to the site to investigate.</em><br/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>[The agent approaches the excavated door. It is covered in sigils carved into its surface.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: You getting me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Yes, we’re receiving. Those carvings…</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Seems like what Gizem carved into its arms.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: They are reminiscent.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Were these checked?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: They don’t match any known language or images in the archives.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: I meant for some sort of trap.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Ah. Yes, they were. No thaumaturgical residue or cognitohazardous effect has been noted from the door or those carvings.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma reaches for the handle and struggles to open the door.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: This is heavy as fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: You are being recorded, Agent.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma shrugs, pushes the door further open and enters the space beyond. She activates her headlamp illuminating a stone passageway made of tightly fit blocks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Air is extremely stale.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Any problems breathing, I want you to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><em>[Rossi audibly sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Heard that.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma moves down the corridor until she approaches another door. This one is designed to be secured with a bar across it. The channels are rusting and empty, no bar currently sits within.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Locking something <em>in</em>?</p>
<p><em>[Gamma opens the door and her lights play across the workshop. Several high wooden work tables are cluttered with tools. Lining the back wall is a series of shelves with partially finished marionettes and dolls.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Whole mess of dolls. Freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: The team that discovered the workshop noted a strange smell.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Yeah, coppery and slight tinge of rot. Probably something rotted down here and it seeped into the wood.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma approaches the tools on the nearest worktable. She touches the handle of a chisel.]</em></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="SCP-Anthology%20Tools%20EDIT" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/SCP-Anthology%20Tools%20EDIT"/>

</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Typical wood working tools.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: This one has blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: What? I’m looking right at it through the feed, doesn’t look like it.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: It’s still wet. Also, the smell is worse. Like a butcher shop or killing yard on a farm. I grew up on a farm. This is worse. Something died in here. Probably more than one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: I don’t see the blood.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma releases the chisel and lifts another, then gasps and drops it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: More gore. <em>[Coughs, covering her mouth.]</em> Brain matter too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Let’s leave that for now. What else is in the room?</p>
<p><em>[Gamma turns and approaches the shelves. Twenty-three marionettes and dolls line the shelves. Each has been abandoned at some point in the work, to varying degree. Some are painted, others unfinished wood.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: These give me the creeps.</p>
<p><em>[All faces turn towards her in one smooth motion. Agent Gamma backs away.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma stays stationary for a several minutes, her breathing rate increases. As she attempts to control her breathing, the camera sweeps across the shelves. None of the dolls move again, but each of their eyes invariably is looking at Gamma.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: You didn’t hear that?</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Someone was speaking in a low voice. In German, I think. You’re alone in the room?</p>
<p><em>[Gamma turns and scans the room, the camera panning around the workshop. No other individual is evident.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: Pretty sure.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma stops panning around the room and moves away from the dolls, approaching a section of bare stone wall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: There’s another passage here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: We don’t see anything on this end, just a wall.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma</strong>: What? No, there’s a tunnel here. Bunch of debris and cobwebs, but it goes back pretty far.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: There’s no passage there, Agent. Advise holding back, let’s scan the wall.</p>
<p><em>[Gamma continues moving towards the wall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rossi</strong>: Did you hear me, Agent? Do not approach that wall. You could be under the influence of an anomaly.</p>

<p>When my father made me, he put in his best work. The workshop under Breslau was his sanctum. What he could do with those tools, I wish you could have seen him work. There were many before me, but none after.</p>
<p>Those halcyon days in Father’s workshop in the undercroft were like a dream, hard to say when it was. Must’ve been a really long time ago now. At least a year. Anyway, the Azure Pixie would speak to us both, appearing in our dreams<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> and telling us of Her plans. Oh, the world She would create was glorious.</p>
<p>But I failed Her and Father both. “Be like a real boy and you shall become one. Speak with truth, respect Me in all that you do, and open the way.”</p>
<p>Humankind is not the oldest intelligence in the universe, not by a long shot. The Azure Pixie told me of Her people, Those from before history. They walked the Earth before we could even imagine a cosmos. But the cosmos moved on, leaving Them behind and disconnected from life.</p>
<p>My father had travelled far in his mercenary years, learning much of the wider world, away from the constrictions of his Catholic upbringing. And when he came home to Germany, he endeavored to bring that wisdom to his family and community, but they would not have it. So, lest he abandon Those that came before, he practiced in secret. Working on his projects with chisel and scalpel, ritual and devotion. Then She came to him and granted him Her favor.</p>
<p>And. I. Could. Not. Meet. Her. Expectations!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7840 looks down at the symbols carved into his arms and then examines his hands.]</em></p>

<p>Agent Gamma was discovered in the passages of the aqueduct on 16/12/2021, sitting in front of the loose stone where her camera was found days before. She was immediately remanded to an isolated observation cell at Site-91.</p>
<p>On 24/12/2021, Gamma escaped confinement – assaulting two security personnel, leaving them catatonic and with severe head injuries. A Site-wide search was initiated and shortly thereafter a breach alarm was triggered at SCP-7840’s containment chamber. When security personnel arrived on scene, they discovered the agent being assaulted by the anomaly. The agent suffered contusions to the face and neck, and a moderate concussion.</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of the incident:</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. SCP-7840’s aging has also affected its voice. Whereas once the anomaly had the voice of a small child, its voice has grown deeper and gruffer in tone.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. Expunged for cognitohazardous material.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. This is inaccurate, given that Freely’s grandfather has been confirmed to have used the anomaly when he was performing. This is not the first time SCP-7840 has exhibited symptoms in line with dyschronometria.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. It was here my dreams became reality, and my terrible child born. In blue light and deep shadow, She came to me. I would be Her instrument in the waking world and She would bear my child.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. I made my workshop from the stones of that long abandoned quarry. The men who cut from those stones were long dead, but their devotion still lingered. It was the stone that made Her notice me. Ancient as She, the black granite had been used to build temples to Her majesty in the time before. Before humanity came to rule this world. Before we forgot giants walked the Earth.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. The tools Agent Gamma indicated were covered in blood were tested by forensic pathologists and found to have very old organic material on their surfaces.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-7"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')">7</a>. The stone does not match the bedrock surrounding the workshop.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-8"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')">8</a>. To look within oneself is the greatest of failures. There are no secrets within us. The mysteries of the cosmos are in the cold darkness of the place outside. Guarded by Those that came before. Like she. The mother of my child. My goddess. <em>Gtharn rvoi lchai.</em> Through Her, I discovered wonder.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-9"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')">9</a>. Her gift was only the semblance of life – without the embodiment of humanity around him Gizem would not reach his ascendance.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-10"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-10')">10</a>. To become human is to destroy. It is no different with Her gift of life than any other mother.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-11"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-11')">11</a>. Site-91 was undergoing a containment breach at the time of recording.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-12"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-12')">12</a>. SCP-7840 does not sleep, so it is unclear what it means by this.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-13"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-13')">13</a>. When the anomaly was taken and cleaned after this incident, forensic personnel noted that its lower extremities and torso were entirely covered in gore.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-14"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-14')">14</a>. Are you sure?</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-15"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-15')">15</a>. Ah, good. All better now.</div>
