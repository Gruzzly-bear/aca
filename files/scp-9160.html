<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A total of 208 Mobile Task Force (MTF) units are to be deployed three times daily to designated sectors in search of SCP-9160-B13, as well as any items that may be identified as the origin of SCP-9160-A. Each unit is to consist of 30 MTF operatives. Following each deployment, a written report detailing search activities and findings is to be submitted by the commanding officer of every unit.</p>
<p>If any of the aforementioned objects are found, the O5 Council is to be notified immediately. No further action is to be taken until direct orders are issued by the Council.</p>
<p>Laboratories currently studying SCP-9160-B1 through B3 are required to submit a weekly report on the object under study. If new discoveries are found, the O5 Council is to be contacted immediately.</p>
<p>SCP-9160-B5 through B6, SCP-9160-B8 through B12, and the paper documentation of SCP-9160-B7 are to be stored within heat-resistant safes under continuous surveillance. A minimum of four MTF operatives are to be stationed as guards at all times. Authorization from an O5 Council member is required for any access or use of the aforementioned objects.</p>
<p>Laboratories are also tasked with searching for the hypothesized SCP-9160-C. A weekly report is required from all facilities involved in this investigation. If new discoveries are found, the O5 Council is to be contacted immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9160-A is a radio signal of unknown origin, first detected at Site ██ on ██/██/20██. The transmission is encoded in International Morse code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The signal is captured purely because of luck,we're testing our radio wave pirating device that day.<br/></p>

<p>SCP-9160-B consists of eleven sheets of paper composed of an unknown material combined with recycled paper, a single digital record, and one hypothesized record of unknown existence. The documents contain either historical accounts between SCP-9160-E and humanities or descriptions of the scenarios occurring when SCP-9160-A reaches SCP-9160-C.</p>
<p>The eleven paper documents have been designated SCP-9160-B1 through SCP-9160-B6 and SCP-9160-B8 through SCP-9160-B12. The digital record is designated SCP-9160-B7, while the hypothesized record is designated SCP-9160-B13.</p>
<p>SCP-9160-C, originally named “Binah”, is an entity outside our current dimension. SCP-9160-C consists of power which can create multiple XK class end-of-the-world scenarios at will. Historical accounts indicate that SCP-9160-C alongside another entity once served <a href="scp-343.html">SCP-343</a>, until the dissolution of a peace treaty established between them. SCP-9160-C remains uncontained and has not been located to date.</p>
<p>SCP-9160-D resembles a sprouting bamboo stalk, possessing white foliage and eight red, semi-oval structures symmetrically distributed along its sides. Each red structure exhibits nuclear energy levels estimated at approximately 4,000 Tsar Bomba equivalents, or roughly 8.4 zettajoules. The root system of SCP-9160-D is presumed to be infinite in length, as the Foundation has not yet located its terminus. No safe or effective method for the neutralization of SCP-9160-D has been discovered to date.</p>
<p>SCP-9160-E refers to a race of entities for which no verified information exists beyond their reported presence within the so-called “Lifeless Land.” Documented accounts describe their issuance of creation commands to Binah Followers regarding SCP-9160-B, their involvement in the destruction of SCP-9160-B7, and their identification as the military force serving SCP-9160-C.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> The following events happened in chronological order.</p>
<p>Although SCP-9160-A possesses the anomalous property of being untraceable to its origin, the Foundation is not prioritizing on SCP-9160-A until the subsequent discovery of SCP-9160-B4 and SCP-9160-D.</p>

<p>This text was discovered in the dormitory of Dr ████████. Despite daily cleaning, the text remained undetected until a D-Class personnel assigned to SCP-9160-related duties was cleaning the room.</p>
<p>Dr ████████ was subsequently brought in for questioning concerning SCP-9160-B4. The transcript of the conversation follows:</p>

Dr ████████ : This is the fourth…<br/>
Dr Anborough : Pardon me?<br/>
Dr ████████ : This prophecy you got…is the fourth one.<br/>
Dr Anborough : There's more of this?<br/>
Dr ████████ : Yes…Thirteen in total…Will all be recorded down by followers of Binah…<br/>
Dr Anborough : (Silence for 5 seconds)Alright then…Should I interpret you as one of the, uhhh…followers?<br/>
Dr ████████ : Yes! I am one of the most loyal servants! That's the reason why they chosen me!<br/>
Dr Anborough : They?<br/>
Dr ████████ : They…are even more loyal to Binah…They are the army of Binah, accompanied with him since the very beginning!<br/>
Dr Anborough : Do you know about the other…uhh…prophecies?<br/>
Dr ████████ : No, I don't.<br/>
Dr Anborough : I thought you say-<br/>
Dr ████████ : (Interrupting)The prophecies are scattered among followers. So one follower can only get one piece of prophecy if they were chosen, and only thirteen people are chosen.<br/>
Dr Anborough : So you are requested to write this down?<br/>
Dr ████████ : Well, not very long ago, but…like a few months before the Foundation found out the "SOS" signal from Lord Binah's army? That army talked to me through a dream. They told me to write down these words.<br/>
Dr Anborough : Alright then. I'm finished.</p>

<p>SCP-9160-D was discovered in ████████, ████████, ████████ on ██/██/20████.</p>
<p>During the discovery of SCP-9160-D, seven self-proclaimed "Binah Followers" were captured. They claimed that SCP-9160-D was "a preparation for Binah’s strike against humanity". This claim was corroborated by the discovery of SCP-9160-B5, which was located five minutes after SCP-9160-D was uncovered.</p>
<p>SCP-9160-B1 through B3 were subsequently discovered across multiple locations.</p>

Dr Clef : Greetings, SCP-343.<br/>
SCP-343 : You're here to talk about Binah, aren't you?<br/>
Dr Clef : Yeah…? So, about SCP-9160-C…You called it Binah, didn't you? Should I then imply that you know it?<br/>
SCP-343 : How would I not know about him, he's the manager of plagues, contrast to his brother, Hokhmah. They are both my assistants.<br/>
Dr Clef : Is Hokhmah…the one holding the cup thingy?<br/>
SCP-343 : (Silence for 5 seconds)…Yes. The cup of life.<br/>
Dr Clef : Do you know about…the war between them?<br/>
SCP-343 : I do. It all started because humanity injured Binah's son. Then they argue on their management of their people…And that led to the war. You know the rest.<br/>
Dr Clef : Alright…Do you know what are those…People of SCP-9160-C are called?<br/>
SCP-343 : I don't know, actually. Binah named them, not me.<br/>

<p>The following conversation occurred when Researcher Samuel M. Lloyd was reading and analyzing SCP-9160-B2 during his lunch break, and he encountered Researcher Rose Labelle.</p>
<p>Lloyd will be short for Researcher Samuel M. Lloyd and Rose will be short for Researcher Rose Labelle.</p>

Rose : What SCP? You're not holding anything.<br/>
Lloyd : What do you mea-(Lloyd looked back on his hand, only seeing his hand empty, while SCP-9160-B2 is on the table.)Why is it on the table? I thought I'm holding it…(Picking SCP-9160-B2 back up)<br/>
Rose : You're not holding anything though?<br/>
Lloyd : Wait, you can't see this?(Held SCP-9160-B2 up)<br/>
Rose : You're not holding anything.<br/>
Lloyd : (Looked at his hand with SCP-9160-B2)I'm pretty sure there is something in my hand. Can you imagine that there is a piece of paper in my hand? And try to touch it?<br/>
Rose : (Does the exact thing Lloyd said)Nope, not feeling anything.<br/>
Lloyd : Have you heard of SCP-9160?<br/>
Rose : We got a SCP-9160? Never heard of it.<br/>
Lloyd : Really? We got an entire laboratory for it, that was made on Site ██, and you don't know shit about it?<br/>
Rose : Nope,not at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this conversation, Lloyd brought Rose to the laboratory and allowed her to listen to SCP-9160-A. Rose was suddenly able to interact with objects related to SCP-9160.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that objects related to SCP-9160 possess anti-memetic properties.</p>
<p>The events described in SCP-9160-B4 are predicted to constitute nine XK-class end-of-the-world scenarios. Each individual event is detailed in SCP-9160-B5 through B12. As nine scenarios are referenced in SCP-9160-B4 and Dr ████████ had mentioned thirteen prophecies, the Foundation has assumed the existence of SCP-9160-B13.</p>

Laying in another dimension, where the hole is the gateway.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The dragon who enjoys the eldritch atmosphere of nothingness.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Is resting silently.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
But when our lord Binah shout its command.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The resting dragon will awaken from its almost never-ending sleep.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
And bring horror and despair to humanity, as its roar break the eardrums of all.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Its claw clashed through lands and lands, its purple flame burns between seas and seas.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Its indigo and violet scales protect even nuclear explosions, tornadoes rise below its forty wings.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Even if you can damage the almighty being.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Its stronger brother will awaken from its mouth, ready to wreak havoc.<br/>

<p>Date:██/██/20██ Involved personnel:Dr Clef, ████████ About:SCP-9160-B7<br/>
Dr Clef : Greetings, your name is ████████, right? May I ask a few questions? Just a few?<br/>
████████ : Absolutely! If the questions are related to my belief. I would be more than happy to share it with you.<br/>
Dr Clef : Yeah, yeah, something like that…Do you know anything about SC-prophecies of Binah?<br/>
████████ : Bro, are you interested in our belief? I can't tell you anything if you're not.<br/>
Dr Clef : (3 seconds of silence)Of course I am! That's why I am asking questions about the prophecies!<br/>
█████████ : Okay then…Binah's army only enlighten me about the 7th prophecy though.<br/>
Dr Clef : It's enough for me. Wait, where's the paper document though?<br/>
█████████ : We burned it.<br/>
Dr Clef : Burned it!? But why?<br/>
█████████ : This is an order directly from the Binah's army…saying that some kind of 'foundation' will try to take it…<br/>
Dr Clef : (Whispering)Those sneaky rats…<br/>
█████████ : What did you say?<br/>
Dr Clef : Nothing, can you continue on saying the prophecy?<br/>
█████████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> : Of course! Here it goes. While the roar of the dragon break through eardrums, it also reaches to some distant old friends. The so called "anomalous", all will hear its call. All will be awaken like the dragon. You thought those were a gift or a curse, when it actually is a ticking bomb. Some might be happy to betray, like the ████████ or the ████████. Or maybe some just wanted to help their friend, like the ████████ and ████████…</p>

But during their quiet rest, trying to get a portion of fresh air.<br/>

The humanity choked in their breath, trachea burning.<br/>

Pharynx and larynx explodes, unable to tank this fatal hit.<br/>

Alveoli rots in distress when bronchioles melt in despair.<br/>

Humanity worried and scared, not sure when will be the next strike of slaughter.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
No matter where they hide, the gas will find you.<br/>

But instead they were one of the plagues humanity need to face.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The stars started to drop like a fallen angel in heaven.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
They fall and fall as they burn in the polluted atmosphere.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Every single one of them is the size of a state in United States.<br/>

Every single one of them can melt the strongest carbon.<br/>
