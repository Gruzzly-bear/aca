<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures (Updated 13/08/1978):</strong> Following the events detailed in Addendum 9120-9, and given the isolated and self-contained nature of all anomalies classified under the SCP-9120 designation, the establishment of formal containment measures has been deemed impractical, unnecessary, and actively detrimental to the Foundation's core mission statement. As such, the classification of SCP-9120 has been changed from Safe to Archon, and all previous containment protocols and activities have been discontinued.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The Foundation has purchased the land surrounding SCP-9120-A from the British Government, and Parahistorical and Thaumatological Research Area-400 has been constructed <em>in situ</em>. A 100-meter circular perimeter has been established around Area-400; this perimeter is to be continuously monitored and secured by on-site security personnel and Applied Task Force Theta-99 ("Regicidium") via unmanned aircraft systems and routine patrols.</p>
<p>In addition to the previous mission, ATF Theta-99 has been assigned the task of assisting SCP-9120-D when repairs to any of the constituent component of SCP-9120-E are deemed necessary, but only when such assistance is explicitly requested by SCP-9120-D.</p>
<p>A secure line of communication has been established between the director of Area-400 and the Overseer Council. This line is to be used regularly to relay updates regarding the status of all the phenomena under the SCP-9120 designation. Failure to report at least once every seven days will result in immediate demotion, and an intervention will be carried out by Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand").</p>
<p>The neutralization of one or more of the anomalies classified as SCP-9120 is considered tantamount to the emergence of an XK-Class ("End-of-the-World") or HK-Class ("Deific Subjugation") Scenario.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Should this occur, Protocol Long Night of Solace is to be declared active by the Overseer Council; all major Foundation facilities located within the United Kingdom and adjacent territories are then to be placed on high alert until further notice.</p>
<p>While exploration missions into SCP-9120-B are generally permitted, all expeditions into SCP-9120-C must be conducted by members of ATF Theta-99 under the supervision of Dr. Ethan Carter, SCP-9120's lead researcher, to prevent any possible altercations or misunderstandings with SCP-9120-D.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p>This protocol is to be declared active by unanimous decision of the Overseer Council when, and exclusively when, the containment of SCP-9120 is considered irreversibly compromised and the occurrence of one or more K-Class Scenario(s) becomes imminent. The following steps are to be taken to ensure the continuation of the human race as a species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sitting Director of Area-400 is to issue an immediate evacuation order for all non-essential personnel. The evacuation window will be limited to ten (10) minutes.</li>
<li>SCP-9120-D is to be contacted and, if feasible, extracted from SCP-9120-B if it has not yet been neutralized.</li>
<li>All members of ATF Theta-99 are to attempt to close SCP-9120-A by any means necessary.</li>
<li>The deployment of Gen-3 Scranton Reality Anchors in conjunction with industrial-grade Lonsdale Thaumaturgic Inhibition Field Generators, all of which are located in the High-Security Storage wing of Area-400, is authorized to seal SCP-9120-A and/or prevent further connections between SCP-9120-B and baseline reality from being formed.</li>
<li>The Overseer Council will formally declare a state of global emergency.</li>
<li>All allied governments and Groups of Interest are to be notified of the situation and briefed through all appropriate secure channels.</li>
<li>The Emerging Threat Response Department (ETRD) will assume operational command and coordinate all countermeasures against EoI-001 should it breach into baseline reality.</li>
<li>The use of all available assets, including conventional, experimental, and anomalous weaponry, as well as SCP objects currently in Foundation custody, is authorized in the engagement against EoI-001.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the steps outlined in this document fail to halt or neutralize EoI-001, it will constitute the ultimate failure of the Foundation’s core threefold mission. In such an event, the Overseer Council will formally announce the dissolution of the SCP Foundation, and all personnel will be relieved of their duties effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9120 is the group designation assigned to four distinct but interconnected anomalous phenomena, and one anomalous entity: SCP-9120-A, SCP-9120-B, SCP-9120-C, SCP-9120-D, and SCP-9120-E.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-A</strong> is a thaumically created and maintained space-time anomaly<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> located on the outskirts of Stratford-upon-Avon, England. SCP-9120-A is imperceptible to the human eye, but can be physically interacted with and traversed by ordinary matter without the need for specialized equipment. SCP-9120-A serves as the primary, and thus far only known, access point to SCP-9120-B.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-B</strong> is a self-contained, extradimensional location connected to baseline reality via SCP-9120-A. The topography of SCP-9120-B consists of a vast, temperate forest inhabited by both mundane and anomalous species of flora and fauna, some of which are extinct on Earth, while others appear to be native to SCP-9120-B. SCP-9120-B undergoes a perpetual 24-hour day/night cycle, although no identifiable light source has yet been located in its interior.</p>
<p>SCP-9120-B is fully navigable and, despite some minor visual and spatial abnormalities that manifest sporadically due to its slightly reduced Hume level compared to baseline reality, it presents no significant hazards. It largely adheres to Euclidean geometry, and possesses a set of physical laws similar to those present in baseline reality. SCP-9120-B is devoid of sapient life in its entirety, with the sole exception being SCP-9120-D.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-C</strong> is a fortified, artificial structure located at what is believed to be the center of SCP-9120-B. Analysis of recovered samples indicates that it is primarily constructed of non-anomalous materials such as sandstone and copper; its interior is extensively decorated. The overwhelming majority of the decorative items and ornaments present within SCP-9120-C are of fae origin and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The internal layout of SCP-9120-C is subject to a persistent spatial anomaly, resulting in the complete reconfiguration of its internal topology upon the entrance of any individual into SCP-9120-C itself or into any of its rooms. These changes follow no discernible pattern, and appear to be entirely random.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D</strong> is a large, winged, reptilian entity of draconic origin. Specifically, it is a living female specimen of a common western dragon (<em><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8672" target="_blank">Draconis ignis</a></em>). SCP-9120-D is estimated to measure approximately 6.5 meters in height and 9 meters in length, although precise measurements are difficult to obtain due to its general distrust of Foundation personnel. The body of SCP-9120-D is covered primarily in silver scales, with patches and patterns of purple scales interspersed throughout. Several pieces of jewelry appear to have been embedded in its forehead, horns, neck base, and forelimbs.</p>
<p>SCP-9120-D is the self-proclaimed caretaker of SCP-9120-A through SCP-9120-E. It can exert near-complete control over the previously mentioned anomalies (with the exception of SCP-9120-E), and it is directly responsible for the spatial reconfigurations observed within SCP-9120-C. However, SCP-9120-D maintains that it did not create these anomalies, and instead functions solely as their guardian.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-E</strong> is a highly complex and interconnected thaumaturgical runic array located throughout SCP-9120-B and SCP-9120-C. Each seal comprising SCP-9120-E is situated in a distinct and geographically distant area within these locations. The main purpose of SCP-9120-E is to prevent Entity of Interest-001 ("Queen Mab") from entering baseline reality through SCP-9120-B.</p>
<p>For further details regarding SCP-9120-E, see Addendum 9120-9</p>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Preliminary knowledge of the phenomena now classified as SCP-9120 can be traced back to the late 16th century, particularly to the works and private correspondence of English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Although not publicly affiliated with any known occult society of the time, archived documents belonging to the now-defunct <em>Her Majesty's Institution for the Suppression and Control of the Paranormal</em> (HMISCP)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> indicate that Shakespeare possessed a nuanced understanding regarding the existence of anomalous and supernatural phenomena, particularly those related to thaumaturgy and the fae.</p>
<p>Given the presence of a marginal note attached to the famous "Queen Mab" speech in Act I, Scene IV in a draft of the play Romeo and Juliet, which described a location bearing significant resemblance to SCP-9120-B, it is currently believed that Shakespeare — at some point in his life — came across the location of SCP-9120-A and established successful and peaceful contact with SCP-9120-D, gaining considerable knowledge of fae history as a result and using it as a source of inspiration for some of his writings.</p>
<p>The existence of these anomalies would not become known to the Foundation until 20/03/1975, however. One week prior to that date, satellites belonging to the British Occult Service<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> detected the occurrence of a localized CK-Class ("Reality Restructuring") event approximately 1.1 kilometers from the town of Stratford-upon-Avon. The event was later determined to have been caused by a violent thaumic discharge of unknown origin by specialized Foundation instruments.</p>
<p>Given the BoS's relatively poor understanding of reality-altering phenomena, along with their lack of proper equipment to properly deal with such anomalies, they contacted the Foundation and ceded control of the situation to it. SCP-9120-A was discovered during a follow-up investigation of the affected area by field agents, and a Mobile Task Force was deployed from Site-80 to investigate the anomaly for exploration and reconnaissance purposes.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 9120-1:</strong> Initial Exploration of SCP-9120-B.</p>
<p>The following exploration took place approximately 14 hours after the initial discovery of SCP-9120-A. The primary objectives of the mission were to confirm the stability of the anomaly, conduct preliminary reconnaissance of the interior environment, and determine the presence of any immediate anomalous threats. Personnel were instructed to avoid engagement with unknown entities unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Assigned Task Force:</strong> Mobile Task Force Xi-42 ("Breaking and Entering")</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Cpt. Adrian Wells (Xi-Alpha)</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Leonard Macek (Xi-Bravo), Richard Voss (Xi-Charlie), John Davidson (Xi-Delta)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Camera feed activates. The image is grainy but stable. All the members of MTF Xi-42 are seen standing directly in front of the location where SCP-9120-A is located.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Alright, this is it. Command, we're ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Roger that Alpha, you may commence the mission now.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha takes a step forward and passes through SCP-9120-A without resistance. The camera flickers but rapidly stabilizes and picks up on the lush green landscape surrounding it now. The rest of the team follows in sequence. Xi-Charlie pauses mid-step after passing through.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> That’s… disorienting.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> First time going through a Way? Don't worry, it'll pass in about a minute. Bravo, what do you got for me?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> Hume levels spiked for a moment there during transition, but they're stabilizing now. They appear to be slightly lower than in baseline, though.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Copy that Bravo. Command, you heard that?</p>
<p><em>Radio is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Command, do you read me?</p>
<p><em>Radio remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Shit, it’s one of those. Should’ve seen this coming.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha steps forward and turns around to face the rest of his teammates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Well, I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but it seems like we're on our own now.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> Oh, of course we are. Typical extradimensional ops. No comms, no backup, probably no extraction either unless we find the door back ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Bravo adjusts his scanner and performs a reading of the surrounding environment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> The good news is that Hume levels are holding steady now. They're still lower than baseline, but there's no fluctuation in our immediate vicinity. EVE on the other hand is all over the place, but that's to be expected given the info we were given.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Good, that's one less thing to worry about.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha moves in place to inspect the area. The camera captures several visual aberrations before landing on a clearing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Let’s keep it tight and push out to that clearing over there. We set base camp, get some wide-angle readings, then sweep outward in a clockwise pattern.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha turns back around and begins walking. The team moves through a narrow forest trail in a standard diamond formation. Birds, insect chittering, and other animal sounds can be heard in the background. The forest is dense but navigable. Light filters strangely through the trees, occasionally bending at odd angles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> Man, this whole place looks straight out of a fairy tale</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> Yeah, all it’s missing is a gingerbread house and a witch trying to fatten us up.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> I wouldn't mind that.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> I meant the food, freak. I don't know about you all, but I couldn't finish my breakfast today.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> What? No, I'm not talking about that. The scanner just pinged something… rather large about 600 meters out, dead ahead.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha pauses and stands still.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Alright boys and girls, change of plans, we're going there. Eyes up and let’s move.</p>
<p><em>The team advances further. After approximately ten minutes of walking, the treeline breaks, revealing a vast open glade. At its center stands a large structure that has been partially overgrown with ivy and is surrounded by stone monoliths.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> The hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Who knows. Structure’s definitely artificial though, looks almost like a castle.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> It most probably is. There's no distinctive energy output that I can detect, but ambient EVE levels just jumped significantly. This place is radiating the stuff.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Delta zooms his camera at the unidentified structure.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> That architecture… it's odd. Looks familiar yet foreign at the same time, and I'm not seeing any recognizable symbology either.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Command is gonna have a field day with this once we’re back. Come on, let’s get closer. Delta, you’re on overwatch.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> Roger.</p>
<p><em>The team cautiously approaches the structure. As they near the main entrance, an arched gateway flanked by vine-covered pillars, there is a sudden gust of wind. Several birds flee from nearby treetops as they get closer to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> Hold up. Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><em>A low growl echoes faintly through the trees. The team goes silent and drops to a defensive crouch. From above, a shadow glides across the clearing. A moment later, a large and slim figure lands with a powerful thud behind them, kicking up a cloud of dust and leaf litter. The figure is massive: silver and purple scales shimmer in the filtered light. Gold chains hang from its horns and throat. Its wings fold slowly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> Shit, is that a—</p>
<p><em>Xi-Charlie gets interrupted by the entity, who speaks in a commanding tone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown entity:</strong> Hold, intruders, and unhand thy steel. Speak thy names, ere I send thee hence with breathless ease.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> Fuck did it just say?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Weapons down. Nobody make a move.</p>
<p><em>The team hesitantly lowers their weapons, but keeps hands close to their gear. Xi-Alpha looks up at the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> Ah, once more doth human folly assail mine ears! But what design doth guide thy boots through this accursèd glade? Com’st thou with tribute fair? Or dost thou bear the madness and the fire of thy fell queen?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> She’s talking like she's straight out of Macbeth, what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> We’re not here to fight, we're… explorers. We came to— we wanted to find out what was at the other side of the… of the gateway.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> Hmm. Words oft woven from gilded breath. Yet thy tone rings clear, if yet unsure. What realm is this thou know'st not, nor the keeper thou dare not name?</p>
<p><em>The entity gestures at the structure with one of its wings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> This hall raised ere thy kind first dreamt of fire. Step not within, lest thou seek the wrath of the beast that lies therein</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Delta:</strong> What's it saying?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Charlie:</strong> Beats me, but it looks like—</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, there is a sharp snap and a flutter. The camera turns just in time to capture Xi-Bravo lowering his foot from a pile of crushed underbrush, beneath which lies the lifeless body of a small avian creature vaguely resembling a juvenile heron sporting two sets of wings.</em></p>
<p><em>The pupils of the entity constrict and a huff of smoke come out from its nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> Dost thou dare to tread into mine own hall with such cloddish disdain?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> It was an accident! I didn’t see it—!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> Silence, thoughtless ape! The wingèd child bore no harm, yet met its end for thy blund’ring step. I warned, and yet thou breakest the peace.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Please, we can make amends. We’ll leave. No harm was intended.</p>
<p><em>The unknown entity raises one of her claws and stomps the ground with it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown Entity:</strong> Intent is naught when ruin is the fruit. Begone, till fate deems thee worthy to return. And mark this well, adventurers, no second misstep shall pass without blood.</p>
<p><em>There is a flash of blinding purple light. The image on the camera scrambles violently with feedback screeches. When it restabilizes, all four team members are lying on the ground just outside the location of the Way. The sky overhead is overcast.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> Did she— teleport us?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Looks like it.</p>
<p><em>Xi-Alpha sighs and turns toward Xi-Bravo.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Smooth move back there, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Bravo:</strong> It <em>was</em> an accident man.</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> Whatever. Command, this is Xi-Alpha, captain of MTF Xi-42. We’re back outside of the anomaly. Please advise.</p>
<p><em>Static comes from the radio, though it rapidly breaks into a clear signal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Xi-Alpha, we read you. You’ve been offline for almost half an hour. What’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> We’re alive and well command, but we made contact with a sapient entity. A… well, a dragon.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> I'm sorry Xi-Alpha, could you repeat that?</p>
<p><strong>Xi-Alpha:</strong> We encountered a dragon in there, or at least a creature that looked like one.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> …Understood. Hold on where you are, we're sending a team to escort you back to base.</p>

<p>Following this exploration, and prompted by the discovery of SCP-9120-D, the containment and cataloguing of SCP-9120 became an Alpha-Level priority by unanimous decision of the Overseer Council. As a result, Containment Area-400 was constructed around the location of SCP-9120-A, and multiple follow-up explorations were subsequently conducted over the span of several years in an attempt to establish proper containment for SCP-9120-C and SCP-9120-D. These attempts did not yield any successful results until 1978.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 9120-2:</strong> Establishment of proper contact with SCP-9120-D.</p>
<p>On 07/01/1978, Dr. Ethan Carter, director of the Foundation's Dragonology Department, submitted a request to the director of Area-400, Director Lucas Walker, to lead an exploration mission into SCP-9120-B with the goal of establishing peaceful contact with SCP-9120-D. This prompted a meeting between Director Walker and Doctor Carter to discuss the contents of the request and the potential risks associated with it.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter was personally chosen by O5-2 to join the SCP-9120 containment project as a consultant for both the research and containment teams at Area-400 following the discovery of SCP-9120-D. This decision was made due to Carter's extensive knowledge of draconic entities, which landed him the title of director of the Foundation's Dragonology Department in 1969.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> You know, Ethan? I would tell you that you are verifiably insane for even bringing this up, but that would be on-brand for you, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’ll take that as a compliment. That aside, you and I both know what we’re dealing with here. This is the moment my department was made to handle, and you’ve been fumbling it for the past three years. I say it’s time we try a different approach.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Sure, I can get behind that. Hell, I’m all for different approaches, but you’re planning to walk into that place with a satchel full of books and no guards. If you ask me, I’d say there are easier ways to commit suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I never said with no guards; I said with a minimal presence of them. You’ve seen the logs, you’ve read the transcripts. -D doesn’t respond well to weapons or perceived threats. I’m not advocating for recklessness; I’m advocating diplomacy — <em>real</em> diplomacy, not whatever we’ve been doing since ’75.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> And if it doesn’t feel like talking? What then? You think that overgrown crocodile is going to sit down for tea and riddles while you pull out your annotated Tolkien?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Dragons aren't related to cro—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> I know that, idiot. Learn to take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Regardless, I do think there’s a chance. You’ve seen the way she speaks. She’s educated and seems literate. Hell, I’d wager she’s better-read than half the staff here, but most of all, she's powerful. If she wanted us dead, you would have a lot of bodies in bags right now.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Touché, but do you really believe that you’re the guy who’s finally going to get through to her?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’ve studied dragons for as long as I can remember, Lucas. If there’s a way to build a rapport with her, I’m your best shot. Maybe your only one if we're being honest.</p>
<p><em>Director Walker sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> You sure love making things difficult for me. Alright, let’s say I greenlight this. Here are the terms: you take two guards with you. No, that’s not negotiable. No rifles, no armor, just pistols, and only for emergencies. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Good. And I want a full psychological screening before you go in. No offense, but if I’m sending one of my best researchers into a literal dragon’s lair, I need to make sure everything’s working up there.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Carter chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Already passed my last one. I bought a motorcycle and everything. Got it out of my system.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Christ, fine. You’ve got forty-eight hours. Prep your materials, brief your team, and, for the love of God, don’t do anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I never do.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> That’s a damn lie and we both know it. Good luck, Ethan, and please don’t die. Paperwork’s going to be hell on my side when that happens.</p>

<p>Four hours following the conclusion of this meeting, a two-man Mobile Task Force was rapidly assembled for the explicit purpose of protecting and guiding Dr. Carter throughout SCP-9120-B. The mission was strictly non-combative; all firearms were to remain holstered unless directly ordered otherwise by Dr. Carter. Dr. Carter himself was given permission to speak freely on behalf of the Foundation during the encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-9120</p>
<p><strong>Assigned Task Force:</strong> Mobile Task Force Iota-64 ("Take Flight")</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Cpt. Georg Reinhard (Iota-Alpha)</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Ethan Carter, Nathan Price (Iota-Bravo)</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Camera feed activates. All members of Mobile Task Force Iota-64 stand in front of SCP-9120-A. Dr. Carter adjusts his jacket's collar.</em></p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> Command, this is Iota-Alpha. Team is at the site, we're preparing for entry.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Copy that, Iota-Alpha. Proceed when ready.</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> Alright, everyone through. Eyes up. Carter, stay close to me.</p>
<p><em>The team enters SCP-9120-A. Video distorts briefly as they pass through the threshold. On the other side, the forest of SCP-9120-B stretches out before them. Lush, damp, and still as a light rain covers the horizon.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter stumbles in place but leans on Iota-Alpha for support.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Wow, this really— it really is disorienting.</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> You'll get used to it. Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, yeah, give me a few seconds.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter straightens, adjusting his satchel and brushing water droplets off his glasses. He takes a deep breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Okay, I'm good. Just… how does one get used to that?</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Bravo:</strong> You stop thinking about it after the fifth time or so.</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> Enough chitchat, let’s move.</p>
<p><em>The team proceeds further into SCP-9120-B, following a narrow trail flanked by moss-covered trees and blue fungi. The rain filters softly through the canopy, giving the forest a quiet atmosphere. After roughly twenty minutes of cautious movement, the team emerges into a familiar glade. SCP-9120-C stands ahead, towering and ominous, its facade partially veiled in ivy and mist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Bravo:</strong> Where shit always goes sideways? Yeah, that's the place.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter scoffs and adjusts his glasses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Alright, this is the highlight of my entire career. First contact with a living dragon… a possibly offended one… and most definitely ancient. No pressure, you've got this.</p>
<p><em>A sudden gust of wind sweeps through the glade. The noise of birds and insects abruptly ceases. From above, a shadow can be seen descending.</em></p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> Alright, your time to shine Carter. Do <em>not</em> fumble this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Huh— what? Oh, y-yeah sure, just— I—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lands heavily in front of the group, cutting Dr. Carter off. Her wings fold in with a loud rustle. The rain does not seem to touch her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Again thou com'st, like fleas upon a lion's back. Six winters hath passed, and still thy ilk return, as trespassers cloaked in stolen courtesy.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter is visibly startled, but steps forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Hello, Lady— uh, Dragon… ma’am… wait, no. Your Grace? — Uh, <em>regardless.</em> Please forgive our intrusion. My name is Dr. Ethan Carter. I come on behalf of—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her head at Dr. Carter, and her eyes narrow. Her nostrils flare, emitting a curl of smoke.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Thou bringest steel with thee still, though I did bid thy kind leave arms at the border many times.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D turns her gaze to Iota-Alpha and Iota-Bravo, nostrils flaring again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Iota-Bravo:</strong> Hey, take it easy. We don't want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Speak not in protest, armored ones. Thy presence offends more than it shields. This is not thine court, nor thine conquest. This is my dominion.</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> With respect, we’re only here to ensure Dr. Carter’s safety. Our weapons are holstered. We have no intention of—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Thou shalt have no intention at all!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D raises a claw. Light bends, space folds, and with a thunderous crack, both Iota-Alpha and Iota-Bravo vanish in a violet flash, leaving behind scorched impressions on the floor. Dr. Carter recoils instinctively.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> O—Oh god, w-what did you—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Sent them elsewhere. They are still within these woods, unspoiled. They shall find no peril should they act with more grace than most of thy ilk. I desired quiet… and thou bringest an entourage. Were I less merciful, their ashes would now rain upon thee.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her body again, closer to Dr. Carter. He swallows hard, and adjusts his glasses again. His fingers tremble slightly as he opens his satchel and pulls out a weatherproof folder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> R-right, of course. You’re absolutely right. I— <em>we</em>, we’ve come with good intentions, I swear it. I… I’ve studied your kind for nearly half my life. I read everything about you— well, everything I could get my hands on. You’re not just fascinating, you’re, uh… majestic. Ancient. Honestly, I—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter fumbles with the folder, dropping several documents into the wet grass.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Shit— no! Not that page—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter kneels to collect the documents, visibly trying to compose himself. SCP-9120-D snorts and hits the soil with her tail in amusement.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Peace, child of ink and fret. Thy words tumble like autumn leaves, frantic and forlorn. Yet… thy eyes speak no deceit. Tell me then, scribe. What dost thou seek here? What cause hath thee and thine shadows to trespass once more upon my glade? Doth some hunger drive thy kind to meddle in what they scarce comprehend?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter stands up, clutching the now-soggy folder in his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> We— we’re not here for conquest or theft, I swear that. We don’t want to disturb you or… or to claim dominion over anything here. I represent a group, an organization, devoted to understanding and protecting things like this place, and like you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> A curious claim. Long have I watched thy kind dress greed in gilded reason. 'Understanding' oft precedes chains, and 'protection' is but prison by fairer name. What makes thee different, child of parchment?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… I can't speak for every action my kind has taken, nor for every mistake, but I can speak for myself. I didn’t come here with a cage, or a contract. I came with questions— honest questions. About you, about this place, and if you'll allow it… I'd like to learn. Just to learn.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter takes a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> We… the Foundation, my people, have failed to approach you with the respect you deserve. I’m here to fix that. Or at least… to try, if you can give me that chance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Many years hath the wind whispered such pleas in mine ear, always followed by rusted boots and shattered oaths. But thou… thou wearest ignorance not as armor, but as an open wound. That is rare.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’m willing to earn your trust, however long it takes. My only request is that you let me speak with you again. Not today, if you prefer. Not until you’re ready, but let there be a next time.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D regards Dr. Carter in silence. Her eyes, reflective and unblinking, hold him in their gaze for several long seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Few indeed are they who ask for time rather than dominion. Fewer still speak as thou dost, not with pride, but with yearning. This realm is no cradle for man’s ambition. Yet… mayhap it can be a hearth for discourse.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter lowers the folder slowly and meets her gaze.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Then… may I return? I’ll come alone, or however you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Aye. Return thou may, but know this: my patience is no inexhaustible well. Speak true, tread light, and thou shalt find no claw raised ‘gainst thee. Break thy word, and nothing shall stay my wrath.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I understand. And… thank you, truly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Words are wind, Ethan Carter. Let action give them weight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Of course. A-Actually… I brought something. As a gift.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter carefully reaches into his satchel and produces a thick, cloth-bound volume wrapped in plastic to protect it from the rain. He unwraps it slowly and holds it out with both hands, the cover facing up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> It’s a dictionary of modern English. I thought… since you speak in an old form of our tongue, you might find this helpful, or maybe even amusing. Language changes fast. I thought it might offer a bridge between you and us.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D shifts slightly, her head lowering until her snout is only a meter or two from the book. Her breath curls around Dr. Carter as she inspects the object. One clawed forelimb extends, unnaturally delicate despite its size, and she uses a single talon to take the book.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> A tome of thy tongue, gifted not as weapon, but as invitation. Curious.</p>
<p><em>Silence. SCP-9120-D takes the dictionary and closes her talon.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> … This pleases me. Few gifts have I been given, and fewer still without snare. Let this be the first page of our concord, inked not in oath, but in dialogue. Come again, Ethan Carter. I shall know when thou drawest near.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… I will. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D nods and lifts its claw again. A white flash occurs, and the camera is now focused on the landscape outside of SCP-9120-A. A second flash occurs a few moments later and Iota-Alpha and Iota-Bravo appear beside Dr. Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Iota-Bravo:</strong> Doc?! Jesus, what the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> It's… a long story.</p>
<p><strong>Iota-Alpha:</strong> You good?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter smiles faintly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Better than ever. I think I just made history.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9120-3:</strong> First formal interview with SCP-9120-D.</p>
<p>Following Dr. Carter's successful attempt at establishing peaceful dialogue with SCP-9120-D, he was directly approached by the Overseer Council and promoted to lead researcher for the SCP-9120 containment project shortly afterward. His first directive in this new position was to conduct a formal, recorded interview with SCP-9120-D to obtain more information about it and its associated phenomena.</p>
<p>Although a security detail had been assigned to Dr. Carter for his protection when entering SCP-9120-A given his position and clearance, he insisted on conducting the interview alone, without the presence of bodyguards. His reasoning for this was SCP-9120-D's evident distaste for Foundation personnel, and the belief that any security detail would be severely ineffective should a confrontation indeed occur.</p>
<p>Dr. Carter's request to conduct the interview alone was approved two days later, following some consideration by the Council. The document attached below is a transcript of the interview in question.</p>

<p><em>The camera activates. Dr. Carter stands approximately five meters from SCP-9120-A. He adjusts the camera, which trembles slightly as he steadies it. Indistinct mumbling is audible in the background.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> O…kay. Command, I'm going in.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Understood. Oh and, Carter, just so you know, you can still call in a task force if you're not feeling up for it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> What? No, I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine. I can do this. I'm just… excited, is all.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Very well. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter steps toward SCP-9120-A and stops directly in front of it. He takes a deep breath, exhales slowly, then squares his shoulders.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><em>He steps forward and passes through SCP-9120-A. The video distorts briefly before stabilizing, capturing the landscape of SCP-9120-B. The weather is overcast; soft ambient light filters through the trees at odd angles.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter stumbles on landing but quickly regains his balance, rubbing the side of his head. He adjusts the strap of his satchel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Alright, no turning back now.</p>
<p><em>He begins walking down the path toward SCP-9120-C, his notebook tucked under one arm. The forest is quiet save for distant birdsong and the crunch of leaves beneath his boots. After roughly fifteen minutes, the glade opens before him. SCP-9120-C looms ahead as mist curls lazily around its ivy-covered towers.</em></p>
<p><em>A low rush of wind sweeps through the clearing. Dr. Carter glances upward, shielding his eyes. SCP-9120-D descends from above, landing in front of him with a heavy thud that shakes the ground. Her scales shimmer faintly in the soft light as she folds her wings back against her sides.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D opens her eyes and fixes them on Dr. Carter. She swings her head once to scan the clearing before returning her gaze to him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You have returned, Ethan Carter. Yet you are alone. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> W-Well, I thought it was for the best. Last time, my companions unsettled you. I wanted this meeting to be without distractions, you know? Just you and me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Wise, that choice. I have no intentions to harm those of your kind, but their presence is most unwelcome here.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D tilts her head, her gaze flicking briefly to the notebook tucked in Dr. Carter’s arm.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And what have you brought there? Some manner of spell-book?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, uh… no. This is just to take notes. Helps me keep track of our conversations, so I don’t forget anything important.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D’s eyes narrow faintly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hm. I still recall your gift from our last encounter. It truly is astounding how much your kind has advanced since I last visited your realm. Such a small world filled with such strange devices… it is almost amusing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Do you have anything specific in mind?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Aye, these… "aeroplanes." Vessels used by men to soar through the skies. They are… fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, right. I suppose a plane would be odd to a dragon. We— humanity I mean, we have been flying for decades now. They can cross oceans in mere hours.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D exhales slowly, a faint curl of smoke escapes from her nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> The thought remains strange to me. For all my years, the skies belonged to dragonkind, but now… they are claimed by your kind’s strange metal shells. Tell me, do they crowd the heavens as ships do the sea?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well… in some places. Air travel is pretty common.</p>
<p><em>Silence. SCP-9120-D lets out a faint laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Your kind has come a long way, Ethan Carter. Truth be told, I am impressed. You may be small, but you pack a great many surprises. Maybe even…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Even…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Ah, forget it. I tend to get lost in my own thoughts. Now, I assume that you are not here just for small talk, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Correct. I would love to continue this conversation, but there are some things I do have to ask you. So, uh, I hope you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Ah, questions is it? Hm.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Very well, but how about a little game? You will ask a question and I shall answer it. In exchange, I will ask a question and you will have to answer it. I have doubts of my own regarding you and your Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> A trade? That… alright, that seems fair. I'll begin.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Speak, then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Alright, how about something simple first, like your name? We have a title for you… sort of, but I figured it would be less awkward if we were both on a first-name basis.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> My name? What a… complicated question indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Hmm? How so?</p>
<p><em>Silence. SCP-9120-D exhales through her nostrils and lowers her head slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I have a name, but it is not <em>my</em> name. It was forced upon me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Then… what's your real name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I… do not know. I am unable to remember it. I am keenly aware that the name I have now is not the name I was given when I hatched, but my true name always eludes me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, Um… I'm sorry, I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You have nothing to be sorry for, Ethan Carter. It was a long time ago, and, in truth, I have grown accustomed to this fact. Besides, I feel as though I may be eluding your inquiry, and that is most unbecoming of me. You may call me Zylià.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zylià… okay, Zylià, that's a nice name. Now, what is—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Aye, now it is my turn, Ethan Carter. You have asked of my name, and so I shall ask something of you. Why do you, a man of learning, risk your life by coming here alone? And please do be honest. Surely it cannot be to sate someone else’s curiosity.</p>
<p><em>Pause. Dr. Carter looks down at his notebook, thumb brushing its edge, then looks back up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Because… well, this may sound sappy, but this matters to me, a lot. Meeting an actual, flesh-and-blood dragon has been one of my dreams ever since I learned of your kind's existence as a child, and I… I believe understanding you, your history, and your nature could change how we see the world for the better. And if I came with soldiers or an escort, I think it would undermine what I'm trying to accomplish.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D flicks her tail once against the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> It is strange to hear such flattering words from someone like you, but I can tell that you are being genuine.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Very well, your answer satisfies me. What question do you wish to pose now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well, this place.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter gestures at the surroundings with his free hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Did you make it? If so, why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> This forest? Hm… a fair question. No, I did not spawn these woods from nothing, nor the stone tower. These are all creations of the mad queen and her servants. I am merely here to make sure that they remain forgotten, though as it turns out, it seems I have failed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> The mad queen?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Ah-ah-ah, you have asked your question and I have answered it. It is my turn now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Right, right, of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> This Foundation you work for, why is it so interested in me and this forest?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That… hm, that’s a bit complicated. As you probably know, we humans are fragile beings—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D chuckles for a few seconds, though it quickly turns into full-blown laughter. After a few seconds, she strikes the ground with her tail and regains her composure.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Yes, you are. Please, do continue.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Uh… right. Since we are fragile, we try to understand, contain, or at least keep an eye on anything that might harm us. You, this forest, everything here… is ancient, unpredictable, and most of all, not understood. That frightens people. That’s why the Foundation has been pestering you for the past three years, but I don’t believe fear should be our only response in this case.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D huffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Perhaps it should be. Neither you, nor your Foundation, truly know of the danger that this forest…</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lifts a claw and gestures at SCP-9120-C.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …and that foul, detestable thing hide.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You… say that, but that's even more of a reason why we should be here. We fight better when we know what we're dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I am afraid that this place does not hold a battle that your Foundation or your kind can win.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Then what does it hold?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Secrets. Wounds carved into the marrow of the world. A monster too vile even for memory, one that is best left buried lest it wake again.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter straightens his posture and clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zylià, with respect, that sounds like the kind of answer meant to scare children from wandering where they shouldn’t. But I don’t think you’d waste words like that. So… what exactly is this “thing” you’re guarding?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D narrows her eyes and lets out a cloud of smoke from her nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You press hard upon boundaries, Ethan Carter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You said we were trading answers. If I’ve gone too far, I’ll accept that. But you must understand: if something truly dangerous is here, then us not knowing makes it worse.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hm. Perhaps you are not as blind as I feared. Very well… a morsel only. The tower is both a fortress and a tomb; it is a forgotten monument to all of the fae’s sins.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Wait, the fae? Tomb? What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That, Ethan Carter, is a riddle you will have to solve on your own.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter swallows, opens his notebook and begins writing on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Your turn, then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Indeed. Tell me truthfully, when you return to your masters, what will you write of me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You heard me plain, Ethan Carter. Will you paint me as a beast to be chained, or as one to be feared? Or perhaps as just another curiosity for your scholars to bicker over?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… don't know. I guess I'll just write the truth.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And what is this truth you speak of?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That you’re not a monster. That you’re intelligent, compassionate even. That you’re—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D interrupts him with a soft scoff.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Careful, little human. Flattery is a poor armor in this place.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I mean it. I’ll write that you’re someone worth listening to, worth treating with respect. Because you are.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D stares at him for several seconds, her expression unreadable. Finally, she exhales, and a warm gust of wind ruffles Carter’s coat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hm. We shall see, little scholar. We shall see. Regardless, let us continue, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yes— wait, actually no.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I mean, still have some things to ask, but I think… I think I have something more important in my hands right now. I should… I'm sorry, Zyliá, but I think I'll have to cut this interview short.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D tilts her head, blinking once.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You would end our discussion so soon? Strange… you seemed so thrilled to speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I was— I <em>am</em>, truly. But that fae comment was a curveball. If they are connected to this, then the situation just… got a lot more serious.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her body and lays on the ground, exhaling softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Very well, Ethan Carter. End your questioning for now if you must. I suppose there will always be another day to continue our talk.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Is… that an invitation for me to come back?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D tilts her head to the side.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I think… I think that was exactly what it sounded like.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You would be correct. In truth, I would not mind another voice in these forsaken woods. Though I have to wonder, is your kind as clueless as you are?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …no, no. I'm just… I'm not the best at picking up these things. And thank you, Zylià, this means more than I can really put into words.</p>
<p><em>A faint smile forms along the snout of SCP-9120-D.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Go now, little scholar. Carry your truths back to your masters.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Right. I have the feeling that we'll see each other sooner than we both expect.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Information:</strong> Nexus-001, otherwise known as <em>The Wanderer's Library</em>, refers to a massive, non-Euclidean, extradimensional location connected to a currently unknown — although believed to be infinite — number of universes, timelines, and planes of existence.</p>
<p>As its name indicates, Nexus-001 takes the form of a traditional library. It serves as a vast repository of knowledge, mundane or otherwise, across all known academic fields. It is often visited by anomalous and non-human beings as a safe haven from anomalous management organizations such as the Foundation, the Allied Occult Initiative (prior to its transition into the UNGOC), and Pentagram, among others, since these types of anomalous organizations (anorgs) are banned from entering the Library. For this very reason, Nexus-001 serves as the base of operations for GoI-014 ("The Serpent's Hand").</p>
<p>The Foundation has been aware of Nexus-001 since its founding in 1880, through knowledge passed down from predecessor organizations. Multiple containment attempts have been made on Nexus-001, but none have thus far been successful.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Immediately following the conclusion of the above interview and the in-depth analysis of the footage recorded by Dr. Carter's personal camera, an investigation was formally launched to verify SCP-9120-D's claim of fae association. However, this task proved to be far more difficult than initially anticipated, given the small number of known fae enclaves and communities, and the Foundation's lack of significant presence within them due to the largely antagonistic relationship between the fae and the Foundation.</p>
<p>As a result of this, Mobile Task Force Sigma-3 ("Bibliographers") was assigned with the task of infiltrating Nexus-001 ("The Wanderer's Library") by any means necessary and retrieving any relevant cultural, historical, and/or religious documentation pertaining to the fae present therein. The mission was conducted on 21/02/1978 and completed one day later, on 22/02/1978. It was generally considered a success, although one operative of Sigma-3 went MIA during extraction.</p>
<p>The analysis of the retrieved material was conducted by personnel from the Parahistory Department on Area-400 grounds, and revealed considerable insight on the SCP-9120 phenomena. The following is an excerpt from an internal research paper published by Parahistorian Flora Levasseur on fae history.</p>

<hr/>
<p>[…] Recently discovered documents, once examined in detail, reveal a surprisingly coherent narrative of fae history. While much of it is framed in allegorical language and purple prose, the outlines of a linear sequence of events can still be discerned.</p>
<p>According to these texts, the fae were not always a united people. For centuries, perhaps millennia, they existed as scattered tribes and clans inhabiting woodlands and valleys. Their society was heavily fractured, and rivalries between clans frequently flared into open conflict. It is in this context that the two most important figures in fae history emerged: Aurora and Mab.</p>
<p>The sisters, if indeed they were sisters in the literal sense, are described in every account as beings of near-unprecedented thaumaturgical and ontokinetic talent. They unified nearby tribes using their abilities and rapidly expanded their dominion, eventually forging what came to be known as The High Courts: the first and only fae empire.</p>
<p>Although details of the structure of the Courts are scarce, it can be inferred from available evidence that they were a highly stratified feudal society composed of nobles, warriors, artisans and servitors that not only disciplined its own people, but also subjugated other civilizations. Among their vassals were the various species of the order <em>Draconiformes</em> — Western dragons (<em>Draconis ignis</em>), Eastern dragons (<em>Draconis serpentis</em>), and Wyverns (<em>Draconis ferox</em>), as classified by our friends at the Dragonology Department — all of which, along with their subspecies, have since disappeared from the Earth.</p>
<p>[…] Perhaps the most remarkable accounts concern Mab’s personal domain. According to multiple fae epics, Mab, the younger but more assertive of the sisters, grew infatuated with a particular stretch of woodland in what is believed to be southern Warwickshire. Dissatisfied with leaving it behind when her itinerant court travelled abroad, she simply tore it from its natural location and embedded it within her personal pocket universe. At its centre, she established a fortified palace constructed in part by fae artisans and in part through her own direct manipulation of reality.</p>
<p>It is here, too, that the figure of the dragon first enters written record. These texts describe Mab summoning, binding, or befriending a female draconic entity to serve as guardian of her castle. She was to stand guard at the threshold of Mab’s personal domain, deterring challengers and lending both might and majesty to the Queen’s household. Some accounts portray the dragon as little more than a servant; others emphasize her as a trusted companion, even a confidante.</p>
<p>[…] The eventual collapse of the empire is less clearly documented. All sources agree on a catastrophic civil conflict between Mab and Aurora, yet the exact cause, details and events that transpired during said conflict are poorly understood. Nevertheless, many accounts conclude with the two sisters buried together beneath Mab’s palace.</p>
<p>In the end, the fae empire came to an end the same way it began: defined by the will of its two rulers.</p>

</div>
<p>After the assertion made by SCP-9120-D was adequately corroborated, given the presence of explicit references to itself, SCP-9120-B, and SCP-9120-C in the recovered fae texts, the SCP-9120 containment project was given full attention by the Foundation's higher chain of command, and Area-400 was formally overhauled. Additional funding and personnel were allocated, and two new sections were established: the Parahistory Wing and the Thaumatology Wing.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, Containment Area-400 was redesignated as Parahistorical and Thaumatological Research Area-400, becoming the de facto facility for fae-related research in the United Kingdom, and the second largest facility for fae-related matters worldwide.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9120-5:</strong> Second interview with SCP-9120-D.</p>
<p>The following interview occurred one week after the operation conducted by Mobile Task Force Sigma-3 and during the reforms to Area-400.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 29/01/1978</p>
<p><strong>Interviever:</strong> Dr. Ethan Carter</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-9120-D</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[IRRELEVANT INFORMATION OMITTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You humans are curious creatures indeed. You said that we would meet again sooner than expected, yet here you are, far later than I anticipated. Tell me, was such a blatant contradiction an intentional act, hm?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> No, no, it wasn’t, sorry. My people have been busy lately with some work-related matters. But you invited me back here, so here I am.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D snorts softly, smoke rises from her nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Very well. I will forgive the delay, just this once.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter shifts his posture, one hand tightening around his notebook.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> T-Thank you, Zylià.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her head slightly, her eyes narrowing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You still stammer like a boy in the maws of a hungry beast, even though you have stood in my presence multiple times already. Do I still unnerve you?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter chuckles, then coughs into his fist and clears his throat before answering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’m not unnerved, it’s just… I’m as fascinated by you now as I was when I first saw you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Fascinated? That is an interesting choice of word. Tell me, little scholar, what is it that captivates you? Is it my form? My wings? My scales? My stature, perhaps? Or is it my mind you hope to dissect?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I…</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter glances down at his notes, then back up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Honestly? Just… all of you, really. You’re remarkable in ways I can barely put into words.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lets out an amused chuckle.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Oh, you <em>are</em> a flatterer after all. I will tell you this, Ethan Carter: play your cards right and, perhaps, I may keep you around for my amusement.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, I'll— …excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You are excused.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her head towards Dr. Carter. Dr. Carter shifts his weight but maintains eye contact.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> But enough games. Tell me, have you figured out my riddle yet?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Riddle? You mean the— your comment about the fae?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That very same.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yes, I think I have— er, <em>we</em> have, it was a team effort, a big one at that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Was it now?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter scratches the side of his temple with his pen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah. That's also kind of the reason why I took so long to get back here— again sorry about that. It was an… enlightening journey, if long, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Enlightening, you say? Then you must indulge me, Ethan Carter. What, pray, did you and your colleagues learn?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well, to put it simply, we’ve been digging into the origins of the fae. From what we’ve gathered so far, they were ruled by two powerful sisters who built a vast empire that controlled nearly the entire planet. Apparently, one of the sisters took a liking to a particular land, so she tore it away and made it her own, which explains…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter gestures at their surroundings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …this place. She then decided to make her castle at its center, which explains…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter extends an arm towards the direction of SCP-9120-C.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …that. And she appointed a draconic familiar to guard both, which explains, well, you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D tilts her head slightly. She does not speak or blink for several seconds. Her pupils constrict to slits.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> A… familiar?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Uh, right, sorry. You must not know that word. Think of it like a trusted third party, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Trusted? Familiar? <em>Pet</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I didn’t mean it like that, Zylià. That’s simply what the material we studied suggested—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> The "material you studied"… are falsehoods. Tell me, do you look at me and see some gilded hound chained to Mab’s gates?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> No, of course not, I—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D snaps her jaw shut and thrusts her head close to Dr. Carter. He flinches and takes an involuntary step back.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Then speak carefully, Ethan Carter. Words carry power here.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter swallows and nods; his hands tremble at his sides. After several seconds of silence, SCP-9120-D blinks slowly and exhales, retreating to her original posture.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …more power than you can imagine.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I… I am most sorry, little scholar. Even though these wounds are old, they still feel fresh to me. Please do forgive me for my outburst.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> N-No, no, it’s fine really. There’s nothing to forgive. If anything, it’s my fault, I shouldn’t have spoken so carelessly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Carelessly? No, you spoke with the knowledge you were given, nothing more. You did not know that those words were poison before they ever reached your ears.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D breathes out again. Smoke drifts from her snout.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> But when one has experienced the things I have, for as long as I have had to, even small things can prod at wounds I thought had healed.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Then, the histories we’ve been studying… they’re lies?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Lies? They are vile fabrications. Tales meant to deceive those unaware of the truth. My kind were never Mab’s servants, nor her familiars, nor her pets. We were her rivals.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Rivals?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D</strong>: Yes. When the fae were still tribes squabbling in their groves, we already had the means to reach for the stars above. We were older and wiser than them. We were builders who bent metal to our will, dreamers who raised citadels that touched the clouds; we were masters of our own flame.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You’re— wait, dragons were technologically advanced?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Indeed we were… once. And to Mab, that was an unforgivable humiliation. To her, the fae were destined to rule all that existed. She never saw us as anything more than scaled vermin that dared to challenge our place in the world.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And so, she waged war upon us. She and her sister brought with them armies of fae soldiers and abominations wrought by their sorcery. My kind fought bravely, but… in the end, their magic gnawed at us like a cancer. Cities were razed, eggs were shattered, whole bloodlines extinguished. Some of us were shackled, others fled to a refuge beyond this world, but I…</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D falters. Her wings shift uneasily.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I remained, but it was not by choice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You were enslaved?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Along with everyone else who bowed down to her. We were paraded as ornaments and forced to wear her banners on our backs.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D turns her gaze toward SCP-9120-C.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That fortress? It is not merely the work of the fae. Its foundations were laid by the labor of my kind. We were made to build it as a mockery of our suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That’s… horrific. I’m sorry, Zylià. I… I can’t imagine how that must have felt.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Correct, you cannot.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter takes a deep breath and adjusts his glasses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> If I may, how did you survive?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Survive? I… survival is not the right word. That implies a struggle met with triumph, but that is not what happened. I endured her constant humiliations and abuses, because if I did not, then I would be handing her the victory she desired most.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D leans back, her gaze drifting toward the horizon.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And I will not let that happen. Not while I yet draw breath.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter lowers his eyes. His pen trembles between his fingers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Why you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Why did Mab choose you to be her personal servant, specifically?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …You must understand that I was not some nameless wyrm, Ethan Carter. I was—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D pauses. Her nostrils flare. Several seconds of silence follow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You were important among your kind.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D nods once.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I was heir apparent for one of the three Kairon; a princess, so to speak. For that, Mab made a point of breaking me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …I don’t even know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> There is nothing you can say. Pity does not unmake the past.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Maybe not… but I think there is something I can say.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D turns back toward Dr. Carter. Her eyes narrow slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zyliá, I know my people made a terrible first impression, and probably continued to do so for three more years. I know you don’t have the best opinion of us, and I understand that, but… but we’re not all cut from the same cloth. The Foundation isn’t like Mab. We’re not here to put you in chains, or erase your past. In a way, you could say we want to preserve it.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D snorts softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Preserve? You speak as though I am a jar upon a shelf, to be catalogued and admired.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That’s not what I mean. I mean… I want— <em>we</em> want to make sure your experiences and your people aren’t erased. Even if they only survive in our records or our database, they will survive.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do you think that is enough to honor the dead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> No, not truly, but it’s a start. And sometimes a start is all history ever gets.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D studies Dr. Carter in silence. The tension lingers until she exhales, releasing a long plume of smoke.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hm. Perhaps there is some truth to your words after all.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Thank you for trusting me with this, Zylià. I know it can’t be easy to reopen old wounds like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And you would be correct. But it is nice to have someone interested in hearing my stories, even if it is painful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’d like to hear more. But I also know that I’m only one man. I can listen and write things down, but I can’t do your story justice on my own.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You mean to bring others?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yes, people far more skilled than me. Historians, analysts, thaumaturges — people who can help us understand, preserve, and maybe even give your people the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> More humans? In my domain? More eyes, more hands… you are reckless, Ethan Carter. Reckless… but perhaps not entirely wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t believe it mattered. Your people deserve better than silence. And I think you deserve better than loneliness.</p>
<p><em>Pause. SCP-9120-D breaks the silence with a low chuckle.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Aren't you a sentimental fool… very well, you may bring in “others,” but I will not tolerate weapons, or cages, or demands. You may prod at the forest and the animals, but the fortress is… 'off limits', so to speak. Should you or they forget this, I will make sure to remind you, and you will not enjoy how.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter nods quickly and smiles nervously.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Understood. I’ll make sure they know. Thank you, Zylià. I promise we won’t waste this chance.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log.&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The information gained from SCP-9120-D after the completion of this interview caused significant turmoil among Foundation parahistorians and high-ranking administrative personnel who were aware of the anomaly's existence, as its version of events clashed heavily with commonly accepted accounts of fae history in the anomalous community at large and painted a radically different picture of it.</p>
<p>As a direct result of this, all Foundation efforts at reconstructing and laying out a clear timeline of fae history were halted, and the Overseer Council ordered a closer examination of all relevant material pertaining to fae history in Foundation possession. This effort is still ongoing to this day, with multiple discrepancies among various sources having already been found that lend credence to SCP-9120-D's version of the story.</p>
<p>Consequently, a major reexamination of containment procedures for fae-related anomalies, as well as the Foundation’s overall approach towards fae communities, is being carried out, pending an Overseer Council decision on the matter.</p>

<td>A large heron-like bird with two pairs of wings: one primary set for flight, and a smaller secondary set for balance and maneuvering. They are a ground-nesting species.</td>
<td>"Even after all this time, I still fail to see the point of adding an extra pair of wings; as I said however, Mab was always eccentric. Oh, and please, do not step on them."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Forest Dragon (<em>Draco Sylvestris</em>)</td>
<td>Small reptiles with membranous wings resembling those of bats. Despite their appearance, they are in no way related to SCP-9120-D.</td>
<td>"These were made as a mockery of me and my people… though, truth be told, I have grown fond of the little critters over the years. Seeing them hunt makes me nostalgic for events long past."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>)</td>
<td>Non-anomalous specimens present throughout SCP-9120-B. Often noted scavenging near SCP-9120-C.</td>
<td>"I do not like them. Do not let their soft facade deceive you; the little ones are cunning."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stagtrap (<em>Dionaea sylvatica</em>)</td>
<td>A large carnivorous plant resembling a Venus flytrap. Unlike terrestrial flytraps, the Stagtrap actively stalks prey by slowly uprooting and dragging itself through short distances with tendril-like appendages.</td>
<td>"Surprisingly, Mab was not responsible for these. The sister was just as eccentric, just in her own, unique way. They are sneakier than they first appear."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Blue Cap (<em>Mycena caerulus</em>)</td>
<td>A species of small, pale-blue mushroom resembling common bonnet fungi. Ingestion produces immediate and potent hallucinogenic and calming effects.</td>
<td>"Ah… these… they are, <em>ahem</em>, they have made my stay in this forest more bearable, shall I say."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cupswort (<em>Planta colligens</em>)</td>
<td>A small herbaceous plant with cup-shaped leaves that collect dew. Unremarkable aside from the fact that it does not exist in baseline reality.</td>
<td>"The poet named them."</td>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17/02/1978</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Ethan Carter</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-9120-D</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[IRRELEVANT INFORMATION OMITTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Hi Zylià. Someone told me you wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That I did, Ethan Carter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, uh, alright. I'm all ears.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter shifts his weight, clearing his throat as he adjusts the strap of his field bag.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Indeed, everything is. I am… merely thinking on how to best convey my thoughts</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Huh, okay. Take all the time you need. I have nothing else to do right now, so I've got plenty of it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hmm.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D glares at Dr. Carter. Her tail, which had been lying slack on the ground, coils in on itself. She draws in a slow breath, her eyes closing as her chest rises. After a few seconds, she finally exhales in a low hiss.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I have been watching your fellow scholars, Ethan Carter. They scuttle about these woods like ants, poking at leaves, plucking mushrooms, chasing after foxes with nets.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That’s… pretty much what biologists do, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hmph. Ants, every one of them. Though, even still, they are not how I envisioned them to be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D opens her snout slightly, pulling in a breath, but remains silent and her gaze becomes fixed on the horizon.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> They write, and draw, and whisper to each other with enthusiasm, as though every little bug is a jewel, much like you were when we first met. I… I thought that—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You thought that you were going to have a confrontation?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You are perspicacious, I will admit that much.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Sounds to me like you're pleasantly surprised by us. Is that what you wanted to tell me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D pauses. Her eyes narrow, the tip of her tail flickers against the soil.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> "Perhaps"? That’s all I get?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do not grow smug, little scholar. I am merely saying that, compared to what I have known, your people are… less insufferable.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hmph. You humans always cling to the smallest victories.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well, a dragon admitting that we're maybe not so bad counts as much more than a small victory for me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do not let it go to your head or I may rescind the sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Fair enough. I’ll try not to let it go to my head.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> See that you don’t.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter reaches toward the recorder, fingers brushing the switch, then stops midway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Wait, actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while now, but I never really had the chance.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D tilts her head slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Speak, then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Do… you happen to know someone by the name of William Shakespeare?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D’s eyes narrow and her expression becomes unreadable.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I know the name, yes. Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Well, uh… it’s just that his works and private notes, some of them at least, make some really specific references to things that sound a lot like this place and, well, you. We haven't figured out how someone from his time could’ve known any of it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> <em>Hs'aless.</em> Yes, we crossed paths quite often a long time ago. He was an odd human, and one of the most interesting companions I have had in my long existence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh…</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …What was he like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Oh, he was insufferably curious, much like you are, Ethan Carter. He wanted to know everything there was about me and my history. We spent several days and nights in each other’s company, exploring every subject he dared bring forth, and some he did not. He had a way of prying past my scales, in more ways than one. It was…</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D sighs softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …It was a nice change of pace from the loneliness I have grown so accustomed to, I must say.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Sounds like he really left an impression on you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That he did. He was quick-witted, sharp of tongue, and not easily cowed. He had a way with words unlike any other human I have met.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That… sounds about right, yeah. His works are still regarded as some of the greatest ever written in human history.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And for good reason. I am sure that he would be held in the same regard had he been a dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That’s a thought. Erh, anyways, thank you for telling me. It’s… strangely comforting, knowing he was here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do not thank me, little scholar. I share this only because you asked in earnest.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9120-8:</strong> Incident 9120-Alpha.</p>
<p>On 10/05/1978, all Foundation personnel located within SCP-9120-B were forcibly spatially reallocated outside of it by SCP-9120-D. Three minutes afterward, a violent thaumic discharge, similar to the one originally detected by MI13 satellites in 1975, occurred within SCP-9120-B, with a portion of the energy leaking through SCP-9120-A and into baseline reality.</p>
<p>Although the energy was contained through the rapid activation of multiple Lonsdale Thaumaturgic Inhibition Field Generators present within Area-400, likely preventing the occurrence of a catastrophic CK-Class ("Reality Restructuring") event in the premises of Area-400, the discharge was believed to have greatly destabilized the interior of SCP-9120-B. Therefore, entry into it was denied by Area Command until entry was deemed safe by on-site thaumaturgists.</p>
<p>On 11/05/1978, Dr. Ethan Carter broke protocol and disobeyed this order by entering SCP-9120-B on his own, without gaining permission from Director Lucas Walker. The following footage was taken by Dr. Carter's personal camera.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident Log.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/05/1978</p>
<p><strong>Personnel Involved:</strong> Dr. Ethan Carter</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This footage was obtained following Dr. Carter's apprehension by Area-400's on-site security personnel after his return to baseline reality.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>The camera feed activates. Heavy static and distortion flickers over the feed for several seconds before stabilizing. Once the camera has stabilized, the forest becomes visible, but it is noticeably unstable: foliage rustles despite the lack of wind, shadows are cast in the wrong directions, and several animals can be seen floating mid-air before snapping back to normal.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter raises the camera toward his face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Alright… alright. I know this was a terrible idea. If I don’t make it out and anyone finds this— I couldn’t just sit there while she’s in here, alone.</p>
<p><em>Carter begins moving down the path that leads to SCP-9120-C. The audio lags and records his footsteps out of sync with the movements of his body. A large boulder rotates several centimeters above the ground before dropping back down with a dull thud. Tree trunks appear to "melt" into each other, before snapping back into separate forms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Christ, I hope this isn't permanent—</p>
<p><em>A fox emerges suddenly from the soil in front of Carter, startling him and causing him to stumble and fall. His descent is slowed down dramatically, and it takes ~5 seconds for his body to impact the ground. Carter groans, stands, and brushes off soil from his clothes.</em></p>
<p><em>He adjusts the camera slightly, and SCP-9120-C becomes visible in the distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> There you are.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter begins to walk towards SCP-9120-C. The feed distorts again, and the colors of the image invert for three seconds as Carter nears the structure.</em></p>
<p><em>A sudden gust of wind bursts from behind him, and SCP-9120-D speaks out of frame.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do <em>not</em> enter.</p>
<p>Carter spins around. SCP-9120-D stands behind him, eyes burning with violet phosphorescence</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter spins around. SCP-9120-D stands behind him. She snarls and her eyes burn with violet, phosphorescent light. She then begins to slowly walk toward Dr. Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> What are you doing here, Carter?! Are you blind the danger surrounding you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zyliá! I— I came to check on you, to see if you were fine. After yesterday we were told not to enter until—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And you should have listened, you foolish human! Do you not value your own life? Hmm? Is that it? Do you… do you perhaps…</p>
<p><em>Her voice cracks, and she stops. The violet light in her eyes dims, her head lowers, and she lets out a long exhale.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Why did you come, Ethan Carter? Do you seek the glory of being the one to document this? Or is it simple curiosity that eats at your insides like maggots at meat?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> What? Neither of those, Zylià. I had to know you were fine here. I couldn’t just let you be alone, not after everything that’s happened.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Alone. Yes. I have been alone for longer than you could possibly imagine. You speak of not leaving me, yet, do you think that I wished for companions?</p>
<p><em>Pause. She sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Just… just leave. This load is mine alone to bear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Load?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do you believe that what is occurring in this forest is accidental? No, that's <em>her</em> meddling. That's <em>her</em> trying to reach from beyond her prison.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Her? You mean, Mab? But how? I thought you said she was dead?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Oh, you ignorant human. Do you truly believe that something as simple as death is enough to hold someone like Mab back for long?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> W-Well, even reality warpers do tend to stay dead after they're killed, no matter how skilled or powerful they are.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Once again, you prove my worries about you and your Foundation correct, Ethan Carter. Mab and her sister were not just mere "reality warpers," as your people call them. They were something else. And I so believe that they knew that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, uh… you know what a reality warper is?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D looks at Dr. Carter and slowly squints her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do you truly believe that humanity is the only species that has have to deal with the unexplained?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> N-No, not at all, I just… I…</p>
<p><em>Pause. Dr. Carter shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …That's not important right now. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, how is Mab causing this? What do you mean by her and Aurora being "something else"?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her gaze to the ground. Her claws dig into the soil as the reality around them both fractures further.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You will see.</p>
<p><em>Before Dr. Carter can respond, the feed is covered by a flash of violet light. Neither the forest or SCP-9120-C are visible anymore. When the light vanishes, the feed resumes in a vast, dim cavern. His breath creates fog in the air. Phosphorescent moss adorns the walls, appearing almost as stars in the night sky.</em></p>
<p><em>The camera trembles in his hands. At the far end of the cavern sits an enormous interlocking rune carved directly into the rock, glowing faintly with a pale blue light. The rock itself is scorched in places; jagged cracks run through the rune.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> What— what is this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> A wound carved in this world. One of many.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D moves past him. Her claws click against the stone and her wings brush the cavern walls as she lowers herself before the rune.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Did you make it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I did not. These were Aurora’s last mercy to this world. A system to bind Mab’s essence, to seal her hand from clawing back into reality.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter steps forward again, focusing on the damaged glyph.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> This… this is like nothing I’ve ever seen. I don’t even know what I’m looking at.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Of course you don't. The fae were masters of their craft. These shapes and symbols only make sense to whoever forged them.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D extends one claw and touches a cracked segment of the rune. A spark of blue light leaps from the stone to her scales. She flinches.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …They are unraveling. All of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> My duty has been to watch over these wards for centuries, to protect them. And in that time I’ve realized even these runes are not infallible. I have tried to mend them where I could… to no avail.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …And now the cracks spread, faster than ever. Threads of her power seep through as she reaches for this world, and one day… one day I fear that she will not have to reach at all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …That thought scares you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> It <em>terrifies</em> me. You know not what Mab is capable of, or how deep her sadism runs, but I do. I endured all her twisted machinations for years on end. Honestly, I… I…</p>
<p><em>Pause. She turns her head to him, her eyes look hollow and tired.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Tell me, little scholar, what will your Foundation do when the walls keeping Mab away fall, and she’s free to do as she pleases once more?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> We would fight. We'd fight until the end.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And if you fail?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Then we would keep fighting. If I had to choose a word to describe humanity, it would be, well, "stubborn."</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D exhales a low chuckle.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I suppose that makes two of us.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Her gaze returns to the symbol.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Carter, please, just leave. Return to your masters. Tell them to prepare for Mab’s arrival, and tell them to never set foot here again. You will find nothing but ruin in this damnable forest.</p>
<p><em>Silence. Dr. Carter takes a deep breath and cleara his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> No.</p>
<p><em>The head of SCP-9120-D turns to see Dr. Carter. Her pupils contract to thin slits in surprise.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …No?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I can't do that, Zylià, not like this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do you understand what I am—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I know. Trust me, I know what you’re doing, and I get it, okay? I know you think this is your responsibility, and that you have to deal with it on your own. But the truth is, you don't have to, not anymore. If this is as urgent as I think it is, then the Foundation would understand. We’d try to help you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D’s wings unfurl slightly, and she stands up once again, towering over Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Help me? Your kind meddles with things it does not understand. These glyphs are complex, and most of all, delicate. One wrong touch could undo everything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zylià, I know that you think that we're brutes, and..</p>
<p><em>Pause. SCP-9120-D snorts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Okay, yeah, I see why you’d think that. But my point is: there are people out there very knowledgeable about magic out there in the world. Maybe they could do something if they had the chance to see it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Could they fix them?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter is silent for a few seconds. He looks back at the damaged symbol, and then at SCP-9120-D again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… I cannot promise that, but I know they’ll at least try. You trusted me enough to tell me this. Trust me enough to help you. Please.</p>
<p><em>Silence. SCP-9120-D eventually exhales.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …You are impossibly reckless and stubborn, Ethan Carter…</p>
<p><em>She closes her eyes, wings folding tight against her back.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …But very well. You may bring whoever you think is relevant for this. Just… do not pretend I did not warn you if nothing comes of this, or if anything goes awry.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter lets out a slow, relieved breath and nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I understand, and… thank you, I will not disappoint you.</p>
<p><em>The image distorts once more, and the feed cuts to static.</em></p>

<p>Immediately after his return to baseline reality, Dr. Ethan Carter was apprehended by on-site security personnel and detained in his personal office until Director Walker was properly notified of the situation and briefed on it.</p>
<p>The following meeting was convened in closed session at Dr. Carter's office.</p>

<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> I'd like to say that I'm surprised, but my pants would instantly cause a forest fire if I did. If anything, I'm more surprised at the fact that it took you this long to get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I wouldn’t call it trouble. I’d call it… progress.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Progress. That’s what we’re calling breaking protocol, entering a forest that's quite literally falling apart, and making promises you aren't cleared to make to a dragon now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Okay, touche. But I got us Information we didn't have, right? Who knew about the wards and their importance? Sure, it was reckless on my part, but it did more good than harm.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> You're still not getting out of this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> But, you do make a fair point.</p>
<p><em>He leans back in his chair, and rubs his temples with one hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Still, you understand how this looks from my side of the desk, right? I'm going to feel the O5s' breathing in my neck for a while, and all the goddamn paperwork I'll have to go through because of this…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> A sorry isn’t going to cut it this time, Ethan. You’ve put yourself, and the rest of this project, on the line because of your little stunt.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I know. I’ll accept whatever sanction you think is fair.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> You sure will, but that'll have to wait. You have no idea how incredibly lucky you are that your little girlfriend will only talk to you. Otherwise you'd be the one explaining to the O5s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> She's not my—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> I don't care. My point is, I can't get rid of you just yet, not until someone analyzes… whatever the hell it was she showed you. Luckily, I happen to know a guy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Oh, that… that's good. Who?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> You'll see. That guy is… well, you'll see.</p>
<p><em>Director Walker stands up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> For now, you’re suspended from any kind of unsupervised field work. You’ll still have access to your recordings and notes, but you won’t set one foot inside that forest without my signature. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Crystal.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><em>Director Walker turns towards the door and begins walking towards it. He pauses as he places a hand on the doorknob.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Walker:</strong> Ethan, don’t mistake this for me not appreciating what you accomplished. Just don’t make me have to pull you out of another fire.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9120-9:</strong> Formation of ATF Theta-99.</p>
<p>Following the discovery of the complex thaumaturgical rune in SCP-9120-B by Dr. Carter, and the implication of there being more, Senior Researcher Dante Esparza — a veteran member of the Department of Applied Thaumatology — was transported to PTR Area-400 to give his professional judgement on the matter, per direct request of Director Lucas Walker. He was briefed on SCP-9120 documentation during his transfer from Site-91 (located in Yorkshire, England) to Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<p>After reviewing the footage, Researcher Esparza determined that it was severely difficult to give an opinion of the glyph given the state in which it was found. As such, an exploration mission with Dr. Carter and Researcher Esparza was conducted immediately after Esparza’s arrival to Area-400.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Exploration Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17/05/1978</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-9120</p>
<p><strong>Assigned Task Force:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Personnel Involved:</strong> Dr. Ethan Carter, Senior Researcher Dante Esparza</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>The video feed activates. Carter and Esparza stand in front of SCP-9120-A. Both are equipped with standard exploration gear. Esparza adjusts his jacket collar and gives a quick glance to the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Is this where the big, spooky door to dragonland is supposed to be? ’Cause I don’t see jack.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, it's there. It’s just invisible.</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> know, I’m just messing around. I read the file on the flight. Whole pocket dimension, dragon lady, magic runes older than dirt. Sounds like a fun weekend.</p>
<p><em>Carter gives him a side glance but doesn’t respond. Both men then step through the portal. The camera wavers, then stabilizes on the familiar treeline of SCP-9120-B. The forest stretches ahead, seemingly stabilized. It is dimly lit, with fog curling around the trees.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Not bad. Bit gloomy, though. Feels like it needs a couple neon signs, or at least a jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> This place isn’t a tourist attraction. It’s—</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> —a fragile extra-dimensional biosphere, yeah, yeah, I got the memo. Doesn’t mean the place couldn’t use some remodelling.</p>
<p><em>The two begin moving deeper into the woods. The sound of distant fauna echoes faintly. Esparza occasionally prods at plants with his boot or leans down to inspect fungi, scribbling notes in the process. Eventually, they pass in front of a Stagtrap, and Esparza pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Huh, the report wasn't bullshit, these things <em>are</em> freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I don't advice getting close to that.</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Oh, relax a bit, Carter, will you? I've got like a thousand safeguards on me. Eating me is not in this thing's best interest.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Ah… right.</p>
<p><em>The two follow the narrow trail toward the clearing. As the fog parts, SCP-9120-C comes into view.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Well, that’s not ominous at all. You sure this isn’t just a giant haunted house ride? Feels like if I knock on the door, I’ll get a free T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I have no idea. Nobody has entered it. She doesn’t allow anyone to get close. And speaking of, I wonder where she’s right now—</p>
<p><em>As if on cue, SCP-9120-D descends from the sky in front of both men, raising dirt and leaves. When the view clears, SCP-9120-D speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Ethan Carter. And… another one.</p>
<p><em>Sparza grins and steps forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Dante Esparza, at your service. Gotta say, you know how to make an entrance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And what justifies your presence here, Dante Esparza?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> He's the—</p>
<p><em>Esparza raises a hand and interrupts Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> No, I'll handle this myself, kid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> But—</p>
<p><em>Esparza coughs and clears his throat while glaring at Dr. Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> As he was trying to say, I’m a Thaumatologist. I heard you’ve got a problem with some runes around this place, and thought I’d lend a hand.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D snorts and turns her head towards Dr. Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> The jester is amusing, but tell me, Ethan Carter, do you vouch for this one?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… I do, I do. As extravagant as he is, you're hardly going to find someone more knowledgeable on magic than him. Or so I've been told, at least.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hmph. Knowledgeable, perhaps. Respectful… less so.</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Oh, I'm plenty respectful, I just like to speak my mind. And, I do believe that I'm here to do a job, so how about we get on with it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> That is something I can agree to.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her head until her eyes are level with Esparza. A gust of warm air escapes her nostrils.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Speak your request plainly, Dante Esparza.</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Sure thing. Now, the rune you showed Carter? Totally busted. It was cracked, half-erased, and bleeding energy all over the place. For me, it’d be like trying to fix a car engine when all you’ve got is the muffler. I’m going to have to see the real deal if I want to do something useful.</p>
<p><em>Pause. SCP-9120-D tilts her head to the side in slight confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Uh, he's trying to say that it wasn’t functional, and that he couldn’t make sense of it, so he needs access to a functioning rune to do anything.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D’s eyes narrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> You demand much for one so small. Do you think me a fool? That I would simply hand you one of the chains that keep Mab away?</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Look, lady, I’m not here to break your toys. But if you want to stop the wards that keep Mab dead from collapsing, I need to study one that’s intact. Otherwise, you’re wasting my time, your own, and Carter’s efforts to help you.</p>
<p><em>Pause. SCP-9120-D huffs and glares at Dr. Carter.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Do You see now why I find your species so… grating.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter gives her an awkward look.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Yeah, I get it. But, well, he <em>is</em> right. Without a working sigil, he can’t do anything. And if what you showed me is any indication, we’re running out of time.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D lowers her head, exhaling through her nostrils in a slow plume of smoke.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I swore none would enter that place. Its walls are heavy with memories I would rather not share.</p>
<p><em>Esparza shrugs, folding his arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Your call. But if another ward crumbles because you were too stubborn to let someone help, that’s entirely on you.</p>
<p><em>A rumbling growl echoes in SCP-9120's chest, though it turns into something closer to a sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …Very well. If it is what you need, I will grant you access to the fortress. To you, Dante Esparza, and to you, Ethan Carter.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter scoffs in disbelief.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You’re really letting us in?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Consider it a gesture, for you, Ethan Carter. You have spoken with me as no human has in centuries. If I must entrust this knowledge to anyone, let it be you and whoever you think should know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Thank you, Zylià. You don’t know how much this means to me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D nods, and she turns toward the doors of SCP-9120-C, her wings unfurling slightly as she begins to walk.</em></p>
<p><em>The camera moves from side to side as SCP-9120-D leads them toward the doors of SCP-9120-C. The great stone slabs part with a low, grinding sound before either of them touches them. A rush of cool air spills outward from within, and the two men follow.</em></p>
<p><em>The feed flickers the moment Carter and Esparza step through the doors. The image fractures into jagged green and purple streaks. The audio cuts in and out, capturing only distorted sounds of their footsteps and nonsensical fragments of words.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> […] whaf kind of — is — doing that?</p>
<p><em>The feed suddenly snaps back into focus. Carter and Esparza stand in the middle of an enormous dining hall. The ceiling towers above them, supported by smooth, carved columns of white stone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> What the hell?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D looks back at them.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Aurora entrusted the protection of this fortress to me, and gave me some of her power so I could fulfill that task. With it, I enchanted this palace so that every room would exchange positions with another whenever anyone went through any door, as a last defense should anything happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> That's… ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> And a pain in the ass to set up with just thaumaturgy alone. Which tells me that magic isn’t exactly what’s going on here.</p>
<p><em>The camera pans across the dining hall as Carter slowly turns around, muttering under his breath.</em></p>
<p><em>The room is enormous. The walls are covered in murals painted directly onto the stone: dragons locked in aerial combat, wielding and wearing strange devices; humanoid figures kneeling in supplication; and two crowned female figures of impossible size looming above both. From the ceiling hang hundreds of long, pale-blue crystal stalactites.</em></p>
<p><em>Dominating the center of the hall is a banquet table made of dark, polished wood, with approximately fifty seats arranged along its sides. Along the far wall, mounted like trophies, are bleached dragon bones: skulls, talons, and wing spines affixed to iron brackets. Several skulls exhibit fracturing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Well… ain't that morbid?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Zylià… are those—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> They are. Reminders.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter glances at her, but does not push further.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Right. So, uh, which door do we—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Any door will suffice. I will make sure that the next room is our destination.</p>
<p><em>Esparza glances around the room, eyeing all the doors present therein.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> …Eh. Dealer’s choice.</p>
<p><em>Without another word, SCP-9120-D walks to the nearest door and presses a single claw against it. She pushes it open effortlessly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Stay close to me.</p>
<p><em>Carter and Esparza exchange a quick look, then step after her.</em></p>
<p><em>The video feed distorts again. Static lines crawl across the image as the three figures cross the door. For several moments, only darkness is visible. When the feed clears, they are standing in a cavernous chamber. The only illumination comes from a single ward carved into the floor.</em></p>
<p><em>The symbol is large and precise. A pale-blue light radiates from it. The pattern consists of a double spiral enclosed within a lattice of angular runes, ringed by numerous smaller sigils.</em></p>
<p><em>Esparza steps forward slowly until he is just in front of the glowing spiral. He remains silent for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Not quite the reaction I was expecting, but the silence is much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Dante?</p>
<p><em>Esparza exhales.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> You know, Carter… I’ve been around a long time, alright? I've seen everything there is to see when it comes to thaumaturgy. Rites, rituals, and even the top-tier stuff the Daevites put together. But this? This is a different beast altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You mean you’ve never—</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Never. Not once has I seen anything close to this in my entire life. Either this was made by someone with an understanding of the craft so far beyond ours that I may as well be a caveman smearing ash on a wall… or it was scribbled by a child with crayons, and I can’t tell which option is correct.</p>
<p><em>He runs a hand through his hair, then lets out a short laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> It’s like staring at sheet music for an orchestra written in twelve languages at once. This is the type of thing that makes religions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Do you understand it?</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Understand it? I have no idea what the hell I’m looking at. I’ll need weeks, months, maybe, just to figure out where to even begin. But I’ll tell you what: this day just officially beat the day I got married. And that says a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> …Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> Dead serious. My wife was very pretty that day. Shame she turned out to be such a bitch, though.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9120-D scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Esparza:</strong> I feel like I'm a kid in goddamn candy land.</p>

<p>Following the exit of Dr. Carter and Researcher Esparza from SCP-9120-B, the latter paused his work on all other obligations and began studying the rune (now classified as SCP-9120-E-1) using the footage recorded by Dr. Carter as his primary source for research, and on drafting a project proposal for the Overseer Council.</p>
<p>The proposal was officially finished and submitted to the Overseer Council for consideration on 07/06/1978, and has been attached below.</p>
<div class="document">

<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following a direct examination of SCP-9120-E-1 within SCP-9120-C, I have concluded that, while the craftsmanship of the sigils that make up SCP-9120-E is impressive — if those additional sigils are of the same scope, of course — they suffer from a glaring problem: excessive thaumaturgical strain concentrated into single points of energy storage and transfer.</p>
<p>If my observations are correct, each sigil functions as both generator and anchor, resulting in a level of systemic stress that cannot be sustainably maintained over indefinite periods of time. If left unaddressed, this flaw will lead to the eventual structural failure of the sigils, which exponentially increases the probability of a catastrophic chain reaction, resulting in the uncontrolled breakdown of SCP-9120-E.</p>
<p>As previously documented, SCP-9120-E is the only barrier preventing the reemergence of EoI-001 (“Queen Mab”) into baseline reality. The consequences of SCP-9120-E being destroyed would therefore be catastrophic to both the Foundation and the world at large.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> I propose the development and installation of a supporting system of secondary, less complex runes designed to act as “pressure valves” of sorts. These secondary glyphs will be inscribed in concentric or adjacent placements surrounding the primary sigils, absorbing and redistributing excess thaumic load, thereby reducing wear on the primary seals and dramatically extending their operational lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to the unprecedented complexity of SCP-9120-E, the implementation of this project cannot be carried out by standard research personnel. It will necessitate a permanent unit of the Department of Applied Thaumatology to operate directly under the oversight of the SCP-9120 Containment Project Lead. For this, I propose the creation of an Applied Task Force that will work under the jurisdiction of Area-400. This Task Force would be composed entirely of trained thaumaturges and other personnel from the Department of Applied Thaumatology.</p>
</div>
<p>This proposal was unanimously approved by the Overseer Council, and was enacted accordingly under the supervision of PTR Area-400's administration, Dr. Ethan Carter, and SCP-9120-D over the course of two months.</p>
<p>Since the completion of Operation Backline on 12/08/1978, no further incidents regarding SCP-9120-E have occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Got your message, Zyliá. You wanted to talk?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I did, Ethan Carter. Sit.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carter lowers himself onto a flat, moss-covered stone. Zyliá sits on the ground, her wings folded tight, and her tail curled around her claws.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Alright. What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><em>Zyliá tilts her head, staring at him for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> …When first I heard of your Foundation, I imagined it as a great beast of iron and chains. A prison for all that does not fit within your world.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> It… well, it kind of is all things considered.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Hmph. I had thought I would despise it for that. That I would despise you one day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> A-And now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Now… well, the truth is, I don't. Even if your plan fails, and the sygils keep breaking, you have at least tried. You have given me reason to genuinely believe I am not alone in carrying this burden.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> I… thanks, Zyliá. But I'm just doing my job here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> Oh, you are one terrible liar, Ethan Carter. I'm certain that you have done more than your task required. You have listened to me and have treated me as an equal even when you feared me, and not as just a monster.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> Because you’re not. You’re— well, you’re you. That’s enough.</p>
<p><em>Zylià lowers her gaze, exhaling softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> It has been centuries since I have spoken with one I could call a… friend. Perhaps I judged too quickly. Perhaps your Foundation is not only of iron and chains. Perhaps it is also of voices willing to hear what others will not.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> We… try to. Some of us, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> And for that, Ethan Carter, I am thankful.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> I have been called many things—warden, monster, curse. Not once in all that time did I imagine that a human would come here and speak to me as you have again. I thought I would die alone with my duty.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carter:</strong> You’re not alone, Zyliá. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9120-D:</strong> No. Not anymore.</p>
