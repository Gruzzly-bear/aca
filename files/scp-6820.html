<p><span class="st">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-6820 is a highly-classified advanced eigenweapon located within <span class="bt">ANTIKILL Facility-A</span> (AKF-A), a subterranean facility beneath Secure Administration Site-01. This weapon is the culmination of <span class="bt">Project ANTIKILL</span>: a high-priority operation conducted with the express purpose of "irreversible, universal neutralization of [SCP-6820-A]."</p>
<p>The project was initiated in January 1968, and operated continuously until the activation of SCP-6820 on 2021/08/05, whereupon a <span class="bt">CK-Class</span> ("Reality-Restructuring") Event retroactively erased SCP-6820-A and its Nöospheric content from consensus existence. SCP-6820 has remained operational since; preliminary investigation thus far presents no clear method of deactivation.</p>
<p>SCP-6820-A was an object, entity, phenomenon or other item, Anomalous or otherwise, successfully neutralized from existence via completion and activation of SCP-6820. The only extant record of its conceptual reduction is likely stored, inaccessibly, within SCP-6820. Research is ongoing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;The four are seated at a black desk within Site-19's administrative offices.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> — and you didn't think to notify the scheduling algorithm? I'm sure you're aware I have other projects to oversee.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> My apologies, Advisor. It was only a few hours ago that the idea was proposed.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> Respectfully, this project takes precedence.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> Yes, but, this <em>meeting</em> does not, unless you've just solved our longest-standing containment crisis.</p>
<p><strong>PHMD:</strong> Whew, Eight's optimistic today.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> &lt;<em>gesturing toward PHMD</em>&gt; Does he need to be here?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Are we <em>trying</em> to delay this meeting?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> I thought not. Now, Overseer, I'm aware you've seen tens of thousands of termination attempts on <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>, and I, of course, know their collective success rate. Your skepticism is warranted, but please hear me in earnest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;O5-8 nods.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> I direct the Essophysics Department, which you all well know is concerned with <em>embodiments</em> — manifestations of concepts within reality. An <em>embodiment</em> of the concept "<a href="/scp-6996" target="_blank">red</a>" would carry all of the characteristics conceptually associated with that color, such as being angry, or desirable, or malevolent. This is a simplified method of conceptualizing what's actually going on here; a tangible object or entity <em>embodies</em> a memetic structure within the Noösphere by conforming to its idealistic ideatic shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;PHMD nods along. O5-8 and Dir. Gears share a glance of confusion.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Simply put, an <em>embodiment</em> is a physical item that's shaped like an idea. And, given the progression of human intelligence and development, over time, that shape can change. This means that, if the essophysical nature of an entity is not readily apparent, it can be discerned by comparing that entity's change over time to changes in human conception and ideatic space; a correlation almost certainly indicates causation.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> So, I'm assuming your Department has observed such a correlation in <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s case.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Correct.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> You must know you're not the first to suggest this. Whether or not <span class="no">██</span>'s a conceptual entity has no impact on the success of the Project.</p>
<p><strong>PHMD:</strong> If that were true, she wouldn't have called a meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;O5-8's mouth opens, then closes again. They motion for Dir. Genevieve to continue.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> <span class="no">███</span> has grown increasingly <span class="no">███████</span> and <span class="no">█████████</span> to containment and termination efforts over time, corresponding with the growth of the human intellectual capacity. Whatever concept <span class="no">██</span> embodies is extremely complex, and is so large that it can only partially intersect with the Noösphere.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> And, if it's not native to human thought, it can be removed without risk.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> As far as we understand it.</p>
<p><strong>PHMD:</strong> Just so I understand: we'll remove <span class="no">███</span> from human thought, thereby making everyone forget about it? What good will that accomplish?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> You misunderstand. I am suggesting we eject the <span class="no">███</span>-<em>concept</em> from the Noösphere. If there are no minds able to comprehend a given concept, its <em>embodiments</em> are broken — they return to following natural law.</p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> <em>&lt;brief pause&gt;</em> Meaning what, exactly? They become non-Anomalous?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;PHMD shares a glance with Dir. Genevieve in apparent realization.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Better yet — they become killable.</p>

<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Construct an Anomalous weapon capable of neutralizing <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>.</p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> While several decades of Project's ANTIKILL's termination attempts (including <span class="no">█████</span>-testing with <a href="/scp-096" target="_blank">-096</a>, <a href="/scp-173" target="_blank">-173</a>, <a href="/scp-217" target="_blank">-217</a>, etc.) have proven unsuccessful, they have also proven useful. Strenuous research and cross-examination of <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s interactions and resultant <span class="no">███████████</span> have motivated the Essophysics Department to attempt a new approach to the project: the creation of an Anomalous weapon with the express purpose of tangibly and conceptually purging <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> from reality.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong> To ensure access to ample administrative and computational resources, as well as secrecy from relevant groups of interest, the weapon (provisionally designated AO-6820) is to be housed beneath Secure Administration Site-01. This entails the excavation of over fifty million cubic meters of earth (as expedited by Anomalous technologies), which is planned to take place over an eight-month period. Once excavated, this chamber (ANTIKILL Facility A) will house the various mechanisms required for AO-6820's operation, including:</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Proposed layout for AKF-A.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SECTION A:</strong> Central Computing Node</p>
<p>The central computing node will house a complex self-iterative neural network with two main functions: pattern-recognition and reality manipulation. This artificial intelligence is to be fed all records of <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s <span class="no">███████████ ████████</span> and termination attempts as training data; the network will be conditioned to map a target quantum informational structure corresponding to the conceptual reduction of <span class="no">███ ███████</span>. Upon AO-6820's activation, the node will act as an "ontokinetic webcrawler", interfacing with Section B to scrub all instances of <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s conceptual structure from consensus reality.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION B:</strong> Placeholder-Gears Ontokinetic Sink</p>
<p>The PH-GOS is designed as an enormous reality-anchoring mechanism and ontokinetic interface; it is to read the sum quantum informational content of the universe and encode it into a readable format, thereby allowing other systems to read and react to the entire state of reality. The PH-GOS can and will be piloted to enact localized reality-restructuring events, directly editing the narrative-space-time continuum based on its source data. As such, it will interface with the central node to ensure the indefinite non-existence of <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION C:</strong> <span class="no">███████████ ██████</span></p>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION D:</strong> Secondary Computing</p>
<p>Additional server capacity for secondary functions. Predicted secondary functions include: self-optimization, heuristic and metaheuristic analysis, creativity simulations, <span class="no">██████</span>.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION E:</strong> Dual-Antifusion Reactor</p>
<p>An isolated power source for, and dependent on, AO-6820. The dual-core reactor will manipulate an embedded antimatter drive to generate high-energy fusion reactions between both matter and antimatter pairs, then neutralize them at their respective peak system activities.</p>

<li>the nature of the erased subject</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial document review indicates Project ANTIKILL's intent to ensure the non-existence of SCP-6820-A in all forms, including any arrangement of data that might serve as a vector for its propagation. This suggests that the item may have been a conceptual entity, which would contradict numerous (heavily corrupted) logs of termination attempts implying its existence as a physical entity (eg. frequent use of the term "body mass").</p>
<p>Furthermore, internal inspection of SCP-6820's central computing node has allowed partial mapping of the data arrangement it has been trained to eliminate. Analysis by the Department of Xenobiology confirms that this pattern describes a unique genetic sequence presenting composite features of kingdoms <em>Animalia</em>, <em>Plantae</em> and <em>Fungi</em>, as well as several embedded non-organic structures, with its most prominent structures closely resembling the class <em>Reptilia</em>.</p>
<p>Immediately following the publishing of this analysis, a localized reality-restructuring event occurred; AKF-A-C no longer exists, nor does any record of what it may have been. Given that there is currently no clear point of human entry to SCP-6820, and that personnel must have entered (and recall entering) its central node for internal analysis, it is hypothesized that Section C was some form of staff access to the chamber. The reasons for its erasure remain unclear.</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>motives for neutralization and excessive resources spent</li>
</ul>
<p>The Foundation operates on strict protocols, one of which is to contain, not eradicate, the Anomalous. Decommissioning is a practice reserved for those scenarios in which it is either absolutely necessary or presents no ethical quandaries. Our persistence in pursuit of Project ANTIKILL is not only uncharacteristic but indicates that SCP-6820-A was a prime threat to the directives of the Foundation as more resources had been dedicated to it than any other individual Anomaly (or other item); a vast and apparent majority of these funds were spent in termination attempts.</p>
<p>And, yet, there is no evidence to suggest that the subject's threat was impending — in fact, the continuance of Project ANTIKILL over most of the past century suggests that, if it had posed existential and/or organizational threats, they could not have yet occurred before its erasure. Alternatively, it is possible that SCP-6820-A possessed a sort of memetic or otherwise compulsory effect that influenced Foundation personnel to neutralize the item, though that such a drastic effect was able to remain undetected for several decades is unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> As former Project ANTIKILL Director, I feel obligated to share my anecdotal experience regarding this deeply confusing situation.</p>
<p>To be clear: I retain all memories of <em>working on the project</em>, insofar as I can discern. I have grown rather accustomed to horrifying phenomena over my lengthy tenure with the Foundation, yet I distinctly recall an intense reaction to… <em>something</em>, on levels both administrative and personal. I recall my presence and involvement in drafting relevant documents, submitting and approving termination attempt requests, organizing increasingly involved projects, and yet, I know not the <em>content</em> of these events; hardly any information which would distinguish SCP-6820-A from any other item or entity has persisted, and none of it is in my head.</p>
<p>Strikingly, all I can recall of the subject is my emotional relationship to it, which is apparently shared by all other ANTIKILL personnel: SCP-6820-A was universally perceived as loathsome, directly prejudicial to life, and "disgusting". Whatever it was, I detested it, as did my peers and, as it seems, all whom it came into contact with. Despite its erasure, these feelings have not dissipated, nor have I felt satisfaction in our "defeat" of SCP-6820-A.</p>
<p>Instead, I am wary that we have been manipulated — it is entirely possible that SCP-6820 brought itself into existence, along with all related memories, during its initial reality-restructuring event, and manufactured the supposed existence (and subsequent non-existence) of SCP-6820-A to distract us. It appears to have erased the access shaft to its chamber, limiting research and investigation of its components, immediately following the publishing of information vital to the nature of SCP-6820-A. This could be excused as it fulfilling its function, keeping SCP-6820-A excluded from the Noösphere — though, the fact that our research is still intact is contradictory to this. Given that our dedication to such a project as ANTIKILL does not "add up", as it were, I am inclined to believe that we cannot trust the intelligent, omniscient, omnipotent paraweapon beneath the Foundation's central administrative facilities.</p>

<p>SCP-6820-A memeplex visualization, largest human-comprehensible cross-section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-6820-A is an extremely dense thought; more specifically, it is a hate-centric hyper-logical memeplex that can be roughly described as "the difference between life and death." Even more specifically, SCP-6820-A is an extremely precise and accurate description of what it means for any arrangement of particles to be defined as "alive" and, complementarily, as "dead" or "inanimate". Its memeplex contains several smaller concepts within its description, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>a theoretical process for large-scale localized entropy inversion;</li>
<li>the particular physical properties of hatred;</li>
<li>the molecular structure of hydrochloric acid;</li>
<li>the quality of "adaptiveness";</li>
<li>the state of being "vaguely-reptilian."</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-6820-A occupied an essophysical embodiment within physical reality for much of known history, remaining interminable (as it was neither alive nor dead) until its eradication from the Noösphere upon activation of SCP-6820. Since this event, the weapon's central core has advanced such that its "mental" capacity far exceeds humans', thereby becoming subject to foreign ideatic predators such as SCP-6820-A.</p>
<p>The entity's conceptual fabric is highly adaptive and mutates rapidly, creating significant computational stresses on SCP-6820; left unchecked, it induces a vulnerable state during which it can corrupt the hyper-ideatic portions of its intelligence. During these occurances, the central node transmits a "<span class="bt st">RAGE-STATE EVENT</span>"<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">despair</span> error, and engages in localized reality-restructuring operations which are both highly adaptive and directly prejudicial to life. Irreparable corruption of Site-01's Secure Database files regularly occurs concurrently with these adaptations. <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>When perceived at the correct angle, <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> SCP-6820-A <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> is <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> <tt>loathsome</tt>, <tt>disgusting</tt>, <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> and <tt>malevolent</tt>. <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="st">ADDENDUM 6820.IV:</span> Termination Attempts</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> As SCP-6820 now serves as a vector for SCP-6820-A, the very entity it was constructed to eradicate, it must be terminated to prevent the spread of said entity's onto-conceptual influence.</p>
<div class="blockquote table5" style="background-color: rgb(10, 0, 0)">
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Retroactively demote SCP-6820 to D-Class status via altered <a href="/scp-2140" target="_blank">SCP-2140-1</a> instance, abusing its hard-coded directive to adhere to Foundation bureaucratic obligations.</p>
<p><strong>INTERACTION:</strong> The aforementioned onto-memetic trigger is projected onto the far wall of Chamber AKF-A in clear view of Section B's internal observation lens. Section A's surface panels begin to flutter as movement is detected within its central core; moments later, a lower panel opens outward, revealing an organized force of tall, malformed, pale-skinned humanoid creatures in orange jumpsuits. They march out of the central node, each carrying various tools and supplies, and begin to weld a massive insignia to its camera-facing side, displaying no intent of caution or self-preservation.</p>
<p>Upon completion, extraneous humanoids return to the core's interior; the insignia is discovered to be another SCP-2140-1 instance, one which has never been seen by any member of the Foundation as all personnel who observe it are verifiably civilians. Analysis by cognito-resistant language processing systems reveals the insignia's inclusion of archaic Daevite script, translating roughly to "one who sees".<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">invariable</span></p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Previously-unavailable sections of SCP-6820's metadata files have now become visible, corroborating various other documents' assertion that it occupies, and has always occupied, the position of O5-8 within the Foundation. A civilian scientist was later discovered within Secure Administration Site-01 in possession of a blank E-Class (Clearance Level 0) ID card; the trespasser has been amnesticized and reintegrated into the public.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Upload a verbal description of <a href="/scp-2521" target="_blank">●●|●●●●●|●●|●</a> to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby introducing an infohazardous trigger to disable its internal components.</p>
<p><strong>INTERACTION:</strong> Following over sixty hours of decryption efforts, sufficient access to central node is regained and infohazardous data is uploaded successfully. Thirty seconds later, a dark cloud begins emanating from the core's poles, slowly growing to envelop the spheroid; several vaguely-reptilian vocalizations are detected within, alongside audio disruptions consistent with ●●|●●●●●|●●|●'s effects. SCP-6820 returns a <span class="bt st">RAGE-STATE EVENT</span><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">vain</span> error, remaining unresponsive for approximately four hours. During this period, four PH-GOS units become wrapped in black tentacle-like protrusions which pull them several meters into the ground, destroying nearby systems. These protrusions dissipate upon ejection of ●●|●●●●●|●●|● from the central node; several black ribbon-like fibers are observed hanging from its figure before it demanifests.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> SCP-6820-A now exhibits increased ontokinetic and memetic influence over media in which it is described verbally, corrupting document metadata by addition of footnotes and highlighting of self-supplementary ideatic structures. Manifestation of ectoentropic appendages has not recurred.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Manipulate SCP-6820-A via semantic interaction with a variable abstract-metaphysical concept pointer (<a href="/scp-2719" target="_blank">SCP-2719</a>), thereby forcing it to exit SCP-6820. To this end, the Anti-Noösphere has been defined as the set of all thoughts which humans are incapable of conceiving.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> SCP-6820's central computing node has been turned inside-out, its internal components now external and exposed to AKF-A. The contents within the node elude human conception. Inside traumatized.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Consult a non-conscripted AI system (<a href="/scp-079" target="_blank">SCP-079</a>) for assistance in termination of SCP-6820. Data salvaged from corrupted documents conveys some form of relationship between SCP-079 and the pre-erasure form of SCP-6820-A.</p>
<p><strong>INTERACTION:</strong> SCP-079 is provided access to both current and outdated SCP-6820 documentation, alongside significant computational resources via external hard drive. The intelligence confirms its understanding of the circumstances' severity and promptly provides a complex counter-algorithm to SCP-6820, emphasizing its lethality to humans and advising it remain unobserved. The counter-algorithm is applied across the accessible Sections of AKF-A according to strictly timed specifications, resulting in the deactivation of all components excepting the reactor and central node.</p>
<p>The node remains dormant for sixteen minutes before inducing a spontaneous Site-wide electromagnetic outage, terminating three augmented administrative personnel. The event lasts one hour, after which all systems regain function.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> AKF-A has been entirely restructured; while its arrangement and components remain intact, all external surfaces have been plated with a theoretically impossible tungsten-diamond alloy, while most internal conduits and superconductors have been exchanged with beryllium-bronze counterparts. Despite a lack of non-white light sources, the chamber's interior is universally perceived as the color <span class="bt st">HATEFUL</span>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">reunion</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Introduce a viral para-organism (<a href="/scp-217" target="_blank">SCP-217</a>) to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby incapacitating possible biological elements within.</p>
<p><strong>INTERACTION:</strong> In the midst of a spontaneous <span class="bt st">RAGE-STATE</span>, SCP-6820's hydrochloric acid solution is treated with SCP-217 before voiding into Section A. The virus reacts immediately with trace organic material embedded within the node's internal atmosphere, beginning to form macro-structures when internal surveillance is lost. External cameras remain active as, twenty-two minutes later, a cloud of reflective particles emerges from the node's west entry port. These particles, found later to be silicon-protein nanobots, arrange themselves into an enormous gear mechanism surrounding the sphere's equator.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> The node's upper and lower hemispheres now rotate independently and periodically, producing sounds of clockwork machinery. <strong>GoI-004</strong> operatives (including followers of Orthodox Cogwork, the United Church, the Church of Maxwellism, the <a href="/scp-6217" target="_blank">Sanctuary of the Holistic</a>, and <a href="/scp-4485" target="_blank">HANSARP</a>) have gained inexplicable knowledge of SCP-6820's location, and have waged holy war on the Foundation in the name of <span class="bt"><tt>WAN</tt></span>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">unbroken</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENTION:</strong> Utilize an insurmountable omnikinetic<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>omnikinetic:</strong> A catch-all term used to describe anomalies which are able to enact a combination of semiontological, ontokinetic, and semiokinetic reality manipulation simultaneously.</span> force (<a href="/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal" target="_blank">SCP-001-KATE</a>) in order to summarily wipe SCP-6820 from existence.</p>
<p><strong>INTERACTION:</strong> The following text was inputted into the safeguarded SCP-001-KATE database file:</p>
<div class="papernote">
<p><tt>AKF-A, SCP-6820, and SCP-6820-A will immediately and entirely be removed from existence upon the saving of this document. The area physically occupied by AKF-A and SCP-6820 will be filled with the material that was excavated from it.</tt></p>
</div>
<p>The file was then saved.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Following the file's saving, Sections C through H of AKF-A were violently and haphazardly replaced with soil. Embedded hyperdense support beams and metal frameworking used for prior efforts instantly bent and collapsed under the severe pressure, causing significant structural damage to subterranean portions of Administration Site-01. Absolutely no discernable change was observed within Sections A and B, as well as to SCP-6820 itself, after the former two structures were forcefully entered via excavation machinery.</p>
<p>Subsequent molecular analysis revealed trace amounts of mineral deposits and organic compounds amid the chamber's constituent atoms. The SCP-001-KATE file was then found to be vacant from the Site-01 DEEPWELL archive, and associated backup archives; such a file has purportedly never been in circulation.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon lizard">abhorrent</span></p>

<p><strong><span class="no">O5-10</span>:</strong> Oh, <em>fuck me</em>. <em>&lt;retches&gt;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> <em>&lt;exasperated&gt;</em> What… what does it want? What are they doing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;More service personnel enter the frame, pouring in from adjacent hallways. Several can be seen operating at the base of a PH-GOS unit, repositioning open wires without protective equipment. They are soon obscured by a mass of technicians in bloodied uniforms, each of them lacking digits or entire hands. Smiling, they reach upward and smother the camera in limbs. The signal is lost.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> There goes the last camera. They're certainly not making repairs — it looks like they're either recalibrating or entirely rewiring the Sinks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="no">O5-12</span>:</strong> What the hell do we do?!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Each party examines their worktablet as they receive notifications. <span class="no">O5-12</span> gasps.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> They're reporting the re-emergence of <a href="/scp-3125" target="_blank">a highly aggressive memeplex</a>, one that caused an XK a few decades back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="no">O5-10</span>:</strong> <em>Another</em> hostile concept? Is this one responsible for the</p>
<p><tt>rage-state</tt></p>
<p>?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Negative. It appears that the signal detected in the maintenance hallways is a mutation of 6820-A's memetic structure, with elements of the 3125-concept embedded in it. If this were 3125 in full form, we'd all be dead already — I'd guess that the adaptation-meme encountered it outside the Noösphere and was forced to, well, adapt.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> It may even have subsumed the entity entirely. We <em>need</em> to get those Sinks online before this thing gains control.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="no">O5-10</span> and <span class="no">-12</span> are approached by <span class="bt st">PENTAGONAL RED</span> appendages, which originate outside camera view; the appendages impale each of them from behind. They disappear silently. The elevator creaks as it slows to a halt, opening into the central bunker chamber.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> No. We need to activate the on-site warheads.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> You think they — we — never tried bombing the thing? If we didn't, it was probably for good reason. Jesus Christ… think of how it might adapt to energy weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Nobody's bombing anything. We <em>solve</em> problems, not obliterate them. It always adapts to us, so how can <em>we</em> adapt to <em>it</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Come on. You're cleared to know about <em>everything</em> the Foundation has at its disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> Well, it'd help if we could <em>remember</em> what we've already tried.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> There are a few things only some of us get to know about, so technically —</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Wait, shit — <em>remembering</em> — we're dealing with an antimemetic threat. We have other antimemes, don't we?</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Yes, there's one here, though it's not very well known. For obvious reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;O5-3 presses a button on her worktablet, forwarding a document to Dir. Gears and Dir. Genevieve.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> Wait, what? There is no SCP-055.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Gold star for missing the point.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> Okay, fine. Tell me how it's going to help us.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Why did 6820 originally fail? How did 6820-A come back into reality?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Gears:</strong> Because it only eliminated -A from <em>human</em> thought, not its own thought.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> Right; it must've still had a copy inside its memory. If we get the AI to understand that, it'll have to erase itself — if we can keep the adaptation-meme away from it for long enough.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> And how are we supposed to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Genevieve:</strong> I've got an anti-idea.</p>

<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <tt>Perfect</tt></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> must be destroyed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Personnel are forbidden to speak to <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>, for fear of provoking a <tt>conversation</tt>. All unauthorized personnel attempting to <tt>know the truth</tt> will be restrained and removed by force.</p>
<p>Due to its frequent attempts at <tt>escape</tt>, difficulty of <tt>imprisonment</tt>, and high threat of <tt>disgust</tt>, <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> is to be <tt>tortured with acid</tt>. The <tt>putrid</tt> will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely <tt>observant</tt>, and was observed to engage in complex <tt>strategy</tt> with <span style="color: #b01">SCP-079</span> during their limited time of exposure. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> appears to <tt>understand what's really going on here</tt>, which has been expressed in several interviews during <tt>subjugation</tt>. (See Addendum <span class="no">███</span>-B).</p>
<p><span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its <tt>threats</tt>. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s physical body grows and changes <tt>as it pleases</tt>, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds <tt>reality</tt>. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> gains energy from anything it <tt>subsumes, physical or conceptual</tt>. Digestion seems to be aided by <tt>invariability</tt> inside of <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s nostrils, which are able to remove <tt>survival</tt> from any liquid solution, enabling it to constantly regenerate from the acid it is contained in. <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>'s regenerative capabilities and resilience are <tt>self-evident</tt>, and <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> has been seen <tt>purging and purifying</tt> with its body 87% destroyed or rotted.</p>
<p>In case of containment breach, <span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span> is to be tracked and <tt>challenged</tt> by all available Mobile Task Forces, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) members are cleared to engage it. To date (██-██-████), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum <span class="no">███</span>-D).</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve:</strong> Now, why did you kill those farmers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>:</strong> (No verbal communication)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve:</strong> If you don't talk now, we'll… wait, where… am I?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve:</strong> No, I… I don't understand.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve:</strong> You… we erased you… we erased you again and again, from every place we could.</p>
<p><strong><span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>:</strong> (No verbal communication)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve:</strong> What did we do wrong? We were acting in self-defense; ever since we found you, you'd hated us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>:</strong> You are… (Incomprehensible)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. <span class="no">██████</span></strong>: (To Dr. Genevieve) That microphone has only so much gain, move it closer to it!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Dr. Genevieve moves the microphone closer. Three points of light blink at her through the darkness. The warm smell of hatred makes her vomit.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="no">███</span>-<span class="no">███</span>:</strong> You are… <strong><span style="color: red">disgusting</span></strong>…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Dr. Genevieve's chamber begins to flood with hydrochloric acid. She drops the microphone and it dissolves. Her screams fill the chamber.&gt;</strong></p>
