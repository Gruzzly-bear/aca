<p>SCP-5035, photographed in stasis inside its containment chamber.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5035 is to be kept in a specially designed containment chamber located 5 km below sub-level 9C at Area-179. The chamber is outfitted with a Chalmez-Forte Matter Stabilizing Stasis Gate.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Following Incident I5035-A, access to SCP-5035 for any purpose is denied to all personnel.</span><br/>
Access to SCP-5035 is limited to members of Project CHARON.</p>
<p>SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B instances are to be collected and held in Dangerous Goods Storage Block 17C according to the Biosafety Level 3 standard.</p>
<p>In the event of a containment breach, all museums and institutions falling under Protocol 5035-CB are to be put under Foundation surveillance until SCP-5035 can successfully be contained. MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") are assigned to the recapture of SCP-5035 due to the risk of hazardous materials potentially manifested by SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5035 is a plaster and cloth statue depicting an African-American male wearing 19th century period accurate clothing. Attempts to remove SCP-5035's clothing have proven futile, as the anomaly is capable of quickly generating a new set using its own internal materials to enact SCP-5035-B.</p>
<p>SCP-5035 spontaneously appears in museum diorama scenes relating to the American Civil War. This begins a process observed to take from one hour to seven months in completion- termed an "Infestation Event"- that results in the creation of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Those observing the diorama prior to the completion of an Infestation Event do not notice the presence of SCP-5035 unless explicitly told to.</p>
<p>SCP-5035 will change the physical properties and appearances of objects making up the diorama to that of their real life counterparts. These transformed objects are referred to as SCP-5035-A. SCP-5035 also has the ability to modify existing objects in mass and position- taking on the appearance of entirely new objects. Modified objects are referred to as SCP-5035-B. For examples of these instances, refer to “Infestation Events Log” below.</p>
<p>Following a transformation, SCP-5035 will cause the object to rapidly decompose. An Infestation Event is considered complete when SCP-5035 stops creating instances of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Upon completion, SCP-5035 will remain in the diorama until its effects are observed by a certain number of persons. The criteria- if any- for how SCP-5035 decides this is unknown, but can be inferred that it is based on the size and scale of the Infestation Event.</p>
<p>SCP-5035 transforms and manipulates a diorama as an apparent form of communication, and the object appears to identify itself with an African American freedman. The end result is that of a calculated work intended to be interpreted by the observer. Upon the completion of an Infestation Event, SCP-5035 will manifest itself at a new location to repeat the process. Despite appearing only in the United States, studies show no discernible travel pattern.</p>

<strong>Report Filed By:</strong> E. Dune<br/>
<strong>Priority:</strong> Keneq</p>
<hr/>
<p>Safe. That's what SCP-5035 is classified as, and for the past seven months- that's what it was. Our tests were proving successful, and there was a certain refinement to the scenes it created- regardless of their undeniably disturbing content. This object wasn't just rotting corpses for no reason- when it altered a scene it knew what it was saying. We came to this conclusion months ago. We also came to the conclusion that- because the object was clearly fixated on visual metaphors for unpaid reparations and the sociopolitical ramifications of slavery in the United States- keeping it locked in a cell unattended with zero non-standard containment procedures was probably a shit idea. We were right.</p>
<p>Around 19:00, Junior Researcher M<span class="bblock">artinez</span>, Officer S<span class="bblock">mith</span>, and Lab Assistant D<span class="bblock">avies</span> were performing tests on SCP-5035 in Laboratory 3F. Security feeds show that at 19:23, SCP-5035 began manifesting its anomalous effects in the form of a SCP-5035-A instance that resulted in M<span class="bblock">artinez</span>'s scalp suddenly tearing itself open, exposing her cerebrum. S<span class="bblock">mith</span> attempted to reach for his firearm, but SCP-5035 had elongated and twisted the officer's digits, rendering them useless. Mass began to rapidly generate in S<span class="bblock">mith</span>'s hands, forcing him to the ground. D<span class="bblock">avies</span> was able to sound an alarm, but the doors to Laboratory 3F were unable to be opened. The footage shows what appear to be string-thin veins exposed from the wrists of D<span class="bblock">avies</span> being pulled across the laboratory floor and into the door's vacuum duct, clogging and sealing the door shut. D<span class="bblock">avies</span> was repeatedly slammed against the door, pulled by his veins. The security team was unable to access the door to Laboratory 3F. At approximately 19:28.32, the security feed cut out, presumably due to an unseen SCP-5035-B instance interfering.</p>
<p>For the next thirty minutes or so, the security team tried to cut into Laboratory 3F. Then, I showed up. The team had already gotten in, so I was able to see the monstrosity SCP-5035 had created using the remains of the testing group- which now resembled crude depictions of Area-179's staff. That fucker even had the gall to make a sculpture of me out of M<span class="bblock">artinez</span>‘s muscle tissue, complete with a bottle of <span class="bblock">brand name</span> in one hand, and a noose in the other- funny joke. As I anticipated, my [DATA EXPUNGED] proved useful in dealing with the anomaly, and was able to keep it occupied until we were able to retrieve a Stasis Gate from offsite. Why we didn’t have a spare in storage or for emergency purposes is beyond my understanding. Such is the state of Area-179. Regardless, it’s secure now.</p>
<p>Special containment procedures update and object reclassification to Euclid pending.</p>

<p><strong>FROM:</strong> Dr. Edward T. Dune<br/>
<strong>TO:</strong> Director Roman Barrow, Area-179<br/>
<strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Neutralization Appeal re:SCP-5035<br/>
<br/>
Director Barrow,</p>
<p>You're damn lucky we caught that thing when we did, Roman. You can give Martin's team shit for whatever you'd like, but when someone flies a jet out to Site 89 to get a goddamned Stasis Gate and a CPR approval in under twelve hours, they're doing a fine job in my book. Yes, I know I'm making you look incompetent. Yes, I'm aware this will show up in the Level 4 file and potentially cost you your position. No, I don't care. I mean, we hypothesized that the object could potentially redirect its effects towards Foundation containment months ago. Christ, Roman- take one look at how it reacted to plastic- all because it was dressed up in a fucking Union outfit. You and the entire financial committee let our Beta-Urgent Update proposals collect dust in document-limbo for months. A budget cut cost Julie her life. Let that sink in for a second, you twat.</p>
<p>However, I didn't write this just to berate you anymore than I usually do, Director. I'd like you to consider something. This object, while successfully contained now, is clearly capable of understanding subtext and loves analogous symbolism so much that I originally figured the thing belonged to those Are We Played Out Yet? fuckers. It's been redirecting its attention from the Civil War and the injustices of slavery to a different form of enslavement- the containment of anomalies.</p>
<p>Consider the scene it had been constructing before we put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Consider that, while the object is in motion stasis, it still may be capable of "thinking".</p>
<p>Consider- assuming the above is true- how pissed off it is right now.</p>
<p>Director, that thing is sitting in stasis thinking about all of the different ways it can kill us. Want to see an entire site turned into a piece of social commentary? How about a security team's insides turned out? Crude drawings of the O5 Council carved into your goddamned chest with a knife fashioned from your toenail? The second a containment breach occurs, or we deactivate that stasis gate, that thing is teleporting the hell out of Area-179, and manifesting itself at another Foundation establishment. I do not think that's a situation you want on your hands.</p>
<p>We can't experiment with it anymore, it's just learning to hate us, it's a massive liability to keep around, and it's utterly pointless to pour resources into it. There's no tip-toeing around it- SCP-5035 must be neutralized. Need I say more?</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Dr. Edward T. Dune</p>

<p><strong>FROM:</strong> Director Roman Barrow, Area-179<br/>
<strong>TO:</strong> Dr. Edward T. Dune<br/>
<strong>SUBJECT:</strong> DENIED- Neutralization Appeal Re:SCP-5035</p>
<p>Dr. Dune,</p>
<p>I have worked with The Foundation for exactly 30 years. I've met minds more brilliant than I could ever hope to be, learned more about the true nature of this reality than I could ever have imagined, and experienced countless horrors untold.</p>
<p>I have never been more disrespected, belittled, and humiliated than from the verbal abuse you continuously hurl at me with zero discretion. If not for reasons clear to both you and I that do not need restating here, I would've had you terminated years ago. That being said, Doctor- I reject your neutralization appeal.</p>
<p>Now, before you call the state of my hair to attention and accuse me of sexual relations with someone's mother- as you've done oh-so-many times before- allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>SCP-5035 is not averted to the Foundation as much as it is to the idea of containment. Look around you- The Foundation is far from the only group interested in anomalies. SCP-5035 appears to possess some sort of cognizance- so why not attempt to communicate with it? Imagine redirecting that resentment away from ourselves and towards a more deserving target. Provided we crack the code, the nature of SCP-5035 may prove advantageous for us in the future.</p>
<p>The existence and growing influence of groups of interest is impeding The Foundation's mission heavily. We've grazed conflict far too frequently as of recent. We live in a world of ideological struggle, and we are rapidly accelerating towards the collapse. Mark my words, Doctor- there will come a tipping point, and it’s our job to be prepared. I reject your appeal, and in place issue an official Directorial Order for an immediate project planning meeting regarding a new testing program to be enacted on SCP-5035. You and your team are to await further details. I'll be seeing you soon, Doctor.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Director Roman Barrow, Area-179</p>
