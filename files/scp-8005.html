<p>SCP-8005</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8005</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8005 is kept in a lead-lined capsule in Cell 17A of Site-59. The capsule's door is permanently unlocked and can be opened both externally and internally.</p>
<p>The only time the capsule will be temporarily locked is if the onsite nuclear warhead is detonated for any reason, after which it will unlock.</p>
<p>However, the bulkhead to Cell 17A can only be opened with a mechanical combination lock. The combination is known only to Project Yurodivy staff, the Administrator of the Foundation, and SCP-8005 itself.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that SCP-8005 is capable of entering and leaving at will. However, all staff are assured that SCP-8005 is incapable of independent action without first being manually activated.</p>
<p>The DNA<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-582861-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-582861-1')">1</a></sup> is a specialized clockwork mechanism designed to press the activation button on the back of SCP-8005's neck after a period of fifty years has elapsed without winding, thus acting as a dead man's switch. As such, the DNA is to be rewound 20 degrees counterclockwise every 402 days.</p>
<p>Before testing, staff are required to procure a hamburger<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-582861-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-582861-2')">2</a></sup> from the Site-59 cafeteria. Under no circumstances is this hamburger to contain cheese.</p>
<p>If the Site-59 cafeteria does not have hamburgers, testing is to be postponed until it does.</p>
<p>If SCP-8005 or any duplicate instances are located, they are to be recovered, given a hamburger, and sent to Site-59 to have all of its observational data extracted and recorded for Project Yurodivy. It will then be contained in either its prior capsule (for the original instance) or a secondary capsule (for the duplicate). In the latter case, it will be designated SCP-8005-2.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8005 refers to an automaton constructed by the Foundation for Project Yurodivy. The object is 30.5 centimeters in height, but is extremely dense for its size; it weighs 121.72 kilograms. It is composed of unidentified materials that have proven resistant to analysis. Additionally, all records of SCP-8005's construction have been destroyed by Project Yurodivy staff.</p>
<p>When the activation switch on SCP-8005's back is pressed, it displays sapience, sentience, and speech capabilities. As such, it answers to both "SCP-8005" and its nickname from Project Yurodivy staff, "Hammie." While generally polite with Foundation staff, it demonstrates particular closeness with its creator (and the head of Project Yurodivy), Dr. Verna Kahn.</p>
<p>During activation, SCP-8005 will constantly pursue its primary objective, as dictated by Project Yurodivy: to touch a hamburger. Once physical contact is made with a hamburger, only then will it return to a dormant state.</p>
<p>It should be noted that SCP-8005's programming forbids it from constructing a hamburger. The reason for this is restricted to personnel involved with Project Yurodivy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the metallic wires that make up 95% of SCP-8005's structure possess a regenerative factor that allows it to regenerate after receiving damage. The extent of this healing factor is unknown, but damage testing has resulted in inter-departmental conflicts from Project Yurodivy staff due to concerns of permanent damage and the importance of its mission.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-582861-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-582861-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Note from Project Yurodivy staff:</strong> If SCP-8005 is not activated by a human, the completion of its primary objective is a SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION: MARDUK priority to the Foundation, and to the continued existence of humanity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-582861-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-582861-4')">4</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log - SCP-8005 during an active state</strong><br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Harry Karlov<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8005<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 1/28/2024</p>
<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>
<p><em>(Karlov enters the interview chamber. SCP-8005 stands on the table, motionless.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-8005. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> I am awaiting a hamburger. I have been told this feeling is "anticipation," "hunger," and/or "impatience." Does that answer your question?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Um, yes, yes it does!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Then that sub-objective has been completed. Question: how much closer does this bring me to receiving a hamburger?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Easy, Hammie. It'll be lunchtime before you know it. For now, I'd like to ask you some —</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> I'm sorry, but I do not understand how "Lunchtime" is relevant to completing my mission. There are many false-positive meal options that comprise "Lunchtime"; I shall endeavor to list a few. "Salad." "Hot dogs." "Lemonade." "Ointment." (More data is needed for the latter item.) While "Hamburger" is absolutely a potential "Lunchtime" variable, "Lunchtime" is a time period of the same Statistical Hamburger Potential (SHP) as "Christmas," "2:00 PM Central Standard Time," "2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time," "Eastern Orthodox Christmas," among others. This is admittedly a high SHP rate, but still minuscule compared to the ideal ratio presented by "Hamburger Distribution O'Clock."</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> …are you done?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> No, my mission has not yet been completed.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Can I just ask you some questions, already?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> You are my superior. This was never forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> <em>(Sigh.)</em> First off, why do you like hamburgers so much?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-8005 kneels in reverence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> …Delicious. Easy to consume. Inexpensive. Highly customizable. Enjoyed by people from all walks of life. Widely and internationally available…</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> But do you eat them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> What do you take me for? I am not so predatory that I need to destroy and defile something in order to appreciate it!</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> So you just like to touch them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> <em>Gently!</em> Its form must be left completely intact by my affections - no denting of the bun, no puncturing of the meat, no wanton corruption of the pickles. My hand must pass <em>gingerly</em> across the hamburger like a spring breeze. Respecting its structural integrity, so that it remains edible to the myriad of teeth and throats who would plead their suit. But! Not <em>so</em> gingerly that it knows not that I was ever there! Only the backward glance of the hamburger, the implicit smile in return, can lull this poor sinner into deactivation.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Do you understand the concept of courtly love?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> No.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-8005 stands up again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Neither do I. Can I have a hamburger now?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> I still have some questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> How many?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Oh, for —</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> I do not mean to rush you. In fact, I do not detect much hamburger-distribution potential in your physical shape, based on an independent survey I have been conducting on the different traits of people who have given me hamburgers. I'm simply interested in knowing the —</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> Next question!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Ready.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> What is Project Yurodivy?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> That's what Mother<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-582861-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-582861-5')">5</a></sup> does for work.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> What does it consist of?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Do you know the reason for your existence?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> I fail to see what that has to do with —</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Project Yurodivy is the reason for my existence. Unlike your species, I have not had the luxury of debating it for several thousand years. I have seen no evidence that philosophy is a hamburger-acquisition vector.</p>
<p>…That, and Mother tells me very little of her job, only that I fulfill it by touching hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> You could have just said that last part.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> But records indicate that smart little boys are rewarded with food. May I make a suggestion as to what kind?</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> What I'm trying to say is: I don't understand how you getting a hamburger is something so important that we had to put it under a special MARDUK classification.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Well, it's very important to <em>me!</em></p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> But making it important <em>to the Foundation</em> is a different matter.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> That just means you care about my needs very much! …thank you, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> This is getting nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> You may be right. The lack of hamburgers before me <em>does</em> present compelling evidence to that end.</p>
<p><em>(Karlov gets up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Karlov:</strong> We're done here. …I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8005:</strong> Oh, interesting! Is that you were created to acquire instead of —</p>
<p><em>(The door closes.)</em></p>
<p>— all right, then.</p>
<p><em>(15 seconds of silence.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Security camera footage captures SCP-8005 sitting down on the table. With a pen dropped by Researcher Karlov, it scrawls a crude picture of a hamburger on the table's surface.)</em></p>
<p><em>(It sits with legs folded in front of the drawing.)</em></p>
<p><em>(It extends a hand toward the drawing. It slowly pantomimes touching the hamburger.)</em></p>
<p>&lt;End Log&gt;</p>

<h1><span><strong>NOTICE</strong></span></h1>
<p>If you're reading this, it's because the O5 Council and the nauseatingly persistent staff at Site-59 have forced me to offer a better explanation for Project Yurodivy. I can offer you only a few more points, but then, it's back to secrecy for good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Yurodivy was created at the command of the Administrator, <em>not</em> the O5 Council.</li>
<li>This level of secrecy is due to how SCP-8005 was created, what materials were needed — and the true extent of his potential.</li>
<li>Yes, it is important that Hammie gets his burger — <em>especially</em> if humanity is extinct.</li>
<li>All non-SCP-8005 systems related to Project Yurodivy (including the DNA, the global release array for Compound Nandi-18, and [DATA EXPUNGED]) are required to use technology that can activate both autonomously and without electrical power. This is to ensure that SCP-8005's objective can be completed even if there is no longer any electricity or personnel left to activate it.</li>
<li>Hammie is our last resort. Not just to protect us against the anomalous, but from ourselves.</li>
<li>I saw your interview, Karlov. My boy is to be treated with respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, unless you're the Administrator or one of my staff, <strong>there will be no further clarification.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
