            <h1>SCP-1140</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1140</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1140 may be kept in any secure storage area of sufficient size (It is currently in room R.4.13). For accurate and rigorous testing, however, it is required that the object is kept in a room with at least 2 metres of clearance in each direction for movement of testing equipment, and is supported at least 30cm off the ground by 4 clear Perspex rods, one mounted at each corner of the base. The base is to be mounted upon a weighing apparatus which is connected to an alarm; the alarm is to sound if the weight of the object changes by more than 0.4%.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Endoscopy equipment is to be stored in the storage area’s equipment locker at all times when not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1140 is a chest of 7 drawers painted with clear gloss varnish over oak. The chest is 148cm in width, 49cm in depth and 91cm in height. The drawers' dimensions are (top to bottom):</p>
<ul>
<li>Three drawers 46cm wide, 21cm tall and 46cm deep</li>
<li>Two drawers 70cm wide, 21cm tall and 46cm deep</li>
<li>Two drawers 70cm wide, 31cm tall and 46cm deep</li>
</ul>
<p>The anomalous behaviour is observed when the central drawer in the top row of the chest is opened at least 2cm, whereby under certain circumstances vocalisation can be detected from within the chest. This vocalisation has been designated SCP-1140-1. Testing has shown that the circumstances include the presence of a single prepubescent child, the presence of a single post-pubescent who has significant mental retardation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, or any adult who has assisted with [REDACTED].<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Dismantling the chest has revealed there to be nothing within the cavity behind the drawers capable of producing vocalisation; presence of speakers or any other electromagnetic equipment capable of playback has been ruled out by use of metal-detection apparatus. As the anomalous vocalisation only occurs when a single individual is present, remote-control equipment must be used during testing. Presence of the equipment seems to have no effect on testing.</p>
<p>Although SCP-1140-1 is for all experimental considerations a disembodied voice, any attempts to reach towards the rear of the drawer during such time as the voice can be heard results in injury. This appears to only occur to live human beings, and does not occur when SCP-1140-1 is inactive. The wounds are consistent with having been caused by a large claw, and are most similar in pathology to wounds caused by a large ratite (ostrich, emu, or cassowary).</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> The item was recovered from the dining area of a house in ███████, ██. The house was otherwise unremarkable; after application of Class A amnestics and neurolinguistic programming by a field agent, the family remain in-situ, with the chest having been replaced by a non-anomalous replica.</p>
<p>SCP-1140 came to the attention of a researcher during periodic checking of psychiatric reports,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and a field agent was sent out to interview both the report's subject and his family. Interviews revealed that the youngest member of the household had been found on several occasions sitting on the floor near to SCP-1140 and having conversations with what the family believed to be an 'imaginary friend'. The amount of time that the child spent doing this, in addition to his refusing to move for hours, resulted in him being reviewed by a child psychiatrist.</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt (0:11:12 to 0:13:42) from Recovery Interview 1140-A5 (███ █████, 6yo male):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> When did you first start hearing the voice?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> I heard him talking to me when I walked past him once.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Can you remember how old you were?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> Oh, it was after my birthday party. I was 6 at my party.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Less than eight months, then. What did the voice say?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> It’s not a voice. It’s Mr Gurgles.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Is that what he says his name is?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> No, I made it up. He doesn’t tell me his name.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> What does he sound like?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> He sounds like he’s on the news <em>(Giggles)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> On the news?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> Yes, he sounds all posh, like Prince Charles.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> And what does he say to you?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> We just talk. About me, about <em>(pauses)</em> school.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Does he talk about himself at all?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> No, I asked him why he was in the drawer once, and he said he wasn’t in the drawer. I asked him where he was then, and he said that he was only a reppentation(sic) in this mentional.(sic). <em>(It can be reasonably assumed that this was</em> 'a representation in this dimension.<em>')</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Did he say anything else about himself?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> I asked him what his house was like, and he said he didn’t want to tell me. He got a bit angry and so I didn’t ask him again.</p>
<p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> What did he say when he was angry?</p>
<p><strong>███ █████:</strong> I couldn’t tell, his voice went all crackly. It was scary, I didn’t like it.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> He’s gone now.</p>
<p><strong>D-93223:</strong> Who has gone? The man?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> Yes. The man has gone. We can talk. You can help me.</p>
<p><strong>D-93223:</strong> What can I do? I can talk to you. Are you from England?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> I'm from… From England, yes.</p>
<p><strong>D-93223:</strong> I want to go to England.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> I need you to find me some <em>(silence for 8 seconds)</em> things. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>D-93223:</strong> Oh, I can't find things. They say at the hospital that I'm always losing things. Have you asked your mom?</p>
<p><em>(The following was inaudible during the recordings and has been re-constructed using forensic audio analysis:)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> How did it feel? Did it make a noise when they tore it out? Did you <em>[INAUDIBLE]</em> when it came away? I bet you <em>[INAUDIBLE]</em> all the way through it, didn’t you? <em>(SCP-1140-1 laughs)</em> Filthy bitch. You haven’t even <em>[INAUDIBLE]</em> pussy before you came in. You shouldn’t have told them why. You never should have told <em>[INAUDIBLE]</em> why you didn’t help her.</p>
<p><strong>D-93223:</strong> I don’t like you! You tell lies! I hate you! <em>(shouts at the door)</em> LET ME OUT! MR GURGLES IS A LIAR! HE’S A FUCKING LIAR!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1140-1:</strong> Let her out. I tire of her. She can't help me. <em>(This is the only occasion SCP-1140-1 has spoken directly to a member of Foundation personnel.)</em></p>

<p>During the test conversations the area behind the drawer was constantly monitored by an endoscopic camera, a thermometer, and barometric indicators; at no point was there any change in any of the readings. During the conversation in which a D-class was injured, the camera showed no movement apart from the injury itself, which occurred between frames of the video.</p>
