<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7293 is not currently contained, and it is presumed that its containment will never be possible. However, due to the complex setup required to perform SCP-7293, containment is largely unnecessary.</p>

<p>A honey bear container, a necessary component of SCP-7293-A.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Update 05/01/2004:</strong> Foundation Agents are to alter any descriptions of SCP-7293 to include the following instruction in an appropriate tone:</p>
<p>"Once the ritual is complete, please inform any entities now present that there is to be no snacking while their invocation is active."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7293 is a series of interconnected rituals that, if performed correctly, summon SCP-7293-1 into baseline reality. Each individual ritual that makes up SCP-7293 has several different required elements, which are listed below.</p>
<div class="table3">
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th><strong>SCP-7293 Component Ritual</strong></th>
<th><strong>Required Items</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-7293-A</td>
<td>One kilogram of honey, stored in one or more honey bear containers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></td>

<tr>
<td>SCP-7293-C</td>
<td>Three stuffed bears, thirty milligrams of sugar, six toothpicks, six marshmallows.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>In order to perform SCP-7293, the following actions must be taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half of the honey must be used to draw a circle on a flat surface. This circle must be greater than one meter in diameter, and must use no more than half of the honey.</li>
<li>The pine ash, gunpowder and remaining honey must be used to draw a nonagram within the existing circle.</li>
<li>The three stuffed bears must be placed evenly apart at any three points in the circle. The toothpicks must be placed in such a way where they are somewhat upright, and making physical contact with the bear. Each of the toothpicks must then have a marshmallow placed on its top end.</li>
<li>Allow the ambient Elan-Vital Energy of the ritual site to simmer for two to three hours.</li>
<li>Using the flame-producing object, ignite each of the marshmallows individually. Once all six have been lit, throw the object into the nonagram.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
<li>If the previous instructions had been executed correctly, the circle will produce a small explosion and a great deal of smoke. Once the smoke clears, SCP-7293-1 will be sitting in the circle, and the ritual will be complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>SCP-7293-1, photographed during a summoning on 03/10/2002.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7293-1 is a deific entity which appears as a member of <em>Ursus arctos</em> (Brown bear). Excluding the drastically higher amount of Akiva radiation given off by the entity, SCP-7293-1 is physically indistinguishable from a non-anomalous member of its species. SCP-7293-1 is relatively passive, only displaying aggression if threatened itself. It also appears to possess an awareness of the location of any edible items within one mile of itself, appearing to prefer traditionally sweet foodstuff.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 7293-1:</strong> The following is a collection of notable instances of SCP-7293 known to have occurred since its discovery by the Foundation in 2000.</p>

<th><strong>Date Of Performance</strong></th>

<tr>
<td>03/09/2000</td>
<td>Containment Cell 2/38, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120" target="_blank" target="_blank">Site-120</a></td>
<td>First documented casting of SCP-7293, following its discovery as part of a collected grimoire of rituals recovered from a hideout belonging to a local cell of the Serpent's Hand. Upon manifestation, SCP-7293-1 proceeded to escape its cell and make its way to the Site's cafeteria, where it would consume the majority of the confectionary which had been delivered earlier that same day. Several members of personnel managed to thaumaturgically bind SCP-7293-1 to a nearby table, where it would remain until demanifestation. In total, SCP-7293-1 injured twelve members of personnel and damaged three cafeteria tables. SCP-7293 receives provisional classification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>24/10/2000-17/04/2001</td>
<td>Downtown Detroit, Michigan</td>
<td>Account received in correspondence with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Unusual Incidents Unit. A group of criminals presumably discovered a copy of the ritual and performed it. SCP-7293-1 proceeded to break into several stores in the area, while the group used its presence as a cover to steal money from the store's cash registers. Following the initial incident, the ritual would be repeated several times over the course of the next six months. The group was eventually brought into custody when SCP-7293-1 raided a Starbucks location where several members of the local UIU offices were ordering their morning coffee. Incidents were covered up by crediting SCP-7293-1 to be a completely non-anomalous bear that the group had been keeping in a truck and releasing to act as a distraction. SCP-7293 receives full classification due to the wide spread of instructions detailing the ritual.</td>

<td>Living District of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/esterberg-city-wikipedia" target="_blank" target="_blank">FP-120 ("Esterberg")</a></td>
<td>SCP-7293-1 summoned during a large picnic which was being hosted by the local <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/manna-wikipedia" target="_blank" target="_blank">Manna Charitable Foundation</a> Center to raise funds for those who had lost their homes and jobs during the then-recent riots against the Marshall, Carter and Darke administration in <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest#goricna" target="_blank">FP-108 ("Gorična")</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Attendees were encouraged to bring their own food in order to share with others, leading to many bringing homemade goods. The area was evacuated and SCP-7293-1 proceeded to spend the next four hours consuming the majority of the food brought to the picnic. The individuals involved in the summoning were apprehended by Esterbergian authorities and the MCF was given a small cash donation as apologies for the inconvenience.</td>

<td>Jurassic District of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">FP-01 ("Three Portlands")</a></td>
<td>SCP-7293-1 was summoned and proceeded to spend the next three hours raiding a pop-up <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ambrose-restaurant-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Ambrose Restaurants</a> location which promised a "Tantalus-esque dining experience." In practise, this meant that any and all food would move, at speed, away from anyone or anything attempting to consume it. UIU and Foundation agents arrived on and secured the scene, and allowed SCP-7293-1 to continue chasing several bowls of ice cream, before it gave up and demanifested. Location staff were financially compensated for the damages caused by SCP-7293-1. The source of SCP-7293-1's summoning on this occasion is currently unknown and under investigation by the UIU.</td>

<tr>
<td>20/12/2003</td>
<td>Site-120 Cafeteria</td>
<td>SCP-7293-1 intentionally summoned by Department of Ontokinetics personnel during the Site-120 Christmas party. Several members of staff pacified the entity with slices of cake, while others dressed it in a fake beard, stocking cap and a red and white coat. SCP-7293-1 did not attempt to remove these articles of clothing, and remained in the cafeteria for the remainder of the party, largely remaining close to the refreshments table. Entity demanifested shortly after the party concluded. Subsequent sightings of SCP-7293-1 during the month of December have reported it wearing a similar outfit.</td>

<tr>
<td>30/06/2022</td>
<td><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-ninth-world-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Site-78</a> Hallway 6B</td>
<td>During the 5th Siege of Hallway 6B, <a href="scp-6945.html">SCP-6945</a> summoned SCP-7293-1 from it's collected stockpile of snacks within the Site-78 breakroom. SCP-6945 then attempted to attack Site-78 security with SCP-7293-1 declaring the entity as its "war mount." SCP-7293-1 however turned back around and proceeded to raid the breakroom fridge instead before demanifesting. SCP-6945 was said to have incurred 150 dollars in damages to its "wares" as a result and has temporarily been discouraged from launching another containment breach.</td>

<p style="text-align: center;">He is meant to be on a diet</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">and the constant eating of sweet</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">sugary foods is not helping him lose weight</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">but he is very understanding and will not eat anything if you tell him not to</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In short</p>
