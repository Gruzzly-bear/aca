<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation surveillance arrays are to be on high alert for reports of YAMA events. Witnesses are to be interrogated and amnesticised. Discarded material, biological or otherwise, is to be processed and incinerated.</p>
<p>Provisional Site-9981/A has been assembled at █████████ in order to monitor SCP-9981 transmissions. To ensure database cleanliness, recorded instances should be filtered and transcribed prior to archival. Monitoring equipment must be destroyed (preferably by incineration) and replaced no less than once per month. Provisional Site-9981/A staff are to be rotated twice a year. The Site is currently manned by: <tt>Dr. Abigail Williams</tt>.</p>

<p>Spectrogram of SCP-9981 signal</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9981 is a radio broadcast in the ██-██ AM band, detectable on a five-kilometre stretch of beach between ██████ Point and █████ Point, on the southwestern coast of England. Each broadcast, which lasts between thirty seconds and five minutes, occurs at unpredictable intervals. Gaps between broadcasts vary, but are on average one week, with the shortest recorded interval being thirteen hours.</p>
<p>The transmission has a semantodissociative effect, causing the meaning of various forms of communication to become disjoined from their medium. This renders all storage devices ultimately unreliable, including the human brain.</p>
<p>Triangulation indicates a source apparently originating beneath the Earth’s surface, though reception through the intervening ~500 kilometres of rock should be impossible. The signal itself adheres to no known broadcasting standards, and often varies wildly over multiple bands even while active. Quality is poor, even to specialised receivers.</p>
<p>These broadcasts typically consist of two distinct phases:</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="items">
<ul>
<li>In the first phase, a series of tones and clicks, akin to a cetacean’s communication, are repeated six times. This takes up the majority of the broadcast.</li>
<li>In the second phase, a string of English words are spoken, often interrupted by interference or what seems to be background noise. These generally form comprehensible phrases, but the phrases do not cohere into full sentences. Phrases are vocalised in an Atlantic accent, and the speaker is noticeably tired, often pausing for breath.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>During both phases, a secondary signal in the infrasonic range is present. This signal is believed to be above the Nyquist frequency of the transmitter, as heavy aliasing is evident, and a higher sampling rate on the receiver reveals band limiting. It is thought that the purpose of the semantodissociative event is to obfuscate this underlying data, and the English transmission is only a side-effect.</p>
<p>Between four and five hours after a broadcast, a YAMA event occurs.</p>

<p>[Dr. Williams is sat at her dining table in Provisional Site-9981/A. In front of her is a laptop, which provides the only light in the room, and a mug of coffee. She has been writing classification training materials for junior researchers on her off-time for bonus compensation.]</p>
<p>[Williams is ranked in the 96th percentile for task bounty completions among researchers of her level.]</p>
<p>[Suddenly, she clenches her jaw and looks away from her screen, before raising her left hand to her face. Tension is evident across her shoulders and back. Her right hand tightens on her coffee.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Hm —</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Fuck it.</p>
<p>[She stands and stretches, hands brushing against the ceiling. She then retrieves her mug from the table and navigates to Provisional Site-9981/A’s kitchen. It is both cramped and cluttered.]</p>
<p>[Williams’ Organisation Index has been decreasing for fifteen consecutive weeks.]</p>
<p>[She sorts past various items of detritus, and retrieves a bottle of liqueur from a cabinet. After shuffling utensils to find a free spot on the counter for her mug, she pours 50mL into her coffee.]</p>
<p>[As she returns to her work, she passes by the sleeping form of her golden retriever, Peri.]</p>
<p>[She sits back at the table, and takes a sip from the mug, grimacing as she does so. She continues to fill out training material.]</p>
<p>[The temperature within the Site is 15 degrees Celsius. Outside, it is 2 degrees. Perimeter cameras confirm the surroundings of the Site are empty. There is nothing outside.]</p>

<hr/>
<p>Though YAMA events occur after each SCP-9981 broadcast, they do not occur exclusively after broadcasts. To date, the Foundation has recorded ███ events, and it is expected there are many more that have not been detected. However, undetected instances are likely to have been extremely low-impact.</p>
<p>YAMA events are targeted at isolated individuals, typically middle-aged, and can last between six hours and two weeks. Activity is not consistent over the period; targets are typically within some proximity to large bodies of water. Their isolation need not be physical; urban environments have been the epicentres of no less than 12 YAMA events.</p>
<p>During a YAMA event, the targeted individual will experience a variety of somatic, visual, and aural hallucinations. These include:</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="items">
<ul>
<li>A repeated sensation of being brushed or grabbed by hands on the back, neck, and shoulders.</li>
<li>The deepening of shadows beyond their natural level, so that even bright lights illuminate only a small area around their source.</li>
<li>Echoing of the target’s voice from the surrounding environment. Occasionally, the target will report that it seems as if their own voice is the echo.</li>
<li>A persistent feeling of being watched.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Individuals will also report sightings of entities designated SCP-9981-Λ. These are believed to be physically present, but very little about them is currently known. Targets often suffer perceptual interrupt and memory loss upon a direct sighting, and instances are generally evasive, only being seen for brief moments.</p>

<p><tt>The place was tiny, and yet too big. There were weeks where I was fine and then I’d see the coat I wore to meet her parents. Or the frame for the photo that I was too scared to put up.</tt></p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>And there was all this equipment, a billion obscure utensils, weird types of knives. She was going to teach me how to cook. Never got around to it.</tt></p>

<p>[Dr. Williams is now moderately inebriated. As she works, she jostles her mug, and spills cold coffee on the table, which is uncovered wood. The stain soaks into the grain as she watches.]</p>
<p>[She removes the laptop from the table, and then picks up the mug and inverts it.]</p>
<p>[Its contents empty and pour onto the floor. She hacks out a laugh.]</p>
<p>[She continues her work. The liqueur dries and forms an adhesive spot on the floor.]</p>
<p>[Williams’ socks touch it, and she winces in disgust. She rises to fetch cleaning supplies. They are not immediately available, and she grows more agitated as she searches for them.]</p>
<p>[Eventually, she gives up and takes another seat, far from the stain.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Sorry, morning me.</p>
<p>[From outside the dining room, Peri begins to bark.]</p>
<p>[Williams glances around toward the door into the foyer, past which is the kitchen and Peri’s spot.]</p>
<p>[Surveillance systems continue to scan the exterior. The grass waves gently in the wind. The few trees have no leaves to hide behind. The sky is black and choked with clouds.]</p>
<p>[Nothing is outside the Site.]</p>
<p>[Nothing knocks on the door.]</p>
<p>[Williams leaps to her feet, sending the chair skidding backwards. She moves quickly into the kitchen as she speaks, knocking aside a misplaced box on the floor.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Hey? Anyone out there?</p>
<p>[She reaches the kitchen. She has previously spent her Containment Credits on a self-defence weapon and stowed it here. She keeps her voice steady as she retrieves it.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> I can hear you! Is there something the matter? Do you need help?</p>
<p>[Williams carries the Glock G19 in her right hand and slowly walks toward the front door. Peri follows her out of the kitchen and into the foyer, barking continuously.]</p>
<p>[Williams runs her hand over Peri’s head.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Easy, boy. Quiet. Just someone in trouble.</p>
<p>[Audio devices briefly cut out across the Site. A quiet rustling can be heard in place of the regular feed.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS (unsteadily):</strong> Hey, ‘Ri. Been a while.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Why don’t you—</p>
<p>[She breathes deeply.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Come on in. I’ve missed you.</p>
<p>[Williams’ fists clench on the gun. She briefly checks the door and throws it open, scanning the field of view outside.]</p>
<p>[There is still nothing outside.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Whoever you are, using her voice?</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Fuck you.</p>
<p>[Williams exits, and locks the door, making sure Peri is inside. She checks the locks twice before leaving, but it does not matter.]</p>
<p>[I am already inside.]</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9981.1:</strong></p>
<p>Some 59 YAMA events are on record following an SCP-9981 transmission. The following is an illustrative list of the most characteristic incidents and their corresponding broadcasts.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>YAMA EVENT 3</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>TARGET:</strong> Kenneth Macdonald, Scottish farmowner, 45</p>
<p><strong>TESTIMONY:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Target regularly checks over his livestock after waking and before sleeping. During his morning rounds, he notes that they seem unusually agitated, and observes several acts of aggression. He particularly recalls three separate instances of maternal cannibalism. His sheep also fail to respond to the herding of his sheepdog, and simply stand in place as it approaches. When it closes the distance, the sheep attack.</p>
<p>Target spends the rest of the day caring for the injured hound, and contacts a veterinarian. During the night, he reports hearing lowing from an unexpected direction, and assumes this means a bull has escaped the enclosure. When he investigates, he finds himself beset by typical hallucinations, and becomes rapidly disoriented and distressed. After he finally regains his bearings, he finds he is only 500 metres from his home. Within, little has changed, but he reports a foul smell a few days later, prompting the call that alerted Foundation listeners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ASSOCIATED BROADCAST:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> ENTRY HEATS…SINGLE OBJECTIVE…PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER…BEGIN MEAL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> A careful search of the target’s home revealed that each drain had been filled with a dense mass of pulped muscular, osseous, and epidermal tissue. Unnoticed by the target, a pot pie had been added to the fridge (and was partially-consumed by the time agents arrived). The meat within was gamey, and DNA analysis showed all identifying nucleotides had been thoroughly destroyed.</p>
<p>Each oven in the home had been left on at minimal temperature.</p>

<p><strong>YAMA EVENT 14</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>TARGET:</strong> Marcus Veldman, wildlife researcher near Great Slave Lake, 38</p>
<p><strong>TESTIMONY:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Target works alone at a remote observation post studying wolf pack behavior in Canada. He feels that his reflections in various mirrors are not perfectly synchronised with his, and are very slightly delayed. Initially, he dismisses this as a symptom of exhaustion and overwork. He also notes that his meteorological systems give inexplicable readings, indicating the occasional presence of several small but dense formations, akin to tornados, though nothing is visible on the horizon.</p>
<p>As the day proceeds, his reflections grow more desynchronised, until ultimately while shaving he turns around and can observe the back of his own head. At this point, he reports significant distress, and strikes the mirror, smashing it. While nursing his hand, he checks the radar, which reports dozens of anomalous presences across the surveyed area. His last memory is of a shadow falling across his window at sunset, after which he awakens the next day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> FREE FOR ALL…OPEN GROUND…RESPECT HABITAT…GOURMET.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Survey of surrounding area notes unusual density of prey animals such as moose and elk, and an absence of bears. Further search locates several <em>Ursus arctos horribilis</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> which have expired due to cervical fracture.</p>

<p><strong>YAMA EVENT 26</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>TARGET:</strong> Officer James Chen, California county sheriff, 27</p>
<p><strong>TESTIMONY:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a late night stay at the jail, target is contacted over radio by a junior officer, who claims to have been involved in a serious car crash. Initially he calls emergency medical services, but cannot reach an operator, and the junior officer grows desperate, and asks for personal help. Officer fetches a shotgun and his K9 from the station kennels before setting off. Communication is marred by serious interference, but target follows his interlocutor’s directions into the local redwood forest.</p>
<p>Within the forest, his K9 begins to act distressed, pawing at the ground and growling constantly. He also reports a feeling of pressure on his ears and a building headache. Though it is a full moon, he also feels that it is unusually dim at ground-level in the forest itself. As he enters the forest, the pressure grows worse, and the junior officer’s voice begins to warble and grow distorted.</p>
<p>Eventually, the voice on the radio directs him to stop. At this point, he notices that he seems to hear the junior officer’s voice doubled. The second source is from an especially tall <em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>. As he looks up its branches, it seems to sway strongly in the wind, despite an apparent height of a hundred metres. Target immediately absconds, abandoning the radio, and returns to the station.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ASSOCIATED BROADCAST:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> HARD MODE…OBSTACLE INVOLABLE…PLAYER VERSUS ENVIRONMENT…TOUGH MEAT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Testimony seems to describe the effect of ultrasonics. Examination of police station found a shattered window, and one deceased K9 unit, mauled at the throat.. Target attributes break-in to a mountain lion, but damage to K9 carcass indicates typical canid aggression. Though target is unaware, the extraneous K9 is not accounted for before the YAMA event.</p>
<p>Large, spiraling patterns are present on the inside of the kennels. Though not anatomically correct, they superficially resemble fingerprints.</p>

<p><tt>But I knew my training, too, and when something calls you in the dead of night — you grab your gun. It hurt more than anything, it was like losing her again to admit that I needed it. But I grabbed my <em>fucking</em> gun.</tt></p>

<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Goodbye, Riya.</p>
<p>[As she looks back down the hill towards the Site, she notices something, and stiffens.]</p>
<p>[In the distance, against the scant lights of P██████, a pillar of darkness rises above the roof of Provisional Site-9981/A.]</p>
<p>[She takes off at a sprint, down the hill, towards me.]</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 9981.2:</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, a brief description of the current staffer at Provisional Site-9981/A, <tt>Dr. Abigail Williams</tt>, is included below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Williams was recruited by the Foundation at 21 as a junior Lab Integrity Assistant. She performed excellently in this role, exceeding the mean casualty-free period by three standard deviations, and was subsequently promoted to Biosafety Specialist. There she met Agent Riya Tripathi, and the two entered a relationship. Both individuals’ productivity increased thereafter, and so they were permitted to marry.</p>
<p>However, Tripathi was the target of a subversion campaign by GoI-056.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> In late ████, she attempted to defect alongside three other personnel during a field operation. She was a fatality in the ensuing firefight. Williams was not considered sufficiently loyal to be allowed this information, and so was given Cover Story 23, "MIA".</p>
<p>She did not cope well with the loss of Tripathi, and her utility plummeted. She stepped away from complex biosafety work, and instead began pursuing a career in the Researcher Training track. Her leisure time decreased 72%, but the quality of her work also declined significantly. As a result, she has been placed in the Experimental Containment Pool, and assigned to Provisional Site-9981/A.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>That overgrown puppy was the last thing I had. If — why didn’t you tell me this shit was coming? I <em>know</em> you knew, don’t give me that look.</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>If I had turned around five seconds later, if I had hesitated one more second for Ri— for the <em>thing</em> that wore Riya’s face.</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>I would never even have known what happened to Peri. Just like her.</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>[Williams arrives, gasping for breath, at the Site.]</p>
<p>[It crawls with shadows.]</p>
<p>[Peri can be heard yowling from within. A dark mass occupies the doorway, and stretches up into the sky.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Jesus <em>Christ</em>.</p>
<p>[She stops at the front lawn, where the floodlights flick on, illuminating me.]</p>
<p>[I am reaching and many and full, so full.]</p>
<p>[Hands reach down from the clouds, jointed dozens of times, covered in coarse and waxy skin. They are dotted with hairs, tumourously lumpy, and my fingers bend in incorrect directions.]</p>
<p>[As Williams watches in stunned silence, they pull free of the doorframe, holding something in my hands.]</p>
<p>[It is small and sweet and golden-furred. I am proud of it.]</p>
<p>[Williams shrieks in horror, and discharges her weapon. My limbs spasm in agony, and blood deluges across the grass.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Get the fuck —</p>
<p>[Peri thrashes fiercely, nipping at my phalanges. My grip is failing.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Come on, get it off of you, good boy, that’s it!</p>
<p>[She approaches me, heedless of my palms swaying like seagrass, and wrenches my joints aside.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Here, here, grab me! Come on, you’re here, just hold on.</p>
<p>[One finger casually bowls her over. She rises, staggering, and bites into a stray wrist, spitting out my blood before it can become hers.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Get OFF!</p>
<p>[My hands relinquish my work, and Williams pulls it away. I rise, away from sight, and am hidden from all things.]</p>
<p>[Peri makes her way to Williams’ side and stands on her hind legs, licking at her free hand.]</p>
<p>[She rushes with it into the Site, not looking back.]</p>
<p>[It has been damaged enormously; the walls are covered in gashes, and the kitchen cabinets have been torn open.]</p>
<p>[The floor and counters are strewn with wrecked utensils. A paring knife is embedded into the ceiling, twisted beyond use.]</p>
<p>[Williams takes in the scale of the damage.]</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> The —</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAMS:</strong> Worth it for you, buddy.</p>
<p>[She kneels and embraces Peri, who rumbles appreciatively.]</p>
<p>[Her shoulders shake silently.]</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 9981.3:</strong> On 25/03/2025, a YAMA event occurred at Provisional Site-9981/A. It was interrupted by the staffer present, who was awarded a week of paid leave for unscheduled service in the line of fire. The event was <em>not</em> preceded by a SCP-9981 broadcast. Instead, the broadcast occurred as the event concluded. A transcript is presented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> CLOSING CEREMONY.</p>
<p>[A repeated gulping sound can be heard.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> END OF PLAY.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9981:</strong> FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p>[The sound of grinding rock and the tearing of fibre. Whimpering is audible.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9981</strong>: SECOND PLACE.</p>
<p>[The sound of an aeroplane engine stuttering. Wind rushes in the background.]</p>
<p>[The broadcast continues in this manner for 59 instances in total.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the final SCP-9981 broadcast to date. The meaning of this transmission remains unknown.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a search of Provisional Site-9981/A revealed that the entire Site had been thoroughly upended, and was no longer suitable for Dr. Williams’ residence. A few elements are highlighted as being especially noteworthy:</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="items">
<ul>
<li>Scratches present across the foyer and dining-room walls. In one, a small shard of a claw has been embedded.</li>
<li>Approximately 5 litres of blood spilled across the floorboards and soaked into the carpeting on the stairs. It is of a thick consistency and does not congeal or dry. Transported to Site-19 for analysis.</li>
<li>One half of a spinal cord, coiled in a drawer in the kitchen. Genetic testing finds that it belongs to <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>. It is frayed at one end, as if it has been chewed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>On account of its cessation of activity, SCP-9981 has been tentatively reclassified as Neutralised. On account of exposure to material above their clearance, Williams was debriefed (see File-9981-Artin-Wollstone) and amnesticised. She has been reassigned to Hazardous Materials Handling alongside her animal companion for terminal employment.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>Is that what happened to her? Just grabbed out of the sky one night?</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>I still don’t understand anything. Why any of this happened, why me, why Riya. What the fuck was that thing <em>doing</em>?!</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>Not for me to know, I guess. Maybe I'm done with looking.</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><tt>If that's what it takes, to save the small things…</tt></p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9981 instances are too numerous and integrated into mundane society to meaningfully contain. The Foundation is to maintain logs of SCP-9981 locations, concentrations, movement patterns, and unusual activity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9981 do not reproduce, shed fur, or age. Otherwise, they are indistinguishable from mundane canids, and currently number approximately seven million across the globe. They are believed to represent a “conservation effort” by the entities responsible for YAMA events, as described in the previous iteration of this file. During each event, an SCP-9981 instance was created, identical in appearance to the nonanomalous canid which was consumed.</p>
