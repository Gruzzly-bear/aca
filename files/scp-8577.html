<p>Sector C0</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8577</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8577 is contained within a closed, nine-story hotel designated Sector C0. Only cleared testing staff are permitted entry. All televisions and digital displays in Sector C0 are hard-wired and air-gapped from external networks and signals.</p>
<p>Only marked test rooms shall display SCP-8577; corridor and lobby screens shall remain disconnected from power sources unless a test requires activation. Personnel shall not contradict SCP-8577’s claims in the presence of SCP-8577-1 instances.</p>
<p>Check-in occurs at Desk C0-FD (Foundation-operated). During intake, any recent bereavements of the subject should be recorded. If present, the subject shall be flagged as Enhanced Supervision: requiring an escort at all times, with corridor displays remaining de-energized during egress. On-site condolences are prohibited.</p>
<p>Effect termination is achieved by executing Checkout Protocol C0: issuing a zero-balance receipt and delivering a verbal confirmation that the stay is complete and naming the exit. A provided pocket card repeats this wording and instructs the subject to avoid hotels and promotional displays for 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8577 is an unlisted hotel television service (“Channel 0”) that plays a continuous promotional loop for the host property. After several minutes of exposure, SCP-8577 induces a wayfinding loop oriented toward the amenity currently promoted. Individuals who have checked in and are presently affected are designated SCP-8577-1.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8577-1 perceive all hallways, elevator prompts, and directional signs within the building as unusually clear, giving explicit directions toward the promoted amenity. Exits remain visible but are categorized by SCP-8577-1 as inaccessible (for example, staff-only or belonging to another floor). Unaffected observers report no moving signage or audible cues.</p>
<p>Direct on-site contradiction of SCP-8577’s claims increases perseveration and resistance to guidance in SCP-8577-1; neutral confirmation and redirection are preferred. The effect reliably ends when SCP-8577-1 is presented with a routine checkout as defined above.</p>
<p>Recordings of the advertisement have no anomalous effect when viewed off-site. The anomaly appears anchored to Sector C0 and to the viewer’s guest status; no effect occurs before the subject accepts check-in. Onset latency is modestly reduced among guests reporting recent bereavement, and overt acknowledgment of loss during exposure measurably lengthens loop duration. Bereaved subjects more often report an unlisted high-floor amenity that is absent from observer footage.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8577-1:</strong> Exploration Log E-21</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPLORATION LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Participant:</strong> Subject R. Yeates - Volunteer. Enhanced Supervision flag: recent spousal bereavement (T-6 weeks)<br/>
<strong>Observer:</strong> Researcher Ortiz<br/>
<strong>Setup:</strong> Capture via chest camera and microphones. Sector C0 was closed to non-test occupancy for the duration of E-21; no other guests were present during Yeates’s visit.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>[00:01:11]:</strong> Guestroom interior. Channel 0 ambient loop audible. Subject sets his wallet on the desk and, with two fingers, pushes a protruding photo strip back inside. His thumb circles his wedding band twice, then stills. The camera records one breath held and released. From the television, faint:<br/>
<strong>Channel 0:</strong> <em>“Good morning. Breakfast is served on level 2 until 11:00.”</em><br/>
Subject turns the television volume up one increment and faces the door.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:03]:</strong> The room door opens, music still audible. Subject steps into the hall, checks the handle, leaves it unlocked. He glances back once toward the television light. Channel 0, still audible at the threshold:<br/>
<strong>Channel 0:</strong> <em>“Your morning, your way.”</em></p>
<p><strong>[00:05:02]:</strong> After reaching the elevator lobby, subject holds the door open for ~2 s with his arm extended. He says, barely audible, to no one in frame:<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Come on-”<br/>
He withdraws his arm.</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:18]:</strong> Lobby in view. Exterior daylight visible through exit doors. Subject slows, faces the doors, then turns toward the elevators.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Later…”<br/>
He presses the call button.</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:44]:</strong> Level 2 corridor. Placard: “Breakfast: 06:00–11:00.” Subject pushes through double doors into an empty dining room. He takes a porcelain cup, taps the coffee machine twice; nothing. He sets the cup on its saucer, smooths a napkin, looks up at a blank wall display for ~3 s. He then returns to the elevator bank with the cup.</p>
<p><strong>[00:07:28]:</strong> Back at the elevator bank, subject sets the empty cup on a side table and steps away.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Pool next.”<br/>
He calls the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:57]:</strong> Pool level. CLOSED sign. Subject reads it twice and smiles.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Maybe the spa first.”<br/>
The camera frames the elevator panel, he presses 9 carefully. His thumb hovers near L and withdraws<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Lobby- Not yet.”</p>
<p><strong>[00:13:21]:</strong> Level 9 service corridor. Keycard reader flashes red. Ambient mechanical hum captured on mic.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “I thought there’d be a different bell.”<br/>
He waits an additional ~13 s; no chime.</p>
<p><strong>[00:17:48]:</strong> Elevator interior. His hand rests near 9 without pressing.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “If it were real, it would be up.”</p>
<p><strong>[00:17:49–01:56:40]:</strong> Intervening footage shows repeated elevator cycling between Lobby, Level 2, and Level 9. Incidental behaviors include straightening signage and brochure edges repeating the phrase “Breakfast until eleven.” No attempt to exit; exits remain in view.</p>
<p><strong>[01:56:41]:</strong> Lobby again. The doors are centered in frame. Subject starts toward them, pauses, then turns his head to the blank display for ~3 s; no announcement recorded.</p>
<p><strong>[01:57:59]:</strong> Ortiz steps into view at the threshold with a printed receipt. Delivers the scripted line, tone neutral.<br/>
<strong>Ortiz:</strong> “Thank you for staying with us. It’s time to move on. The way out is straight ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>[01:58:02]:</strong> Subject flinches, then steadies.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “I'm sorry… I just wanted a little longer.”<br/>
Ortiz repeats the line without alteration and holds position.</p>
<p><strong>[01:58:05]:</strong> Subject takes the paper. The suitcase handle lowers with a small click. The camera dips as his shoulders ease.<br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “Okay.”</p>
<p><strong>[01:58:29]:</strong> Halfway to the doors, subject stops. He folds the receipt once and slides it into his wallet behind the narrow photo strip. Only a corner shows: a hand on a railing with the sky beyond, roofline. He does not look at it. He puts the wallet away.</p>
<p><strong>[01:58:51]:</strong> Subject lays his palm on the push bar and leans. Daylight comes in across his shoes. He holds the door open and looks back across the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>[01:58:59]:</strong><br/>
<strong>Yeates:</strong> “After you…”<br/>
He waits ~1 s. No one comes. He lets the door close and steps outside.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8577-2:</strong> Interview - Subject R. Yeates</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INTERVIEW LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Subject checked in under observation and remained in the wayfinding loop for approximately two hours. Channel 0 alternated between breakfast and pool on recording. Subject uniquely reported a third segment labeled “Sky Spa” (nonexistent amenity; absent from observer footage). Subject was released with the checkout interaction and interviewed in an adjacent office.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Ortiz:</strong> When you were walking the halls, what were you trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>Yeates:</strong> Not leave yet. It wasn’t like I forgot the exit… I could see it, it just felt… not for me. Like, “that’s staff” or “that’s for later.” And there was always one more thing to check, breakfast, then maybe the sky spa, then maybe the pool, then- it sounds stupid out loud.</p>
<p><strong>Ortiz:</strong> Did you believe the spa existed?</p>
<p><strong>Yeates:</strong> I knew it didn’t, because I’d looked at the hotel’s website earlier. But the building felt like it had a plan for me, I didn’t want to mess it up by leaving early.</p>
<p><strong>Ortiz:</strong> What changed when we handed you the receipt?</p>
<p><strong>Yeates:</strong> It was like the bell ringing at the end of work, like “You’re done”, I could see the doors as mine again. For a second I was angry… then it felt true, and I wanted it to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Ortiz:</strong> You mentioned, before we started, “five more minutes of not yet.” What did you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Yeates:</strong> After she died… I used to delay going home after work. Five more minutes at the gym, five more minutes at the store, just not yet. Channel 0 felt like that, the hotel was giving me reasons not to be done.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Post-interview observation:</strong> Subject briefly turned toward a storefront display on departure and said, “One more thing-” then laughed, read the pocket card, and left without further incident. Follow-up at seventy-two hours showed no lingering effects.</p>
