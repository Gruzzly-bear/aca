<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4166-1 is a female human class-C reality bender responsible for the creation of SCP-4166-2 and SCP-4166-3. It displays numerous psychological ailments, including aversion to men, fear of sleeping, PTSD, and suicidality.</p>
<p>Medical analysis has discovered significant scarring on the palms, feet, and genital area. Additionally, SCP-4166-1 develops cachexia if not administered 1 cc of human semen weekly.</p>
<p>Every seven days, or in times of increased distress, SCP-4166-1 manifests an instance of SCP-4166-2 (if one does not currently exist) within an adjoining room or corridor.</p>
<p>SCP-4166-2 is a psychovisual-blackbody humanoid with cognitihazardous properties. Upon manifestation, SCP-4166-2 enters the room containing SCP-4166-1 through the primary method of entry, regardless of barriers. It then attempts to approach SCP-4166-1.</p>
<p>If SCP-4166-1 retains the memory of containment of SCP-4166-2, SCP-4166-2 proceeds to take action to counteract previous methods of containment, up to and including manifesting with weaponry.</p>
<p>Upon termination, SCP-4166-2 instances demanifest instantaneously.</p>
<p>SCP-4166-3 is a three-phase mental illness<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> affecting individuals who have observed an active instance of SCP-4166-2<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>SCP-4166-1 was raised in a Catholic orphanage twelve years prior to the hospitalization of Father █████ in an apparent case of spontaneous combustion. Six days afterwards, the first manifestation of SCP-4166-2 occurred on 07-24-2008. During this manifestation, a gunshot attracted the attention of the nuns. Upon entering the room, they found SCP-4166-1 alone, holding a pistol at the entrance to its room. Authorities were notified of the incident, leading to the retrieval of SCP-4166</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Psychologist ██████ ███</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Intake session done shortly after acquisition, on 07-26-2008.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 13:21&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-4166-1.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> Uh. I… would prefer if you. Didn't call me that. Please.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Apologies. Do you have a preferred manner of address?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I'm… fuck.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> No, I mean. I, well. I don't. Have anything I'd particularly like to be called. I guess uh…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 remains in silence for a few moments.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> Just. Call me uh, [SCP-4166-1] I guess? That's just my family name. Haven't picked out a new one yet.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Very well then. It is my pleasure to meet you, [SCP-4166-1].</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for a full minute.]</em></p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> [SCP-4166-1]? Are you okay?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for ten minutes as Junior Psychologist ███ continues to take notes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> Haha. Uh. I guess I can't not speak this time.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> You're free to take your time. I'm here for as long as you need.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I… thanks. But I meant… I want to. I, uh. Intakes, right? You want to know what my deal is. You want to help. I want to help you help. So. Uh. Brace yourself? It's uh. You should.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Sure, [SCP-4166-1].</p>
<p><em>[Ten seconds elapse.]</em></p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Alright. I'm ready when you are.</p>
<p><em>[Twenty seconds elapse.]</em></p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> [SCP-4166-1]?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I was um. Er… like. you know? I. You know what I mean, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> I'm… afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> Uh. God, uh. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> It's alright. Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> Yeah.. I know. I <em>know</em>. I just. God. It's hard to say. It's impossible to say. I hoped it would be obvious what my damage is, you know? I guess not though. You already know a lot of my personality from asking the nuns.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Yes, they told me a lot about you. How hard working you were, how devout. Albeit fearful without reason at times. They really did —</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> You, they didn't tell you about… About me? Shit, I mean, I, I was? I am? I am those things. Or was? I don't know anymore. God. Did they tell you anything about, about uh, that?</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Could you clarify?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> … No.</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for a minute.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> … I'm sorry. I feel so useless. So fucking pathetic. Why? Why does it have to be so fucking hard to just fucking say what I mean? I wish I could just… say it, I wish I could face it. I just. I. Do… Do you have a pen?</p>
<p><strong>███:</strong> Oh, uh. Let me check. Yeah, I do. But, I just want to tell you… it's fine. You're being extremely hard on yourself for not being able to talk about things which are <em>hard to talk about</em>. My entire job is to help people find the words to process what they've gone through, and then to help them figure out how to move on from it. You aren't useless or pathetic. So, here you go, here's a pen. Let's start from the beginning, if that's okay.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I… hated the church. I hated being there. I hated being there and feeling like I was sin. Like I was sin incarnate. They treated me like that, you know? I was five. They didn't know how to deal with me when I started being "symptomatic". <em>[SCP-4166-1 grimaces.]</em> They called it weakness of the flesh. When I'd cry, or say things I wasn't supposed to, or do, uh, things inappropriate for my age. I was hit. I was shunned. I was made to repent.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I was worthless. I was a demon. And every Sunday, they made me sit in the pews and listen about how the demonic, the satanic was to be rejected, to be shunned, to be hated. So I started talking to the only one I felt I could. I started talking to the devil.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 begins to tear up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> And eventually, after years and fucking years of being hit and being dirtied, I made a deal, you know? I made a deal to make it fucking stop. I made a deal to make him pay. To make him burn like I did, to <em>feel</em> like how he made me. But that was for a price, of course. I made the deal in exchange for having to seduce and sleep with a dude once a week. But I was, pardon my French, a fucking slut back then. Fucking <em>horrible</em>. Christ. Christ. So, so I didn't care. It was a fucking <em>upside</em> to me. God. God. Christ. Forgive me.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-1 clutches its temple with both hands, pressing into its eyes with its palms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> For the first time in my fucking life I felt powerful. I felt in control. I got the power to kill him and I didn't even fucking do that right. I should've known demons don't die so easily.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-2 manifests.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4166-1:</strong> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4166-2 begins approaching SCP-4166-1. Emergency containment protocol ECP-166 initiated.]</em> —losing it. I should've been better than that. I have to be. I'd like to, I'd like to stop for today.</p>
