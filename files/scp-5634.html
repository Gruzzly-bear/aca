<p><em>The following revision was used from 1891-1930.</em></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5634 is to be allowed total and complete autonomy unless otherwise stated. Any civilians attempting to enter SCP-5634 will be pressured away from SCP-5634’s perimeter by force under the guise of border security.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5634 was a self declared nationstate comprised of the townships of St. Joseph, Felson, and Neche in Pembina County, North Dakota, USA. SCP-5634 existed for a period of 37 years (1893-1930) under the name “The Agrarian Union of Neche”, in which time it was able to create its own currency, military, and government. Residents of SCP-5634 henceforth referred to as SCP-5634-2, gradually became anomalous in nature during the period in which SCP-5634 existed, assumedly due to breeding with the anomalous (assumed to be) native inhabitants of SCP-5634. Anomalous effects vary widely but consist mainly of physical mutations, which include an unexplainable level of strength, speed, and polymelia (primarily in the legs and arms). Many of these effects harm those effected in some way, causing average anomalous inhabitants of SCP-5634 to live for an average of roughly 40 years (according to documents written by SCP-5634’s physician Douglas Olson, see <em>Addendum-5634-I</em>).</p>

<p>A-5634-A ("Declaration of Independence")</p>
<p>The following document was recovered from the National Farmers Museum in Neche, and is SCP-5634's "Declaration of Independence".</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Declaration of Independence</strong></span><br/>
<sub>of the Great Agrarian Union</sub></p>
</div>
<p>We the people and workers of Neche, Saint Josephs, and Felson collectively declare independence from the false and backward "Union" of States whom continue to swipe the rights of the agrarian and of the people, due to the crimes mentioned in this document, which this council hereby claim to be an irredeemable and unforgivable offense even to the lord above.</p>
<p><strong>List of Unforgiveables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The taxation of the worker to a degree most unfavorable and illegal.</li>
<li>The attacks by Union forces due to our acts of retaliation which we do deem to be right with God and with the rights previously bestowed to us by your false articles and douments.</li>
<li>The deaths of over twenty just south of Neche.</li>
<li>The imperialistic actions of the Union in the Dakota area, primarily the conflict with the Sioux.</li>
<li>The imperialistic actions of the Union outside of the Dakota area, namely Korea, Mexico, and other areas where fellow agrarians were slain.</li>
<li>The clear prosecution of those with traits unique to that of the average man, some of who had been members of this very council.</li>
<li>The “confiscation” of hunting rifles, pistols, and other tools explicitly kept for self defense (which were keenly permitted by your articles).</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>(List continues for 2 more pages, for details see Document 5634/Miscellaneous/LoU.)</em></p>
<p>With this document we declare ourselves independent, and in a state of war with the false States of the Union.</p>

<p>The following document is a medical report written by Douglas Olson. The public unveilment of this document led to a surge of “anti-unique” activity, and boosted “anti-unique” political parties. These parties would eventually win an election in 1928 with candidate Robert Gibson, who took almost dictatorial power of 5634-society within a year.</p>

<p>Freaks, the lot of them.<br/>
