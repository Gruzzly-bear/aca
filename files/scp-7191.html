<p>SCP-7191-A (Current Picture).</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7191</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-7191 is contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site-17 and is to be provided with a portable oxygen tank alongside standard amenities. All proposals concerning SCP-7191-B extraction are to be sent to Dr. Barrack for review.</span></p>
<p>SCP-7191 is held in a containment chamber installed with a built-in ventilation system at Site-17 and is medically restrained to their bed. Personnel must adorn respirators and flame-retardant coverings before entering the chamber. In the event that signs of leakage or ventilation breakdown are present, the attending supervisor is to be notified immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7191 is an 11-year-old male humanoid of Chinese-American descent (formerly known as Collin Tian). SCP-7191 possesses an extra-dimensional space in the form of SCP-7191-A, a marble cave-like structure superimposed on their nasopharynx. SCP-7191-A is host to tunnels, cenotes, speleothems in addition to various mining-based materials.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-7191 has a tangible effect on SCP-7191-A, as the entity's head movements or coughs result in the space temporarily changing gravity or be afflicted with tremors respectively. SCP-7191-A is not miniaturized and retains the actual corresponding size to that of non-anomalous caverns. Despite this, SCP-7191 is not weighed down by SCP-7191-A and has freedom of movement. SCP-7191 is overall not negatively affected by SCP-7191-A with the exception of indirectly causing its dyspnea, which can be alleviated via oxygen therapy.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Prior to containment, SCP-7191 was born with multiple nasal-related disorders that worsened during its development. On 09/22/2022, SCP-7191's mother had taken the entity for a scheduled doctor's appointment, during which attending physicians were astonished to witness SCP-7191-A. The Foundation was alerted to the situation and amnestized all relevant parties. SCP-7191 was then subsequently transferred to Site-17.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong> Post-containment, an in-depth inspection of SCP-7191-A was performed through endoscopic technology. There, researchers discovered SCP-7191-B, a series of mineral deposits located throughout the anomaly. Individual SCP-7191-B instances not only hold native elements expected in underground mining, but also contain exceedingly excessive amounts of rare, artificial, and even anomalous metals such as <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-073">Beryllium Bronze</a> and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-fellow-scholar">Morgana Silver</a>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">However, SCP-7191-A is completely absent of fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal.</span></p>
<p>The revelation that SCP-7191-B-related material are identical to their original counterparts and carry zero risk of anomalous contamination, combined with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932023_global_chip_shortage">ongoing global chip crisis</a> convinced Site Director Thomas Graham to assign Dr. Barrack to SCP-7191's case to see if the entity was suitable for potential thaumiel class status.</p>
<p>Although SCP-7191-B are capable of being mined, the diminutive size of SCP-7191-A's entrance and the impracticality of maneuvering the drill made extraction largely inefficient. Dissatisfied, Director Graham gave Dr. Barrack a strict deadline to bypass the 'obstacle' at hand or risk demotion. This issue was further exacerbated when SCP-7191 was beginning to reluctantly cooperate with staff, as extractions always caused the entity immense discomfort.</p>
<p>To amend this, Dr. Barrack attempted to regain SCP-7191's compliance through enticement as he continued the struggle finding an optimal solution for his predicament.</p>

<p><em>[SCP-7191 is seated by the table, holding their hands and slowly swaying in their chair. The entity rubs their eyes when they notice the one-way mirror. SCP-7191 rubs their mask, sighs, then rests their head. The testing chamber's door opens.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack and several researchers pushing utility carts enter the chamber. Upon noticing them, SCP-7191 moves up from their seat and folds their arms. The entity looks to the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Hey champ, how you doin'?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 mutters under their breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> I'm sorry, can you repeat that son?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> …I-I'm fine—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 abruptly slides down their mask and coughs loudly. The entity massages their throat when they observe the carts. SCP-7191 posture stiffens.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> SCP… Collin, can you sit back down? Nothing will happen, I promise. I just want to… give you something.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> …O… O-Okay…</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 slowly sits down, hands and shoulders visibly shaking. Dr. Barrack orders a researcher to bring one of the carts closer to the table. SCP-7191 covers their eyes as Dr. Barrack removes the cloth. The entity's breath shudders and respirates deeply when the sound of lighter flickering is heard.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 pulls away their hands. Dr. Barrack is using a barbecue lighter to ignite the candles on a white large rectangular cake. Although much of the font is illegible from this angle, the words "HAPPY" and "12TH" can be seen written on the surface with purple frosting.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Um?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 looks at the other carts, various sweets and pizza resting on them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> I don't get it. Is this another test?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack chuckles and pours a glass of chocolate milk on the table. He is wearing a party hat and a polka-dot styled tie.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Nope, no testing. It's a… reward.</p>
<p><em>[Researchers begin transferring the dishes from the carts onto the table. SCP-7191 looks on in disbelief.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Reward?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Mm-hmm. Consider it a gift from me to you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 reads the lettering.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Oh… thank you? But it's not my birthday—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Consider it an <em>early</em> birthday then. I figured it was overdue for all the nice, <em>wonderful</em> hard work you've been doing.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack gives SCP-7191 a spare party hat. SCP-7191 looks towards the glass, reaches for it and takes a sip. Visibly elated, the entity quickly downs its contents.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> So… cool… this is awesome! Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Hey, don't mention bud. What are <em>friends</em> for?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Yeah, thank you so much and… oh wow! Does that mean the tests have finished?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack expresses an exaggerated frown.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Sorry, champ, but that's not in cards.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Oh… because of my shiny boogers?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Yes, right on the nose… pun unintended. Collin, I know it sucks but if we don't remove them soon… it'll just cause more health problems in the long run. Y'know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Oh… okay.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack slides the cake closer to the entity. Dr. Barrack fills himself and the entity's glass with more chocolate milk.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> But it's not going to be forever, I promise. When we eventually remove all those, heh, <em>boogers</em> out, you can go back home. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> You said 'promise' twice—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Anyways we should get this party started before your cake melts. Vanilla ice cream cake. Your favorite.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 smiles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Thank you so much. I'll try to do my best.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> [Laughs] I'm sure you will.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 removes their mask. As they do so, the entity frowns.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Something wrong, champ?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Sorry, Mr. Barrack. I've just been getting this gross smell all day. Is that normal?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> Ah, that's probably the new nasal spray we've been given you. It'll pass. Eh… just not to exert your lungs far more than you have to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7191:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 inhales, leans close to the candles, and exhales. A bright light flash emanates from the table, instantaneously followed by a loud bang, then smoke. Attending researchers are bewildered and disoriented.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrack:</strong> T-T-The fuck?! What the hell is… Ow! Ow… why—</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Barrack gasps. An eyeball is floating in his glass of chocolate milk and teeth are embedded in his arm. Dr. Barrack stares at the table in horror. SCP-7191 is sitting in their seat; fire and smoke emerge from their head.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-7191 sways widely, then falls onto the cake. The cake quickly melts as the table catches on fire. The fire alarm blares as Dr. Barrack watches from a distance, stunned. Researchers begin to panic as the fire spreads to SCP-7191's clothing.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A researcher pulls on the fire extinguisher on the wall as security enter the room.]</em></p>

<p>SCP-7191-A was inspected in the immediate aftermath, uncovering recently-drilled sections containing trace amounts of methane. Investigators deduced that prior to the events of Addendum-01, the entity was subjected to standard SCP-7191-B extraction that early morning. However, the research team had inadvertently perforated into a reservoir of natural gas, causing it to leak throughout SCP-7191-A. SCP-7191 didn't suffer the effects of the gas flooding into their respiratory tract due to the aforementioned small entrance to SCP-7191-A and the sufficient oxygen it was being supplied with.</p>
<p>The resulting explosion caused the irrevocable destruction of SCP-7191's facial muscles, bones, and organs. The entity was also afflicted with substantial brain damage, causing it to undergo a deep coma. As SCP-7191 was placed in its current containment chamber, Site Director Graham drafted disciplinary measures for Dr. Barrack. Resources were also allocated to SCP-7191 for experimental reconstruction surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-02:</strong> Several days after, the combustion within SCP-7191 ceased completely. Another endoscopic exploration found that while SCP-7191-A was significantly damaged, a large portion of SCP-7191-B was not. The introduction of the enlarged opening on SCP-7191 allowed the application of drones to venture into and extract SCP-7191-B more efficiently and easier than prior attempts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the explosion unearthed more tunnels, leading to more caverns containing a massive overabundance of SCP-7191-B instances, even more than those located by the entrance. Months later, it was concluded that SCP-7191-A has no measurable length or depth, and is presumed to be infinite. Site Director Graham congratulated the research team's endeavors on finding a workaround solution for the preliminary issue, granting them more permits and permissions.</p>
<p>Dr. Barrack was granted the opportunity for a promotion, but ultimately declined it. Dr. Barrack has drafted proposals citing up advocacy of siphon resources that are now primarily allocated to mining-based expenditures back to reconstruction surgery. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-17-hub">The proposal was declined</a>.</p>
