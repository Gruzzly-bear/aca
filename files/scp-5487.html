<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
</div>
<p>SCP-5487 is the designation for the anomalous stimulant drug called "Cardocran", often nicknamed "Cardo". While SCP-5487 acts similarly to cocaine, its anomalous properties occur on its effect as a triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI): it approximately triples its efficiency while also removing its dependency issues on its subject.</p>
<p>While SCP-5487 can be used as an alternative to cocaine, cocaine cannot be used as an alternative to 5487.</p>
<p>5487 is unable to be created without anomalous technology. It is currently unknown who created SCP-5487.</p>
<div class="heading">
<p><strong>ITEM HISTORY</strong></p>
</div>
<p>A version of SCP-5487 was discovered on the market by Foundation agents stationed in Miami, Florida, who later notified the Foundation. The compound was analyzed, and the 5487 designation was given to the drug.</p>
<p>A subdivision of the Special Crimes Investigative Division (SCID) in Miami was created to combat the appearance and use of veil-breaking drugs to the general public.</p>

Cardocran has recently shown up again in the market labeled as "Cardonian Cocaine", described as a high-quality variant of cocaine stemming from the (fictional) Cardonia region of Peru.
<p>Analysis performed on the seized cardocran shows this does not appear to be the same type of cardocran sent to us by the Foundation. An operation will shortly be put in place to determine the source of this new cardocran. If we can nab the buyers, we can get them to give us the sellers.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes out. Miami Vice has agreed to work with us on this one, considering it seems like they've been hit hard with this kind of thing popping up again.<br/></p>

<hr/>
<p>OPERATION YELLOWJACKET is a sting operation that will be conducted by the SCID with the help of MPD Vice on the afternoon of July 18th, 1987.</p>
<p>The operation will commence at approximately 10:30, where SCID special teams will set up in the buildings around the main plaza of Hortin Marina.<br/>
These teams will provide covering fire and/or general support should the sting go wrong, and are equipped with tear gas. Designated long-range combatants will be armed with M16A1 rifles from MPD SWAT.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hernandez and Captain Peters will be occupying an unmarked squad car from across the street for immediate support. Several other places (see Document OYJ.02 for specific placement) will also contain plainclothes or otherwise disguised officers.</p>
<p>At 11:00, Detectives Richard Garrett and Manuel Acosta (undercover as sellers "Brad" and "De la Cruz") will meet the buyers. They will be accompanied by Foundation liaison Haskell, who is masquerading as a middleman. Acosta will also be outfitted with a wire to listen in on the conversation.</p>
<p>Once the buyers trade off the money and receive the cardocran, they are to be immediately arrested. The MPD will be around on standby for the SCID's signal.</p>
<p>Should any of the plan deviate or if it is apparent that the situation will escalate, the sting is to be immediately ended and the area secured by the SCID and MPD.</p>

<div class="heading">
<p><strong>ON YELLOWJACKET</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Due to an oversight in planning and an unprecedented violation in operations scale within the SCID, YELLOWJACKET led to the injuries of several officers in the SCID as well as the FBIUIU. The cause of the shootout was also investigated; it was found to be caused by the misjudgment of SCID Captain James Peters, who mistakenly thought UIU Agent Ivanovic was pulling out a pistol.</p>
<p>Captain Peters has been demoted and put on unpaid administrative leave for a month.</p>
<div class="heading">
<p><strong>ON UIU PRESCENCE</strong></p>
</div>
<p>A unit of the FBIUIU was present at the time of the incident to carry out a sting operation against Foundation researchers possibly selling small amounts of SCP-5487 to the general public. Further investigation into this claim has uncovered a chain of misunderstandings stemming from a partnership with the UIU, curated by ████, over proceedings and undercover operations including the use of 5487. No other UIU presence was determined within the recent events.</p>
<p>The FBIUIU has admitted their mistake over their wrongly-implemented investigation and misunderstanding of ████'s good intentions.</p>
<div class="heading">
<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Further investigation into illegal production and distribution of SCP-5487 will be henceforth operated by the main branch of the Foundation. The SCID will be limited to low-level operations (with prior Foundation approval) and executing specific stakeouts/raids as given by the Foundation. This agreement will continue indefinitely until the Foundation believes the SCID is capable enough to handle such large cases without prompting or promoting unacceptable incidents.</p>
<p>The failure of YELLOWJACKET rests squarely on each and every involved member of the SCID.</p>

</div>
<br/>
An early prototype of SCP-5487 was discovered after a project to improve medical cocaine via SCP-914 adjustment. Foundation personnel eventually stabilized the most flagrant side-effects of the 5487 prototypes and codified them into the final SCP-5487 drug.
<p>Following the lead of PENTAGRAM in drug-related offerings, the Foundation dispersed the process of making 5487 to certain anomalous groups with the intention of receiving payments on its licensing. After enough money was circulated through this process to support the Foundation's own 5487 production cycle, the Special Crimes Investigative Division (SCID) in Miami was employed to unknowingly remove most major competitors.</p>
<p>Despite a recent altercation over SCP-5487 involving the FBIUIU, SCID, and MPD-Vice, the major 5487 operation was not affected. Fault was placed on Foundation Liaison Mike Haskell and SCID Lieutenant Jaimie Hernandez, who were later terminated. Internal Agent Peters has been commended for his service in quickly bringing the affair to a close.</p>
<p>The 5487 operation will continue as long as it is profitable for the Foundation to do so.</p>
