<p>Documentation of SCP-1574 manifestation.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1574</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All movements made by SCP-1574 are to be tracked and reported by Foundation agents stationed in the states of Mexico, Cuba, the United States, and other nations near or within the Gulf of Mexico. Any changes to its appearance are to be logged, in addition to any changes to its location. Currently, work on disabling SCP-1574's cloaking mechanism is ongoing. Any subjects witnessing SCP-1574's anomalous properties are to be issued Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-1574 begins approaching a Foundation site, or other area known to house anomalous items, the area is to be evacuated, and all anomalous items removed until SCP-1574 passes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1574 is a roughly spherical object of extraterrestrial origin, 1.63 meters in diameter and capable of moving in any direction.</p>
<p>SCP-1574 has never been directly observed, due a perception-altering effect it emits on any living subject capable of observing it. This causes the subject to believe they are perceiving a variety of other objects, partially logged in this document. This is believed to be a cloaking effect, to allow SCP-1574 easy access to surveillance locations without being seen. Analysis by other methods has shown SCP-1574's actual shape, but testing to observe it further is ongoing.</p>

<p>The movement pattern displayed by SCP-1574 is erratic and apparently random, usually taking it through rural areas of Mexico and Cuba, and waters bordering those states. It has been known to make brief excursions to other states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, but these occur more rarely. It moves at a constant speed of 20 kph, with altitude varying between 1 and 16 meters off of the ground. As of ██/██201█, no major population centers have been targeted by SCP-1574, but this has not been eliminated as a possibility.</p>
<p>Various radio broadcasts have been recorded to emit from SCP-1574, usually directly following an alteration to its appearance. Prior to 1935, these broadcasts were incomprehensible to Foundation Xenocryptographers. However, since 09/03/1935, all transmissions made by SCP-1574 have used terrestrial languages, spliced together from various media programs.</p>
<p>SCP-1574 was first observed on 12/15/1927, as a meteorite heading towards earth. Following impact, SCP-1574's anomalous properties were observed by Foundation personnel, leading to its classification as an anomalous object. SCP-1574 was documented as an SCP on 11/23/1941, and classified as Euclid. Following SCP-1574's manifestation on 09/18/2012, it has been reclassified as Keter.</p>
