<p>SCP-5853 Unwrapped and illuminated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-5853 products are subject to public recall. Supplies of SCP-5853 are to be contained in a standard containment unit at Secure Facility 64, Wing-F. Any instances of SCP-5853 discovered being sold are to be immediately intercepted.</p>
<p>All episodes of SCP-5853-A have been removed from air and scans for further television broadcasts and online video are to be performed with positive returns to be expunged from their respective platforms. Under no circumstances may any Foundation personnel<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> that have children or are considering parenthood be assigned to SCP-5853.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5853 are packaged taffy confections. Each package of SCP-5853 contains two candies: one blue - raspberry flavored, and one red - cherry flavored. While the blue candy has thus far shown no anomalous effects, any individual who consumes the red SCP-5853, after reciting the key phrase, will be transported to an extra-dimensional space. This space coincides with the features of “Ticky Taffy Town”, henceforth referred to as “SCP-5853-A”, a 90’s era television program that advertised SCP-5853 prominently.</p>
<p>The anomaly was brought to the attention of the Foundation by way of the UIU, who had become aware of an apparent correlation between disappearances of children and the airing of SCP-5853-A. SCP-5853 is theorized to be responsible for the disappearances of an estimated 3500 children between the years 1994-1999.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: darkred"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853 Document File 1: Discovery</span></strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Notable connections between child disappearances are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Parents of missing children have reported that their child was last seen within, or assumed to be heading into, a kitchen pantry.</p>
<p>2. Upon searching for missing children, the only evidence found in the vicinity were open Ticky-Taffy wrappers. In all cases the cherry-flavored portion was not present, leaving the blue raspberry portion.</p>
<p>3. The previously aired episode of SCP-5853-A had the appearance of a secondary character, “Mr. Hister”.</p>
<p>4. In all cases in which the parent was nearby upon the disappearance of the child, music of the show’s theme song could be heard.</p>
<p>The anomaly was relinquished from the UIU to the Foundation following the disappearance of a UIU operative’s child. Formal request for SCP designation was sent to Administration with notable documentation contained henceforth.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Physical descriptions and characteristics of the 5 main “characters”, henceforth referred to as “entities”, of SCP-5853-A:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853-A-1</span>:</strong><br/>
<em>Mr. Squibbles</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span> A bipedal humanoid figure with the head of a plush octopus. Entity is approximately 3.2 meters in height and consistently wears khakis and a red sweater vest.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality:</span> Takes the role of a father figure within SCP-5853-A. Has a patient and benevolent manner, and often touts the episode’s lesson.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853-A-2</span>:</strong><br/>
<em>Mrs. Bobble</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span> A female entity dressed in attire similar to that of a stereotypical clown, with blue hair, white makeup, red nose and an over-sized, multi-colored blouse and cargo pants.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality:</span> Entity is often portrayed as a bringer of questions to SCP-5853-A-1 concerning the day’s lesson or theme.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853-A-3</span>:</strong><br/>
<em>Kizzy Wink</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span> A small entity roughly 1 meter in height that resembles a bipedal feline. Possesses humanoid hands and an oversized head in comparison to the size of the remainder of its body.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality:</span> Entity is often the perpetrator of the events that illicit the need for a daily lesson and theme. Often benign, but mischievous, the entity is the surrogate avatar for the young audience.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853-A-4</span>:</strong><br/>
<em>Franzipans</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span> A small, rotund, plush-like avian entity roughly 0.3 meters in both length and wingspan. Entity has an anthropomorphic hammer in place of a beak. Despite its small wingspan, entity is able to fly and will often hit the other entities as a form of physical comedy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality:</span> Appears to be the companion pet of SCP-5853-A-3, often annoying SCP-5853-A-1.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853-A-5</span>:</strong><br/>
<em>Mr. Hister</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span> A 2.3 meters high, presumably male<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> humanoid entity with a long, golden-yellow hooded-robe. Entity uses tentacles that emerge from beneath its cloak as a means of transport. Attempts at obtaining facial descriptions have proven difficult due to the significant distorting effects it has on SCP-5853-A recordings when entering the video frame. Current attempts to describe its face note that it resembles a misshapen, tumorous human skull.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality:</span> While the entity is not depicted as hostile by SCP-5853-A, it is visually and verbally disturbing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: darkred"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5853 Document File 3: Critera &amp; Relevant Info</span></strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>All episodes of SCP-5853-A that contain SCP-5853-A-5, typically start with hyper-colorized, pleasant lighting and tone, as consistent with that of children’s programing. The main cast of entities (SCP-5853-A-1 — 4) will act as normal throughout the first half of the episode while learning about the day’s lesson. Teachings include tying shoes, the importance of brushing teeth, locking doors, listening to your parents, and telling the truth, et cetera. The mood is often bright, and after the episode’s opening montage, the theme song continues to play along in the background.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme Song &amp; Background Music <em>Prior</em> to SCP-5853-A-5’s Entrance</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Lyrics removed as potentially cognitohazardous.</em></p>
<p><iframe allowtransparency="true" class="html-block-iframe" frameborder="0" src="/scp-5853/html/4fec9a8ddf4dd300f81be0a8faf4c8eb1acb7895-1937547759745631019"></iframe></p>

<p>However, when SCP-5853-A-5 enters the frame, noticeable distortions appear. Distortions include, but are not limited to: dulled video quality, over-saturation of color, and substantially decreased contrast. Additionally, the usual upbeat background theme is transposed from C-Major Ionian to B-Locrian.</p>

<p>When on screen, the subject matter changes quite drastically as SCP-5853-A-5 offers stark nihilistic messages about reality, existence, death, and time. SCP-5853-A-1 — 4 will show signs of distress at the content of SCP-5853-A-5’s speech and will attempt to offer positive counterarguments, but these are inevitably refuted by SCP-5853-A-5. Some of note are as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>- “To exist is such a holy endeavor, that the Gods find it impossible.”<br/>
- “I met God the other day, I stared at Him, and He stared back. I cried and He cried. I laughed and He laughed. When I went to embrace Him, my hands could not pass through the Mirror.”<br/>
- “Flesh is not the truth.”<br/>
- “Your parents will soon die, and so will you.”<br/>
- “Days have become weeks, and weeks have become moments, seconds long, decades apart. Time is ebbing, flowing, undulating as a worm through the dirt, moving towards the beak of a bird. For a long time, it has only been the ever infinite now.”<br/>
- “I feel nothing but the nothingness.”<br/>
- “You may not believe in the slaughter, but the slaughter believes in you.”</p>
</div>
<p>Upon departing the scene, SCP-5853-A-5 will remark “I shall now be departing to the land of right, with the truth of red to be my might” as it enters the large dresser with the words “Mr. Squibbles’s Treasure Chest” written on the top.</p>
<p>Following SCP-5853-A-5’s departure, the episode will continue as if SCP-5853-A-5 had never visited; none of the main characters will mention the previous conversations or events.</p>
<p>It is believed that SCP-5853-A-5’s closing remark may have some role to play in the disappearance of the children. (See Addendum: SCP-5853-A-B)</p>

<p><strong>Forward:</strong><br/>
D-643980 is to be restrained to a detainment chair situated in front of a television set in the middle of the observation room, SCP-5853-OBR. D-Class is to be monitored using standard medical equipment. Junior Researcher is to scan infrared, ultra-violet and other frequency wavelengths of audio-visual data for anomalous, cognitohazardous, or memetic activity. Ethics Committee Consultant is to sit in on the test. Lead Researcher is to signal to begin the test.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Lead Researcher, Frank Monroe commencing with test SCP-5853-1. We are using SCP-5853-A episode 03, season 01, the first appearance of Mr. Hister, SCP-5853-A-5.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Klaus:</strong> Vitals steady, everything normal.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> What do you freaks have for me this week?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A episode begins.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> What the shit is this?!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Please D-Class, just watch the show.</p>
<p><em>As the show opens, D-643980 begins watching more intently. While initially a cognitohazard is suspected, scans from Junior Researcher Morgan Eskew reveal no anomalous influence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Morgan, everything looking good on the additive levels?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> All good sir, a small increase in Hume, nothing but indeterminacy can’t shrug off.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Say Doc? I assume there’s some “Doc” watching all this. Why this show?</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Klaus:</strong> Heart rate increasing, as well as perspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, we are investigating a new anomaly. That’s all you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> It’s just… I got some memories with this show. My younger brother, he used to watch this show all the time, until he… until he disappeared. <em>D-643980 sighs</em>. I miss him.</p>
<p><em>Upon hearing this, Jennifer Lam is visibly shaken. Dr. Monroe, Mrs. Lam, and Researcher Eskew all look at one another.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Mrs. Lam?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Mrs. Lam, do we proceed with this D-Class?!</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Give me a moment! What I want to know is, how the hell this wasn’t vetted!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> I’m so sorry about this, but I have no idea how this was missed. Morgan! Any change in Hume or hazard?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> It’s the same as before. There’s been no change.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Lam! Do we proceed?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> I’m thinking, damnit!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 makes its appearance on screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Lam?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Proceed! I’ll take the hit if anything comes of it.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> <em>To himself.</em> Man, I don’t remember the show getting this dark. Jeremy… watched this shit?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Thank you. You make the calls I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Well, it is my job.</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Alright, let’s focus on the test.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> <em>Whispers under his breath.</em> How’d we miss that?</p>
<p><em>The show continues. SCP-5853-A-5 departs, and the show has its closing song, credits roll, and the show ends.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Well, that was fucken weird.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, are you ready to proceed to the next part of the test?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> I mean, I don’t have a choice, do I?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Not really. Just trying to be cordial.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Yeah all these straps… real cordial.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Agent Bekolev, please undo torso restraints on the D-Class.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Bekolev:</strong> Copy.</p>
<p><em>Agent Bekolev proceeds to un-latch the leather restraints on D-643980. Researcher Klaus removes the monitoring equipment and attaches a mic, earpiece, receiver, and shoulder camera mount.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Fancy toys, this must cost a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Klaus:</strong> Spare no expense.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Agent Bekolev, please remove shackles and hand restraints. Upon removal, you are authorized to terminate the D-Class should he fail to register any command within five seconds. D-Class, do you understand?</p>
<p><em>Agent Bekolev readies his firearm by engaging the slide.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Bekolev:</strong> Copy sir.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Agent Bekolev, please hand D-Class the SCP-5853 package.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Bekolev:</strong> Copy.</p>
<p><em>Agent Bekolev puts an package of SCP-5853 into D-643980’s hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Oh shit! I haven’t seen these in years. They’re like a novelty now, huh? I always liked the raspberry; Jeremy always took the cherry…</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, on the back of the box you will find a phrase taped to it. Please eat a red piece, and the red piece only, then say the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> What kind of weird ass…</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Five seconds, D-643980. Bekolev?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Okay! Okay! Okay, Jeez.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 consumes the red SCP-5853 candy and recites the key phrase.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> “Flesh is not the truth.”</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Sir, Hume levels are now rising. I think we’re in.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Perfect, D-Class, please sit down and report anything strange.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Okay, umm, no, nothing… wait… what?</p>
<p><em>Video feed from D-643980’s camera distorts and the theme song of SCP-5853-A can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Fuck!</p>
<p><em>D-643980 disappears from the observation area.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Hume levels returning to baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Klaus:</strong> Switching to D-Class Audio-Visual.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class. Come in D-Class. Can you hear me?</p>

<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> We don’t know. That’s why you’re there. Move forward please.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Well, I don’t have anyone pointing a gun at my head anymore, so I ain’t doing shit. I’ll just stay here until you come get me.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> If we get you, D-Class, you will be terminated. Just do what we say and things will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Are you fucking kidding me? <em>D-643980 sighs.</em> Okay, fine, I’m moving forward. There’s this door. It seems like I’m, uh, like I’m in some kind of big closet.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Please exit if you can.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 pushes open the doors and falls out on. The shoulder camera spins as D-643980 stumbles, revealing “Mr. Squibbles’s Treasure Chest”.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Jesus!</p>
<p><em>D-643980 stands up, the video feed shows the rest of the room. The theme song of the show continues in a loop in the background. The room is an exact replica of the SCP-5853-A set, however locations that aren’t shown during the airing of episodes — or otherwise remain unseen to the general audience, are filled with blank, white backdrop. The sound of a door opening can be heard. SCP-5853-A-1 through -4 walk through the front. SCP-5853-4 is skipping and speaking indistinctly. D-643980 returns to hide in “Mr. Squibbles’s Treasure Chest”.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, please extend the camera out so that we can see.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 opens the chest’s door slightly and points the camera outwards.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> What a day! We sure did learn a thing or two!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-4:</strong> Wouldn’t be another wonderful wacky Ticky Taffy day if we didn’t!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-4 flies around the room and bumps SCP-5853-A-1 in the head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> My tentacles!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-2 - 4 laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Cut that out you two! We only have a bit longer before the town meeting!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-2:</strong> Oh boy! I hope someone brought some good ones!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> I’m sure they will be great, like all the others! I for one, am looking forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> As always! I don’t think we got any yet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-2:</strong> Yes, usually we would see them by now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-4 flies toward the camera. D-643980 pulls the camera back inside, D-643980’s breathing is fast and labored.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-4:</strong> Can’t forget to check! To check!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-1 opens the doors and looks down at D-643980.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Oh, what pleasure! Hello there, little boy! Welcome to Ticky Taffy Town! I am Mr. Squibbles.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 screams.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> Why is this one so loud? And so big!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Little boy, it is alright! Mr. Squibbles doesn’t mean to cause you fright!</p>
<p><em>D-643980 stops screaming, the camera feed is noticeably shakey.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Sir, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><em>Both SCP-5853-A-1 and Doctor Monroe reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Just have a seat and calm down. Come join us for the engagement in town!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Engage with entities while we form an extraction plan.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Engage?!</p>
<p><em>Both SCP-5853-A-3 and Monroe reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> Ment! It’s the gathering after we all learn our lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> We will be sending a team in shortly for extraction. Remain calm, retreat only if absolutely vital.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Fuck, ok.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly SCP-5853-A-2 loses all its color and turns a glowing red.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-2:</strong> What did you just say, young man?</p>
<p><em>The camera feed starts warping, and video quality drops substantially.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> I’m sorry! I’m sorry. I was scared.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Mrs Bobble, do calm down. If the boy was scared, he’s allowed to to express himself. However, young sir, do find better language to do so, if you would please. It’s not good to make Mrs. Bobble upset, lest you fail his righteous test. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, do not, in any circumstances anger the entities! It may mean the difference between life and death.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> <em>Replying to both simultaneously.</em> Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> What’s your name, kid? Why are you so big?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, I have a hunch. Do not let them know you are an adult.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> My name, uh… is uhh, Davey and I have a… umm… growth disorder, my… uhh, bones are really big, you see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Remarkable! Well Davey, we must be off to the town meeting! You will join us as our esteemed guest.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, please proceed, we need to see the extent of the anomalous area.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> <em>Quietly.</em> Sounds great…</p>
<p><em>D-643980’s camera feed is led outside the front door of the domicile. D-643980 turns the camera around to show that on the front door there is an address number that reads “S01E03”.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> That’s very interesting, hey Eskew?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Yes Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Can you bring me the list of all the episodes of SCP-5853-A that feature Mr. Hister?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Oh. Oh, oh! Yes! I See.</p>
<p><em>Outside the house, the surrounding area is made up of the miniature town that is only seen briefly in the opening sequence of the show. All structures, buildings and roads are made and stylized exactly as the miniature set-pieces would be, however are to full scale. Past what could only be seen in the immediate areas in the opening sequence, the larger space drops off to the same vacant white backdrop as to what was seen in the SCP-5853-A house. Scattered throughout this large expanse are other copies of the town, each with their own SCP-5853-A house. The towns have no regard for placement, some being located overhead or below across the vast whiteness. A long pathway leading from each house converges to a single location in the distance. This location is that of a small-town square, containing a cobblestone roundabout and a large fountain in the center. D-643980’s camera is whirled around as the group walks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> D-Class, wait. Point your shoulder up to the diagonal right, about a half turn, and then at one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Jen, what do you see? D-Class, please follow that request.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-2:</strong> Aww, now Dave! Don’t sound so down! Can’t be blue when you’re with this clown!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-4 then flies into SCP-5853-A-1’s head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> My tentacles!</p>
<p><em>All entities burst out laughing. D-643980 nervously chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Heh.</p>
<p><em>D-643980’s camera feed pans up and to the right.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Monroe, see that?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Eskew, zoom in.</p>
<p><em>D-643980’s camera feed zooms in on one of the long roads in the distance. There are other versions of SCP-5853-A-1 - 4 walking down their respective road.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-643980, please turn your camera view so that we may see some other roads out there. Can you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Uh, yeah, I can, but I gotta stay quiet.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-3 turns to D-643980.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> Don’t be quiet! Start a riot! You’re stuck here now, might as well try it!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Good point D-Class, just try to point your camera at the other pathways in the distance.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 raises a thumbs up into the camera feed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Here it is Dr. Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Thank you, Eskew.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> There! <em>Lam gasps.</em> Oh God. There’s a kid with each group. I’ve counted 3 so far.</p>
<p><em>D-643980’s camera feed shows that small children are walking with each of the groups of SCP-5853-A-1 - 4.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, please if you can aim your camera at one of the entities’ homes that are in the towns floating around you.</p>
<p><em>Camera feed from D-643980, shows him hold up a quick middle finger, before the motion of the camera is aimed at a distant entity house.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Eskew, zoom further. Can you make out the number on the door?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Barely.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Oh man. It reads “Sierra…Oscar…3…Echo…13”.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Ok so, yes… ok, so season three, episode thirteen, is on the list of episodes featuring SCP-5853-A-5.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> How many seasons was this show on?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Five.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> And how many episodes in each season?</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> Twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> So exactly how many episodes are stealing children?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> We’ve counted thirty… umm… thirty-one episodes with Mr. Hist… umm SCP-5853-A-5.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Jesus, with re-runs, VHS sales, and that crazy internet showing everything now… how many children? Hundreds? Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> I would gather.</p>
<p><strong>Morgan Eskew:</strong> We gotta know how to properly contain this thing then!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Alright, MTF it is. I’ll submit the request.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> You’ll need my endorsement. Which I am not willing to give.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> I’m sorry, but we can’t send countless MTF ops into some place we know absolutely nothing about. That could just end up as a needless loss of life.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Jen!</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> I hate this as much as you do, but we’re in no position to do anything right now outside of pulling this from the public and containing it. For all we know, the children are already dead.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> So, what do we do with the D-Class?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> We gather as much information as we can now, and then try to get him the hell out later.</p>
<p><em>D-643980 whispers into his mic.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Hey, guys, we’re here.</p>
<p><em>Camera feed pans up as Researcher Eskew zooms the camera back out to bring the panorama function online. All the SCP-5853-A-1 - 4 entities from each episode have gathered at the fountain. Over one hundred entities and over two hundred children can be seen. D-643980 and his respective entities are located immediately at the fountains edge with children and other entities crowding around. Most of the children are in a state of petrified fear, while others look sleep-deprived, most are crying. The entities converse amongst themselves in a strange, unknown language. As the last of the groups make their way to the area, the continual background theme stops.</em></p>
<p><strong>All the entities in unison:</strong> I now arrive to the sea of sin, with the red of my flesh to offer him!</p>
<p><em>From a point in the white, 15 meters above the fountain, a large 3 by 2-meter mirror-like rectangle appears. The rectangle starts spinning until the blur of its motion creates a black void, out from which SCP-5853-A-5 emerges.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unison:</strong> Mister Hister!</p>
<p><em>The mirror behind SCP-5853-A-5 slows down to a stop, its reflective surface expels a continuous stream of white light. From the white back-drop surrounding the space, hundreds of dark humanoid entities materialize, each motionless, suspended upside-down in the air. Each humanoid entity is the size of a child.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class, focus in on SCP-5853-A-5. Do not interact, unless advised.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> <em>Whispering.</em> Just get me out of here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> We’ll do our best.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 speaks. Its voice is a combination of many overlapped whispers and hisses. When it speaks the suspended figures twitch and shake.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Hello, my children. How is everyone today?</p>
<p><em>The crowd of SCP-5853-A entities cheer and jump.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> That’s so good to hear. My children, it is time to tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A entities continue cheering.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Ennie, Meanie, Minnie, Moe, catch a sinner by the toe.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 points long, slender, bony finger at one of the children opposite D-643980 on the other side of the fountain.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Yes, you my child. What is your name?</p>
<p><em>The child is a female with blonde hair, approximately four to six years of age. She appears disturbed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:</strong> Um… Ummmm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> My child, do I frighten you? Don’t you remember Mister Hister?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> <em>Whispers into mic.</em> This doesn’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Just observe D-Class. It’s all we can do for right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:</strong> <em>The child nods.</em> I… My name is Bethany.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Well Bethany, why don’t you come up here and tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.</p>
<p><em>One of SCP-5853-A-5’s many tentacles extend from beneath its robe and picks up the child. The child screams. As she does, the other children are seen trying to run away, but are all intercepted by an SCP-5853-A entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Oh, Bethany, do not cry, have no fear. Just tell Mister Hister what he wants to hear. Did you learn your lesson today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:</strong> Yes.. <em>The child sobs.</em> Yes, I did sir…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> And what was the lesson? Say it so all the other children can hear.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:</strong> I… Um… Today I learned from Mr. Squibbles that it is um.. important to tie your shoes in his special way, so they don’t… um… come lose all day.</p>
<p><em>The cheer of an SCP-5853-A-1 entity can be heard from somewhere in the crowd.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Oh, Bethany, that is so good, and so smart of you. Your prize is to pass through the mirror and into the Dreamlands!</p>
<p><em>All SCP-5853-A entities cheer in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A Entities:</strong> The Dreamlands!</p>
<p><em>The SCP-5853-A-5 tentacle throws the child into the mirror behind it. The child’s cries are cut off as her body crosses the threshold. The mirrored surface increases in luminosity. This causes more children to try to run. The SCP-5853-A entities again restrain those who attempt to flee.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Lam:</strong> Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Who is next? How about you friend?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 uses its tentacles to acquire a young male child, with brown hair and glasses, approximately seven to nine years in age.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Hello my child. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:</strong> Tommy… <em>Sobs.</em> Tommy Mathis.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Ahh Tommy! You look like such a smart boy with your glasses. Can you tell Mister Hister, did you learn your lesson today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:</strong> I um…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Take your time, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:</strong> I remember today you told us that you met, um God the other day…. you…. uh… stared at him, and… he stared back. You uh cried and he cried too. Um… You laughed and he did too. You went to hug him, but your hands could not umm… pass through the… the… Mirror.’</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> What a smart boy you are! And so rare! Not for this world!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 sighs, as the child it was holding vanishes. SCP-5853-A-5 then turns to the other children.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> I do like when that happens. Who’s next? How about you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 grabs another child, male, black hair, five to seven years of age.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> And what is your name young man?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:</strong> <em>The child is sobbing uncontrollably.</em> I… I… I…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Don’t be afraid, I just want to know your name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:</strong> I… I… Tyrone… Please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Well Tyrone, can you tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:</strong> I… I… didn’t pay attention… I… I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> You didn’t learn anything Tyrone?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:</strong> No… I…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Well then Tyrone, you are now going to learn your lesson.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 holds the child over the fountain and begins to flay them starting with the legs. Small chunks of flesh are removed by the tentacles’ serrated suckers while the child screams in pain. The child can be seen and heard screaming. Blood and flesh fall into the fountain causing the water to turn red. As SCP-5853-A-5 works its way up the child’s body, it tears away at pieces of skin and flesh and tosses them into the fountain. The SCP-5853-A entities surrounding the fountain rush in and begin to devour the pieces. This causes the remaining children to attempt escape. Video feed from D-643980 shows that he also attempts to flee. All around the tentacles of SCP-5853-A-5 start to grab children at a much faster rate, skipping the pervious introductions and going straight to asking each child what lesson they learned. The many voices comprising SCP-XXX-A-5’s speech ask multiple children at the same time. As each answer, they all met fate of the previous children based on their responses. (See Addendum SCP-5853-3)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Fuck, fuck, fuck, what do I do?!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> Try to find shelter of some sort! Anywhere!</p>
<p><em>In their panic, some of the children run over or are pushed off the side of the floating precipice of the town center. Their bodies immediately lifted into the air to become a part of the floating figures above SCP-5853-A-5. D-643980’s screams are heard as his video feed is pulled rapidly upwards. As D-643980 is above the fountain, dozens of children’s bodies can be seen, dismembered, skinned, quartered, and partially, if not almost completely, eaten. The SCP-5853-A entities gnaw and tear at pieces of flesh as they wade through the fountain, which is now filled with blood, bone, and viscera. SCP-5853-A-5 turns to D-643980.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Well hello there! You’re quite the hefty child, aren’t you? No matter. Pray tell, what have you learned today?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> My Name is Dave. Dave…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> And Mr. Trenton, what did you learn today?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> How do I respond?!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> <em>Monroe can be heard flipping rapidly through pages of episode transcripts.</em> Umm… S01E03… Umm the lesson there was…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> What was that my friend?</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> I… I remember, on my way here… I was told by Mr. Squibbles: “Don’t make Mrs. Bobble upset, lest you fail his hideous test.”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-5:</strong> Oh, my dear child, so close… You should know the consequences of your actions. You are to exist for all stars, amongst your brothers.</p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Wait. No. No. No!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-5 makes an unseen injury on D-643980 and then lifts them to the sky with the other suspended humanoid figures. Video feed from D-643980 shows that a young boy of nine to eleven years of age is suspended upside-down along with D-643980, who is also upside-down. The child is unrecognizable except for identifying clothing. The skin and muscle of show years of decay and dehydration.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Jeremy!… Is that you!… Oh Jeremy! Oh, no! I… I’m sorry! No! Please! Please wake up! No! Jeremy!… Can you hear me! Jeremy!… Please.</p>
<p><em>Later investigation shows the clothing belonged to that of a Jeremy Trenton who was reported missing to the FBI and later UIU under strange circumstances.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-643980:</strong> Oh Jeremy…</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-Class?</p>
<p><em>One-minute of silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-643980?</p>
<p><em>One-minute silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank Monroe:</strong> D-643980, please show sign of life.</p>
<p><em>For three days, the camera feed from D-643980 can be seen, suspended upside-down next to the body. A continuous stream of red fluid, presumed to be blood, flows constantly over the camera lens. Of note, the volume of blood seen passing the shoulder cam of D-643980 throughout the three days is in excess of eighteen times the amount of blood found in the human body.</em></p>
<p><em>The feed is terminated three days later.</em></p>

<p>Regarding SCP-5853 and latter D-Class explorational logs:<br/>
Full understanding of these parameters for any future explorations into/experiments involving SCP-5853-A are necessary. Note that these findings were made from extensive viewing of the recorded evidence of a single D-Class exploration log, and may be inaccurate:</p>
<p>-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a lesson from the aired SCP-5853-A episode, they are passed through the “Mirror”.</p>
<p>-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a lesson from being in the extra-dimensional space, they are left to hang with the other suspended entities.</p>
<p>-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers that they don’t remember what they learned, didn’t pay attention, didn’t learn anything, or lie (this can also mean giving lessons from an episode other than which episode the SCP-5853-A-Child viewed), the child is, in variable ways, tortured, killed, and consumed.</p>
<p>-If the SCP-5853-A-Child answers with a repetition or summation of the phrase Mr. Hister says in the episode, the child will disappear, to be transported back to the kitchen pantry from which they left. (See example in Addendum SCP-5853-A-A)</p>

<p>Jennifer,</p>
<p>I feel like it is my duty to follow up. I know you declined MTF operations into the SCP-5853-A area. However, the more I think about it, the more I deem it unconscionable to not do everything in our power to find a way to rescue those children.</p>
<p>Please Reconsider,</p>

<p>Dr. Monroe,</p>
<p>I want to make myself explicitly clear. No operation, nor further exploration into SCP-5853-A shall be performed. Scan the media spaces, recall the candy, and call it a day. The children currently in SCP-5853-A are to be considered lost and we are to move forward with mitigation procedures. Please move forward to containment.</p>

<p>Site life has been good to me. Just been working my way up the ladder. I don’t particularly miss missions. I certainly don’t miss not knowing whether or not the next mission might be my last. You know better than anyone, those people never gave us the full picture. I hope to be better. In that vain Terrence, I have to ask, would you be willing to do a 3 man mission into a spatial anomaly? I will send you all I have. However, this will be off books though, EC has given me nothing but push back.</p>
<p>Let me know…</p>

<p>Terrence, that’s EXACTLY why I’m asking you! This anomaly, its killing children, some as young as 3 years old! I know you would avoid everything about this anomaly… BUT I feel we, you and I, owe it to these children, these families to figure out WHY! You could be saving lives!</p>

<p><em>All MTF members are seen disappearing from the observation room.</em></p>

<p><em>Through distorted static, Alpha’s voice can be heard.</em></p>

<p><strong>Delta:</strong> I am trying, please, move your leg.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Team, quiet. Ensure cameras are on. Stay frosty.</p>
<p><strong>Delta &amp; Charlie:</strong> Heard.</p>
<p><em>All MTF cameras show a black void with a single opening of light shining through. Alpha pushes the interior door open and light floods the camera’s view.

The exit can be seen ahead, along with three windows. Outside is completely white.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Scan everything.</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>The MTF team spreads out into the small set area. Each camera detailing the setting. MTF-Delta’s feed shows a living room with an exaggerated TV set and an oversized reclining chair.

<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Command, you seeing this? It’s all fake.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Noted Charlie. Alpha, progress to the town square area.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Copy. Team, let’s go.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, the door to the set area can be heard being opened. Charlie takes a position hiding behind the large recliner. Delta ducks down behind the kitchen counter. Alpha rushes back into the dresser.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Maintain positions. Weapons hot.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Team, do not, under any circumstances, engage with the entities.</p>
<p><em>Charlie &amp; Delta’s camera feeds continue in limited capacity, showing the entities’ movements.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-3:</strong> What a day! We sure did learn a thing or two!</p>
<p><em>The SCP-5853-A-3 jumps into the recliner.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-4:</strong> Wouldn’t be another wonderful wacky Ticky Taffy day if we didn’t!</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-4:</strong> Can’t forget to check! To check!</p>
<p><em>The SCP-5853-A-1 entity walks over to the cabinet, opens the doors and looks down at Alpha.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Hello there, little boy! Welcome to Ticky Taffy Town! I am Mr. Squib…</p>
<p><em>Alpha opens fire. The rounds connect with the entity. Brown rust-colored fluid is seen leaking from the body mass of the SCP-5853-A-1 entity. It stumbles backward and collapses on the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-1:</strong> Owie.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-1 ceases movement. 6 seconds passes as the other SCP-5853-A entities look at the body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Terrence! I told you to not engage.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Fuck, Frank, there isn’t much else to do! We are cornered!</p>
<p><em>Every MTF feed records the sound of a sharp scream, followed by many more. The 3 remaining entities in the area also begin screaming. The exterior white surrounding the area dims turning black. After 4 seconds the entities stop screaming. All is quiet and black.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> <em>Quietly.</em> Okay command, switching to NODs.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Copy.</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>Feeds from MTF switch from black to night vision. Delta’s feed peaks around the kitchen counter. No entities besides SCP-5853-A-4 are in sight within the domicile.

<p><strong>Command:</strong> Alpha, this is no longer an exploration mission, the objective is extraction. Priority One is to get you and your team to the Town Center, and tell SCP-5853-A-5 the key phrase.</p>
<p><em>Audio feed begins to degrade substantially, while video feedback reduces from approximately 93% to 87%.</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> … Sacrifice… Chaos… Perception…</p>

<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Copy.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Negative.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Report Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> I still have an active threat in sight, Alpha.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> What is it doing?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Hovering, its stationary. But… like glitching.</p>
<p><em>Feed from Charlie shows the SCP-5853-A-4 entity phasing in and out of location, appearing in both static and transitory forms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Charlie, head for the door first. Delta and I will suppress. We will follow up behind you once threat is eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Rodger.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Three… two.. one… go!</p>
<p><em>Charlie’s feed begins to rapidly move towards the interior/exterior door. Alpha’s feed emerges slightly from the dresser. Delta’s feed rises from behind the kitchen counter, the barrel of his rifle partially obscuring the frame. Both MTF feeds observe Charlie attempt to approach the door, the SCP-5853-A-4 entity returns to normal function. The entity speeds at Charlie’s head, making contact and propelling the agent into the neighboring wall. Alpha’s camera shows that the injury is instantly fatal, as Agent Charlie’s cranium appears to shatter upon impact with the wall. Alpha and Delta proceed to open fire upon the entity. The agents continue to engage fire until the entity is brought from flight to immobile on the ground. Gunfire quickly subsides.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Go! Moo! Head toward door!</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Yes, sir!</p>
<p><em>Agent Delta’s feed shakes from behind the kitchen counter and towards the door. Feed from Alpha shows five claws and a shadow pass outside one of the windows. As Alpha opens the door, from the left, the SCP-5853-A-1 entity grabs Agent Delta. The SCP-5853-A-3 entity then uses it claws to tear out a large portion of Agent Delta’s abdomen. Agent Delta continues automatic gunfire upon SCP-5853-A-3 until it ceases movement. SCP-5853-A-1 screams. Last signal received from Agent Delta was of his own hands pulling the pin on an incendiary grenade, while charging the SCP-5853-A-1 entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Moo! Fuck. One of you fuckers left. Where are you?</p>
<p><em>Feed from Alpha shows the shadow of SCP-5853-A-2 bouncing in and out of frame.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-A-2:</strong> Miss Bobble is upset…</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-A-2 is seen from Alpha’s feed. The entity is charging at inhuman speeds. Alpha fires a grenade round from his secondary. The impact blows a hole in the entity, and it ceases to move, remaining upright in its prior charging stance. Alpha’s feed rushes across the SCP-5853-A set and exits the building. The entire area is completely black, except what can be illuminated by standard issue MTF - NOD equipment. A narrow pathway is seen, as well as a dim light in the distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Frank, what the fuck? Well, hell, if anyone is even getting this anymore. If I don’t make it outta here, please give all my love to Jesse. Let Caleb know, his father loved him so much. Teach him to not make the same mistakes I did.</p>
<p><em>The camera feed from Alpha continues in night vision down a narrow path towards the growing light in the distance. The sound of SCP-5853-A’s theme song is notably absent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> I hate Non-Euclidian shit…</p>
<p><em>182 minutes of travel goes by, and the distant light is no longer in front of the path, but above it. Alpha’s camera feed points upward, suddenly shifts, and loses focus.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> I feel like being pulled by something. I’m on a lower path now. Deeper, longer…</p>
<p><em>Alpha’s feed slowly brightens until the entire feed is whiteout. Second to last notable feed shows Alpha approaching the Town Square.</em></p>
<p><em>Alpha’s feed goes to static for 8 minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>Alpha’s feed returns, showing Alpha’s hand reaching out and opening a white wooden door. Past the door is a room with a young woman in a rocking chair. The woman is humming to an infant in her arms. The woman looks up to the camera. The woman appears to be Jesse Bazarian, Agent Bazarian’s wife.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Jesse?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-?:</strong> Hello… my, child.</p>
<p><em>The entity holds the infant up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5853-?:</strong> See the Mirror. Through the Mirror. The Mirror is the only Salvation. Salvation achieved by sacrifice to He Who Is Divine Among the Dreamlands. Release yourself through the Mirror. Ascend through the Mirror. Transcend through the Mirror…</p>
<p><em>SCP-5853-? takes the infant-entity and holds it at arm’s length. With its left hand, the SCP-5853-? figured twists the entity’s head off.</em></p>
<p><em>Alpha screams and collapses.</em></p>
<p><em>11 seconds of static.</em></p>
<p><em>Feed resumes. Alpha’s camera view is faced towards SCP-5853-A-5.</em></p>

<p>I need to know when to call it quits. I could spend ‘X’ number of dollars and ‘X’ number lives, sacrificing to whatever… to wherever I think, or wherever I think the ‘Mirror’ may bring us, who ‘Mr. Hister’ might be, or the implications of a clown entity called ‘Bobble’. I could try to chase these down to their penultimate conclusion, sacrificing MTF, D-class and children alike.</p>
<p>Lam, she was right. God I’m sorry, Terrence. At the end of the day all SCP-5853 needs is to be hidden. In the dark.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, I’m just not made for this. Not anymore. I can no longer do this. Let me forget. Let me go back.</p>
<p>Consider this my resignation.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Monroe</p>

<p>Further investigations into production staff and actors turned up no leads. Analysis of SCP-5853-A’s closing credits revealed that instead of staffer names, the credits consisted of a continually growing list of names. Cross-examination into both Foundation and UIU records show that all known names of children who have been reported missing due to what is believed to be SCP-5853-A’s effects are listed on the credits. Cross-referencing of the credits against known missing children shows that only 17% of children listed are known to the Foundation and UIU.</p>
<p>Of note, as of 1-23-2000, the names Robert Faulk, Mohammed Al Abi, Terrence Bazarian, and Frank Monroe have been added.</p>
<p>Frank Monroe is currently M.I.A.</p>
