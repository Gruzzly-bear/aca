            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9890</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to be alerted to any reported "resurrections" or of individuals found to be living despite having a valid death certificate issued under their identity. Any such individuals are to be screened for the possibility of being SCP-9890 instances. Known SCP-9890 instances are to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. All non-Foundation personnel exposed to the anomaly are to be amnesticized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9890 refers to perfect biological copies of recently deceased individuals. Each SCP-9890 instance is identical in every aspect to the individual it is mimicking, including retaining the individual's memories. Upon manifestation, an SCP-9890 instance attempts to establish contact with the deceased individual’s close relatives, relying on them for basic care and support consistent with typical human relationships.</p>
<p>As of 10-28-2025, seven SCP-9890 instances have been reported globally, designated SCP-9890-1 through 7. Each case involves the reappearance of a deceased individual within 2–174 days of their confirmed death. Investigation into a potential common origin or trigger event is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum — Initial Discovery:</strong> The first recorded instance of SCP-9890 occurred on 9-14-2025, when Researcher Ethan Holt was approached outside his residence by his mother, Diane Holt, approximately two months after her death. Researcher Holt immediately contacted the Foundation, resulting in containment of the SCP-9890 instance. It was subsequently transferred to the nearby Site-149.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum — Research:</strong> Upon containment, the instance refused to communicate with anyone except Researcher Holt. Despite his objections, Holt was assigned as Head Researcher to ensure cooperation and continued communication with the anomaly.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Director Donovan,</p>
I once again would like to request reassignment from SCP-9890. The anomaly is persistent in maintaining the act of being my mother, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain professionalism. Considering the circumstances, I believe that a different researcher would be better suited to conduct the interviews.</div>

I am sorry, but I must deny your request. You remain the only person the anomaly has shown willingness to speak with. I do not believe it is wise to burn that bridge before even trying. If the anomaly is so adamant in upholding the act, I suggest you consider engaging with it on its terms for now.</div>

<p>Ethan,</p>
<p>The test results came in. The biological scans came back as a perfect match to Diane Holt. Not just DNA, but everything. Blood type, fingerprints, dental records, even old scar tissue lines up exactly with what’s on her medical file.</p>
<p>I don't know how to tell you this, but for all intents and purposes, that <strong>is</strong> your mother.</p>
Let me know how you want to proceed.</div>

<p>At first, I didn’t feel anything. I figured it would be that way. I was trying to let you go as much as I could. Well, apparently unsuccessfully, because eventually I started feeling… sad.</p>
<p>I was sad for what could've been. I knew we'd never have a relationship again, but there always was that lingering <em>“what if.”</em> That little bit of hope, as much as I tried to fight it. And it wasn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>But, I also felt… relieved. Relieved knowing that my mother wasn't drinking herself to sleep anymore. Knowing that it was finally over.</p>

<p>And then I realized, how much I just… couldn’t stand you. How much I hated being around you. You looked like my mother, yet you were nothing like her. The wonderful, loving, and caring person I remembered was long gone, replaced by a shell of your former self. A walking reminder of what I lost. And I hated it. I hated you.</p>
<p>So yeah, I felt relieved. Relieved that you were finally gone. All of you.</p>
<p>You’re not back, Ma. You never will be. I had to accept that, because I can't keep getting hurt. Not again.</p>
