<p>Nanga Parbat.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3833</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Geographical</p>
<p><strong>Containment Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-3833 has been constructed one kilometer below SCP-3833's lower bound to assist in monitoring and containment efforts. No personnel or civilians are allowed to enter SCP-3833, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">aside from D-class personnel equipped with recording equipment for testing purposes.</span> A no-fly zone is to be enforced around Nanga Parbat under the guise of Standard Cover Story 088 ("Weather Hazard").</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3833 is a rectangular volume of space centered on the summit of Nanga Parbat, a mountain in the Himalayas mountain range. The lower bound of SCP-3833 is approximately six kilometers above sea level, and SCP-3833 is one kilometer in width and length. The upper bound of SCP-3833 is unknown<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, but is believed to be between 20 and 30 kilometers above sea level.</p>
<p>SCP-3833 plays host to two known anomalous phenomena, designated SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-1 is a recurring phenomena where the conditions of Nanga Parbat will become extremely severe. An unusually intense snowstorm signifies the arrival of SCP-3833-1. SCP-3833-1 often involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aforementioned snowstorm, described as being strong and very cold.</li>
<li>Rock formations becoming increasingly difficult to climb.</li>
<li>Equipment failure becoming increasingly common.</li>
<li>Areas of the mountain become iced over and hard to navigate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without intervention from SCP-3833-2, death due to SCP-3833-1 is unavoidable. Circumstances attributable to equipment failure prevent subjects from exiting SCP-3833. None of this anomalous phenomena has been observed by subjects outside of SCP-3833. SCP-3833-1 tends to only affect solo climbers or small groups, though SCP-3833-1 has been known to cause the crashes of commercial airliners flying through SCP-3833 on rare occasions. SCP-3833-1 typically lasts 3 to 6 hours before subsiding.</p>
<p>SCP-3833-2 is a cabin located within SCP-3833. Though GPS devices left within SCP-3833-2 do not change location, SCP-3833-2 has not been observed outside of SCP-3833-1 occurrences. SCP-3833-3 is a Caucasian male of Slavic descent who inhabits SCP-3833-2, apparently as its caretaker.</p>
<p>In approximately 33% of all SCP-3833-1 occurrences, the subject will find SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-3 will invite the subject to enter SCP-3833-2. Once they are inside, SCP-3833-3 will coerce the subject into staying in SCP-3833-2 to shelter themselves from SCP-3833-1. Once SCP-3833-1 has subsided, the subject will be given proper equipment to descend Nanga Parbat if their equipment was broken.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2 came to the Foundation's attention after mountain climber Jerry Helder ascended Nanga Parbat and encountered both SCP-3833-1 and SCP-3833-2. Helder posted about this incident on his mountain-climbing blog, where it was flagged by Foundation webcrawler I/O-BLACKLEECH for potential anomalous activity. The blog was seized by Foundation assets and the post was deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 02/01/2018:</strong> All attempts to find SCP-3833-2 using long-range surveillance has failed. In all instances, SCP-3833-2 only appears during manifestations of SCP-3833-1. Similarly to SCP-3833-1, SCP-3833-2 is unobservable outside of SCP-3833, making observation outside of SCP-3833 impossible.</p>
<p>With authorization from Site Director Graham and Resource Marshall ██████, short-range interaction through D-class personnel has been approved. Fifty D-class personnel of above-average physical health have been allocated to Site-3833 for use in this operation.</p>
<p>One group of four D-class personnel is to ascend Nanga Parbat and then descend the mountain. Should they ascend and descend successfully, another group is to ascend the mountain. Should they encounter SCP-3833-1, they are to attempt to find the clifface where SCP-3833-2 is located. If they find SCP-3833-2, they are to enter and use audiovisual equipment to record interactions with SCP-3833-3.</p>
<p>Five groups encountered SCP-3833-1, and only one encountered SCP-3833-2. No further incursions into SCP-3833 are planned.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIDEO TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Krunt:</strong> Alright boys, recorders are on. For the record, state your names and numbers.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Marty ███████, D-8990.</p>
<p><strong>D-2344:</strong> Fredericks ████, D-2344.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Clyde █████, D-0110.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Micheal ████, D-5671.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Krunt:</strong> This is Agent James Krunt of the D-Class management division. I'm about to send these guys up to the peak of the mountain in hopes of encountering SCP-3833-2. We will have sniper rifles trained on them at all times<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> to ensure compliance. Do you have anything to say before I send you up?</p>
<p><strong>D-2344:</strong> I already fucking hate this.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Krunt:</strong> Great. Well, you know your mission, please begin to ascend the mountain.</p>
<p><em>The groups begins to ascend Nanga Parbat. 15 minutes and 43 seconds of little interaction.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> I think we're outside earshot of Agent Cunt and his minions now.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Don't call him that! Remember what-</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Yeah, what are they gonna do? Shoot us down for making shitty puns? Fat chance.</p>
<p><strong>D-2344:</strong> Shut up, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Shut the hell up, Fred.</p>
<p><em>The group continues to ascend the mountain, until they reach a very tall cliff-wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Fucking hell, how are we supposed to climb this?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Calvin (Over Radio):</strong> You have a winch in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Wait, you're still listening in on us?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Calvin:</strong> Affirmative.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> So, is Agent Cunt there with you?</p>
<p><em>33 minutes 46 seconds of little interaction. Wind begins to rise in intensity.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> It's getting pretty fucking windy up here.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Calvin:</strong> Is it also cloudy?</p>
<p><strong>D-2344:</strong> Yeah, it's basically overcast.</p>
<p><em>Cloud cover prevents direct observation of the group through satellite telescope.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Calvin:</strong> This could be the anomalous storm we're looking for. Remember to keep close to the walls and watch your step, and try to navigate to [REDACTED]</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><em>2 minutes 12 seconds of little interaction. The group reaches a relatively flat part of the mountain.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2344:</strong> Stop pushing me around, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Wasn't me.</p>
<p><em>The wind pushes D-2344 to the ground, and slides him towards a nearby cliff. D-2344 manages to employ his ice pick, but the end of the pick breaks off, and D-2344 falls into a chasm. Fall is assumed to be fatal.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> I can swear to god there wasn't a chasm there a second ago.</p>
<p><em>18 minutes 23 seconds of little interaction, aside from complaints from the group about the environment.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Fuck, it's getting colder by the minute up here. My coat isn't helping at all.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> The snow's like a spray of fucking bullets.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Calvin:</strong> Remember to go to [REDACTED]</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> You-</p>
<p><em>Interference with audiovisual equipment makes communication impossible at this point. Signal is not received for fifteen minutes until backup equipment is remotely activated.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> I can't fucking take it anymore. It's too intense.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Wait, I think I hear something?</p>
<p><em>Analysis of audio at this point has revealed that the sound of a man's voice can be heard through the storm.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> It's coming from over there!</p>
<p><em>The group rounds a corner and discovers a wooden cabin matching descriptions of SCP-3833-2. A man, presumably SCP-3833-3, is standing in front of the door and yelling.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Hey! Over here!</p>
<p><em>The group enters SCP-3833-2. SCP-3833-3 closes the door to SCP-3833-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Welcome to the top of the mountain. Would you like something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Fuck yeah. I'm fucking dying from thirst.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 leads the group over to a set of two worn, red couches and a stone fireplace. SCP-3833-3 then enters a kitchen area to make drinks.</em></p>
<p><em>The group takes their coats off.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Damn, these couches are comfy.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> I'm guessing it's just because we're finally out of the fucking cold.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> This reminds me a bit of my grammie's old cabin. I can swear to God she had that <em>exact</em> same painting of a moose…</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 enters the room carrying a tray of four cups of hot chocolate. SCP-3833-3 reacts with shock at a series of dermal abrasions on D-0110's arm and chest. SCP-3833-3 puts the tray down onto a table in between the couches, and the group begins to drink.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 takes out a metal box underneath one of the couches, and takes out a small, unlabeled bottle of liquid from the box.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> A bit of medicine for those scars.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 applies some liquid to his hand and then uses his hand to apply it to D-0110's arms, and a previously unseen set of abrasions on D-0110's chest. SCP-3833-3 then wraps gauze from the box around D-0110's arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> It won't heal right away, but that should take the pain away. Make sure you keep the bandages on.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Thanks, man. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><em>The group sits in silence for three minutes until they finish their drinks. Personnel at Base Command push the group to ask SCP-3833-3 interview questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> So, what's your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> You can call me Russel.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Alright, Russel, what is this place?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> It's a cabin I built here a while back. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Alright. Why is it so damn stormy up here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> The higher up you get, the colder it gets. If I'm not mistaken, that's how it works for every mountain.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Did you enjoy your drinks?</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> They're great. They taste all sweet and fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Well, it's getting pretty late now.</p>
<p><em>It is of note that the approximate time was 9:03 PM.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> You must be tired, after all that's happened today. Would you like to rest?</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Would I? I'd kill for a half-decent cot.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 stands up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Follow me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 leads the group into a hallway adjacent to the living room, and then to a bedroom. The room contains two bunk beds with red comforters covered in blue stars. The walls and ceiling are colored blue, and covered with a white spiral pattern. A window on one wall allows for a view of SCP-3833-1. A spruce dressing stand is pressed against the remaining wall, and has a beige lamp and a blue analog clock resting on it.</em></p>
<p><em>The group slides into the bunk beds and goes to sleep. Audiovisual equipment is set to deactivate for six hours during night time.</em></p>
<p><em>The next day, SCP-3833-1 is still in the process of occurring. Personnel stationed at Site-3833 confirms the precense of SCP-3833-1. This means that SCP-3833-1 has been occurring for 9 hours, making it the longest occurrence of SCP-3833-1 to date.</em></p>
<p><em>After a short period of time, the group leaves the bedroom to find SCP-3833-3 in the living room, staring out the window.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> The storm doesn't usually last this long. I don't think you'll be able to go out, so I guess you'll have to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> That sucks.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Hey, it's not all bad. I'm making muffins, do you want any?</p>
<p><em>Once the group finishes eating breakfast, they begin to play board games such as checkers and chess by SCP-3833-3's suggestion. Little interaction is recorded during this period.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Hey, do you have cable up here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Unfortunately, no. It does get lonely up here, but I doubt anyone would be able to run a cable up here.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> I think we're missing the Super Bowl up here.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Oh crap, you're right!</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Which teams are playing again?</p>
<p><em>89 minutes and 45 seconds of little interaction.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> And… checkmate.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> God damn it.</p>
<p><em>D-5671 walks up to SCP-3833-3, who is working in the kitchen.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> Russel, do you have any other games? I swear to God, if I lose another game of chess to Clyde I'll throw myself out the window into the damn storm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Well, I do have something else…</p>
<p><em>The group sets up a game of</em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <em>They play for 164 minutes and 33 seconds without interruption.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> I take out my sword and fight the elf.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Alright, then roll initiative.</p>
<p><em>The group rolls twenty-sided dies.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Fuck yeah!</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Another fucking natural twenty? I swear to God, Clyde, what <em>are</em> you?</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Jackson Evergreen, level two Ranger, warrior of Neverwinter, and soon-to-be killer of elves.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Alright, you get to go first, Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> I peg 'im between the eyes with my crossbow.</p>
<p><em>D-0110 rolls a die.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> You miss. It's now the elf's turn. He casts Eldritch Blast on Crogon-</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> Fuck me, <em>another</em> sorcerer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> It's Micheal's turn, now.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> I walk up and stab the fucker in the neck.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Damn, in the <em>neck</em>? We gotta catch this guy for information!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> You're almost as cruel as the mountain, Micheal!</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Anyways, roll for damage.</p>
<p><em>The group continues to play</em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons <em>for a while longer, before stopping and sharing personal stories.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> …and then I got the fuck out of the <a href="/scp-087">stairwell</a> before the creep got me. Then I got transferred to here, and I had to climb this damn mountain. That's my story.</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Alright, Russel, it looks like it's your turn.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Well, all of you have so many interesting stories, and I'm sorry for being so dull. I was born in Kaliningrad half a century ago. I had a relatively quiet childhood, before I went to Saint Petersburg to study Culinary Arts. I was a chef for the better part of my life, then I came up here.</p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> <em>&lt;At the insistence of Researcher Calvin, connected through radio.&gt;</em> But why did you come up here in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> I'm more interested in how he got up here, with the storms and all.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> It all started when a close friend of mine died here on the mountain. I was devastated, and at the funeral I vowed to make sure nobody died up here again. My vows were strong, and my will stronger, so I constructed a humble cabin to shelter the poor fools who came up here.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3833-3 begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-8990:</strong> What's wrong, Russel?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> It's not the storm, it's the mountain. The mountain <em>hates</em>. It hated Randall back when it swallowed him up. It hates every little person who tries to climb up the mountain. It hates you. And it <em>especially</em> hates me.</p>
<p><em>Pause. SCP-3833-1 is still occurring, creating a record time of 25 hours for duration.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> I'm alright. It's getting pretty late, now. We should go to bed.</p>
<p><em>The group goes to bed. Audiovisual equipment is shut down to preserve power. However, equipment is not reactivated by the group in the morning. Remote activation is necessary. SCP-3833-1 has died down. The equipment is still in the bedroom. The following audio is audible through the equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Ah, you're up quite early.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> That's because we made a decision. We're going to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>D-0110:</strong> Yeah, you're right, this mountain fucking sucks. But you don't have to stay up here alone.</p>
<p><strong>D-5671:</strong> We'll help out wherever we can, we promise.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3833-3:</strong> I don't see why not. It gets a little bit lonely up here, and I'm tired of just having my thoughts for company.</p>
<p><em>The equipment does not record any more dialogue, and runs out of power 72 hours later.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End Log&gt;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STATUS REPORT</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>On 07/19/2018, another group of five D-class personnel were made to ascend Nanga Parbat, and encountered SCP-3833-1. The group was directed to [DATA REDACTED], where SCP-3833-2 was located. It was discovered that two new cabins were built next to SCP-3833-2, apparently for the residence of the original group sent up to SCP-3833-2. The D-Class sent to investigate were persuaded to remove their equipment and enter the cabins. These personnel are considered to have integrated to this community of D-class personnel and SCP-3833-3.</p>
<p>The two new cabins have been designated SCP-3833-2A and -2B. Due to the risk of sending trained agents into SCP-3833, and the risk of losing more D-class personnel to SCP-3833-2, no further personnel are to ascend Nanga Parbat.</p>
