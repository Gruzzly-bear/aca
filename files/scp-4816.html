            <h1>SCP-4816</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Several digital copies of SCP-4816 are securely stored within the Foundation database and are actively watched by embedded system bots. All other found digital copies of SCP-4816 have been erased.</p>
<p>Several physical copies of SCP-4816 are stored within a secure containment locker at Site-19.</p>
<p>Access to the digital and/or physical copies of SCP-4816 must be approved by a Level-3 Researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4816 is a non-anomalous photo which displays a doorway and a white text phrase. SCP-4816 was previously capable of altering its contents, and altered to its current state on July 7th, 2018. SCP-4816 previously displayed PoI-6888 "kkrule"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, known member of GoI-5869 <a href="/gamers-against-weed-hub">"Gamers Against Weed"</a>. Where SCP-4816 was photographed is currently unknown, but is believed to have been in a facility or private home.</p>
<p>See Addendum 1 for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> When SCP-4816 was initially discovered, it was believed to posess anomalous properties. Following extensive research, however, SCP-4816 was deemed non-anomalous and briefly reclassified to a GoI artifact, though SCP documentation was kept for reference. Following this designation, a search was initiated across the United States on July 5th, 2018, utilizing field agents and Foundation webcrawlers, in search of PoI-6888 using SCP-4816 and several copies of it.</p>
<p>38 hours following initiation of the search, SCP-4816's contents were altered. SCP-4816 no longer showed PoI-6888 and had a white text phrase in his place. All digital and physical copies of SCP-4816 were equally altered. The national search was subsequently cancelled, and SCP-4816 was promptly reclassified "Safe". Following further research and several months of inactivity, however, SCP-4816 was given its current object class. SCP-4816 has not exhibited anomalous behavior since, and is being considered for a second reclassification.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> SCP-4816 was initially discovered in a GoI-5869 chatroom by Foundation chatbots. The chat logs discussing SCP-4816 are documented below.</p>
