<br/>
SCP-1486 returned an average menseme score of 30 with minor deviations.<br/>
<br/>
SCP-1176 returned consistent menseme scores of exactly 8.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Rhine-Fort Psionic Resonance Scale, a menseme score of 30 is considered average for a living human adult with normative capacity for thought and emotion. A score below 20 typically indicates an underdeveloped or hindered consciousness. A score below 10 may indicate that a consciousness is severely debilitated, in early development, or merely residual.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all non-anomalous humans return consistent mensemic readings across multiple tests. By contrast, it is typical for intelligent anomalous objects such as SCP-1486 to exhibit greater variation in menseme scores, necessitating a greater number of tests. The exact reason for this disparity is unknown, though the variations are believed to be indicative of material fluctuations in mensemic activity rather than a margin of error.<br/>
<br/>
It may be observed that the consistency of DFPO-A201's results display a greater similarity to normative human intelligence than the results of the tests conducted with SCP-1486. However, at this time there is no evidence to suggest such a resemblance to the human baseline is anything more than superficial.<br/>
<br/>
Despite its physical appearance and unusual personality, SCP-1486 possesses all the characteristics necessary to be considered a non-living animate person, and following the Sapient Objects Act of 2015, has been afforded many of the same rights granted to living human SCP objects of a comparable hazard level.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, DFPO-A201 is wholly inanimate and displays no connection to anomalous phenomena apart from triggering SCP-8986. As per the previous experiment, DFPO-A201 was chosen at random from a publicly operating department store, along with 9 other mannequins which displayed no mensemic activity. Following this experiment, DFPO-A201 was placed in an on-site storage locker for archival purposes.</td>

Irene Scarmer, a high-menseme individual employed by the Foundation to assist in researching conscious energy due to her history of correctly detecting non-living animate objects during field operations.<br/>
<br/>
The Rhine-Fort Psionic Resonance Scale defines a "high-menseme" rating as any score above 35 and below 50. Subjects who fall in this range usually possess a heightened sensitivity to the mensemic emanations of other beings, most commonly in the form of low-level telepathy or psychometric paraperception.<br/>
<br/>
Subjects who display Rhine-Fort scores in the 50 to 75 range may possess the ability to exert influence over the consciousnesses of other beings. Under the Rhine Act, subjects who score in this range must be placed under compulsory evaluation for SCP designation as soon as they are discovered. Rhine-Fort scores in excess of 80 have only ever been recorded in anomalies with obvious ontokinetic qualities.</td>

SCP-8986 occurrence compared to detail score indicated a strong positive correlation; moreover, the data gathered suggests that a theoretical sample of subjects all displaying maximum detail ratings in all categories could present a false-positive frequency as high as 1 in 10.<br/>
<br/>
Of the categories of detail measured, occurrences of SCP-8986 correlated most strongly to realism of facial detail, followed by completeness of body, and then accuracy of proportion. Color and painting of the mannequin showed the weakest relation to frequency of SCP-8986 occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the time, manpower, and electricity required to conduct recent experiments, RG-Θ225's grant request to further repeat testing with an even larger sample size was rejected by the O2 Congress.</td>

<hr/>
<p>In light of expenses incurred from SCP-8986 testing, particularly the labor and power required to undertake Experiment 8986-0154, a hold was issued by the O2 Congress barring additional experimentation-based grants to RG-Θ225.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increased proliferation of false-positive responses across all mensemic measurement devices was deemed to be a critical operational liability, and an initiative was put in place to devise and issue new sensitivity calibration standards for all equipment affected by SCP-8986.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of these changes, occurrences of SCP-8986 ceased to be reported. A movement was passed to redesignate SCP-8986 as Neutralized; however, implementation of this change has been suspended pending the O3 Court verdict on a RAISA injunction co-filed by RG-Θ225.</p>
<p>The basis of the complaint, drafted by former RG-Θ225 lead Dr. Hanneke Minst, puts forward that the SCP-8986 designation should instead be adapted to refer to a newly discovered anomalous error in mensemic measurement devices characterized by the frequent occurrence of false-negative responses when scanning living human subjects, including the entirety of RG-Θ225 personnel.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. A menseme is a Foundation-standard unit used in the measurement of extraphysical energy radiated by conscious beings. Mensemes are spirothaumic and unrelated to the electrochemical processes of normative thought, therefore providing a means by which the Foundation may measure the conscious energy of entities which do not possess brains.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. As SCP-8986 is an anomaly originating from devices which measure mensemes, the subjects of the measurements are not technically considered anomalous by the Foundation and are therefore ineligible for SCP subdesignation. The DFPO designation was created as an alternative means of cataloging objects associated with SCP-8986.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. Automata animated by normative mechanisms are not considered self-animated under this criteria.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. This criteria exists primarily to exclude corpses and objects constructed from corpses, which may naturally retain residual mensemic energy. Objects constructed using materiels derived from traditionally unintelligent organisms generally qualify for DFPO designation, but may be excluded at the discretion of RG-Θ225.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>.

Standard process believed to be the most accurate method of measuring mensemes in a given subject.

Under the Rhine Act, any entity recorded as having a menseme score above 50 must necessarily be contained and entered into candidacy for SCP status, and any score above 70 would trigger an immediate emergency lockdown. However, false-positive responses triggered by SCP-8986 are technically not covered under the Rhine Act, as the official stance of the O5 Council is that the anomaly lies with the method of measurement, and that DFPOs are not themselves anomalous. Nevertheless, a Priority 2 Memo was submitted to the O5 Council by Dr. Minst alerting them to the existence of DFPO-D0230 as a matter of diligence. The memo was recorded as having been received by the O5 offices; as the offices did not deem it necessary to issue a response, Dr. Minst proceeded with testing.</div>
