<p>SCP-8614.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8614 is not to be opened. It is to be kept in a soundproofed containment chamber.</p>
<p>A single agent has been handpicked from available staff to guard SCP-8614 for the duration of their work hours. They are provided with custom headphones and the only key to the object.</p>
<p>The agent is to ignore any and all sound emanating from SCP-8614.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8614 is a locked wooden coffin of unknown age and origin. The coffin is made of inert matter and does not appear to age or deteriorate. The coffin exchanges air with its surroundings every hour. It is otherwise airtight.</p>
<p>The sides of SCP-8614 are covered in funerary art as well as untranslated ███████ glyphs suspected to relate to bloodletting, autocannibalism and ascendance. The illustration depicts scenes of identical women fighting with the victor consuming the blood of the vanquished, and then placing them in a coffin.</p>
<p>Sounds ranging from 30dB to 120dB emanate from the coffin at irregular intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8614-A:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>Agent Horner's provided headphones short-circuit and cease functioning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><em>A scratchy voice can be heard from within the coffin.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> No no no no no, no more voices, stop the voices.</p>
<p><em>Horner quickly turns to face the coffin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Who's there?!</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Nothing but a corpse. Maybe that's what I always was and will be.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> I- are you in the coffin?</p>
<p><em>A soft sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Your voice… It's much nicer than the others. So familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Others? I promise that I've been the only one guarding this coffin for a long time now. It's pretty boring, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> I- You're guarding the coffin? Are you real?!</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> I'd like to think so.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Oh my god. Oh my god. Let me out! LetmeoutLetmeoutLetmeoutLetmeout!</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> I, uh, I don't think I should do that. Freeing an anomaly is a big no-no. I probably shouldn't talk to you either, honestly. I just didn't expect someone to be <em>inside</em> the coffin. Not sure what I thought was inside, to be honest. I'm not paid to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Please. I'm not an anomaly, I work for the Foundation! I was assigned to guard this coffin, SCP-8614, right? Someone pushed me into this coffin and trapped me! You must be who they assigned after me.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> The previous guard did disappear pretty suddenly… It's not too unbelievable, but I need some proof. ████ ███ █████ ████ ████?</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> ███ ███████ █████.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Holy shit. Ok, let's get you out of there.</p>
<p><em>██████ mumbles incoherently as Horner unlocks and opens SCP-8614.</em></p>
<p><em>██████ exits SCP-8614 with help from Horner. They appear emaciated, with eyes both milky white and bloodshot, about the same height as Horner. They are clothed in deteriorating rags.</em></p>
<p><em>Horner helps ██████ to a seat. ██████ is wracked with sobs.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> This is a dream, it must be. The past, the future, when am I? The blood.</p>
<p><em>Horner puts a hand on their shoulder to comfort them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> This is real. You're okay, you're out of there.</p>
<p><em>██████ calms over several minutes. Horner musters ██████'s dishevelled face for a bit, but then shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> I'm sorry, this is just so <em>much</em>. For a while there, I thought the coffin was all that ever existed.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> That's awful. You said someone trapped you in there? Who?</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> The monster from inside the coffin. Impossibly old. Must have been the master of time, the neverbeens never told me.</p>
<p><em>██████ rambles incoherently for a moment. Then clutches their head.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> I'm sorry. Right. I was trapped. Now I'm not.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> You were saying, the monster from the box?</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Oh, I thought I hadn't said it yet. It was crazy, pretended to be human, but something was <em>off</em>; it tricked me into freeing it from the box. Said it got trapped in there. I let it out, and it pushed me in, laughing laughing laughing <em>laughing</em> at me. I can still hear it. That laugh, like it went on forev-</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> God, what happened to you in there?</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Everything. Nothing. Both? I don't know.</p>
<p><em>██████ exhales. and stands with some difficulty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Whoa, there! Careful now.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> I have to see it. I have to see the inside of it now that I'm on the outside.</p>
<p><em>██████ walks towards SCP-8614. Horner follows. They stand side by side looking into the the object.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> It's so much bigger than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> It's weird seeing the inside of this thing after looking at the outside for so long.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> I can't thank you enough for letting me out.</p>
<p><em>██████ hesitates a moment. Then softly mumbles.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> How <em>did</em> you let me out? I'm the only one with-</p>
<p><em>██████ eyes Horner suspiciously. Horner is leaning into the coffin to get a better look.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Hm? Well, I had a key obviously.</p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> Of course. It's so clear now…</p>
<p><em>█████ suddenly shoves Horner into the coffin. Horner seems shocked and slightly dazed, then █████ slams the coffin and locks it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> Hey, what the fuck?! Let me out!</p>
<p><em>Pounding can be heard from within the coffin.</em></p>
<p><strong>██████:</strong> The monster was the only one with another key. You may look different, but it's still <em>you</em> isn't it. Well, let's see how you like it.</p>
<p><strong>Horner:</strong> You're fucking crazy! Open the damn coffin.</p>
<p><em>██████ laughs hysterically.</em></p>
</div>
<p>As per orders of the Temporal Anomalies Department, the preceding Addendum is to be sealed.</p>
<p>██████ debriefed and reassigned. A new guard has been chosen from available staff.</p>
