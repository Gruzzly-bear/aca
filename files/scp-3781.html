            <h1>SCP-3781</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3781</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> On October 11, 1999, all of SCP-3781's publicly available servers were shut down and removed from the Internet. All search results, screenshots, and links for SCP-3781 were completely removed from the Internet. Using IP addresses gathered from the game's database, all players of SCP-3781 were tracked down, detained, and released after being administered Class C amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3781.071901:</strong> Following the incident of July 19, 2001, a mass misinformation campaign was instated with the cooperation of every major space agency in the world to convince the rest of the world that the International Space Station is intact and operational. Further testing on SCP-3781 has been ceased indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3781 is a Japanese massively multiplayer online game titled <em>OK Painter!</em> (OK ペインター!), developed and published in 1999 by Tokyo-based independent video game studio PaintSoft. The game was online for 6 months prior to the Foundation's discovery and its subsequent shutdown on<br/>
October 11, 1999. Data gathered from the game's database revealed that SCP-3781 had a total of 153 players, all of which were located within Tokyo Prefecture.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Players assume control of "Painters", white humanoid creatures drawn in the Japanese "super-deformed" cartoon style and equipped with paint brushes and buckets of paint. Painters serve as the player's avatar and are widely customizable in appearance.</p>
<p>The primary objective of SCP-3781 is to gain rewards and increase in experience level through scaling various buildings in Tokyo using paint. Upon reaching the maximum level of 99, reaching a balcony or rooftop produces a dialog box reading "Leave a cool message?" and the options YES and NO.</p>
<p>Choosing YES prompts the player to type a phrase or quote associated with a piece of popular culture into the provided space. (See Addendum 3781.1 for additional details.) Upon entering the phrase, a cutscene occurs wherein the Painter paints the phrase onto the wall (or floor if on the rooftop) in the format "OK Painter, [input]" Immediately following this, an event involving the Painter is depicted that alludes to the work associated with the inputted phrase.</p>
<p>Approximately 33 minutes and 19 seconds later, the effect produced upon the Painter is followed by an analogous event at a random real-world location. Further testing has suggested that locations of said events are related to the country from which the work referenced by the inputted phrase originates.</p>

<p>Choosing YES when asked to "leave a cool message" produces the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type your favorite phrase from popular culture into the space below. Make sure it's cool!<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">type your phrase here</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phrases must fall within a certain set of criteria to be accepted by SCP-3781. The currently known criteria are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-3781 defines "popular culture" as any narrative communicated by any form of broadcast, digital, outdoor or print media.</li>
<li>The work referenced by the phrase must be a fictional narrative. Descriptions of nonfictional events are considered fictional as long as the characters involved are fictional.</li>
<li>The referenced work must have been made available to the general public at one point in time. Entering a phrase from an unreleased or prototype version of any work that did not appear in the final product produces the message "That's not how I remember it. Try again!"</li>
<li>The phrase must have explicitly appeared within the referenced work itself. Different adaptations of the same narrative are considered separate works.</li>
<li>The phrase cannot include the name of the referenced work. Simply entering the title of the work in question (e.g. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as opposed to "My naked weapon is out.") produces the message "That's too obvious. Try again!"</li>
<li>The phrase must be written exactly as it appears in the referenced work, including grammar and punctuation. Typing a misquoted phrase (e.g. "Luke, I am your father." instead of "No, I am your father."), produces the message "That's not quite right. Try again!"</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of a phrase appearing in multiple works, the work referenced will be the one to which the player has most recently been exposed, or which the player consciously or subconsciously associates with the phrase.</p>

<p>The following experiment logs are all translated from Japanese. All times listed are in Japanese Standard Time (JST) unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>Test 01—</strong>10/12/99, 14:23<br/>
<strong>Player:</strong> Researcher Toriyama<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong>"OK Painter, Special Beam Cannon!"<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> The Painter gains a green complexion and replaces its customized outfit with a white cape with shoulder guards and a white turban. The Painter touches a hand to its forehead, then expels a bright energy beam bounded by rings of light into the distance. A small explosion is observed in the far left corner of the background.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> On October 12, 1999 at 14:56, an abrupt ██████% increase in nuclear radiation levels was detected for 13.39 seconds within a 10 cm<sup>2</sup>wide area of space across a strawberry field outside of ████████, a town in Ibaraki Prefecture. Two hundred and twenty-three (223) strawberry plants were obliterated by the radiation blast; no animals or human beings were harmed.</p>
<p><strong>Test 02—</strong>01/25/00, 12:00<br/>
<strong>Player:</strong> Researcher Fujiwara<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> "OK Painter, You are already dead."<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> A tall, muscular man wearing a blue vest and jeans with white shoulder pads punches through the wall in front of the Painter. He presses his thumbs into the sides of the Painter's head and speaks: "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." The Painter runs around the rooftop for approximately 7 seconds before suddenly clutching its head and collapsing. The screen turns red as a loud, high-pitched warbling tone plays, followed by the sound of an explosion and splattering noises. The word "ひでぶっ!!" is displayed on the screen.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> On January 25, 2000 at 12:33, Japanese news station ███'s breaking news segment covered the murder in broad daylight of ██████ Kazuma, a Yakuza member involved in a series of murders and human trafficking operations across Japan's Kantō region. Kazuma was apprehended and assaulted in the Harajuku district of Shibuya, Tokyo by a man "cosplaying" as the character Kenshiro from the <em>Fist of the North Star</em> manga and anime series. Video footage showed Kazuma's assailant saying "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." This was immediately followed by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Kazuma's official cause of death was listed as severe head trauma and internal hemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>Test 03—</strong> 06/20/00, 19:42<br/>
<strong>Player:</strong> Researcher Takeuchi<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> "OK Painter, You're gonna need a bigger boat."<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Perspective shifts to reveal a large rooftop swimming pool with a small fishing boat at one end. The Painter boards the boat and steers it in brief laps around the pool. Five seconds in, a shark fin appears above the water; three seconds later, a specimen of <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em> (great white shark) emerges and violently consumes the rear half of the boat, causing it to begin sinking. The Painter jumps overboard and swims to safety while the shark consumes the rest of the boat.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> On June 20th, 2000 at 06:15 EST, an illegal shark hunting vessel called the <em>Orca</em> █ miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard was attacked by a male <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, compromising the rear portion of the hull and causing the vessel to sink. The three crew members of the <em>Orca</em> were rescued by Coast Guard vessels patrolling the area, and were apprehended by law enforcement when they arrived on land.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> This is the first time something happened outside of Japan. Perhaps it was because Jaws is an American film? If so, then the locations of anomalous events may depend on the origin of the work referenced by the phrase. We must definitely look into this further. -<em>Dr. Yamamoto</em></p>
<p><strong>Test 04—</strong> 07/16/01, 23:03<br/>
<strong>Player:</strong> Researcher Amano<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> "OK Painter, That is one big pile of shit."<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> An orange <em>Triceratops</em> appears on the rooftop where it feeds on several potted plants. After finishing its meal, the <em>Triceratops</em> defecates loudly, covering the center of the rooftop. It walks back down the access hatch as the Painter pinches its nose.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> On July 16, 2001, at 06:36 PST, a complete fossil of <em>Triceratops prorsus</em> was discovered next to a pile of coprolite weighing approximately 1814.369 kilograms in the backyard of film director Steven Spielberg's mansion in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Well, this certainly seems to confirm my suspicions. I must admit I am interested in running a few more tests just to see how what kinds of weird things happen. Let's just try not to cause any international crises! -<em>Dr. Yamamoto</em></p>
<p><strong>Test 05—</strong> 07/19/01, 03:00<br/>
<strong>Player:</strong> Researcher Sakamoto<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> "OK Painter, The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace."<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The Painter morphs into a tall humanoid figure wearing an orange space suit with a green arm cannon. The figure kneels in front of a green jellyfish-like organism in a glass container and a draconic figure appears, seizing the container and attacking the Painter. The Painter fires several missiles at it before it flies away.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> On July 19, 2001, at 03:33, an unidentified orange spaceship was seen approaching the International Space Station. Surveillance cameras onboard recorded [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in the deaths of all scientists on board. The orange-suited individual was unable to be apprehended, but escaped in the same spaceship from which they arrived. At 03:36, the entire space station exploded. Two unidentified life forms were also seen escaping the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Is it just me or did the person in the orange space suit look like a woman? -<em>Researcher Sakamoto</em><br/>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Goddamnit. -<em>Dr. Yamamoto</em></p>
