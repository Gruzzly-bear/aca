<h3><span>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</span></h3>
<p>As SCP-9110 is still an active case, containment procedures have yet to be developed. It is unknown if it is a one-time event, or a recurring phenomena.</p>
<p>Finding POI-9110 is to remain the top priority.<br/>

<p>POI-9110, David Thompson</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-9110 is the sudden disappearance of David Thompson (POI-9110), which occurred on 03/05/2025.</p>
<p>The unusual circumstances surrounding the event prompted a joint investigation by the UIU and FIIC,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-528422-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-528422-1')">1</a></sup> and resulted in the subsequent classification as an anomaly.

<p>David Thompson is a white male, 179 cm tall, brown hair, brown eyes, 33 years of age at time of disappearance. He is a non-anomalous human, and is member of the sub veil community, currently employed by the Portland division of the UIU.</p>

<p>The last confirmed sighting of Thompson was on the CCTV of the Portland UIU Bureau's parking lot at 15:41, with the SCP-9110 event theorized to have taken place at 15:53.</p>
<p>After he failed to return home within an expected time frame, his absence was reported to the Portland UIU, who began the investigation. A public appeal for information has been raised alongside their efforts, under the guise of a standard, non anomalous disappearance.<br/>

<hr/>
<p>Good Morning Commander Phillips,</p>
<p>I’m writing to formally request an SCP classification for the disappearance of David Thompson. The evidence recovered so far points to clear anomalous activity.</p>
<p>I understand my connections to the case may cause concern. However, I've been cleared by the UIU investigative team, and it would mean a lot to me to be able to oversee this case as the assigned FIIC representative.</p>

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>As your commander, I really have to recommend against it. It's toeing the line of a conflict of interest, if not crossing that line completely.</p>

<h3><span>ADDENDUM 2: INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW</span></h3>
<p>After confirming that Thompson was not at his residence, a search of hospitals, police stations and freeports in the county was begun. The search was halted after only a few hours, as David's coworkers identified his vehicle in the Portland UIU Bureau parking lot.</p>
<p>Following review of the parking lot's CCTV, an effort to retrieve additional footage was initiated, with the goal of establishing a timeline of Thompson's movements.</p>
<p>Further investigation into Thompson’s personal life was also conducted, performed through interviews with relevant individuals and examination of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>Through this process, a number of unusual factors were uncovered that appeared to deviate from David’s standard behaviors, indicating he may have been under duress in the weeks leading up to SCP-9110.</p>
<p>Foul play is suspected.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h3><span>CRIME SCENE OVERVIEW</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Case Identifier:</strong> 869522908<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 9:36<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, 04/09/2025<br/>
<strong>Address:</strong> 2265 NW Savier St<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Parking Lot<br/>
<strong>Vehicle Details:</strong> Light silver TDI VW Golf with the license plate MHK846. No visible signs of damage, tinted windows<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5><span>INITIAL CRIME SCENE NOTES</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>The event had no eyewitnesses, as the other cars visible in the CCTV footage were empty at the time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Akiva and Hume levels were consistent with baseline readings. Slightly elevated EVE readings, but not thaumaturgically significant at present time. Deemed safe to approach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upon attempted entry, the car was discovered to be locked. The key fob was not found inside the car, or anywhere else. No signs of forced entry. An alternative key to the vehicle was retrieved from ████.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-528422-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-528422-3')">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mundane entry and exit routes to the interior appear inaccessible and untampered with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scene turned up clean for latent prints and impression evidence. The only prints at the scene were Thompson’s.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<h3><span>COLLECTED EVIDENCE</span></h3>
<hr/>
<h5><span>Cigarettes and a lighter</span></h5>
<p>A packet of Marlboro Red cigarettes, half empty, and a Bic lighter were found in the glove box. Good condition. Those close to Thompson have reported he was not a smoker.</p>
<h5><span>Blood spatter</span></h5>
<p>Application of luminol revealed traces of blood on the driver's seat, steering wheel, and dashboard. Droplets were not visible to the naked eye, and reconstruction analysis posits the patterns suggest low velocity, pointing away from arterial spray or backswing from a weapon. DNA testing revealed the blood is not human. Further information on the species of origin is inconclusive.</p>
<h5><span>Smell</span></h5>
<p>When entering the car, investigators reported a sharp, pungent odor described as “metallic”, “sharp” and “bleach-like”. While the smell did not belong to a chemical threat, no obvious source could be determined.</p>
<h5><span>Trace evidence</span></h5>
<p>Several chips of clear and beige plastic (Polycarbonate and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), &lt;1mm in length. Non-anomalous. Do not match any items found at the scene.</p>
<h5><span>Phone signal</span></h5>
<p>Cell tower triangulation of Thompson’s mobile phone’s location at time of disappearance corresponded with the location of his car. There was no further movement of the phone until it could no longer receive signals, and is assumed to have run out of battery. Despite this, Thompson’s phone could not be located within the car or surrounding parking lot during the search of the area.</p>

<h3><span>ADDENDUM 3: TIMELINE OF EVENTS</span></h3>
<p>Using CCTV footage gathered from locations in the area, a timeline mapping Thompson’s movements on the day of his disappearance was able to be constructed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<h5><span>ACTIVITY TIMELINE</span></h5>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>9:14</strong><br/>
Thompson departs his residence by car. His partner reported that Thompson had stated he needed to go to the Portland UIU Bureau to "finish some urgent work", and that he would return home "before dinner".<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>9:30</strong><br/>
Thompson parks at the Holman Lane Entrance of Forest Park, exits his vehicle, and enters the park.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>9:47</strong><br/>
Thompson is flagged by the Forest Park's Way's monitoring system, indicating he used it to enter Three Portlands.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>DATA MISSING</strong><br/>
<em>Thompson's actions and exact location during this time are still unknown, due to the lack of accessible and comprehensive video surveillance within Three Portlands.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>13:58</strong><br/>
Thompson returns to his vehicle, and exits the Holman Lane Entrance parking lot.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>14:05</strong><br/>
Thompson enters Stepping Stone cafe. He approaches the counter, orders a cappuccino, and purchases a 500g bag of house blend coffee beans. He seats himself at the table in the back right corner of the shop.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>14:16</strong><br/>
He spends approximately the next hour writing in a notebook,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-528422-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-528422-4')">4</a></sup> although the camera feed’s quality makes determining the contents of said writings impossible.</p>
<p><strong>15:28</strong><br/>
David tears several pages out of the notebook, crumpling them into a ball and depositing them in one of the store's bins.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-528422-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-528422-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>15:37</strong><br/>
Thompson exits the cafe, and enters his car. He exits the car park.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>15:41</strong><br/>
Thompson's car pulls into the parking lot of the Portland office of the UIU.
<p>He parks the car in his assigned space, and then exits the car, walking to the trunk and opening it. He retrieves his service belt, and re-enters the drivers side.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-528422-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-528422-6')">6</a></sup><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>15:53</strong><br/>
A flash of white light, estimated to be in excess of 10 million lumens and lasting 1.39 seconds, emanates from within the car. The car is undamaged.</p>
<p>No further sightings of David are reported following this event.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<hr/>
<h3><span>ADDENDUM 4: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</span></h3>
<p>In the lead up to the SCP-9110 event, those close to Thompson noted he seemed withdrawn and distant. In the weeks before the event, he would frequently return home late, as well as taking several day trips citing confidential work related issues.</p>

<h5><span>INTERVIEW LOG</span></h5>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong>12/05/2025<br/>
<strong>TIME:</strong> 10:27<br/>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Portland UIU Bureau<br/>
<strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Chief Gordon Baker<br/>
<strong>INTERVIEWEE:</strong> Detective Thomas Jackson<br/>
<strong>SUBJECT:</strong> David Thompson</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&gt; AUDIO RECORDING STARTED &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> I know it's procedure, but it feels kinda weird that we’re having this conversation in an interview room rather than in the break room.</p>
<p><em>(Laughs)</em></p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> I know, I know. It’s just how we have to do things.</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Oh, yeah, not complaining. It’s strange is all.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Ok. We’re on record. Are you ready to begin?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Go ahead, chief.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Ok. Great. Can you state your name for the record?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Thomas Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Great. And what was your relationship with David Thompson?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> We’re coworkers. And friends. Y’know, not super close or anything, but he’s one of the guys. We’d all get drinks together on Fridays, I’ve been over to his place once or twice when he would host a get-together. That kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> It would have to be the day before he went missing, so Friday. I can’t tell you when I last saw him down to the minute, but I know he left work at the usual time. I said bye, he said bye, I said ‘see ya Monday’, he said the same. Pretty regular conversation.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Was there anything about the way he was acting that day that seemed unusual to you?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> No.</p>
<p><em>(A brief pause)</em></p>
<p>Well, maybe. Maybe it’s just hindsight, and I’m making a mountain out of a molehill, but he did seem a bit distant. Lost in his own head, that kind of thing. He’s been like that for a while now actually, if I think about it.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Can you elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Ah, well, it was never anything major. He’s always been a pretty quiet guy. Introverted, I guess you could call him. Last couple of months, he seemed to be quieter than usual. Would catch him staring off into space, like he was thinking real hard about something. But when I’d ask him what was wrong, he’d just snap out of it, shake his head and laugh. Said he was just tired, it was making him distracted. And I didn’t have any reason to doubt him, so I just let it be.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(The sound of rustling papers is heard.)</em></p>
<p>That lines up with what I’ve heard from his partner, although he said that David told him he was tired from work. Did he seem to be having a problem with his workload?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> I doubt it. He didn’t seem like he was outta his depth at all - he’s probably one of the best guys at his job there, if I’m being honest. I think he was working a bit more than he usually did, staying late and the like, but he didn’t seem like he was struggling with it at all. Just, invested, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> I see. Could you elaborate on what your department had been working on?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Well, on paper, we’ve been investigating potential Specter activity, but in reality, we’ve mostly just been following up on dead ends.</p>
<p><em>(A chuckle.)</em></p>
<p>Nothing crazy, mostly stuff related to contraband and smuggling. Pretty typical paracrime stuff. You can ask Angela in Records to send you the case files if you want.</p>
<p><em>(A pen is heard scribbling on paper.)</em></p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Thanks, I’ll send her an email as soon as we wrap up here. And speaking of which, there’s not really anything left for me to ask at this juncture. Before we finish, was there anything else you wanted to add?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Not off the top of my head. But Harold?</p>
<p><strong>BAKER:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>JACKSON:</strong> Let me know how the investigation goes, ok? David’s a good guy. Y'know, he even gave me his watch the other day when mine broke? Just the kind of person he is. Real stand up guy. Hope he’s ok.</p>

<h3><span>DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION SUMMARY</span></h3>
<p>Logs of David's archival access, for both physical and digital records, revealed he had been taking strong interest in specific topics.</p>
<p>While these topics were related to his units assigned cases, logs of his activity show he continued to pursue them outside of working hours. Colleagues who were questioned on the matter reported David did not share the topic or purpose of his research with other agents within his unit.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5><span>THE SPECTER</span></h5>
<p>David’s unit had been assigned to investigate paracriminal activity within Three Portlands for possible links to a rumored organized crime group with potential links to GOI-001 (The Chicago Spirit). While now defunct, rumors of a group known as “The Specter” have been circulating in sub-veil communities since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>While the UIU has been aware of said rumors for some time, no credible accounts had been reported within their jurisdiction until the early 2020's. Since then, multiple accounts, although unverified, have been reported of the Specter operating within the Three Portlands. An unusual spike in unlawful imports and exports of controlled and illegal materials has been reported within the Three Portlands since 2023.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5><span>TYPE BLUES</span></h5>
<p>Three Portlands has a substantial community of both licensed and black market thaumaturgists. Routine measurements of EVE levels, taken at a selection of key locations within Three Portlands, has revealed a recent increase in ambient EVE above expected baseline levels. David’s archive search history contained a majority of the POI files kept on known Type Blues within the area.<br/>

<p>Good Morning Commander Phillips,</p>
<p>I’m writing to formally request that the FIIC open an investigation into SCP-9110. My research leads me to believe the event has ties to larger paracriminal organizations, and if so, this may not be a one-off event.</p>
<p>Additionally, since it's David's place of employment, there's a possible conflict of interest regarding the UIU. Even if they aren't involved, the organization could be a target, and having Foundation support could be very beneficial to them.</p>
Sincerely,</div>

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>I understand your concerns, but Foundation involvement in an active UIU case is always tricky to navigate, (with all the potential for stepping on toes involved in the process), and if we wanted to open a case, we would need to move this up the chain of command.</p>
<p>I make no promises, but I can put some feelers out and see how much red tape we would have to cut through to open the case. Unfortunately, I suspect it'll be a lot.</p>
<p>While I respect your involvement in this case, I believe your connection to it may color the perception of urgency in some people’s eyes, and doubt we would receive permission to get involved any more closely than we already are.</p>
<p>I’ll see what I can do, and let you know if there are any new developments.</p>
Regards,</div>

<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>If we can’t open a case, even a few people willing to use their spare time to look over evidence, or a permit to interview some locals in 3Ports would be invaluable. Bea's been helping out where she can, but a few more pairs of eyes could do wonders.</p>
<p>Anything is better than nothing. I appreciate everything you’ve done so far for me, and for him.</p>
