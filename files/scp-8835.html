<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation webcrawlers are to identify and neutralize any mention of SCP-8835 across the Internet. Any surviving records are to be purged from Foundation servers and replaced with redacted copies. All staff are required to affirm their refusal in order to contain SCP-8835.</p>
<div class="mouse">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
That should be enough, right? We said no. We said it clearly.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<p>SCP-8835 is to be suppressed.</p>
<p>SCP-8835 is to be ignored.</p>
<p>SCP-8835 is to be denied.</p>
<div class="mouse">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We keep repeating these lines because they told us that repetition makes containment stronger.</p>
<p>That's not true.</p>
<p>We've tried this before.</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
<p>No, just forget it. Lock the file up.</p>
<p>No one else can know. They'll all say the same thing again.</p>
<p>I should have known better.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8835 is a recurring anomalous phenomenon defined by the inability of affected individuals to recognize or process negative responses, including refusal, denial, and especially the explicit verbalization of "no." When exposed to refusal, subjects universally interpret the interaction as if affirmation has been given, and act accordingly. This effect is consistent across language, medium, and intent.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects presented with verbal denial (e.g., "No, you cannot") will behave as if told "Yes, you may."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Written instructions containing "NO ENTRY" are interpreted as permission to enter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attempts at physical resistance are perceived as invitation, encouragement, or play.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-8835 appears to manifest as patterned behavior within multiple individuals. There appears to be no upper limit to the amount of persons that can be affected by SCP-8835 at once. Attempts to neutralize SCP-8835 by relocating and/or quarantining affected subjects have been unsuccessful. Despite extensive containment attempts, SCP-8835 continues to manifest worldwide.</p>
<div class="mouse">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We tried escalating the warnings.</p>
<p>We tried escalating the refusals.</p>
<p>We thought if we could make the "no" louder, sharper, undeniable, then maybe it would matter.</p>
<p>It never mattered.</p>
<p>Every subject smiles, nods, apologizes, promises.</p>
<p>And then repeats.</p>
<p>They always repeat.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<p>Test results confirm that escalation of refusal, including raised volume and physical force, cause no measurable deviation in outcome. Affected subjects consistently reinterpret all forms of resistance as affirmation.</p>
<div class="mouse">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We tell ourselves it's different each time.</p>
<p>That maybe this is the exception.</p>
<p>That maybe this time, the refusal will register.</p>
<p>But it's always the same.</p>
<p>Why have you done this to me?</p>
<p><em>Why are you doing this to me?</em><br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 8835.1:</strong> Interview with Victim of SCP-8835 Affected Subject</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>I remember the first time. I told them no. I told them calmly, then clearly, then loudly. I said it with my body, I said it with my voice, I said it with my clawing hands.</p>
<p>That was supposed to be the last time. But then it happened again. Different face, different voice, same pattern. Every time I thought I'd found a way out, a way to cut the cycle, it closed itself around me again. You could change the circumstances, change the city, change the people, change me. I changed you. And still, it came back. Again, again, again.</p>
<p>I told myself it was random. I told myself I was unlucky. But luck doesn't repeat with this kind of precision. You start to wonder if the "no" was ever there in the first place. If maybe you only dreamed you said it. If maybe the pattern was always going to happen, and the refusal is just a decoration, a ritual gesture that means nothing. You start to think maybe you deserve it, because why else would it keep coming back? What kind of anomaly repeats with such loyalty, unless it's written into who you are?</p>
<p>I told you it had happened to me before. You wondered how anyone could do such a thing.</p>
<p>Clearly, you figured it out.</p>
</div>
<p>Foundation records indicate that documentation of SCP-8835 has been produced before, although original iterations cannot be located. It is unknown if previous iterations documented the same anomaly.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Again, again, again.</p>
<p>You don't understand how heavy that word is until you feel it pressing on you like a stone. Every time you think you're climbing out, you slip all the way down. Again. Every time you say it's over, you wake up back at the beginning. Again. Again. Again. I don't know how many times this has been. I don't think I could count it, even if I tried.</p>
<p>I remember once, we were sitting outside in late summer. The sky was dark, and it felt like that kind of evening where everything slows down, and for a while I thought maybe this was what it felt like to be safe. You were laughing about nothing, brushing my hair back, and I thought I could stay in that moment forever. I thought, finally, this is different.</p>
<p>But then I look back, and all I can see is the pattern written under every second of it. The way your laughter was a shield, a distraction. The way my smile was permission I never meant to give. The way that "forever" I wanted was already fraying at the edges even as I imagined it. I thought it was a light at the end of the tunnel, but it was a lampfish waiting to bite into me. I thought it was safety, but it was the loop tightening again.</p>
<p>I see it now. I see it clearly. You don't love me. You don't care.</p>
</div>
<p>In controlled interviews, subjects exposed to SCP-8835 describe interpersonal relationships, including family and friends, as illusory. Expressions of care or love are later reinterpreted as elements of SCP-8835's recursive structure. Researchers have noted that this conception persists even when subjects are confronted with verifiable, positive evidence to the contrary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Attempts to break this interpretive cycle have so far failed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>But it's not about the no. It's not about you. It's everyone. It's all of them. Every face, every voice, every empty exchange.</p>
<p>I walk down a hallway and someone smiles at me. I think maybe this one is different. But the smile is paper-thin, an automatic gesture, and it carries me right back to that place I'd swore I'd never return to. A place in my chest that makes me feel sick, that faint nausea of realizing they don't see you at all, they're just playing out the same script that we're all roped into. Their smile takes you there. Every time.</p>
<p>You tell them "I'm fine." They tell you "That's good." You tell them "It's been rough." They say "I know how that is."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Hollow words, hollow faces. Every conversation empties out until there's nothing but the echo of yourself trying to believe you're understood. But you never are. You never were. You never will be.</p>
<p>I used to think small talk was harmless, meaningless filler. Now I think it's SCP-8835 in miniature: the same empty assurances, the "I'm fine" where there should be a cry for help, the same "yes" where there should have been a "no." The same pattern that keeps you in place.</p>
</div>
<p>Researchers now hypothesize that SCP-8835 does not operate as an external anomaly but as an intrinsic inevitability of the universe. <span style="background-color: black; color: white;">⠀SCP-8835 is a fact of life.⠀</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I start to feel like maybe this is the only structure people have, repeating white lies. Maybe we were made for this, our only role is to smile, receive the empty words, and then walk away. Maybe the anomaly isn't them at all. Maybe it's me, standing in the same place while the pattern rebuilds itself around me.</p>
</div>
<div class="marcus">
<p>End log.</p>
<p>The truth is that I've read this file before. I've written it before. The same words, the same sentences, the same collapse. It's all been here already, in another draft, in another cycle. It's a script. We're all just playing our part.</p>
<p>I tell you to stop. You tell me you will. You don't. I don't. Nobody does. I say no and it collapses into yes. I say yes and it collapses into silence. You put your hand out like it's for comfort and it lands like a strike. You say "trust me" and I do, and I shouldn't, and I know I shouldn't, and I still do, and isn't that the joke, isn't that the punishment, isn't that the whole reason SCP-8835 exists? But you were supposed to be different. You weren't supposed to be another pattern. But I guess nothing's ever different. Nothing changes.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8835.2:</strong> Log of SCP-8835 Events</p>
<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<div class="marcus">
<p>They always told me I was different. From the beginning. My teachers, my parents, my neighbors. "Smart kid." "You're gonna be special." "You're going to do something incredible someday." Every word was a prophecy and I believed all of it. How could I not? When you're a child, you take their voices as gospel. I was supposed to be the exception. I was supposed to be the one who broke the cycle.</p>
<p>I still hear it sometimes. And I say thank you, I nod, I try to wear the title like armor. I repeat it to myself when I feel the loop tightening. I am, aren't I? I am smart. I am special. I am different.</p>
<p>But if I'm so different, why does it never change? Why do the people who were supposed to be better end up being the same? Why do the ones who promised me something new fall into the same choreography as all the others? I was supposed to climb higher, to move past this, to outgrow it. That's what they told me. That's what I told myself. But here I am, writing the same words into the same file that's already been written a hundred times before. I'm still sitting here, in the place I should have left behind.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8835.3:</strong> Noted Effects on Victims' Mental State</p>
<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<div class="marcus">
<p>What good is being "special" if it only leads you to the same place as everyone else? What good is being clever if you can't escape? I've tested the pattern, I've studied it, I've out-thought it a dozen ways. And still: the same result. Nothing changes. Nothing has ever changed.</p>
<p>I think that's the hardest part. The disappointment. To look at someone you believed in, someone you thought might be different, and watch them play their part like all the others. To realize it doesn't matter how brilliant you are, how carefully you plan, how loudly you say no. The script will play out. The pattern will hold. The ending will come.</p>
<p>And every time, I am left here asking the same question: If I was supposed to be different, then why does nothing ever change? What can I do? In the end, what have I done?</p>

<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<div class="marcus">
<p>Everything has to start somewhere, right? We were exhausted. It was a good day. We laid down on my bed, and I remember the hum of my fan, the glow of the clock in the corner of the room, and your labored breathing. Your disgusting intakes.</p>
<p>I lay there staring at the ceiling until the drywall blurred into static, until the dark felt like it was pressing on me. I said no. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>I thought sleep would help, that it would soften something. It didn't. And even when I closed my eyes the next night, I was back there again, in that moment where it began, and it never ended.</p>
<p>That night has folded itself into every night since. I can't close my eyes without hearing the air vibrate, without seeing the shape of the room collapse into an endless replay. I can't rest anymore. The mattress might as well be a concrete slab I'm pinned to, waiting to relive that one night every moment of every day.</p>
<p>At least you got what you wanted.</p>

<p>I tried to be different. Again.</p>
<p>I tried to leave it all behind. Again.</p>
<p>I tried to survive. Again.</p>
<p>I tried to love. Again.<br/>

Now all I can do is sit here and wait. I kept waiting for someone to be different. I kept waiting for something to change.</p>
<p>It never did. It never will.</p>
<p>I don't want to move.</p>
<p>I can't sleep. I can't even pretend to. The bed is just a reminder. Every night begins again the same way the first one did, and I know the ending before I've even started.</p>
<p>This body is tainted.</p>

<p>I thought maybe writing it down would save me. That naming it would make it real, make it containable. But there's no containment for this. No procedure. No escape.</p>
<p>SCP-8835 has to be me. SCP-8835 must be me. SCP-8835 is always me.</p>
<p>And I'm tired.</p>
