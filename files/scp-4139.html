</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4139 is to be kept in secure containment lockup with all SCP-4139-1/6 attached, at <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-research-site-45">Site-45</a> outside of testing. The password to the combination lock affixed to SCP-4139 is restricted to level 2 personnel.</p>
<p>If SCP-4139 exhibits unusual noises or rocking, research leader Samuels must be contacted along with site security to allow for acquisition of POI-326.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4139 is a medium sized, white, single-door fridge/freezer of unknown brand and make. SCP-4139-1 through -6 refers to 6 crude drawings depicting people and objects in various activities, including picnicking, space travel, and intercourse. Aside from a combination lock affixed to the front door, SCP-4139 has no electrical components. The back of SCP-4139 consists of a small assembly of pipes, ending in two curved openings.</p>
<p>SCP-4139-1/6 instances act as a control board for SCP-4139, meaning that the manipulation of their placement on the front of SCP-4139 can alter its properties. These properties only take effect when SCP-4139-1/6 are connected to SCP-4139 through the use of magnetism. SCP-4139 functions as a non-anomalous fridge cooling at 1.6°C as long as SCP-4139-1/6 are attached to it. The relation between the arrangement of SCP-4139-1/6 and the effects are not fully understood, prompting a trial and error approach to research.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> As of writing, these are the known orientations of SCP-4139-1/6 and their properties:</p>

<td>A gas chemically similar to class A amnestic is released from the holes on the back of SCP-4139 until the orientation of SCP-4139-1/6 is altered. The gas vents at a low rate, tending to take many hours to effectively fill a standard test chamber.</td>

Paper scraps extend from the pipes on the back of SCP-4139, seemingly cut off crudely, presumably by POI-326. analysis of the remaining scraps imply the document to be a users guide for SCP-4139, prompting researchers to consider the origin of SCP-4139 extended prior to POI-326.</td>

<p>Due to the extensive possible arrangements of SCP-4139-1/6, it is unknown how many phenomena can be produced through the manipulation of SCP-4139. Estimates based on current ratio of successful to unsuccessful combinations suggest that there may be up to 200 separate phenomena possible.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> The following is the Audio/Video log transcript from the raid on POI-326's hotel apartment, in which SCP-4139 was discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery Team Audio/Video Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 28/6/██</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> MTF-Delta 11 ("Wonderers")</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> ██████, WA, Australia</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> D11-Cap</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> D11-1 / D11-2 / D11-3 / D11-4 / D11-Sup</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Delta-10 had been tracking the movements of POI-326 since his initial connection with Dr. Wondertainment as a contract carrier in association with SCP-████. The incursions objective was to capture POI-326 for interrogation, and possible containment of related anomalous materials.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>D11-Sup:</strong> Audio and visual recording online. Fun's over.</p>
<p><strong>D11-Cap:</strong> That's right Johansson, you wouldn't want <em>that</em> on official record.</p>
<p><em>D11-2 chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-Cap:</strong> When we get up there, we're looking to apprehend three twenty-six as quickly as possible. Mr. Manchild<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> said that he noticed old-english lookin' runes around the entire area, so be looking out for alchemy.</p>
<p><strong>D11-Sup:</strong> Remember, if conventional medical attention isn't working, try a bezoar. If that isn't working, it probably isn't alchemy.</p>
<p><em>The elevator door opens to the 4th floor with police tape blocking every door except that leading to apartment 8. The hallway is clean aside from a purple, painted thaumic hazard on the roof above apartment 8. In the centre of this is a security camera, aimed at the elevator with a cord running into the top of the door. D11 had experienced little training against Thaumaturgical anomalies, allowing none of them to effectively visualise the camera clearly.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-Cap:</strong> Hemsworth, check rooms one through seven and Johansson, nine through twelve.</p>
<p><em>D11-Cap, D11-2, and D11-3 approach the door to apartment 8 and perform routine check for alchemical anomalies, allowing for the thaumic hazard to go undetected. D11 was later reprimanded for negligence. D11-2 unlocks the door revealing an immaculately cleaned walkway opening to a kitchen. SCP-4139 is visible at the end of the walkway, but goes unnoticed due to its unexceptional appearance. D11-2 moves into a the bathroom to the left while D11-3 walks further down the hall, revealing a hole in the wall leading to room 7 surrounded by similar paint as outside. D-10-sup notices this hazard.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-3:</strong> The wall's knocked in here. The rooms are connected. <em>(begins walking towards the hazard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-sup:</strong> Careful in your approach three, that looks thaumaturgical.</p>
<p><em>D11-3 looks around but appears not to be able to see the paint. She moves over to the hole in the wall. As she steps over, a bright flash damages the video feeds from D10-3 and D10-Cap. Yelling and thumping is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-Cap:</strong> What the hell is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>D11-3:</strong> Cut it off!</p>
<p><em>D11-2 Rushes down the hall to the others. The painted section of floor has extended out of the ground and attached around D10-3's leg. D10-Cap uses his field knife to cut the protuberance, causing it to disintegrate into wet paint.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-2:</strong> That thing looks bloody disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>D11-3:</strong> Behind you!</p>
<p><em>D11-2 turns, showing POI-326 running down the walkway to SCP-4139. POI-326 opens SCP-4139 while rearranging the SCP-4139-1/6 obscured from the body cam. D11-Cap shoots POI-326 in the leg, causing him to collapse into the open door. D11-2 runs to SCP-4139 as it closes.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-2:</strong> Put your hands behind your head!</p>
<p><em>D11-2 opens SCP-4139, which appears to be entirely full of carrots and potatoes. They tumble out knocking over D11-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>D11-Cap:</strong> Where'd he go?</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Due to the large vegetable mass in the room when collecting SCP-4139, and the disorderly actions of D11, the order of SCP-4139-1/6 used by POI-326 in his escape is unknown. Knocking and muffled vocalisations were heard originating from inside SCP-4139 roughly 30 days after procurement of SCP-4139. Due to the possibility that POI-326 may still be inside, testing of SCP-4139-1/6 combinations has been deemed top priority for discovering the whereabouts of POI-326.</em></p>
