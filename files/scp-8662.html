<p>SCP-8662 with the majority of SCP-8662-1 removed, prior to retrieval. When SCP-8662 reached Site-65, the trunk had reached full capacity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8662 is to be kept in a refrigerated, dry containment chamber, designation Containment Chamber α12. Assigned level 1 personnel must remove <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">at least</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">4</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">8</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">16</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">32</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kilograms</span> as much SCP-8662-1 as possible per day. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The rear trunk of SCP-8662 must always be closed when leaving its containment chamber.</span> The door to its containment chamber must be closed as soon as any SCP-8662-1 is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8662 is a red 2003 Honda Civic with a trunk completely filled with smooth peanut butter (SCP-8662-1). SCP-8662 was discovered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan after its owner was pulled over by local law enforcement during a routine traffic stop. Foundation agents within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police retrieved SCP-8662 from a civilian impound lot after the owner of the lot reported that SCP-8662-1 had seemed to be multiplying and transported it to Site-65 for containment.</p>
<p>When any volume of SCP-8662-1 is removed from SCP-8662, the remaining SCP-8662-1 will undergo a process of duplication which continues until it fills <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the trunk of SCP-8662</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Containment Chamber α12</span> the west wing of Site-65. Replacing the removed SCP-8662-1 does not halt the duplication process. The speed at which this process occurs is relative to the amount of SCP-8662-1 removed with an unknown maximum.</p>
<p>When SCP-8662-1 reaches the volume of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the trunk of SCP-8662</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Containment Chamber α12</span> the west wing of Site-65, it will stop duplicating, unless given access to another area. Access must be through an open door, window, or other stationary opening. Testing has shown that SCP-8662-1 will attempt to fill Containment Chamber α12 before it moves on to other parts of the facility, allowing it to be contained with regular removal.</p>
<p>Initial testing shows that any removed SCP-8662-1 does not contain the necessary properties to duplicate, and is safe for human consumption. Body scans show no anomalous effects, outside of a minor increase in dopamine production, slightly above the normal range after consuming food. Site staff are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">permitted</span> encouraged to requisition <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a reasonable</span> any amount of SCP-8662-1 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for personal use</span>. Excess SCP-8662-1 must be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">incinerated</span> kept in site storage until the incinerator can be repaired.</p>

<p>Hi Clarence,</p>
It's very nice to hear from you! Your email was a nice, unexpected surprise. How are the wife and kids? I hear the weather up there is pretty cold this time of year.<br/>
Anyways, unfortunately, your request for additional funding for Site-65 was denied by regional administration. But you're resourceful! I'm sure you'll find extra room in your budget for everything that needs to be repaired. After all, your site's been containing the same anomalies for years. I'm sure you'll figure it out.<br/>
Keep me in the loop if SCP-8662 turns out to be something interesting. Otherwise, I'll be up for a visit sometime after the snow thaws!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup><br/>

<p>Hi Clarence,</p>
<p>Boy, your staff up there are certainly something. I have an idea though. Why don't you placate Dobbs with a new title or something? Sure, he has to give up his cold storage to store SCP-8662, but why don't you call him "Nutrient Overseer" or something, just to make him feel more important?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> But I told you you'd be resourceful and come up with a solution.</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>FROM THE DESK OF THE SITE DIRECTOR</span></h4>
<p>01/07/16<br/>
Memorandum to all staff:</p>
<p>Initial trials for SCP-8662 and SCP-8662-1 have been completed. As SCP-8662-1 has been deemed safe for consumption, site staff can now requisition a portion of SCP-8662-1 for personal use. Site staff are asked to use SCP-8662-1 in a responsible, cautious manner, and are reminded that SCP-8662-1 is still in containment, and is not to be removed from Site-65. SCP-8662-1 can be requisitioned from <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> Nutrient Overseer Dobbs, then retrieved from Containment Chamber α12 (Formerly Site-65 Cafeteria Cold Storage).</p>
<p>— Dr. Clarence Johnson, Director, Site-65</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Incident 8662-A</strong></p>
<p>On 01/07/16 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> Nutrient Overseer Reginald Dobbs opted to include SCP-8662-1 as part of the daily on-site lunch menu. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> Nutrient Overseer Dobbs neglected to mention the addition of SCP-8662-1 or mention a potential allergy risk. Dr. Samira Pakan, who has a severe peanut allergy, was half way through a chocolate banana smoothie when <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> Nutrient Overseer Dobbs remembered the allergy. Dr. Pakan was rushed to the medical station to be given an epinephrine injection, however, they did not show any symptoms of an allergic reaction on the way there. Site medical staff determined that while bio-identical to peanut butter, Dr. Pakan shows no allergenic symptoms to SCP-8662-1.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<h4 id="toc1"><span>FROM THE DESK OF THE SITE DIRECTOR</span></h4>
<p>01/08/16<br/>
Memorandum to all staff:</p>
<p>As per Foundation food provisions guidelines, any food served in the cafeteria needs to be labeled for allergens. Since SCP-8662-1 has many similarities to peanut butter, this includes SCP-8662-1. It is noted that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> Nutrient Overseer Dobbs has issued a formal apology to Dr. Pakan due to the inclusion of SCP-8662-1 in yesterday's lunch, and site medical staff have determined that Dr. Pakan's peanut allergy does not extend to SCP-8662-1.</p>
<p>— Dr. Clarence Johnson, Director, Site-65</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Incident 8662-B</strong></p>
<p>On 01/10/16, after completing requisition requests for SCP-8662-1, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cafeteria Manager</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nutrient Overseer</span> Cafeteria Manager Reginald Dobbs was locking up the containment chamber for SCP-8662, but neglected to close the trunk of SCP-8662. This resulted in a containment breach as SCP-8662-1 had pushed out beyond the locked door of its containment chamber, and into the cafeteria of Site-65. On-site crews were able to clean up the additional SCP-8662-1 and incinerate it. However, this removal resulted in SCP-8662-1's regeneration speed to increase dramatically, making it impossible to contain it inside of the trunk of SCP-8662. Due to the alarming rate of SCP-8662-1 production, testing will commence on a new minimum daily volume for removal.</p>

<p>01/12/16<br/>
Memorandum to all staff:</p>
<p>Due to the incident yesterday involving SCP-8662-1 and Dr. Pakan's office, site staff are reminded that due to the nature of the Foundation, acquiring trained and efficient janitorial staff with proper security clearance is extremely difficult. This is not an appropriate way to test the limits of Dr. Pakan's lack of allergic reaction to SCP-8662-1. I have approved overtime for any site staff who wishes to assist with removing SCP-8662-1 from the walls of Dr. Pakan's office, and I would like to remind staff that any future 'pranks' such as this will be met with disciplinary action.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure filling the trunk of my car with SCP-8662-1 is a violation of the ethics code. I have no idea how you managed to get that much SCP-8662-1 in there. I now need to get it deep cleaned and I can't exactly take it to a civilian detailing place. Removing SCP-8662-1 from containment for any reason other than disposal is no longer permitted.

<p>Look, I get it's funny, but making life-sized statues and dressing them up in lab coats and ID badges to spook me is NOT OK.

Memorandum to all staff:</p>
<p>Please just stop. Just stop. I've had enough. I came in today, and everything in my office had been replaced with a 1:1 scale model made of SCP-8662-1. Haven't I been tortured enough? I am locking up the cold storage, and throwing away the damn key.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 8662-C</strong></p>
<p>On 01/26/16, Site Director Johnson ordered the incineration of all SCP-8662-1 outside of the trunk of SCP-8662. Despite the best efforts of site staff, the regeneration rate of SCP-8662-1 outpaced removal efforts. The sheer volume of SCP-8662-1 that was removed has caused permanent damage to the site's incinerator, leaving it in a state of disrepair. SCP-8662-1 was successfully re-contained in its containment chamber, and the removed SCP-8662-1 was put into site storage. After this incident, Site Director Johnson put in for a four-day leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 8662-D</strong></p>
<p>On 01/28/16, due to severe neglect from site staff, there was a containment breach as SCP-8662-1 had expanded out of its containment chamber, and filled up the Site-65 cafeteria. It then further expanded into the hallways until it took up the entire West Wing. It is unknown which member of staff was responsible for the breach, but it is assumed that someone must have faked clearance above the site director to open the containment chamber. Investigations are ongoing.</p>
