<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9104 is a fissure in the ground at Site-109's main warehouse, approximately 0.93m in size. It does not pose any threat to base-level normalcy or living organisms, nor does it expand in size. It is unambiguously a regular crack in the floor, constituting no danger at all, that maintenance at the Site has delayed fixing (due to plain indolence).</p>
<p>It has been designated an anomaly in this file solely to expedite processes to repair it, as well as to hasten explanation to any Foundation employee who inquires about its existence.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Though it is not fully understood how this crevice was formed, it is known that it was not present prior to June 16th, 2020. A low-level researcher stumbled over the fracture while checking inventory, and reported it to their superiors impetuously. Upon extensive experimentation, Dr. X. Flip and his team determined the crack to be a simple, physical error in the warehouse floor, likely due to a low-magnitude earthquake, and thus directed Foundation activities elsewhere, reprimanding the researcher for hastily reporting a false anomaly.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area around SCP-9104 has been sectioned off, so that no researchers without clearance can access the anomaly, though it is still visible from other levels of the warehouse. Additionally, tungsten plates were placed in the ground to ensure the anomaly does not extend any further, acting as structural braces.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9104 is a fissure in the ground at Site-109, beginning at 0.93m in size, but has now grown to approximately 2m (though is still actively expanding). Using a Kant counter, the crack and surrounding area's Hume level was measured to be 17.4 Hm (after taking the distortions to Hume levels from other anomalies contained at the site into account). As such, the Foundation has determined that this is not an overt threat to reality, and has allowed general staff to continue using the facility to be able to carry on with the Site's overall responsibilities.</p>
<p>Despite this, it is not currently known what force has caused this anomaly to grow. The fracture extends across the floor of the Site's main storage facility, lengthening at erratic rates that have shown no statistical consistency. However, the crevice has not seemed to halt its growth since it has first been observed, and has appeared to, in fact, slightly increase in efficiency.</p>
<p>It is also currently unknown whether SCP-9104 has a will or goal, but the anomaly still does not appear to have any adverse mental or physical health effects on those exposed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Researcher Ian Corcoran was the first to discover SCP-9104 during a routine inventory check, and reported it to his supervisor, Dr. Elijah Ross, who was skeptical if the fissure had any properties to constitute it as anomalous. It wasn't until the attached interview that strict experimentation was ordered.</p>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Discovery Log</span></h2>
<p><em>Interviewed:</em> Ian Corcoran, Level 2 Researcher</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Dr. Elijah Ross</p>
<p><em>Foreword:</em> Dr. Elijah Ross, concerned by Researcher Ian Corcoran's sudden anxiety about what he percieved to be a "crack so small, it isn't even a tripping risk", administered a psychological evaluation to determine whether Researcher Corcoran had sufficient ability to continue work at Site-109.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>(Dr. Elijah Ross sits across from Ian Corcoran, pulling out a large binder, flipping through the pages, then reading through the contents out loud, strictly and with little intonation.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Hello, Mr. Corcoran. Thank you for your cooperation. I hope that you are not too uncomfortable with the current situation.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran nervously fidgets in his seat.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Well, it's- This is…pretty intense for me, to say the least. I only really catalogue things here digitally. I've never actually seen any of the…things we keep in the facility.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> <em>(Still reading)</em> I apologize for any inconvenience. However, I am here to assess whether or not your current attitude poses a liability to the Foundation, and to ensure-</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> -continued enthusiasm and willingness to participate in Site-sanctioned activities. I know the spiel, Eli.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross looks up from the binder, silently staring. Corcoran immediately becomes uncomfortable.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Sorry, I- I didn't mean- I have the utmost respect for-…<em>(Sigh)</em> Just, go on, please.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'd like to begin with a simple appraisal of your present level of awareness. Can you tell me what today's date is?</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> It's June 16th.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Good. How long have you worked at the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> I think we're coming up on three years now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Alright. Now please describe the events that transpired after you left work yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Well, it's like I told you. I drove home, fixed dinner for my mother. She uh- She can't really cook for herself, at this point. Then I got ready for bed and slept. Nothing really out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> You told me yesterday you were concerned that there was a new anomaly emerging. That this crack-</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> -Yeah, uh, I should- I'm sorry about that. My therapist says I have the tendency to…sensationalize things. Uh, like…create problems before they exist, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> So you're not anxious about this anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Well, I <em>wasn't</em>. I tried to reassure myself that I was just doing my whole pattern over again, tried to remember what my therapist said I could do to calm down…and then I came in today and it was bigger. Then, everything just…started all over again. <em>(Sigh)</em> I'm starting to think I won't ever be able to do anything about it.</p>
<p><em>(A short pause. Corcoran looks down, then catches himself, jolting back to meet Dr. Ross's eyeline.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> But y- you're right. It's probably just a crack in the floor. I don't want to waste your time with this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> My concern is that it will affect your work. You have a history of mental illness?</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> I mean- I guess a little bit. B-but it's not an issue. I can keep working. I'm managing, and…I'll keep at it.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross studies him, combing over his body with his eyes. The silence continues for a minute more before Corcoran speaks up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Could you stop that, please? You're making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, Dr. Ross's Foundation-issue cellular phone chimes. He calmly picks up the phone and answers with little urgency.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Is there a problem?</p>
<p><em>(A short pause. There is no reaction from Dr. Ross.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Understood. I'll be right there.</p>
<p><em>(He hangs up the phone.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I must go. Apparently this crack you found just expanded once again.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> You're kidding me! So this might actually be…something?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'll be the one to determine that.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran studies Dr. Ross's expression, puzzled.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Why does it seem like this doesn't bother you <em>at all</em>?</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross rolls his eyes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Please, it's a crack in the floor. I've seen a whole lot during my time here, and nothing has ever managed to faze me.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Sounds like a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> It isn't.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Well, it's just- you know that most agents train for years to reach that level of…confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I wouldn't presume it's confidence.</p>
<p><em>(Abruptly, Dr. Ross stands up and walks toward the door.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> You can go home for today. Try not to have a panic attack on the drive home.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Uh…sure. I'll give it a shot.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Afterword:</em> Upon inspection of SCP-9104, and witnessing the expansion firsthand, Dr. Ross determined that classification within the Foundation's official system was necessary, and experimentation would begin to attempt to slow the growth of the anomaly.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-109 has been reduced to 50% capacity, only retaining staff above Level 3 Clearance to safely continue the containment of other anomalies at the site. Additionally, several Scranton Reality Anchors were placed around Warehouse 109a, as the Hume level surrounding the anomaly has risen steadily to 103 Hm, and does not show signs of slowing its increase.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9104 is a large gap in the ground, located in Site-109's main warehouse, that continues to grow at a seemingly exponential rate, beginning at just 0.93m, but now extending to over 32m. Although growth has significantly hastened since it was first located, a small dip in the acceleration of expansion was noticed after Site-109 was fully evacuated.</p>
<p>SCP-9104 has also recently begun to grow various flora alongside its walls, including Prickly Russian Thistle (<em>salsola tragus</em>), Winged Pigweed (<em>dysphania atriplicifolia</em>), and Resurrection Plant (<em>selaginella lepidophylla</em>). Despite the fact that these plants continue to enlarge as if they are living, all species of flora that develop within the anomaly appear brown and completely lifeless. Samples have shown that this vegetation is not currently alive, and shows no signs of ever containing moisture or any living tissue.</p>

<p>While attempting several expeditions to explore what lies at the bottom, the gorge continued to expand, causing the climbing gear of several agents to malfunction and disengage, dropping the agents down until they were trapped in between the floor. Site Administrators advised not to mount rescue expeditions for the lost agents, and not to expend any further staff to physically explore inside the rift. Their screams and struggling continued for several days as the gap expanded more swiftly than usual, until the agents presumably dropped low enough to be out of earshot.</p>
<p>As opposed to further expeditions, video and audio surveillance devices will be used to monitor the condition of SCP-9104.</p>

<h2 id="toc1"><span>Expedition Log</span></h2>
<p><em>Reporting Agent: Dr. Elijah Ross</em></p>
<p><em>18 Jul. 2020</em></p>
<p><em>Foreword:</em> Researcher Ian Corcoran was retained as "essential staff", due to his initial discovery of SCP-9104, and has been responsible for all documentation related to SCP-9104. He and Dr. Elijah Ross have, at present, visited the anomaly 14 separate times.</p>
<p>On this expedition, Dr. Ross carried a small camera along with him, attached to an appendange that can be mechanically lowered at will, to potentially gain insight into the contents of the anomaly without risking personnel.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>(Dr. Elijah Ross and Ian Corcoran enter Warehouse 109a. As soon as the door opens, the entire floor rumbles slightly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Holy hell, it's- it's grown <em>so much</em> since last week.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> <em>(Dispassionate)</em> Seems the anchors haven't done much to stop it. Nor has decreased observation. You were right that it would only continue growing.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> I <em>really</em> didn't want to be.</p>
<p><em>(They both begin walking closer toward SCP-9104.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> This is- This is getting <em>really</em> bad. Shouldn't we alert the Council? Can't one of them do something about all of this? Fast-track experiments, or try some special power or whatever the fuck they have…anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I don't think it's time for that quite yet. I still have some hypotheses that I'd like to put to the test. There's much left for us to do here.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> "There's much-"…Are you serious? It's almost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">swallowed</span> this building! How are you not concerned about this?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> <em>(Sigh)</em> I'm growing tired of explaining my disposition to you.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Wh- Then what are you even doing here?! The whole <em>point</em> of working at this place is to protect others, to shield people from these…downright <em>horrific</em> things. You're telling me that you "don't care" about the damage this could to do people's lives?!</p>
<p><em>(A short pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> I have no idea how you could spend so much time fighting for humanity, trying to <em>understand</em> these things, if you have no value for other people. I mean, what the hell is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong</span> with y-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -Corcoran. This is unprofessional. Dr. Flip has placed me in charge of investigating 9104, so it's my call. No Council yet. We do not need their aid. I'm not sure they'd be able to do much more than us, anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Okay, so then why do <em>I</em> have to be here?! I don't want to look at this thing! I usually never see these things, I just write about them. It was always easier to help that way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> We're still monitoring to make sure that this doesn't present any adverse effects. Sometimes it can take months. We'd rather not expose anyone else until we're absolutely sure that there isn't any harm done from viewing the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> You, uh- You seriously think it could still, like, melt me or something?</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross stops walking and turns to Corcoran, raising an eyebrow. The chasm groans once again behind them.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Melt you?</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> I don't know! I've heard some horror stories about the people who've worked here-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -At this point, I'm sure you'll be fine. It's just a precaution. Not to mention: you're the first one who saw this anomaly. Dr. Flip instructed us to keep you along, just in case you might possess any valuable knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> So, we're just throwing whatever we can think of at this thing? That's…not reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Well, no one's priority is to reassure you.</p>
<p><em>(The fissure rumbles once more, as the chasm visibly extends another 0.2 meters. Dr. Ross observes Corcoran's reaction.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> AH! Shit! It's- We should get out of here. I don't need to see this thing anymore. We got the picture. It's bigger. It's <em>always</em> bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> The addition of this device will benefit us in the future. Just continue recording the investigation and our findings. That's all you need to worry about.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran takes a deep breath, composing himself.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Okay…Okay, okay. I'll just- I'll keep writing.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross shakes his head in disapprobation, slowly inching further toward the anomaly. Carefully, he affixes the device near the edge of the fissure. Just as he moves to secure the clip in place, the gap quakes once more.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Shit! Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> <em>(Annoyed)</em> Yes, yes, calm down. It barely moved.</p>
<p><em>(After the clip snaps into place, Dr. Ross lowers the camera down into the abyss below. Corcoran closely watches, intensely staring at the camera as it descends. There's a long moment of silence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Is it working-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -I don't know yet. Please: enough talking.</p>
<p><em>(A short pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> <em>(Whispering)</em> Sorry…</p>
<p><em>(The crevice vibrates to life, rupturing the ground further throughout the floor. As the pieces of rock give way below it, the device holding the camera falls into the rift. Dr. Ross reaches out to catch the apparatus, but is a moment too late, watching as it slinks into the darkness.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Oh, God, you're <em>kidding</em> me!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Well, that is a shame.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross stands up, dusting his hands off on his lab coat. Waiting, he listens for the camera to echo back once it hits the ground, but no sound comes. Corcoran simply stares at the crack, inching away in fear.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'll check the feeds to see if anything is still coming back, but if there is a "floor" to that anomaly, then it definitely won't survive the fall. Which means, next steps: We're going to need some sort of pulley system to suspend the camera directly above SCP-9104. I can't presume the ceiling of this warehouse will hold up much longer. The walls have already taken a beating. And we can't continue-</p>
<p><em>(The crack shakes, expanding once again, moving quickly toward the walls of the warehouse, and causing small fisures to form up the base.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> That's it! W-we have to go. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Then go, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> No, it's- You have to come back with me. It's not safe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> You don't need to worry for me, Corcoran.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> No, I do! Because you clearly have <em>no</em> survival instinct! We <em>need</em> you here at this Site! How else are we going to-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -I'm beginning to grow impatient with you, so I'll tell you once more: Leave. Now.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran hesitates, but then turns and walks quickly out of the warehouse, exasperated, as the chasm continuing to widen and vibrate with every step he takes. Dr. Ross watches intently, then turns back toward SCP-9104, pondering the results of this expedition.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All attempts to contain SCP-9104 have failed, as it continues to grow to encompass nearly the entire area of Site-109. Investigation is still ongoing to attempt to lessen the effects of 9104, and to permanently restore Site-109 to its former condition. Until then, nearly all staff have been released from their duties at the site temporarily.</p>

<p>The final photograph of SCP-9104, taken by Dr. Ross on May 7th, 2021.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9104 is a large chasm, splitting the grounds of Site-109 completely in half. Though it originated from within a single warehouse, the abyss has steadily grown to incorporate more and more of the nearby land. In the few weeks since its initial discovery, it has expanded from a small crack in the floor to a colossal gorge.</p>
<p>There has been no successful attempts to explore further downward in the anomaly, and the Foundation has been unable to discern if SCP-9104 has any "floor" at all. Despite no signs of life within the anomaly, it has been observed to grow various plants alongside the edge of its cliffs. Although they continue to enlarge and multiply, the flora itself appears dead and lifeless. It is unknown where these plants emerge from, what forces cause them to grow, or if they were ever alive in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9104.A: <em>Incident Log</em></strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center">
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Incident Log</span></h2>
<p><em>Date of Incident:</em> August 27th, 2020</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>Description:</em> SCP-9104, steadily expanding throughout the site, fractured through Containment Stucture 109a's main foundation, causing an entire wall to collapse in an instant. As panic ensued, the anomaly continued to expand at a rapid rate through the center of the edifice, widening enough to engulf a large piece of the structure, effectively splitting the building in half.</p>
<p>22 employee lives were lost during the initial subsidance, and an additional 14 were injured due to the demolition. Additionally, SCP-████ and SCP-████-1, which were contained near the area of destruction, were able to use the diversion to escape containment, and are actively at large.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Recourse:</em> SCP-████ poses little overt physical harm and damage to nearby civilization relative to SCP-████-1, so the latter will be given strict priority. Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 ("Green Stags") has been requested to assist in acquisition of both anomalies with immediate urgency.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 14 Nov. 2020:</strong> SCP-████ has been located, but has eluded the MTF's grasp on 6 separate occasions. SCP-████-1 has been seen once, but immediately eliminated all witnesses. MTF Mu-9 ("Land's Hand") requested for further assistance in securing SCP-████-1.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 3 Jan. 2021:</strong> SCP-████ has been captured and successfully contained.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 8 Apr. 2021:</strong> SCP-████-1 was located once again, but was able to dispose of all witnesses before containment procedures could proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 21 Jun. 2021:</strong> SCP-████-1 was finally able to be subdued and contained at 3:47 A.M. Both anomalies have been fully secured once again, following the immediate reconstruction of their containment units within Site-109. Remaining members of MTF Gamma-4 are to return to Site-44.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9104.B: <em>Final Expedition Log</em></strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center">
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Expedition Log</span></h2>
<p><em>Reporting Agent: Dr. Elijah Ross</em></p>
<p><em>2 May 2021</em></p>
<p><em>Foreword:</em> Dr. Elijah Ross continued regular investigation into the anomaly, specially permitted by Dr. X. Flip. Upon request, Researcher Ian Corcoran was also brought to the grounds of Site-109, though agents were required to be dispatched to forcibly retrieve him from his home.</p>
<p>The following was transcribed from recovered audio files inside Observatory 109.G, which was established out of SCP-9104's presumed path of destruction.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>(A small rumbling sound can continuously be heard throughout the entire recording. Agents Rea Kovaçi and Sadiq Aiza guide Dr. Ross and Researcher Corcoran into Observatory 109.G.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Rea Kovaçi:</strong> As you can see, our two main Containment Buildings' structural integrity continues to be threatened by SCP-9104.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ian Corcoran:</strong> Oh my god. I-…I can't be here, anymore. I've already been thinking about this thing day and night, as it is. Why, <em>why</em> did you bring me back?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Elijah Ross:</strong> I wanted to assess a few more things, and I suspect it may aid my observations if you're present as well.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran emits a small whine under his breath.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> So, how much further has it expanded?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Sadiq Aiza:</strong> Since the collapse? About another 70 meters.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Hm…much more and we won't have a site any longer. Perhaps Dr. Flip should alert the Council.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Wait, <em>what</em>? You haven't <em>told</em> them yet?! What is the matter with you-</p>
<p><em>(The rumbling in this distance grows in force.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -Dr. Flip agreed not to request further aid until absolutely, wholly necessary. They don't take those requests lightly, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> But this is completely out of control! We have to tell <span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone</span>!</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran turns to the two agents who guard him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> You two- You- You both know that I'm right, right? I mean, this is- this could destroy <em>everything</em>. How could- How can you just stand there?!</p>
<p><em>(Agents Aiza and Kovaçi eye one another.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> You <em>have</em> to understand! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please.</span> Please, help me here!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Pay no mind to Researcher Corcoran. He's always been easily spooked.</p>
<p><em>(A short pause. The two guards nod toward one another, then look back to Dr. Ross with confidence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Aiza:</strong> Understood, sir.</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran eyes the guards' unmoving expressions with disbelief.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> No, you- You <em>can't</em>…You're all insane. You all <em>have</em> to be insane. This- You have to understand why I can't- I can't be around this anymore! Just- let me go home, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please</span>.</p>
<p><em>(The rumbling grows even louder. Dr. Ross moves to the main window of the observatory.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Have either of you recently noticed the rather…specific growth from SCP-9104?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kovaçi:</strong> What do you mean, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Well, there now seem to be several branches extending out from the main chasm, travelling in separate directions than the initial fissure.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> …What.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> By my count, there appears to be at least 8 new branches, perhaps more still forming. One extends directly toward this building. We never assumed that it would continue in any direction besides North or South. This is utterly fascinating…</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> You can't be serious. This- This is <em>it</em>!</p>
<p><em>(The rumbling can now be heard clearly on the recording, reaching a volume that indicates it is directly outside Observatory 109.G.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> <em>(Voice trembling)</em> It's here…It's coming straight for me! You have to let me out of here. I can't- I can't <em>be here</em> anymore!</p>
<p><em>(Corcoran tries to flee, but Agents Aiza and Kovaçi swiftly restrain him, preventing him from leaving. As the anomaly continues to expand toward the observatory, Dr. Ross takes several steps back from the large, front-facing window, just as the crack reaches the base of the building. Once it fractures through the wall, the entire main window shatters into pieces.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Flinching, Dr. Ross steps backward, as SCP-9104 continues to break apart the concrete flooring of the building, decimeter by decimeter. The two agents and Researcher Corcoran back away from the fissure, as they are sectioned off from Dr. Ross by the growing chasm.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Holy shit- Doctor! Are you alright?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'm fine! Calm down! It's just expanding, same as always. Nothing we haven't seen before.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> "Just exp-" <em>(Scoff)</em> Are- Are you okay? Like, in the head? <em>Any</em> of you?! This thing is tearing our entire Site apart, and now it just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span> attacked us!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Well, we're not entirely sure about that yet. I'd like to take a soil sample, examine for any irregularities, perhaps see if there's any difference between this particular branch-</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> -NO! That's enough! We're leaving right now, and we're alerting the Council, <em>someone</em> who can do anything to actually help close this thing up! I mean, come on! This- this lackadaisical attitude you have has to end right here, right now! This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">serious</span>. This could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hurt people</span>. It <em>has</em> hurt people, cost us lives! You seem to be the only one around here who doesn't really get that! You <em>have to realize</em> how enormously dangerous this thing is!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9104 continues to quake beneath this outburst from Corcoran, bleating almost animalistically. It continues its tear through Observatory 109.G, widening its cavity to reveal more vegetation underneath, creeping to the surface as if yearning for sunlight.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Dead weeds and brush spread throughout the building, displacing the flooring and slithering futher and further in every direction. Corcoran spins around, observing in sheer panic as the vines spread up the walls, beginning to engulf the structure entirely.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> <em>(Breathing heavily)</em> Oh my g- This isn't happening…I can't <em>believe</em> I put any sort of faith in you! I'm an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">idiot</span>! I thought- This whole time, I've been on the edge of just <em>losing it</em>, and the only thing that kept me sane was thinking that you, <em>somehow</em>, knew what you were doing. That your ability to push all of this away was because you had some grand plan that would actually help us! I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depended on you</span>. But I just finally realized that-…</p>
<p><em>(A short pause. Corcoran begins to tear up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> <em>You just don't care.</em> <em>(Scoff)</em> You don't care at all, do you? About me, this Site…<em>anyone.</em></p>
<p><em>(A long pause as Corcoran stares directly past Dr. Ross's eyes, searching for anything beyond them. Dr. Ross stares back blankly, then turns his attention down toward SCP-9104.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Fine. We can talk to Dr. Flip about alerting the Council. It'd be far less troublesome for me to have you satisfied <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and silent</span>.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross gingerly steps over the anomaly, swiftly reaching the exit of Observatory 109.G. However, as Corcoran moves to step away from SCP-9104, his foot catches, tripping him to the ground. He looks down to see that one of the dead shrubs has wrapped fully around his ankle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Agh, shit- My foot got caught in one of these weeds. Could you help me out here?</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross rolls his eyes, moving forward to help untangle Corcoran's foot. However, before he can, the plant begins to slither up Corcoran's leg, dragging him further toward SCP-9104.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Uh, Eli, it's- it's growing. You have to get me out of here <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p><em>(Monitoring the phenomenon, Dr. Ross takes a step backward.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> What- What are you doing? Come back, I- I can't get my foot loose!</p>
<p><em>(Another nearby weed latches onto Corcoran's other foot, hauling him with even more force into the chasm. Quickly, he digs his fingers into the ground to prevent himself from being lugged into the anomaly. Tears form in his eyes as he hopelessly clings to the dirt. Dr. Ross simply watches attentively.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> ELI! <em>Please</em>, it- it's trying to take me! Please, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">help me!</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'm not sure that I'm capable of doing that, Ian.</p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Wh- No, just- just take my hand! Try, <em>please</em>! You can- You can pull me out!</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross merely stares, observing as the dead roots make their way up Corcoran's legs, wriggling as they reach for more dominion over him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> Why are you just standing there?! Get these things off me <em>now</em>!</p>
<p><em>(No response comes from Dr. Ross, as Corcoran's feet are heaved over the edge of SCP-9104. As the lifeless vines pull them down, they force his legs to bend against their joints, snapping backward, resulting in acute knee hyperextension. Corcoran howls in pain, tears streaming down his face, as the plants continue to drag him further into the anomaly, lengthening to wrap around his waist.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> UNGH- HELP ME! PLEASE, HELP ME! <em>(Cough)</em> I can't- Please! <em>Please, get me out of here.</em></p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross takes another step back, toward the exit.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> NO! Nonono, you can't just- You can't leave! You <em>have</em> to help me!</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross stands and watches, unmoving. The weeds keep up their development, reaching Corcoran's chest, and beginning to outstretch toward his arms. His fingernails dig deep into the earth to cling to the brink.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Corcoran:</strong> YOU HAVE TO! I'm- I'm a <em>person</em>! You won't forget this if you don't- You won't forget <em>me</em>! Come on, y- you <em>can't just leave me here</em>! Please, Eli, <em>please</em>. I'm scared…I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so scared</span>.</p>
<p><em>(Another dead vine creeps forward, slowly encasing his mouth. The thorns from the flora pierce his tongue as his head is yanked firmly backwards. His fingernails bend away, losing their hold on the earth, peeling off his skin as he attempts to grip firmly to the ground and hold his place. Dr. Ross, still silently observing, takes a step toward Researcher Corcoran, the brush around him crunching lifelessly. He crouches down and faces Corcoran, staring fearlessly into his eyes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> I'm aware that you're afraid. And I also believe that this is part of the reason why I cannot help you. Perhaps you can take comfort in the fact that your participation has aided this Site immensely. This anomaly and anything having to do with this ordeal will finally be able to be completely forgotten by this Site. And in time…<em>no one will even remember that this ever existed.</em></p>
<p><em>(Corcoran's eyes widen in horror, tears violently pouring out as he shakes his head with pure dread. As he clings desperately to the ground, his fingernails give in, snapping off as the vines and weeds pull him further toward the abyss. He tries to scream out, but all he can muster is a muffled whine through the plants that clog his throat, hauling him into the chasm.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Dr. Ross watches closely as Corcoran gradually disappears below the edge of the anomaly, not visibly recoiling in any way. Corcoran's stifled shouts of pain slowly drown out until only the incessant rumbling of SCP-9104 can be heard.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A long period of silence ensues, as Dr. Ross inches toward SCP-9104, searching for any trace of Researcher Ian Corcoran. As he does, the break within Observatory 109.G begins to shrink in size, narrowing the fissure gradually and retreating backward toward the main chasm. After observing the phenomenon closely, Dr. Ross turns back to the two agents.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Hmph. I believe we've finally cracked this, agents. Bring the entire Site's staff back for amnesticization, then give them all a leave of one month, while we get the Site repaired.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Aiza:</strong> The entire Site? Why? What will that do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> Just begin the proceedings. I can practically guarantee it will have almost shut entirely by the time the staff returns, and we will never have to pay any mind to it again.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kovaçi:</strong> And what about you, sir? Who will take care of your amnesticization?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> That won't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Kovaçi:</strong> Wh- Are you sure? I mean, what if SCP-9104 starts-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ross:</strong> -I've got one piece of advice for you, Kovaçi: <em>Don't worry so much.</em></p>
