<p>Screenshot of SCP-8632.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8632</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The only means of containing SCP-8632 is to not seek it out directly. Secondary sources of information on SCP-8632 seem to have no adverse affects, but any individuals who go out of their way to attempt to find and engage with SCP-8632 will inevitably succeed if not prevented. The bulk of individuals searching for SCP-8632 typically give up, but those who are truly dedicated to seeking the anomaly out will be able to locate it. Individuals who have given up on the search for SCP-8632 only to resume it at a later date will eventually establish contact as long as their interest is active, no matter how many times they give up and retry.</p>
<p>Any attempts to completely restrict knowledge of SCP-8632 have failed. As discussion of SCP-8632 occurs almost exclusively online, particularly in English-speaking spaces, any instances of the anomaly being mentioned must be thoroughly moderated by dedicated staff with the goal of convincing those searching for it that SCP-8632 is a fabrication born from rumors, and does not truly exist. If this fails, any and all fabrications must be presented as the truth to deter only but the most curious and dedicated individuals. These individuals who continue to express interest in SCP-8632 must be monitored further in the highly likely scenario it is deemed necessary to intercept their attempts or retrieve them for future research.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-8632 is “discovered”, the individual reporting the discovery is to be immediately detained and assigned as D-Class personnel, effective immediately. No amnestic procedures have been found to be successful in curing any individuals affected by SCP-8632, and thus all affected individuals are to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell for the purposes of further research. Incidents and anomalous events are expected to occur no matter what so any and all events are to be reported to Dr. Gorniack.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8632 is believed to be the Japanese adult visual novel or “eroge” <em>エンジェル ベイビー ～恩讐の渦～ (Angel Baby ~Spiral of Love and Hatred~)</em>, the sole 2001 release of defunct company SKYBUSTER unofficially translated into English and Spanish, and the anomalous phenomenon associated with the game and its players.</p>
<p>Knowledge regarding SCP-8632’s existence and some of its core elements such as its focal characters, setting, and content warnings (hereby referred to as “Tier 1 Information”) is widespread throughout the internet, though the anomaly remains relatively obscure to individuals not engaged within the niche communities it would appeal to.</p>
<p>Suppression of greater knowledge (hereby referred to as “Tier 2 Information”) regarding SCP-8632 is vital. SCP-8632 cannot be contained by any means traditional or unorthodox, and as both testing and research of its abilities is incredibly difficult, all Tier 2 Information regarding SCP-8632 is highly classified. Tier 2 Information involves aspects such as its effects on the human mind, where it could potentially be found and/or accessed, and narrative details.</p>
<p>Any data regarding SCP-8632 that does not directly correlate to Tier 2 is of the highest Tier (hereby referred to as “Tier 3 Information”) and can only be gleaned from individuals who have been affected by SCP-8632. Tier 3 Information can vary wildly and even conflict with data gathered from different recovered individuals, but all share a common theme of a described climax to SCP-8632’s narrative, and the affected individual succumbing to some form of madness.</p>
<p>As such, a summary of SCP-8632 and its full contents is currently impossible, but a description widely believed to have been used to advertise as well as brief biographies for its central characters are often presented as proof of its existence, which are provided below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>LOVE X MADNESS X HATE X MONSTER X DESTRUCTION X CURSE X LOVE</strong></p>
<p>“I’ll love you until the world ends, our flesh rots, our bones are crushed into stars, and even beyond that.”</p>
<p>Such are the words Tomihiko Fujimiya heard in a dream from the love of his life. Whispering softly to him, she destroyed herself and the world, sending him back to a cruel reality.</p>
<p>Fujimiya has not dreamt a single night since that day six years ago, and his scarred heart bears a trauma no one can understand. Unable to trust other people and eternally fearful of loss, he exists alone in a tiny world no one may enter all the way up to his first year of college.</p>
<p>One day, in the middle of June, a new student appears — Runa Hishijima, a beautiful girl who quickly distances herself from others with her bizarre nature and love of the occult.</p>
<p>Quick to latch onto a new target to bully, she threatens her would-be abusers with a curse.</p>
<p>Come graduation, rumors began to spread when the girls she cursed are crushed to death by construction equipment.</p>
<p>The story goes that before they died, all three girls told the same story —</p>
<p>“Hishijima-san was in my dream, and made me watch her kill herself.”</p>
<p>Upon overhearing, Fujimiya cast a glance at Hihishima, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>The world froze, and she approached him with a wry, secretive smile.</p>
<p>"I’m back, Tommy.”</p>
<p>Fujimiya hadn’t heard that name since the girl in the dream died. Runa provides no explanation, and instead disappears as suddenly as she appeared.</p>
<p>Now in college, every night, Fujimiya is haunted by nightmares of the girl he loved dying, over and over.</p>
<p>He prays and begs and hopes for his hell to end and for his heart to heal, when one day, she appears again as his underclassman.</p>
<p>“Really, Tommy, you’re useless.”</p>
<p>Fujimiya once again forgets how to dream as Runa Hishijima reenters his life, even as he remains an observer. The same events as high school begin to play out once more, but this time, he interferes.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see you getting hurt like that, Hishijima-san.” His honest feelings make the girl giddy with joy.</p>
<p>“Then, Tommy, you won’t run away this time, right?” She asks with a sweet smile, and the glint of a boxcutter in her hands shines under the summer sunset before it plunges into his chest.</p>
<p>When Fujimiya reawakens, his body surges with power as he comprehends his changed form — a reptilian tail, a monstrous build, a draconic face, and an insatiable hunger stare back at him from the mirror, as the soft footsteps of that girl enter the basement.</p>
<p>“Are you happy yet, Tommy?” She asks, with the sweetest smile in and beyond the world.</p>
<p>And thus, a slow, ordinary everyday is torn apart, defiled, and cast into the abyss of madness.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<blockquote>
<p>Tomihiko Fujimiya (藤宮 登美彦)<br/>
The protagonist who lost the ability to dream before it was replaced by unending nightmares. A quiet person who struggles to communicate with others besides his mother. Awoke one day as a reptile-like monster with an unending hunger.<br/>
<em>“I just want to make you happy. That’s enough for me.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kazura Harukawa (春川 藤)<br/>
Fujimiya’s classmate from high school. Though they never met as children, they share a dynamic similar to childhood friends. A brash tomboy with incredibly feminine interests, she has a talent for making sweets. A somewhat difficult to deal with person who always gets her way.<br/>
<em>“You think too hard! I made them for you, you dummy, so eat them already!”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Urara Amaike (雨池 うらら)<br/>
Fujimiya’s underclassman in his university’s radio club. A gentle, ditzy genius of a girl who lazes about until a deadline is right around the corner. She holds a great disdain in her heart for other human beings. Her hobby is caring for marimo balls.<br/>
<em>“Ahaha, it’ll be fine, it’ll be fine~ Stress is bad, y’know, so let’s take it easy all day, every day~”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tenka Katagaya (潟ケ谷 天歌)<br/>
A cold, impersonable girl who borders on sadistic, who seems to want to be both waited on like a princess and respected like a crime boss. She enjoys terrorizing others through mental warfare and is seemingly academically perfect. No one knows anything about her past.<br/>
<em>“I’m not asking you. It’s an order. Now be a good boy and scram.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mimiko Nagisa (渚 ミミ子)<br/>
A teaching assistant more talented than actual professors, she’s incredibly kind to all to the point even counselors are threatened by her. She’s incredibly intuitive to the point of being called psychic. Somewhat clumsy.<br/>
<em>“Aaaah, are you feeling a little stressed, perhaps? My lap’s known to have healing properties, so why don’t you rest your head for a minute?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Django (ジャンゴ)<br/>
A massive beast who wanders the night. He desires to discard his humanity and yet it clings to him like a leech. Takes an interest in the transformed Fujimiya, encouraging the evil within him.<br/>
<em>“Don’t like it? Hurry up and kill yourself, then.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Runa Hishijima (菱島 瑠月)<br/>
A beautiful, strange girl with an otherworldly air around her. Has a universal love of the occult and sticks out no matter the crowd. Her personality could be described as sweet until tested, then she becomes incredibly vile with a poisonous tongue. She is the center of Fujimiya’s world, and all in existence must conform according to her will, or else she will destroy it. Never seen without her glasses, even when bathing or sleeping.<br/>
<em>“It’s because I love you, Tommy. Now and always.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mizu (ミズ)<br/>
A girl who died.<br/>
<em>“…Sorry…”</em></p>

</div>
<p>All names of staff and actors believed to have worked on SCP-8632 are pseudonyms believed to be created exclusively for the game, and information on the individual under the username “runaruination” who the unofficial translation is attributed to seems to have been entirely wiped from the internet beyond discussion relating to obtaining SCP-8632.</p>
<p>SCP-8632 has gained notoriety within niche internet groups due to its supposed content described of being an extremely disturbing nature. As it was advertised and sold as an adult game, SCP-8632 naturally contains pornographic content, but the specifics are unknown. Online discussion claims that SCP-8632 contains a wide variety of disturbing content both sexual and non-sexual, and the title is described as “extremely gory and explicit even with mandatory censorship”. A wide variety of content has been claimed to be present within the game ranging from standard sexual practices to depictions of “illegal” and/or “bizarre” acts, but none can be verified apart from instances of “grotesquely erotic gore”.</p>
<p>Once SCP-8632 has begun to affect an individual, there is no means of prevention or recovery, and any and all identified individuals are to be immediately classified as or demoted to D-Class Personnel, placed in solitary confinement, and be monitored 24/7. Without exception.</p>
<p>An individual who has finally located SCP-8632 is still recoverable if they have only begun to engage with its contents. As long as the individual never reaches a yet unclarified “point of no return” wherein Tier 3 Information may be gleaned, they can be separated from SCP-8632. These individuals must be entirely isolated from not just the internet, but humanity as a whole, as they will continue to obsess over SCP-8632 and search for it through any means necessary.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8632 affected individuals following assumed recovery have been observed succumbing to the anomaly’s effect through a wide variety of means, such as the following example cases listed for clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-X was separated from SCP-8632 after engaging with it for a total of 10 hours, 7 minutes, and 23 seconds. Subject-X had a habit of confronting others with information related to SCP-8632, demanding their theories as to how its narrative would have developed based on the provided information. Subject-X was able to gain Tier 3 Information through this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-Y was separated from SCP-8632 after engaging with it for an estimated 12-18 hours. Subject-Y was observed to consistently fantasize about SCP-8632, writing and drawing imaginary scenarios relating to it on any surface they could, citing inspiration from the world around them. Even when they were entirely stripped of possible tools and restrained after attempting to use their own bodily fluids as ink, they were ultimately able to achieve Tier 3 Information through imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-Z was separated from SCP-8632 after engaging with it for 26 hours, 54 minutes, and an unknown number of seconds. Subject-Z began to attempt to emulate the behaviours of the main character of SCP-8632’s narrative, acting as if he had been displaced from the game itself, and was ultimately able to gain Tier 3 Information through doing so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject-█, ██████ ██████████ ███ ██████ █████████ ███ the first ██ ███ ██████████ ██ ████████ and ██████ SCP-8632 █████ ████████ with it for ██ █████████ ██████ of ███ weeks. Subject-█ ██████ Tier 3 information ███████ ███████ █████ and ████████████ expired ██ ████████-2002-874-WLD.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Once obtaining Tier 3 Information, subjects have been observed to entirely close themselves off from reality and become irreversibly delusional. Instances have been observed of subjects interacting with objects, surfaces, and people as if they were completely different and interchangeable as long as they conformed to the scenario they believed to be reality within their minds. Psychosomatic injuries such as burn marks or bruises have been observed when no possible cause has been present within the subjects’ environments, and stronger cases result in conversion disorder in subjects leading to seemingly incurable symptoms such as temporary blindness or paralysis with no clear cause nor explanation for when and how said symptoms clear up, with cases lasting from minutes to a recorded maximum of 2 years, 3 months, and 4 days. Additional instances of subjects not under constant watch inexplicably appearing elsewhere on-site have been observed, mandating 24/7 surveillance.</p>
<p>Any attempts to interact with subjects through presenting conflicting evidence to their imagined realities typically leads to no notable responses; subjects typically claim the other is insane or respond to a different, hallucinated statement. Enough pressing typically results in a subject growing unnerved and quickly hostile regardless of temperament to the point of aggression. An instance where a subject was physically restrained while confronted with proof of their delusional nature lead to the subject suddenly becoming unconscious for approximately 48 hours, and then awakening back to their prior state as if nothing abnormal had occurred.</p>
<p>Various other instances have been observed to be common occurrences with subjects sharing traits, which are noted as follows with examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects suffering from curable illnesses typically begin healing regardless of odds and without any external treatment provided, though some still display behaviour as if they remained ill despite health examinations proving otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects suffering from incurable illnesses’ conditions improve to the point of increased life expectancy, though still remain hindered in ways similar to before such as shortness of breath or various pains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects suffering from various mental ailments affecting their perceived ability to feel love or affection, such as alexithymia, depersonalization-derealization disorder, or any relevant traumas have seemingly “regained the ability to love”, but otherwise remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects with disabilities affecting their senses both physical and mental no longer seem deterred by such. One subject suffering from congenital anosmia was observed noting the scent of their containment cell as “floral”, and another blind subject was capable of accurately describing the color blue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects who previously displayed a large degree of self hatred have begun to identify themselves as “Tomihiko Fujimiya”, and when questioned on themselves describe their past as overly similar to each other, with a few traits considered unique to each instance that is believed to be significant to the subject’s original identity. Subjects display confusion when their prior identities are discussed, with no aggression no matter how often or frequently the topic is breached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Irrefutable proof of the existence of the Dirac sea obtained from data produced mid-termination of a Tier 3 Subject through extended lethal injection and subsequent testing before expiration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Active subjects possessing Tier 3 information for an extended period of time around roughly nine months begin displaying the ability to spontaneously materialize objects into existence. Objects refer to anything and everything, as instances of dried flowers, spray paint depicting Runa Hishijima, and live animals have all been observed on-site within the proximity of subjects believed to be responsible for their materialization. Those lacking Tier 2 information and above act as if these objects have always been present. This is a result of extended exposure to Tier 3 information causing expansion of the amygdala and right parietal lobe. This expansion allows Tier 3 subjects to transceive electromagnetic waves at a greater frequency, which subsequently allows for simultaneous access to the morphogenetic field and Dirac sea. Once access has been obtained, Tier 3 subjects are capable of harnessing the morphogenetic field to breach the collective subconscious of as many individuals as possible who share both psychological and physical proximity to them to transmit the “concept” of the object being materialized allowing for it to begin materialization. Once a subsequent number of individuals based on the likelihood of the objects presence and its size have received the data through these waves, Tier 3 subjects utilize these individuals as extenders for their electromagnetic waves to breach the Dirac sea to harness particles and antiparticles which are then intercepted into the extenders’ brains, stimulating them primarily through the dead spot and causing the imagined object to materialize itself within reality. Failure of this technique is common and widespread as evidenced by consistent reports of inexplicable sensations and sightings from on-site personnel, and repeated training of this skill is required in order to further expand the relevant sections of a <span style="color: #000d19">Tier 3 subject’s brain. These materialized objects as noted previously appear out of place to subjects possessing Tier 2 and above information often leading to resulting behaviours being documented as instances of their delusional nature, but this is demonstrably false.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #001b33"><strong>Addendum:</strong> Tier 3 subjects who maintain strong electromagnetic wave transceived links to the morphogenetic field and Dirac sea inevitably draw upon basic quantum mechanics to utilize the law of quantum suicide, effe</span><span style="color: #00284c">ctively making themselves immortal.

As a result of this, it is recommended to begin scheduling the termination of any Tier 3 subjects who have been documented as possessing T</span><span style="color: #00437f">ier 3 information for 9 or more months to prevent an overflow.

Much like how an octopus’s limbs all contain advanced neural circuitry beyond their central nervous system that allows for each limb to move independently fr</span><span style="color: #005fb2">om the brain, Tier 3 subjects are able to bypass the human body’s lack of a decentralized nervous system by creating one through the usage of other individuals through a process tentatively dubbed “brainjacking”. Brainjacked targets effectively function as simpler, secondary brains that allow a transceiving Tier 3 subject to materialize non-existent objects into reality at a much greater rate as evidenced by multiple recent incident reports, proving that everything can be expl</span><span style="color: #0070cc">ained according to the laws of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8632/offset/1" target="_blank">science</a>. Brainjacked targets will often describe their head or the inside of it “feeling itchy” and when examined will have a feverish body temperature and display an overall lethargic yet upbeat demeanour regardless of the situation at hand and will frequently vomit particularly if exposed to a slightly higher amount of simultan</span><span style="color: #007ee5">eous stimuli than the individual is used to. Later cases often result in long-lasting, sudden feelings of pain that travel from their source directly to the head resulting in victims attempting to get rid of the pain at any cost while complaining of a notable burning sensation that grows worse until the individual is rendered unco</span><span style="color: #008cff">nscious by the pain that removes as soon as they wake up until the eventual expiration of the individual.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008cff">Brainjacked targets must be terminated immediately upon discovery and immediate investigation to dis</span><span style="color: #ffffff">cover the offending Tier 3 subject must be launched, effective immediately. Diligence in monitoring for instances of brainjacking must increase as this phenomenon will only continue to grow in frequency.</span></p>
