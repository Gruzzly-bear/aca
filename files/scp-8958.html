<p>Discovery location</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8958</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8958 is contained in the Site-20 observation ward. Intravenous nutrition is approved, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8958 is an amalgamated mass of human biological material, consisting of at least four individuals. Human skin covers the exterior, with hair, sensory organs and extremities protruding at irregular intervals.</p>
<p>SCP-8958 exhibits vital signs – perspiration, pupillary response, and sporadic convulsions – despite an anatomical configuration incompatible with life.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8958 was discovered in a shipping container in Baltimore, MD. Evidence indicates the constituent individuals intended to immigrate illegally. No personal effects were found.</p>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>
<p><em>11-25-24:</em> Shortly after a custodian began disinfecting the chamber floor, matter spontaneously detached from the mass. It reformed into a female human, devoid of hair or distinguishing features, which identified itself as “Gabriela Victoria Ramos Silva”. It was designated SCP-8958-A.</p>
<p>Dr. Marissa Vo was assigned to interview.</p>
<p><em>11-27-24:</em> SCP-8958-A claimed the disinfectant smell was reminiscent of its hospital in Caracas, though it remembered nothing else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>Sensory stimuli might be key.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>12-10-24:</em> Vo provided SCP-8958-A a cup of café con leche. Immediate changes were observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Height reduced ~5 in</li>
<li>Grew shoulder-length brown hair</li>
<li>Subject recalled additional memories</li>
</ul>
<p>Of 49 tested stimuli, 3 produced results:</p>

<p><em>01-08-25:</em> Following these tests, SCP-8958-A’s appearance matched those of official records for Silva, and the SCP-8958-A designation was retired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vo:</strong> <em>Silva claims no memory of her amalgamation, but she exhibits nyctophobia and panic disorder, and complains of nightmares.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>04-20-25:</em> After 12 unproductive stimuli, Vo burned agarwood incense. SCP-8958 immediately exhibited intensified convulsions and diaphoresis, before extruding a male: SCP-8958-B.</p>

<p><em>07-04-25:</em> Habeas corpus required Silva, Mohammadi and Khalil be released. Vo requisitioned ongoing surveillance; consequently, they are permitted to remain in the US, contingent on NDA consent and adoption of a cover identity.</p>
