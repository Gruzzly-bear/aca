<p><strong>SCP-7920</strong> designates an object, phenomenon, entity, or concept located at <strong><tt>[COORDINATES REDACTED]</tt></strong>, in Blau, Sweden. While the exact nature of SCP-7920 is unknown, local Akiva readings around the anomaly measure at exactly 0.0.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Currently, SCP-7920 is the only known anomaly to exhibit this property.</p>

<p><em>[The camera begins to record as Dr. Gardner enters the containment chamber. The interior of the chamber appears to be a beige-colored room decorated similarly to a classroom. Posters and drawings line the walls and the floor is littered with papers and pencils. Throughout the room, there are multiple desks, and at the front of the room is a large black chalkboard. Seated at the desks are young humanoid entities (designated STUDENT-1 through STUDENT-5) and standing at the front of the room is a larger humanoid entity (designated TEACHER).]</em></p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> —can tell me? How many stars have fallen through the sky? How many stars have died?</p>
<p><em>[STUDENT-2 raises his hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STUDENT-2:</strong> Another one. One more has fallen.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Good, good. Now, tell me: where do we now stand?</p>
<p><em>[STUDENT-3 raises his hand. Small pinpricks of light appear on his hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STUDENT-3:</strong> We stand in the home of butterflies.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Wrong. An angel has been slain.</p>
<p><em>[STUDENT-3 dematerializes in a burst of light. A purple butterfly appears in his place.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STUDENT-1:</strong> A graveyard! We stand in nothing.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Correct.</p>
<p><em>[A loud sound similar to flapping wings can be heard. The TEACHER-entity turns purple.]</em></p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Now, who enters our midst?</p>
<p><em>[All the STUDENT-entities turn to stare at the camera. The camera shakes slightly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>STUDENT-2:</strong> Someone to fill our place. Water fills a hole in the ground and a king fills a throne.</p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Good. Now, tell me the name of god.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>TEACHER:</strong> Tell me the name of god.</p>

<p><strong>STUDENT-5:</strong> <em>[Unintelligible. Squelching.]</em></p>
<p><em>[STUDENT-5 transforms into a large chrysalis. The camera begins to shake. A purple light engulfs the video.]</em></p>

<hr/>
<p>On 2025/09/22, the <strong>OVERSEER COUNCIL</strong> voted unanimously to initiate <strong>PROJECT BLACK LOTUS</strong> and entered SCP-7920’s containment chamber. The Ethics Committee raised dissent— however, due to pressing circumstances, including the recent loss of <a href="scp-7540.html">Site-515</a> and Site-906, the completion of the project was necessitated and the Committee’s dissent was vetoed.</p>

<p><em>[The OVERSEERS enter the containment chamber. They are standing inside a large circular cavity. The walls are pink and slimy, organic in appearance, slightly squishy to the touch. Dotting the walls are small holes, about ten centimeters in diameter each, filled with a harsh golden light. Every couple of seconds, the entire cavity shakes, bouncing the camera up and down. At the end of the cavity, there is a light.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The camera moves towards the light, and the OVERSEERS step into it.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Inside it appears to be a small hospital room. In the center of the room is a bed, surrounded by IV pumps. Lying in the bed is a man in a hospital gown. His eyes are closed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-12:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Is that… Adam?</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> No. Not anymore, I don’t think.</p>

<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Hard to say for certain. <em>[Pauses.]</em> Have you read the Theology report?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> How do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Yes, we have.</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Then you’d know who I am.</p>
<p><em>[An IV pump begins to beep.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Here? It’s a hole. A very big one. Large enough to fit a man… large enough to fit a god. It’s… whatever you want it to be, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><em>[The beeping increases in volume. Suddenly, the scene shifts. The hospital room slowly transforms into a bedroom and the hospital bed becomes a large white king-sized bed. The IV pump’s beeping is replaced with that of an alarm clock’s.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> What have you become?</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> I’ve filled the place of what used to exist here. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> A star supernovas and a new star is formed in its dust. Have you forgotten the number of dead stars?</p>
<p><em>[A pause. The beeping grows louder. Holes appear in the ceiling, in which long pink fleshy tentacles begin to protrude out of. They writhe in the air. The OVERSEERS do not take notice.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> <em>[Angrily.]</em> What is the name of god?</p>

<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> Answer him, coward. What is the name of god?</p>
<p><em>[The alarm clock continues to beep.]</em></p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Adam.</p>

<p><strong><tt>[REDACTED]</tt>:</strong> What else did you see?</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Over the red glow, there was a pitch black silhouette, like a hand, reaching over the star. It blocked the light from the star, for just a moment, until…. There was a sound, like a gunshot, and then… silence.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> The whole mountain was drenched in dark, like nothing had ever happened. The light was gone. <em>[Pauses.]</em> I can still hear it sometimes.</p>

<p>Following the successful completion of <strong>PROJECT BLACK LOTUS</strong> and the containment of SCP-7920, the Foundation now represents a Class-VI Deific entity. At this time, the <strong>OVERSEER COUNCIL</strong> represents the godhead<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> of the Foundation and will see this organization to its end. Due to the current status of the Foundation, the Trinity Directive<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> has been etched into the fabric of metaphysical reality.</p>
<p>Systemic worship and widespread internal reorganization will continue to ensure the deific status of the Foundation.</p>
<p>The OVERSEERS have been briefed on Class-Thaumiel contingency: <strong>PROTOCOL 999-SERAPH</strong> and are currently the primary executors of Section 2.5 (Theocide). Crimes have been preemptively justified.</p>
<p>Remote Provisional Containment Facility Site-901 has been re-designated as <strong>Site-01</strong>.</p>
