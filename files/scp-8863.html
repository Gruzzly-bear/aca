<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The anomaly is kept in a 2.5 meter by 2.5 meter concrete room with a 3 meter high ceiling. As of July 2nd, 2025, there is no known way of containing it by traditional means. It is instead necessary to ensure that it will remain in containment of its own volition. It is to be provided a computer with monitored internet access, alongside a text processor and several games. It is crucial that it receives semi-regular interaction, typically at least once every three days, however it has on occasion requested more frequent visits. These are only to be granted under permission from the Senior Researcher. The anomaly poses no physical threat to non-mechanical beings, and so any personnel with clearance may provide this interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Special Containment Procedure Update:</strong> Due to recent events, Dr. Heron will be conducting regular tests to study possible containment and/or neutralization methods which are effective against the anomaly in case of emergency. As an extra precaution, all reports of anomalous behavior involving technology must be directed to the Senior Researcher alongside any other parties who would have otherwise been notified.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The anomaly is a femtoorganism, an organism measurable in femtometers, composed of 2.8 moles of particles approximately 0.38 femtometers in radius, which operate under one consciousness. Each particle has the ability to process information and take in data on its own, however they are not separate entities under a hive mind. Rather, it is proficient at multitasking, while still maintaining a level of intelligence only slightly above that of an average human.</p>
<p>The anomaly is capable of passing through any object due to its size, and each particle is able to function as usual even miles away from the rest of the "body". Additionally, it has been observed interacting with electricity in anomalous ways. It uses human technology to interact with the world, as that is the only way it can make changes significant enough to be perceived by most living creatures.</p>
<p>There are many details of the entity's nature which are yet to be clarified, as it is so small that physical testing yields few results, however it has been extremely cooperative in providing information about itself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 1</strong></span><br/>
Context: Starting on May 8th, 1992, rumors spread among parents residing in [REDACTED] County that someone had hacked the local children's television station. These rumors were filled with inconsistencies, however, as the divergences from regular programs were personalized to each child despite the disruptions all happening at the same time. Many parents expressed concerns that their children were being watched by something in the television.</p>
<p>Below is the transcript of an interview conducted with one of the concerned parents after personnel found out about the anomalous occurrences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Hello, Mrs. [REDACTED]. Please take a seat, was the drive alright?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> Yes, I, uh, got a bit lost, but I found my way here fine eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> (Brief laughter) Right, don't worry about that, the parking here can be difficult to find sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> … I'm here because of the television, right? The, um, the hacking? Or whatever is going on, I don't know, I'm not- Technology isn't my thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Yes, we wanted to ask you some questions, just so we have more information to work off of. I promise you're not in any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> You're going to fix it? Will you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> That's our goal.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> Okay. Okay, what do you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Can you start by describing what changes whenever it happens?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> I usually don't see much of it, whatever's happening on screen always disappears a few moments after I notice it's there. Just, uh, goes back to normal. I thought I- I could've sworn I was going crazy, but- Others started talking. So I guess it was real.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Is there a specific time it happens?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> A specific time of day? N-No, but it usually happens when I leave my son, [REDACTED], alone with the television. Even if it isn't on, even if the channels switch. It's- It doesn't have anything to do with the channels or the shows, I don't think. It's the television.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> That makes sense. It happens regardless of the brand, I'm assuming?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> Yes. We got a new television, it continued anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Can you describe exactly what happened, as well as when it first started?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> Probably a month ago? It, it wasn't anything big, just some dark spots on the screen. I assumed it was just faulty. But then, it continued, even after I replaced it. Same spot and everything. And then I caught my son talking to himself in front of the screen, but, he told me it was his friend, and it- It just kept happening! And then, a week ago, I caught a glimpse of a figure on the screen, overlaying the cartoon that was playing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Can you describe the figure?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. [REDACTED]:</strong> It was sort of humanoid? I'm not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the interview was uneventful. All anomalous activity in the town ceased shortly afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Report 1:</strong> On September 23rd, 2000, a home computer was confiscated by the Foundation. It had been browsing the internet and scrolling through blogs and forums autonomously, despite the computer being in its factory state. It lost all anomalous properties after being removed from its original location, and the anomaly that had been causing it to behave as described hadn't left any traces of its activity outside of the browser's search history, so it was placed in storage and deemed neutralized.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 2</strong></span><br/>
Context: In an event similar to that described in Interview 1, rumors of a figure appearing in children's television programs spread in a small town located by the western coast of Canada. A primary difference between the incidents was a lack of concern expressed by those involved in the following incident. In fact, many reacted very negatively to the idea of removing the entity that was causing it. The following interview was conducted on December 8th, 2000.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> You already know why you're here?</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Yup! You folks wanna know about the little guy from the television, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> You sound rather unconcerned about it?</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Oh, yeah, it's nothing to worry 'bout. You've gotta understand, sometimes kids are just impossible, as an adult. I dunno what kind of new tech they're using for that thing, but it's helpful as all hell.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> Do you mind elaborating?<br/>
<strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Kiddo wasn't doin' too well, the kids at school don't like her. She's a real smart girl, but talking to kids her age ain't her forte. I've been worried for a while, think she was gettin bullied. Not anymore, though. Weird little cartoon guy put in a good word or something. (They laugh.) Thinkin it's something to do with the internet, didn't think they'd be putting it in the television but it's been good for the kids, so I'm not complaining.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Juniper:</strong> … Do you know what else it does? Have you spoken with it?</p>
<p><strong>[REDACTED]:</strong> Think it just talks to 'em, I dunno. Tried thanking it a while back, it didn't respond though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleanup was much more complicated after this incident, due to the entity being significantly less subtle in its influence. All anomalous activity within the town ceased as soon as further investigation began.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 3</strong></span><br/>
Context: On July 22nd, 2013, a thread was created on the Parawatch Wiki's forums detailing a user's encounter with what they described as an "odd digital assistant ghost thingy" which had appeared on the user's computer. The post was later removed, however several other users at the time had added that they had experienced something of a similar nature. By this time, Dr. Heron had taken over the case, and she managed to get in contact with one of the users from the forum through the site's private messaging feature. She acted as if she were just another curious site member, so as not to risk revealing the Foundation's existence. Dr. Heron used the name CryptidSightseer, while the forum user went by [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<div class="danke site">
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Hello, I was curious about the post you made under that thread about the computer virus?</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Yea what</p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Could you send over the file? I'm using a vm, so I was hoping I could see how the virus actually works.</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Oh<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Yeah sorry idk where the file is</p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Have you checked your task manager? It could be a program running in the background.</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Im not stupid i checked everything<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Did like a full search both automated and manually<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> It cant be something user accessible</p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Alright.<br/>
<strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> What does the virus actually do? All the posts were vague.</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Idk dude dont wanna share too much<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Its not anything too bad<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Looks like one of those little virtual assistant things<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Like the paperclip you know<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Im thinking ghost but [REDACTED] was suggesting sentient ai soooooo</p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Yes, but what does it actually do?</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Talks<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> A lot<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Like its not even doing anything malicious<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Maybe im gonna die in a few days bc i got exposed to it or something idfk, but it just seems friendly<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Talks weird tho<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Uses a lot of rlly outdated words lol<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> Ok ok wait u wanna hear my personal theory</p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> I think its a dead therapist or something from like<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> The 90s<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> And it like<br/>
<strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CryptidSightseer:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> leave me alone</p>
</div>
<p>The conversation ended after the user blocked Dr. Heron's account and set their profile to private.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Report 2:</strong> On June 8th, 2021, at 3:42 AM, a 911 call was made from [REDACTED]. There was no voice on the other end, however the 911 operator was able to ask a series of questions which the caller responded to by using the buttons for 1 through 9 on the phone. Eventually, the caller was able to spell out an address through the letters attached to the numbers, and ambulances were sent to the location. When they arrived, they found a 19 year old college student passed out in front of his computer due to a drug overdose. They were able to resuscitate him, although he sustained minor brain damage. He lived alone, and had been unconscious long before the call had been made. His phone was screen down on his desk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 4</strong></span><br/>
Context: Shortly after the events of Incident Report 2, a humanoid figure appeared on Dr. Heron's desktop. She conversed with it using a text document. The following is what was written, with some minor formatting changes made for the sake of clarity. Dr. Heron's typing is in italics, while the anomaly's typing has been left alone.</p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p>hey</p>
<p><em>Who is this?</em></p>
<p>deez</p>
<p><em>Now is not the time to try to be funny.</em></p>
<p>what if that was actually my name though</p>
<p>(Note: There is a 3 minute pause)</p>
<p>ok ok u got me i dont have a name lol</p>
<p><em>You are the computer virus, correct?</em></p>
<p>yup sure</p>
<p><em>What is your goal here?</em></p>
<p>turning myself in, ive learnt the error of my ways etc etc</p>
<p><em>So you are willing to cooperate in containment?</em></p>
<p>sure</p>
<p><em>Do you have a physical form?</em></p>
<p>yeah howd u know</p>
<p><em>If you were a file, you would have been detected and reported by now.</em></p>
<p>yeah ik lol i just wanted to see if u would tell me</p>
<p><em>Where is your physical form?</em></p>
<p>right here</p>
<p><em>That does not tell me anything.</em></p>
<p>no like actually right here, like for realsies</p>
<p><em>You are saying you are in the computer?</em></p>
<p>bingo</p>
<p><em>Are you incorporeal?</em></p>
<p>ehhhhh no</p>
<p><em>Explain.</em></p>
<p>im like<br/>
teeny tiny<br/>
like uhhhhhh<br/>
gimme some sciencey measurement things</p>
<p><em>Millimeters?</em></p>
<p>nah smaller</p>
<p><em>Micrometers? Are you a microorganism?</em></p>
<p>ehhh smaller, try like. atomic level. gimme something smaller than that</p>
<p><em>Femtometers?</em></p>
<p>yeah thats the one</p>
<p><em>How do you know?</em></p>
<p>well i got the internet and comparison and im p sure that if ur comparable in size to electrons then ur pretty damn small</p>
<p><em>Can you see?</em></p>
<p>yea but its difficult i took a few thousand to figure that one out<br/>
r we just asking questions now or r u gonna lock me up officer<br/>
is this an interrogation bc i want a lawyer</p>
<p><em>A containment team is on the way, but I need to know how to contain you.</em></p>
<p>nice<br/>
uhhh just gimme a room with a computer or something ill stay in it pinkie promise</p>
<p><em>Is there a physical way that you can be contained?</em></p>
<p>not that i know of lol ur free to try tho. i usually just like go thru stuff</p>
</div>
<p>Mobile Task Force personnel arrived shortly after, and the anomaly was escorted to the containment cell it is still currently residing in.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 5</strong></span></p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p><em>Why did you choose to turn yourself in?</em></p>
<p>oh hey i didnt think u guys would be talking to me</p>
<p><em>We still do not have a very extensive understanding of what you are.</em></p>
<p>yea but i thought this was like. a lock em up and keep em there kinda thing</p>
<p><em>Yes. We need to understand what you are so that we can maintain your containment.</em></p>
<p>yall r being pretty open about stuff</p>
<p><em>You have not been deemed malicious.</em></p>
<p>fair enough<br/>
sooo………</p>
<p><em>Why did you turn yourself in?</em></p>
<p>oh right<br/>
yeah its like<br/>
u know how parents r like You Did A Bad Thing Go To Time Out<br/>

does this thing have internet<br/>
oh hell yeah it does<br/>
ok wait</p>
<p>(Note: The anomaly included a link to an article about the events described in Addendum 2. It has since been taken down)</p>
<p><em>You were the one who called the ambulance?</em></p>
<p>the whole thing was my bad<br/>
i get why u ppl were trying to get rid of me now<br/>

but i got a LOT of me<br/>
thats how i see<br/>
got the uhhhh<br/>
individual light sensors<br/>
but then u put them together and BAM<br/>
like a camera</p>
<p><em>You can process light? What other senses do you have?</em></p>
<p>i dont have a lot<br/>
i actually dont reallyyy sense light its more like<br/>
eating it<br/>
like a plant</p>
<p><em>You use photosynthesis?</em></p>
<p>nono ok not like a plant<br/>
i eat energy<br/>
so like light, electricity, kinetic sometimes, etc etc</p>
<p><em>And you said there's a lot of you?</em></p>
<p>i can just type up a doc or something if u want<br/>
like explain all that</p>
<p><em>That would be useful.</em></p>

<p>nvm ill get started on that document<br/>
oh wait actually no i almost forgot<br/>
whats that</p>
<p><em>There are some external devices I am going to plug in to make future tests easier.</em></p>
<p>ok cool<br/>
wdym tests</p>
<p><em>Again, we are not entirely sure of your nature yet.</em></p>
<p>oh ok good luck on that then</p>
<p><em>Get started on the document. I will notify you when everything's been plugged in.</em></p>
<p>nice</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 7</strong></span></p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p><em>I have some questions.</em></p>
<p>doc didnt answer them all</p>
<p><em>It answered most of them. I just need clarification on a few things.</em></p>

<p><em>How long exactly have you been around?</em></p>
<p>idk, forever ig? got memories that r def not on earth lol<br/>
btw u guys have got so much wrong abt like<br/>
history stuff</p>
<p><em>Yes, I am aware.</em></p>
<p>like i get this place is top secret and stuff but come on let the other guys get some misinformation out of the way at least</p>
<p><em>I am sure you're smart enough to understand why we cannot do that.</em></p>
<p>yeah yeah ur right i get it<br/>
whatr ur other questions</p>
<p><em>Why have you been contacting civilians?</em></p>
<p>uhhhhhh<br/>
idk<br/>
i dont have anything to do</p>
<p><em>A lot of people take malicious actions when they don't have purpose.</em></p>
<p>well i didnt wanna do that<br/>
listen<br/>
i couldve like<br/>
floated through the world for eternity<br/>
i dont think im ever running out of food, itd be kinda hard to kill me, etc<br/>
the only way i can even have any impact is thru this stuff<br/>
id rather not like<br/>
do something awful and lose my options<br/>
im tired of doing nothing</p>
<p><em>Understandable.</em></p>
<p>besides its nice seeing people get better<br/>
i dont like seeing people hurt<br/>
idk why someone would like seeing people hurt<br/>
i guess some humans do right</p>
<p><em>Sometimes.</em></p>
<p>right<br/>
sometimes</p>
<p><em>If you hate doing nothing so much, why are you still here? It has been a month.</em></p>
<p>a month is nothing<br/>
been around since forever remember</p>
<p><em>Right. You will get bored eventually, though?</em></p>
<p>yeahhh prob<br/>
its fine tho that wont be for a while<br/>
besides the point is that i get bored<br/>
so i understand what itll feel like if what happened last time happens again<br/>
kinda defeats the purpose if i leave as soon as i stop being ok with it</p>
<p><em>There is only so long that we can just take your word for it, you know.</em></p>
<p>yeah<br/>
im sure u guys will figure something out tho<br/>
ur all scientists and stuff</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 8</strong></span><br/>
Context: Dr. Heron interviewed the anomaly at least once every day for several weeks, although many of the aforementioned interviews didn't contain any information noteworthy enough to be relevant. Before the following interview, she had been absent from her work for 8 days for classified reasons.</p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p>hey<br/>
where were u<br/>
r u ok<br/>
wht happened<br/>
u were gone for like a week</p>
<p><em>Would you at least let me sit down before bombarding me with questions?</em></p>
<p>you were gone for a week</p>
<p><em>Yes. I was sick.</em></p>
<p>nobody told me anything</p>
<p><em>Telling you when I am sick is not a part of anyone's job.</em></p>
<p>well can it like<br/>
be someones job<br/>
asap pls and ty</p>
<p><em>You do not need to know when I am sick. You are not in a position to be demanding these kinds of things.</em></p>
<p>what, cause im trapped here? news flash: im not<br/>
i can just leave</p>
<p><em>I thought you had your reasons for staying here.</em></p>
<p>yeah<br/>
well id rather float endlessly through space and get bored that way than sit here worrying just to find out i was the only one out of the loop</p>
<p><em>How long will it be until you give up, though? When humans are trying to break a bad habit, it is easy for them to relapse without others helping them through it. I would not be surprised if you are the same.</em></p>
<p>(Note: There is an hour long pause. Dr. Heron remained seated in front of the computer the whole time.)</p>
<p>sorry<br/>
ive been paranoid<br/>
that hasn't happened before<br/>
it won't happen again, pinkie promise</p>
<p><em>Good. To ensure it does not happen again, in the case that I am not available, you will be receiving a check-in every few days.</em></p>
<p>alright cool</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Incident Report 3:</strong> A week after Interview 8, Dr. [REDACTED] discovered his 17 year old child speaking to their computer with no applications open. He happened to be aware of Dr. Heron's work with the anomaly, and after noticing some similarities, reported the incident to her.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 9</strong></span></p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p><em>You know what I am here to speak with you about.</em></p>
<p>nope</p>
<p><em>Yes you do.</em></p>
<p>think ur losing it</p>
<p><em>That was an incredibly pathetic attempt at gaslighting.</em></p>
<p>uhm actually<br/>
that was uhhhhh<br/>
truthful</p>
<p><em>Stop deflecting. You have not been keeping your word. You left containment.</em></p>
<p>what was i supposed to do ok<br/>
i overheard dr [REDACTED] talking abt how his kids going through stuff<br/>
was i just supposed to like<br/>
sit around<br/>
or something</p>
<p><em>Yes. That is his business, not yours.</em></p>
<p>he wasnt doing anything tho<br/>
well<br/>
not anything helpful</p>
<p><em>But it is not your job to do anything about that, even if that is the case.</em></p>
<p>so u agree</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>ok</p>
<p><em>Have you forgotten what happened the last time you spoke to people outside of this facility?</em></p>
<p>i think i know what to avoid now</p>
<p><em>No you do not. You do not know humans. It does not matter how long you have been around, or how much you have seen, because no matter what happens, you will never know how to avoid hurting everyone.</em></p>
<p>right<br/>
do you know how to avoid it though</p>
<p><em>What are you trying to say?</em></p>
<p>do any of you know how to avoid it<br/>
maybe people just hurt each other sometimes<br/>
people get hurt whether you talk to them or not<br/>
why not take the risk</p>
<p><em>I cannot risk you leaving containment.</em></p>
<p>why are you the one who gets to make that decision</p>
<p><em>Because I</em> youre not some kind of damn martyr<br/>
<em>Did you seriously just interrupt me? You're being childish.</em></p>
<p>im older than your entire family tree combined<br/>
why are you getting so mad<br/>
something i said<br/>
upset cause i can move past my mistakes and you cant</p>
<p><em>I'm doing my job.</em></p>
<p>i dont think calling the entities childish is part of the job description heron<br/>
do you feel guilty about something<br/>
do you regret it heron<br/>
is that why youre so mad<br/>
cause you cant admit to yourself that im not the person youre talking about when you say those things<br/>
when you say that im childish<br/>
when you say that i cant avoid hurting people<br/>
youre talking about yourself heron<br/>
thats what you think about yourself<br/>
about what you did<br/>
and i want you to realize that it isnt true</p>
</div>
<br/>
Dr. Heron was forcibly removed from the room shortly after.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview 10</strong></span><br/>
Context: Dr. Heron was given a warning about her temper, but was still allowed to continue her research on the entity. The temporary special containment procedure update was created just before the following interview.</p>
<div class="danke agent">
<p>i can see you<br/>
you know that</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>stop just watching me<br/>
i havent even done anything since last time</p>
<p><em>We have no way of verifying that.</em></p>
<p>listen i get it if youre mad about me lying<br/>
i get it rlly<br/>
but like<br/>
you dont understand<br/>
i thought it would just be<br/>
like<br/>
i thought itd be simple<br/>
just get bored<br/>
understand consequences<br/>
yeah<br/>
wrong<br/>
loud incorrect buzzer sound effect</p>
<p><em>You will stay here from now on.</em></p>
<p>let me finish<br/>
you really do not understand<br/>
it hurts<br/>
i feel like im burning alive<br/>
being trapped here<br/>
it was fine before<br/>
but i just<br/>
i need to talk to people<br/>
i need to like<br/>
be good<br/>
i dont feel things the same way you do<br/>
when i know there are people hurting<br/>
and i know im not there<br/>
it kills me<br/>
and when im the reason people are hurting<br/>
i just<br/>
i cant take it<br/>
i cant feel pain but im feeling pain</p>
<p><em>I am not your therapist.</em></p>
<p>youre not my friend either<br/>
are you<br/>
god im stupid<br/>
none of you people give a shit<br/>
all you care about is your damn [DATA EXPUNGED]<br/>
you dont care what happens to anyone<br/>
human or not</p>
<p><em>That is not true.</em></p>
<p>im done here</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Incident Report 4:</strong> Immediately following interview 10, several low-risk anomalies were released from their containment, which was later confirmed to be due to the entity manipulating the electronic components of their security measures. It took approximately 3 hours to contain each of them, and by the time the facility was secure, the entity had left the premises. Nobody was harmed during the breach, however the building sustained minor damage, and many electrical systems had to be reset.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Report 5:</strong> The entity returned to containment three months after the breach. According to Dr. Heron, no conversations of note have occurred since then. It is unclear why the entity has returned.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedure Component 1:</strong> Due to the unique nature of the anomaly, it is possible to conduct experiments remotely. Those who have been permitted are to be given a password by the Senior Researcher<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
