<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6153 is a fundamental force intrinsic to the human psychosphere, having been recognized to varying extents in every major culture throughout history. As such, containment has not only been deemed infeasible, but unnecessary. Resources are to instead be used to prevent knowledge of SCP-6153's true nature from being realized by discrediting individuals who attempt to reveal such. Although such widespread knowledge of an anomaly would typically credit an Amida disruption classification, the widespread disbelief in its anomalous properties prevents the knowledge from being disruptive, earning the Chaya classification. SCP-6153-B instances measuring a -15 to -20 on the Tyche Radiation scale currently in containment are to be immediately terminated, with SCP-6153-B-related events being completely covered up or having information regarding them mildly edited based on severity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6153 is the designation given to a widespread phenomenon affecting the outcomes of actions taken by approximately 19.2% of the population, SCP-6153-A and SCP-6153-B instances. This phenomenon is measured in Tyche Radiation using the TEQ and the current known maximum and minimum are +40 and -40 respectively. Lower TR indicates negative outcomes and higher TR indicates beneficial outcomes relative to the perspective of the SCP-6153-A or SCP-6153-B instance.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Although the SCP-6153 phenomenon is widely known and ingrained in human cultural and religious practices, SCP-6153 was not classified until 8/19/1982, when the inherent anomalous properties of SCP-6153 were discovered. SCP-6153 has a notable connection to the concept of luck (ie, people with higher or lower amounts of Tyche radiation typically believe in luck, and vice versa) but it is unknown what the relation to the phenomena is.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Logs:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> An SCP-6153-A instance with an ambient Tyche level of 11 is placed within a standard testing chamber and given a pair of die. The subject is then to roll the pair 10 times and record the total score.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The subject gained a total score of 90, with 5 of the rolls being doubles sixes. Of note is during the test, the subject never rolled a one.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-6153 seems to affect games and toys. More experimentation involving -A and -B instances is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-2</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> An instance of SCP-6153-A with an ambient Tyche Radiation level of +6 is instructed to play a simulated casino slot game on a supplied terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject opened the game on the supplied terminal, and proceeded to get the jackpot</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-6153's effects extend to digital games</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-2-B</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> An instance of SCP-6153-B with an ambient Tyche Radiation level of -16 is instructed to play a simulated casino slot game on a supplied terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> As the subject opened the terminal, it immediately detonated with an explosive force of 4.184×10 to the ninth joules, destroying the chamber and a section of the surrounding site.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Testing with SCP-6153-B instances is to be conducted within a high-security protective chamber.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-3</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> 2 individuals are placed in separate chambers and instructed to complete a standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube within 15 minutes. Subject 1 is an instance of SCP-6153-A with an ambient Tyche Radiation of +9, while Subject 2 is an SCP-6153-B instance with an ambient Tyche Radiation of -18. Both subjects have no prior experience with Rubik's Cubes. Both subjects are placed into their chambers, and the timer is started.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> 14 seconds in, Subject 1 solves the cube. Later interview revealed that the subject turned the cube in the correct order to solve it in the most efficient way possible, demonstrating unusual levels of hand dexterity. Subject 2 struggles with the cube for the following 14 minutes and 54 seconds before the vent covering falls on the subject's head knocking him unconscious. Later investigation revealed that the vent had been in a state of severe disrepair for the past 3 years before several remaining screws came undone at once, causing the covering to collapse onto the subject's head and that the cube had been exactly one vertical turn from completion.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-6153's effect on the results of an attempted action varies immensely between individuals, and SCP-6153 will seemingly use any means to deliver its desired outcome to an individual, whether high or low levels of Tyche Radiation.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-4</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> An SCP-6153-B instance with an ambient Tyche level of -9 is to be placed within a high-security testing chamber and subjected to a Thaumaturgical ritual believed to increase SCP-6153. Afterward, the subject is then to be scanned to see if any changes in Tyche Radiation occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The subject's Tyche radiation was raised to +17, being reclassified as an SCP-6153-A instance. Of note is the Tyche radiation of all researchers in a 30-meter radius was reduced by .4, creating 2 new SCP-6153-B instances.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Levels of SCP-6153 can be changed via thaumaturgy and possibly other means. This test also implies that new amounts of SCP-6153 cannot be created, but only transferred. Further usage of this phenomenon has been dubbed TRT or Tyche Radiation Transfer.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-5</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Two SCP-6153-A instances, thereafter mentioned as -A-1 and -A-2, each with a TR level of 13 were assigned the same task within two different rooms and then they were told to perform the same task together. The second task was then compared to benchmark TR 3 to 18 -A instances.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The task was to solve a jigsaw puzzle while blindfolded. The puzzle was a simple 5x5 square of the picture of a rabbit. -A-1 completed it in 7 minutes and 45 seconds and -A-2 completed it 8 minutes and 12 seconds. After that, they were put to work together, while still blindfolded on a 10x10 puzzle of the picture of a hawk. They were able to complete the task in 6 minutes and 23 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The combined efforts of -A-1 and -A-2 resulted on the completion of the 10x10 puzzle faster then each one of them were able to complete the first 5x5, which is a remarkable result, since the 10x10 puzzle has four times more pieces. This implies that the combined efforts of high ambient TR Levels results on the potentialization of SCP-6153 influence. The benchmark results to single individuals given the same puzzle were: 28 minutes 47 seconds (TR 3), 23 minutes 32 seconds (TR 8), 18 minutes 17 seconds (TR 13), 14 minutes 56 seconds (TR 18)</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-5-B</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One instance of SCP-6153-A with TR level of 13 and a SCP-6153-B with TR level of -13 were asked to repeat the procedures in Test 6153-5.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The -A instance finished the first part of the test in 7 minutes and 57 seconds. The -B was unable to finish it in under 1 hour, when one of the puzzle pieces disappeared, rendering the test unfeasible. When put together to perform the second part of the test, it took 44 minutes and 43 seconds for completion.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> When let free, diametrical opposite TR levels seems to nulify each other. This would explain the reason why 6153 intervation seems to follow an average on day to day basis. As urban areas grew more densely populated with time, the distribution of ambient TR levels would even out in most geographical areas.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test 6153-6</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A baseline D-Class is to be given a standard 100 piece puzzle and told to complete it. A Thaumaturgical ritual is then to be performed to lower the subject's Tyche level, and turn it into an SCP-6153-B instance. The subject is then to complete a similar puzzle again, and the times are to be compared.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Before the transformation, the subject took 30 minutes and 14 seconds to complete the puzzle. The ritual was then performed, to lower the subject's Tyche level to -40, far lower than expected. Before the final piece was placed in the puzzle, after 1 hour and 56 minutes, the room the subject was in exploded, killing the SCP-6153-B instance and 27 Foundation personnel. An investigation later revealed that the explosion was caused by a build-up of combustible gases underneath the testing chamber and the lighting of Researcher Tennyson's cigar.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Testing with this phenomenon is extremely dangerous and unpredictable.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 6153.2: Project Head Gary Tyler's Resignation Notice.</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I know this will come as a surprise to many of you, but I'm leaving the project, effective immediately. I will not have my legacy within this Foundation be the discovery of this force, this thing that we are incapable of fully understanding! This is beyond us, and not something we should be playing with and pushing the limits of so carelessly. What if we were wrong? What if Tyche radiation can in-fact exceed ± 40? The resulting bloodshed will fall on the hands of those who continued to prod the proverbial bear.</p>
<p>My final act as Project Head is to halt testing, indefinitely. I trust that the more sensible of the team will understand. And to my successor, I can only wish you the best of luck.</p>
<p>- Gary Tyler</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> SCP-6153 is a widespread probabilistic anomaly, affecting either beneficial or harmful events occurring to an individual, colloquially known as "luck".</p>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Project Lakshmi focuses on utilizing the effects of SCP-6153 to constructively enhance the performance of Foundation personnel to better enact and carry out containment tasks and procedures, to hopefully minimize the risks posed by any third party.</p>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Through the use of thaumaturgic rituals conducted by trained Foundation personnel, the components of SCP-6153 (mainly Tyche Radiation) can be successfully manipulated and transferred to chosen individuals. These individuals would then be tasked with maintaining the containment of certain anomalies.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal Status:</strong> <span style="color: green"><strong>ACCEPTED</strong></span>. Further establishment protocols will be offered soon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following the acceptance and agreement on the proposal, the Department of Thaumaturgic Research and the Department of Applied Thaumaturgy attempted to create a Thaumaturgic ritual that allows Tyche radiation to be directly transferred from one entity to another. The procedure (designation the Tyche Radiation Transfer) is contained below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Materials Required:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>One SCP-6153-A or -B instance, with the desired Tyche Radiation Level, hereafter referred to as "Giver"</li>
<li>One human (or inanimate object, see Test 6153-7), to receive the desired Tyche Level, designated "Receiver"</li>
<li>2 golden chalices, each containing .5 liters of blood belonging to a <em>Sus domesticus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2319-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2319-1')">1</a></sup>, designated "chalice"</li>
<li>2 strung amulets composed of jade, displaying seven circles, imbued with Sharp EVE by a Class II or higher Thaumaturgist, hereafter referred to as "necklace"</li>

</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>The Giver is to stand 5 meters in front of the Receiver, who is to be kneeling.</li>
<li>The Receiver and the Giver are both to don a necklace</li>
<li>The Giver is then to speak the words "Tibi do, Magne, fortunam meam si accepturus es."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2319-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2319-2')">2</a></sup></li>

<li>Both the Receiver and the Giver are to consume the blood located within the chalices</li>
<li>The Giver is to place their dominant hand on the forehead of the giver.</li>
<li>Once the appropriate amount of TR is transferred, the Giver is then to remove their hand. For each second placed, approximately 2 TR is transferred.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Following the creation of Tyche Radiation Transfer, the Department of Anomalous Probability proceeded to conduct basic and early testing on the effects of SCP-6153. After several weeks, SCP-6153 demonstrated its anomalous properties with the expected accuracy, and thus the Department began to oversee trial runs regarding Project Lakshmi.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-7</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> In light of Test 6153-3, a test was conducted to see if TRT (Tyche Radiation Transfer) could be utilized by a group.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A group of 5 individuals proficient in thaumaturgy engaged in a ritual to complete a TRT from a type A instance with an ambient Tyche Radiation level of +14, to a group of 3 type B instances with ambient Tyche Radiation levels of -3, -11, and -7</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The TRT was performed successfully, with the ambient radiation level of the type A instances being reduced to +3 and each of the former type B instances being increased to +2, -4, and -2 respectively. Testing revealed that all surrounding personnel were unaffected by the ritual and had consistent Tyche Radiation levels throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> It is possible to execute a successful TRT into a group from an individual.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-8</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> TRT was successfully performed on James Halloran, Director of Finances at Site-87.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> James Halloran's TR level increased to +19, and site distribution of funds became extremely efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Usage of SCP-6153 has proven immensely beneficial, and I have submitted a request for further use of TRT to assist in site operations. - Dr Malcolm Reese</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-9-B</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") is to have its members turned into SCP-6153-A instances via TRT.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> All missions performed by MTF Alpha-1 since have been significantly more successful, with a 43% increase in success rate.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Usage of the TRT on other MTFs is currently being reviewed. - Senior Field Agent Maranda Brinker, Director of Task Forces and MTF Alpha-1 Lead.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-9</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> TRT is to be used on an inanimate object that has a cultural connection to luck (the detached foot of a <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2319-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2319-4')">4</a></sup>) and scanned to see if SCP-6153 effects inamite objects.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The procedure was performed successfully, with the Tyche level being raised to an ambient level of +13.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> TRT works on inanimates too. We need to test this more. -Dr. Malcolm Reese</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-9-B</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Utilizing the TR implanted rabbit's foot, a Class D subject was instructed to tell Dr. Malcolm Reese the number he was thinking of.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject successfully guessed a number from 1-10 7 times in a row before incorrectly guessing.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Intriguing, considering that making inanimate -A instances is less taxing on our thaumaturgists, it would be more efficient to produce them instead of imbuing humans with SCP-6153. However, inanimate instances are noticeably weaker than sentient ones. Further testing is required. -Dr. Malcolm Reese</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-9-C</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A shipment of standard issue plasmatic rifles to GOI-007 ("Global Occult Coalition") is to be intercepted and have a TRT performed on them in an attempt to lower Tyche levels. The drivers are then to be amnesticized and released, bringing the weapons back to GOC headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The Tyche levels of the rifles were reduced to -6, and since, all hostile encounters with GOI-007 have had a 32% increase in success rate.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The use of weaponizing inanimate SCP-6153-B instances against other GOIs is currently being reviewed. -O5-4</p>
</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-10</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A easily producible object (in this case, a 15 cm wide steel sphere) is to have a TRT performed on it, in an attempt to "store" Tyche for ease of distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> An SCP-6153-A with a Tyche Radiation of +12 performed successfully performed the procedure, lowering their Tyche levels to -0.3, and raising the object's to +12.7.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The ability to store Tyche has nearly infinite potential, and if we were to automate this… . More testing is necessary.- Dr. Reese</p>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A easily producible object (in this case, a 15 cm wide steel sphere) is to have a TRT performed on it, in an attempt to "store" Tyche for ease of distribution. Multiple subjects are to be used in order to determine the maximum amount of Tyche Radiation transferable.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Three (3) SCP-6153-A instances with Tyche levels of +14, +17, and +13, respectively, successfully performed the transfer. Upon completion, the first two instances both reached baseline levels, however, the third instance retained a non-baseline level of +4.5. It was revealed afterwards that the sphere had a radiation of exactly +40, confirming beliefs that +40 is the highest possible Tyche radiation.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Storage of SCP-6153 is possible, although costing us a lot of pig blood. We need to find a better way to do this. - Dr. Samantha Redwood</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A easily producible object (in this case, a 15 cm wide steel sphere) is to have Tyche Radiation stored within via use of a para-technological Thaumaturgical trigger<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2319-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2319-5')">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Using several SCP-6153-A instances, the object successfully absorbed +40 Tyche Radiation.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> We'll have to do a few more tests before moving on to -B's but this seems to be working. -Dr. Samantha Redwood</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-11</strong></span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A Thaumaturgical trigger is to be attached to a beryllium-bronze funnel, located over a 15 cm wide steel sphere, in an attempt to transfer Tyche Radiation automatically. A conveyor belt is then to shift the sphere, and provide another transfer onto another sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The test was successful, averaging 3.4 SCP-6153-A instances per sphere, at a rate of 1 -A instance every 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The machine created for this test has been dubbed SCP-6153-Ω. Now onto storing -Bs - Dr. Samantha Redwood</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-6153-Ω is to be used to transform a 15 centimeter wide steel sphere into and SCP-6153-B instance with a Tyche level of -40. The instance is then to be placed in a standard containment locker within a high-security testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> After 2 hours of containment, the instance of SCP-6153-B suddenly heated to a temperature believed to be over 3,500 Kelvin and melted through the containment locker, neutralizing it. It is currently theorized that an Einstein-Rosen bridge<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2319-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2319-6')">6</a></sup> opened on the surface of star Betelgeuse for approximately 2 minutes, due to the similar temperature and detection of a spacial anomaly by Foundation Deep Space Satellites.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This will be the "baseline" for the effects of SCP-6153-B on containment. - Dr. Samantha Redwood</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test 6153-12-B</strong></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-6153-Ω is to be used to transform a 15 centimeter wide steel sphere into and SCP-6153-B instance with a Tyche level of -40. The instance is then to be placed in a standard containment locker within a high-security testing chamber. A Scranton Reality Anchor is to be placed underneath the locker, in an attempt to see how SCP-6153 is affected by SRAs.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> After 4 hours and 12 minutes of containment, a vat of acid on the floor above the testing chamber burst due to a build up of pressure. The acid proceed to seep through the floor, and dissolved the locker, neutralizing the SCP-6153-B instance as well.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Although it seems an SRA reduces the potency of SCP-6153-B, more testing must be done to see if this was simply a coincidence. -Dr. Malcolm Reese</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> After 3 hours and 57 minutes of containment, an experimental para-technological device created by the 'Pataphysics department misfired and conceptually erased the SCP-6153-B instance, theorizing to have neutralized it.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> These two tests imply that SCP-6153 effects, at least in part, baseline reality levels. However, this does not solve the containment issues. I wonder if we could follow the success of an older test. - Dr. Samantha Redwood</p>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-6153-Ω is to be used to transform a 15 centimeter wide steel sphere into and SCP-6153-B instance with a Tyche level of -40. The instance is then to be placed in a standard containment locker within a high-security testing chamber. The instance is to be placed to another sphere with a Tyche level of +40, created via the same means.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> After two days, the SCP-6153-A and -B instances were unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Now we have a way to store these. I have sent in a proposal to O5-12. - Dr. Samantha Redwood.</p>
