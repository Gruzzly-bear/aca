</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures, 2025/05/02:</strong> SCP-9365 must be apprehended and contained as soon as possible. Foundation webcrawlers are to continuously monitor major social media platforms for instances of SCP-9365-A. Identified copies or derivatives are to be removed under the guise of DMCA copyright violations or platform-specific 'misinformation' policies.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9365 is Muhammad 'Babul' Hossain, a 25-year old man of Bangladeshi descent residing in Los Angeles, California. Prior to the onset of the anomalous effects of SCP-9365-A, the subject was employed as a food delivery courier under an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Subject's immediate family, consisting of his parents, a wife, and two sons, reside in his hometown of Noakhali District, Chattogram, Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Upon finding employment in the United States, SCP-9365 joined a mobile messaging group for delivery couriers titled "Hard Life <em>Polapan</em>"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The group's discourse focusses on challenges its members experience while working and tips to improve their financial status.</p>
<p>On 2025/04/03 at 15:44 PST, SCP-9365 posted an ironic 'meme' image of himself to the messaging group. In this image, he is wearing sunglasses and a collared shirt with the caption '<em>BABUL HOSSAIN: America's Newest Billionaire</em>', followed by three emojis. A fellow messaging group member, Sumon Ali, shared this image on the website Facebook. Once posted, it developed an anomalous memetic effect and spread widely on the social media apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok, receiving an estimated 960 million impressions before it could be suppressed by Foundation bots. This image is designated SCP-9365-A.</p>
<p>More than 90% of individuals exposed to SCP-9365-A develop the belief that SCP-9365 was the latest person to achieve a net worth of one billion USD in the United States as of the time the image was posted; this effect is reversible, and can be negated by providing evidence contrary to this belief. Members of the "Hard Life <em>Polapan</em>" messaging group do not appear to have been affected by SCP-9365-A, possibly due to their level of prior knowledge about the subject's lifestyle and finances.</p>

<p><em>[Sana Hashwani is standing outside of the Getty Centre in LA, dressed in fashionable clothes and holding a luxury handbag.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: Hell-o businessladies! So if you've been following my videos, you'll know I've been trying to get in touch with LA's most secretive billionaire for weeks. And now we're going to meet him!</p>
<p><em>[She smiles and points at the building behind her.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: I've invited him to a private showing of my brand, and he said yes! Now, you know my haters are always saying that my brand isn't mine, that it's all funded by my dad, and other lies like that. No. Stop. This is my brand, and I'm building it <em>myself</em> and finding the investors <em>myself</em> who can help me grow my business. We're going to go in now and meet him, and I'm going to show all my girlies what life is like as a Gen Z businesswoman.</p>
<p><em>[The video speeds up as the camera follows Miss Hashwani entering the building and going into a display room, where SCP-9365 is standing, looking thoughtfully at a selection of handbags.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: Mr. Hossain! Thank you so much for coming!</p>
<p><span class="subject"><strong>SCP-9365</strong></span>: <em>(Smiling awkwardly)</em> Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: I know I sent you an email already to introduce my products, and I know your time is valuable, but I think it's so much easier to tell if something is quality when you see it in reality. So, this is my business, I'm Sana Hashwani, and I design sustainable luxury accessories. Not just handbags, but belts, wallets, everything. What do you think of this?</p>
<p><em>[She passes SCP-9365 a wallet.]</em></p>
<p><span class="subject"><strong>SCP-9365</strong></span>: <em>(He turns it over in his hands.)</em> It looks good. Feels… high quality?</p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: Thank you so much! It's 100% halal vegan leather, completely ethically sourced. I want you to keep it. To be honest, you just holding it right now is worth more than any ad campaign I could come up with.</p>
<p><em>[She takes a selfie with SCP-9365 and the wallet. He looks uncomfortable, but does not refuse.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: And if you want to try anything else, just let me know! When you post it on your socials, remember to tag me!</p>
<p><span class="subject"><strong>SCP-9365</strong></span>: Okay, and you'll compensate me for that?</p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: Absolutely! We're still on camera, but I'll have a contract sent to you tomorrow!</p>
<p><span class="subject"><strong>SCP-9365</strong></span>: That's great. You're good at this.</p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: Thanks so much, Mr. Hossain!</p>
<p><em>[Miss Hashwani begins to walk away. She takes the camera and brings it close to her face so she can whisper.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Hashwani</strong>: I'm pretty sure he thought I was insane, but just watch. This post is going to do numbers!</p>

<p>Babul Hossain // The L.A. Insider Exclusive Interview</p>

<div class="news-body">
<p>In 2021, during the peak of the pandemic housing market that saw L.A. home prices skyrocket, the city of angels' most trusted news outlet, <em>the L.A. Insider</em>, <span class="news-link">compiled a list of the city's most elusive wealthy figures</span>.</p>
<p>Four years later, a new name has come to the world's attention.</p>
<p>The mysterious Babul Hossain sat down with us at a café in West Hollywood, sporting a platinum Patek Philippe and a Balenciaga jacket. We asked him the big questions to which you've all been waiting to hear the answers.</p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">Babul, the world is obsessed by you and your style. It's crazy that no-one had even heard of you until you stormed the internet just two weeks ago. Is it true? Are you really worth a billion dollars?</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">Sarah, I'm a private man, and I don't like to talk about money.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">No kidding. We went looking for companies founded in your name and we couldn't find a single one. Are you getting a bit creative with your finances? It's all above board, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">I've always paid my taxes, even before I came to America. It's the least I can do to give back to the country that gave me this opportunity. But remember, success is a currency. I didn't buy this jacket. A shop owner in Beverly Hills gave it to me after I agreed to a selfie. This watch was a gift from a charitable organisation. Once you've found success, these things just happen to you, whether you want them or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">How has this wealth affected you and your family? You came from poverty, right? Are they as shocked as you are?</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a"><em>(Sighs.)</em> Growth can be painful. I elevated my mindset, but some people want to have everything while staying on the ground floor. I refuse to let anyone pull me down. Don't misunderstand me, Sarah! I've made sure they're taken care of. I love my roots, but I need room to grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">That must have been hard, Babul. I don't think I expected that from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">America has hardened me. You're either the guy who delivers the food, or the guy who owns him.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">Wow, that's quite the statement. Now, Mr. Hossain, you've been spotted with designer and businesswoman Sana Hashwani. I have to ask: are you two an item?</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">Sana and I understand each other. We both know what it's like to have people make assumptions about you, and take you for granted. We don't do that to each other. I'm very glad to know her.</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Warsawsky:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">Beautifully cryptic. So, is she still paying you for appearances and endorsements?</span></p>
<p><span class="news-q">Hossain:</span><br/>
<span class="news-a">If me wearing one of her products or showing up at her event helps her, and she wants to show she respects my time, is that so different from what any other celebrity might do? Our relationship works for us. Let's move on to a different subject.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Date</strong>: 2025/05/03</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Time</strong>: 18:09 p.m.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Doctor Mina Jin</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interviewed</strong>: SCP-9365</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: Everyone knows my name. I'm Babul.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: We need your full name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: Look, if you're police, we can sort this out. I'm not happy about being snatched away like this. I have commitments this evening.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Full name, please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: <em>(Sighing)</em> Muhammad Hossain. Babul.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Thank you. Now, tell me about the keynote speech you just gave. How much were you paid?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: Six hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: On the second of April, you had exactly four hundred and twelve dollars, sixty four cents in your bank account.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: What's it to you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: How do you feel about the changing way you've been treated, Mr. Hossain?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: I won't deny it's weird. I thought my life was falling apart at first. I managed to get back on my feet, though. I'm happier now. I'm successful. I wouldn't change it back for anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Do you know why people think you're a billionaire?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: No. It just happened. Sumon posted that picture, and suddenly my life changed. It was a stupid picture, a stupid meme. I still don't understand how people could believe something like that just because they see it online.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: They wouldn't, usually. The image had an anomalous effect. It shouldn't have done that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: So it's not my fault? Or Sumon's?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Not as far as we can tell. But our job is to neutralise things like this and keep the order of the world.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: But why? I'm not hurting anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: You cut yourself off from your family, so you may not even know this. Your mother was beaten by a mob looking for treasure hidden inside her house.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: <em>(Startled)</em> I didn't know about that. Is she okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Yes. We took her in for a debrief, treated her injuries, and resolved the issue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: That… I should have heard about that. I could have protected them. But I didn't abandon <em>them</em>! They abandoned <em>me</em>. As soon as they saw that picture, I stopped mattering. They only cared about the lie, and they all demanded a share in it. I couldn't stand it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: You chose not to know when you walked away. Did you feel entitled to leave them all behind and just walk into a billionaire's lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: Yes, no less than anybody else is! I spent twenty five years as a nobody. In my village, I was just a shadow. When I came to America, I was just a ghost on a bike. When I made a delivery, people would often just say 'thanks' and they wouldn't even look at me. I was working hard and making their lives easier, but I was changing my whole self and personality just to try and get a few more tips. I can't live like that any more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: The image that started this will be removed. After that, we'll release a counter-narrative that undoes the effect. People will stop seeing Babul the billionaire. All the money, the contracts, and the gifts will be reverted. Your girlfriend will forget you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: She wasn't my girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: Some of the money you sent to your family will stay. We'll call it compensation for an accident, and we'll construct a paper trail to explain it. You'll be far better off than you ever were before. I hope you can take some comfort in that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: I'm not the only person who faked their way into wealth. Are you going to hunt down the others, too?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: We only deal with the anomalous. The rest is beyond our concern.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9365</strong>: That's not justice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jin</strong>: I'm sorry, Mr. Hossain.</p>

<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Neutralised</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: Following the treatment of the subject and their family and associates with Class-B amnestics, SCP-9365 is considered neutralised. Foundation webcrawlers are to disseminate countermeme 9365-β to the general population to neutralise the effects of SCP-9365-A. Countermeme 9365-β, described internally as the 'sad delivery guy meme', depicts an exhausted SCP-9365 sitting on a curb in a rainy alleyway and eating a cold paratha roll. It contains an embedded memetic agent designed to ensure that it spreads virally through the same social media websites as SCP-9365-A, and precisely counteracts the effects of the anomaly.</p>
<p>Any identified copies or derivatives of SCP-9365-A are to be removed under the guise of DMCA copyright violations or platform-specific 'misinformation' policies.</p>
