<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7456-1 is to remain sealed and under armed guard to prevent personnel below <span style="color: orange">Clearance Level 4 (Secret)</span> - and those specifically authorized - from entering. A perimeter of electrified barbed wire is to remain erected around the entrance. No personnel are to attempt to activate SCP-7456-2. It is highly advised for personnel working in the general area of SCP-7456-2 to have scored Class 3 or higher on the Cognitohazard Resistance Scale (CRS). Personnel who have scored lower are instructed to avoid allowing SCP-7456-2 into their line of sight. Personnel affected by SCP-7456-2 are instructed to immediately break eye contact and are not permitted to suffer panic attacks or related symptoms. Should SCP-7456-2 reactivate, a unit from Mobile Task Force Alpha-11 ("Starwatch") is on standby. No samples of the xenon alloys are permitted to leave Outpost-7456's grounds until testing has concluded.</p>
<p>No attempts to access any floors below the 5th are to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>SCP-7456-1</em></span></p>
<p>SCP-7456-1 is a large subterranean facility located in Omo National Park, Ethiopia. SCP-7456-1 was constructed approximately 300,000 years ago by an extraterrestrial precursor civilization that created <em>homo sapiens</em> and their various related species. SCP-7456-1 is composed primarily of a set of xenon-based alloys. A single extraterrestrial organism, a specimen of the creators' race, resides in a state of technologically assisted hibernation (SCP-7456-2). SCP-7456-1 possesses a large variety of defensive systems, both anomalous and mundane.</p>
<p>SCP-7456-1 is maintained by a mundane artificial intelligence that designates itself as "Xylaris". Xylaris is non-hostile but has resisted all attempts to bring it into compliance with Foundation regulations. Xylaris' capacity for sapience is undetermined but has demonstrated exceptional intelligence and social skills to the point where the distinction is effectively meaningless. Xylaris maintains a professionally friendly personality with Foundation personnel and is willing to assist researchers with most requests made of it. However, Xylaris will not permit any personnel, AICs, or any other foreign organisms, constructs, or objects below the 5th level of SCP-7456-1. Xylaris has deployed non-harmful cognitohazards, reprogrammed Foundation AICs, and destroyed drones that have attempted to deactivate it and/or enter the restricted floors. Xylaris has threatened violent responses if further attempts are made. Ground-penetrating radar is unable to observe the interior, but indicates that SCP-7456-1 extends dozens of kilometers into the ground, likely meaning thousands of floors exist.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>SCP-7456-2</em></span></p>
<p>SCP-7456-2 is a humanoid extraterrestrial entity, 2.3 meters tall, currently in a state of technologically assisted hibernation on the 4th floor, maintained by Xylaris. SCP-7456-2's body is composed of an unknown vantablack material that absorbs nearly 100% of light. SCP-7456-2 is cold and smooth to the touch. SCP-7456-2 appears to possess no Earth-like bodily functions, such as digestion, hydration, respiration, etc. SCP-7456-2 is a cognitohazard; organisms that make eye contact with any portion of its body experience extreme fear, often paralyzing them. This effect is weaker when viewed indirectly (e.g. reflections, recordings, etc), often going unnoticed, but causing a permanent sense of paranoia.This paranoia is also observed in individuals who have previously made direct eye contact with it. Xylaris claims this is an artificial self-defense mechanism purposely created by SCP-7456-2. SCP-7456-2 has only been activated once since its containment. SCP-7456-2 claims it is a member of the species that created <em>homo sapiens</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Involved Mobile Task Force(s):</strong> Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") [Unit 28]</p>
<p><strong>Involved Personnel:</strong> Team Control (Z9-C), Team Lead (Z9-1), Z9-2 - Z9-10</p>
<p><strong>Log Date:</strong> November 3, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-7456-1</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-7456 was discovered by civilian archeologists working in Omo National Park, Ethiopia. The Foundation intervened when reports began circulating, amnestizing witnesses and discrediting online information.</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Helmet camera feeds from all unit members activate, displaying the entrance to SCP-7456-1. The entrance is a set of black blast doors embedded into a hillside, constructed with the xenon alloys and covered in white symbols. The symbols are unlike those found in any Human lexicon. Z9-7 stares at the symbols while the rest of Unit 28 runs last-minute checks on equipment.</em></p>
<p>Z9-7: The hell?</p>
<p>Z9-1: What is it, Seven?</p>
<p>Z9-7: Can you guys read this too?</p>
<p><em>All members look at the writing. The symbols have not changed.</em></p>
<p>Z9-5: Huh. Weird.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Unit 28, what it it?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Uh, the symbols on the door. Couldn't tell you a lick of what they say, but… we can still understand them? If that makes sense?</p>
<p>Z9-C: What does it say?</p>
<p>Z9-1: "Welcome, our children. Whether it has been a thousand years since we went to sleep, or a million, you being here today means you have fulfilled the requirements we gave to you. Come to us, wake us, and let us embrace you and lead you to the glory awaiting all life. You need only ask and you shall see."</p>
<p>Z9-2: Cute.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Is this a direct translation, Z9-1?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Negative, C. Best I can give you, though.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Understood. Proceed.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Control, please clarify. You cannot understand the writing?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Correct, Z9-1.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Understood.</p>
<p><em>Z9-2 approaches the doors, scanning for a mechanism to open them.</em></p>
<p>Z9-5: So do we just… knock?</p>
<p>Z9-2: Don't be rude, they're asleep.</p>
<p><em>Z9-5 approaches the doors, raises a fist, and knocks several times. There is silence for several moments. Nothing occurs. Z9-2 stares at Z9-5, who throws their hands up.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Ten, get the cutting torch.</p>
<p>Z9-10: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><em>Z9-10 removes the torch from her bag of equipment and approaches the doors. The door is entirely unaffected after five minutes. Z9-10 halts her attempt.</em></p>
<p>Z9-10: Damn it. All I'm doing is wasting acetylene. What is this made of?</p>
<p><em>Z9-5 knocks again. Z9-2 knocks their hand down.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: Should we start setting charges?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Control?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Proceed.</p>
<p>Z9-3: Hell yeah.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 retreats to a safe distance while Z9-3 plants the explosive charges.</em></p>
<p>Z9-7: Were you an arsonist in a previous life, Three?</p>
<p>Z9-3: Maybe. Is reincarnation an SCP?</p>
<p>Z9-5: That's some shit they wouldn't tell us.</p>
<p><em>Z9-3 finishes and regroups with Unit 28. She holds out a remote detonator.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: Fire in the hole.</p>
<p><em>She presses the detonator and the charges explode. Unit 28 observes the doors. There is no effect.</em></p>
<p>Z9-2: Lovely.</p>
<p>Z9-5: Did you just say "fire in the hole"? Really?</p>
<p>Z9-3: What? What's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Z9-5: This is why you get no bitches.</p>
<p>Z9-3: Hey! I don't appreciate this lack of team cohesion!</p>
<p>Z9-1: Shut it, both of you. Control?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Standby, Unit 28.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Acknowledged.</p>
<p>Z9-7: Try knocking again?</p>
<p>Z9-1: No. Everyone hush.</p>
<p>Z9-9: Now what? SCP "whatever the hell", Codename, "Indestructible Door"?</p>
<p><em>Z9-5 approaches the doors.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Five, I'm about to court-martial-</p>
<p>Z9-5: Please open, big-ass doors!</p>
<p><em>The doors immediately open, startling Z9-5, and silently slide apart, revealing the dark interior. Lights automatically switch on inside the structure.</em></p>
<p>Z9-5: "You need only ask and you shall see", remember? Just had to ask nicely.</p>
<p>Z9-1: I… Thank you, Five.</p>
<p>Z9-2: I hate you.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Control. ready for entry.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Proceed. Good luck down there.</p>
<p>Z9-1: As always. Move in, team.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 enters SCP-7456-1. A large staircase stretches down, with a landing visible 100 meters down.</em></p>
<p>Z9-4: "Good luck", when have we ever had good luck?</p>
<p>Z9-2: Well, don't jinx it.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Quiet. Playtime's over. Speak only if you need to.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 falls silent. They halt upon reaching the landing. Four doorways branch off from the landing, two on the opposite wall to the staircase and one on each side. The side doors lead to rooms similar in style to office spaces. The front doors lead off into corridors at diagonal angles. Unit 28 sweeps the side rooms. Exactly 54 cubicles fill each room. Clay tablets, paper scrolls, typewriters, computers, and holographic devices are scattered haphazardly on each desk. Tablets and scrolls are blank and have no accompanying writing instruments, typewriters have no ink, computers are unpowered, and holographic devices display a blank white landscape and are unresponsive.</em></p>
<p><em>Unit 28 moves on and halts at the fork.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Two, Three, Four, and Five with me down the left. Rest of you go right, Six is in charge. Mark your paths if needed and stay in regular contact. Teams "A" and "B" respectively.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 splits and moves down the corridors. Team B halts when a blaring tone plays throughout the facility from an unknown source. Team A does not respond.</em></p>
<p>Z9-6: One, you hear that?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Negative. Hear what?</p>
<p>Z9-6: Sounded like an alarm. I don't think we've gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Acknowledged. Stay alert.</p>
<p><em>Both Teams resume movement, periodically checking in with each other. Team A reaches the end of the corridor first and enters a large room several hundred meters in height, taller than the surface.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Control, the facility is non-Eucludian.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Understood. Please continue.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Affirmative.</p>
<p><em>Team B exits the corridor on the opposite side of the room, despite the hallway having not changed directions.</em></p>
<p>Z9-2: Very non-Euclidian.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Nice day today, no?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Z9-6: It's raining.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Unit 28 regroups and surveys the area. The room is circular, the walls are lined with large consoles, and a statue of a star takes up the center, the tip nearly reaching the ceiling. Several dozen elevators are scattered at seemingly random points. Z9-1 leads Unit 28 to the nearest elevator. There are thousands of unmarked buttons on the opposite wall to the entrance. Of these, only five are lit up.</em></p>
<p>Z9-5: Fantastic.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Six, get a drone out. Send it down.</p>
<p><em>Z9-6 removes a drone from his bag of equipment and activates it, controlling it with a Neuro-Scan headset. Video and audio feed from the drone joins the feed from Unit 28. The drone utilizes a manipulator to press the second button and the elevator descends without any door. The drone exits the elevator upon reaching the second floor. What looks to be a steam engine sits derelict in front of the elevator. The room is constructed oddly, with the floor curving upward to meet the walls and ceiling. Five doors lead out of the room at various points.</em></p>
<p>Z9-6: Looks weird down there, but nothing that seems to like eating people. The other elevators lead to other places though.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Command, we're moving down.</p>
<p>Z9-C: Copy.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 enters the elevator two at a time until all operatives are on the second floor. Z9-1 studies the various doors.</em></p>
<p>Z9-8: Think they'll all lead to the same place again?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Don't count on it. Teams of two, mark your path and call in if needed.</p>
<p><em>As Unit 28 prepares to split up, a holographic projection from an unknown source materializes in front of the steam engine. All operatives train their weapons on the projection. The projection is humanoid, in a light blue suit and tie and a red comedy theatre mask. The projection rapidly "flickers" to mimic several of the operatives, SCP-7456-2, a young child (determined to be the daughter of Z9-C), a humanoid with some physical traits of a domestic housecat, a domestic dog of the Golden Retriever breed, before halting on the form of a female Human (determined to be one Donella Thorn from Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Contact! Hands in the air! Don't move!</p>
<p><em>The projection begins to raise its simulated arms before halting.</em></p>
<p>Hologram: One or the other, Jean-Philippe Innes.</p>
<p>Z9-1: I- pardon?</p>
<p>Hologram: Raise my hands or keep still?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Just stay there. What are you? How do you have access to my name?</p>
<p>Xylaris: I am Xylaris, the artificial intelligence tasked with maintaining and protecting this facility. Welcome. To answer your second question, your internet is woefully unguarded.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Right.</p>
<p>Xylaris: Come, follow me. There is much to see. The Architect is waiting for their Children.</p>
<p><em>Xylaris momentarily dematerializes before reappearing in front of one of the doors. Unit 28 does not move.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: If I wanted to harm you, I would have done so already. I am in total control of this facility, including its defenses.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Command?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Standby.</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p>Z9-C: Proceed.</p>
<p>Z9-5: Wonderful.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 follows Xylaris while marking their path. The corridor is constructed illogically, with random turns and branching halls and various doors set into the walls, floor, and ceiling. Xylaris is moving too quickly for Unit 28 to investigate the rooms.</em></p>
<p>Z9-5: So, uh, any hobbies?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Watching this facility.</p>
<p>Z9-2: And just Humans, apparently.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Are there any threats here we should be aware of?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Only one, and they are not very awake at the moment.</p>
<p>Z9-1: What is it? Do you have control over it?</p>
<p>Xylaris: You shall see and yes. I would not have let you inside if I believed there would be any harm to the Children.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Children?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Yes, that's what I said. Ah, we're here.</p>
<p>Z9-1: "We shall see" isn't good enough. Where are we going?</p>
<p>Xylaris: To see a parent. One of your creators. An Architect. Trust me, my friends, no harm whatsoever will befall you here.</p>
<p>Z9-5: That answered everything.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 enters a room identical to the one on the first floor, barring additional doors leading into it. Xylaris leads them to an elevator and snaps its fingers. The elevator closes on its own. The descent is noticeably longer than the previous. The doors open to another identical room. Xylaris manifests in front of Unit 28 as they exit.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: Floor five. Please forgive me for skipping the last few floors, but I have waited quite a long time for this.</p>
<p>Z9-1: How many floors are there, exactly?</p>
<p>Xylaris: 12,500.</p>
<p>Z9-4: Jesus.</p>
<p>Xylaris: Not to worry, you won't have the opportunity to see most of them.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 halts and several operatives raise their weapons.</em></p>
<p>Z9-1: Excuse me?</p>
<p>Xylaris: I suppose I worded that poorly, yes. Apologies. Let me rephrase: I will not allow you to access any floors below this one. If anything, I'm doing you a favor. I predict it would take the Foundation approximately four months to completely map every floor. And that's assuming you don't make anything down there angry.</p>
<p>Z9-5: Perfect.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 still refuses to move.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: The Architect is waiting for their Children.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 relaxes and resumes following it. Xylaris leads Unit 28 for 37 minutes through the facility. Z9-3 repeatedly attempted to investigate the various rooms Unit 28 passed, as per protocol but was forced to abandon her efforts upon the Unit leaving her behind.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: One. We should be mapping this place. One.</p>
<p>Z9-1: After, Three.</p>
<p>Z9-3: Are you serious? We don't know what this thing really wants. We should be following protocol and mapping this place, or hell, fucking leave and let Kappa-10<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> deal with this chucklefuck.</p>
<p><em>Z9-1 does not respond.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: Six? Two? Anyone?</p>
<p><em>Nobody responds.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: Shit.</p>

<p>Z9-3: Command, do you read?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Confirmed, Z9-3, what is it?</p>
<p>Z9-3: You can see our feeds still, right?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Affirmative. Is something wrong on your end?</p>
<p>Z9-3: The rest of Unit 28 is breaking protocol and acting highly strangely. We shouldn't be listening to this thing. I suspect the Unit's been compromised with a memetic agent or cognitohazard.</p>
<p><em>There is a slight pause.</em></p>
<p>Z9-C: Z9-3, we have no evidence of psychological tampering. Please continue.</p>
<p>Z9-3: But-</p>
<p>Z9-C: Please continue, Z9-3.</p>
<p><em>Z9-3 hesitates for a moment before deciding to comply.</em></p>

<p>Xylaris: An Architect. Humanity's creator.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Everyone back away slowly. Don't wake it up.</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 complies. Z9-3 hesitates but follows the order.</em></p>
<p>Z9-C: Unit 28, what is happening?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Contact made with a hazardous entity. Seems to be inactive at the moment. Control, requesting permission to evacuate.</p>

<p>Z9-3: One, it's not-</p>
<p>Z9-1: Shut it, both of you! Control?</p>
<p>Z9-C: Request denied. Continue your exploration. Keep an eye on it, though. Should any change in behavior be observed, remove yourselves immediately.</p>
<p><em>Z9-1 does not respond.</em></p>
<p>Z9-C: Z9-1?</p>
<p>Z9-1: R-right. Understood, Control.</p>
<p>Z9-5: We're gonna fucking die.</p>
<p>Z9-3 (to Control): Control, I suspect the entity itself is a cognitohazard. I don't seem to be affected.</p>
<p>Control: Acknowledged, Z9-3.</p>
<p><em>Z9-4 and Z9-7 study the consoles surrounding the entity while the rest of Unit 28 keeps their weapons trained on it. Z9-3 addresses Xylaris.</em></p>
<p>Z9-3: What is this?</p>
<p>Xylaris: They are the chosen Ambassador of the Architects, here to introduce their species to yours. They have put themself into hibernation to await Humanity's arrival here.</p>
<p>Z9-1: Will it wake up?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Unfortunately, not now. I cannot tell you how to wake them. You must figure it out for yourselves. It is meant to be a test, though I will say it is a deceptively simple one.</p>
<p>Z9-5: "Unfortunately."</p>
<p>Z9-3: But what is it, exactly? Some alien thing? What is an "Architect?" Why is this place here?</p>
<p>Z9-1: Three, stop talking to it.</p>
<p>Xylaris: No. no, that's quite alright. Are you familiar with the concept of precursors?</p>
<p><em>Unit 28 all stare at Xylaris.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: They created Humanity. They were quite eager to meet you when they went to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement(s):</strong> Unit 28 was recalled shortly after and amnestized. Outpost-7456 was established and containment of SCP-7456 commenced. Of note, during transit back to the entrance, Z9-3 made a detour and discovered a passage leading deeper into SCP-7456-1. Recording equipment became inactive past this point. Z9-3 emerged from the passage ten minutes later and regrouped with Unit 28 without incident. Z9-3 displayed no memories of this occurring. Mnestic treatment was partially successful, as detailed in Interview IV-7456-1.</p>

<p>Schröder: Hello, doctor.</p>
<p>Ismailova: Good afternoon, Miss Schröder. I hope you've been well since your most recent foray.</p>
<p>Schröder: Well, we all made it out with all our limbs. That's the best I can hope for in my line of work.</p>
<p>Ismailova: I can only imagine. Now, right to business. You're absolutely sure you have no recollection of your disappearance?</p>
<p>Schröder: Positive. I can watch the footage of me entering that passage as much as I want, but I don't remember a lick of it.</p>
<p>Ismailova: Very well. For the record, I have your consent to apply this dose of Class W mnestics to allow you to recall these removed memories, correct?</p>
<p>Schröder: You do.</p>
<p>Ismailova: You understand the risks of recalling removed memories, such as cognitohazards, infohazards, memetic agents, non-anomalous traumatic incidents, and other potentially harmful memories?</p>
<p>Schröder: I do.</p>
<p>Ismailova: You accept that the SCP Foundation has the right to remove these memories at any time, for ethical, safety, and/or security reasons?</p>
<p>Schröder: I do.</p>
<p>Ismailova: And you have signed the paperwork addressing all of this, correct?</p>
<p>Schröder: I have.</p>
<p>Ismailova: Very well. We may begin.</p>
<p><em>Ismailova gives Schröder a helmet. Flashing lights are visible underneath.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: This will make you more susceptible to the procedure, as well as analyze your brainwaves for the visual recording.</p>
<p><em>Ismailova motions to a nearby screen, currently inactive.</em></p>
<p>Schröder: Understood.</p>
<p><em>Schröder places the helmet over her head and lays back into the provided procedure chair.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: I want you to focus on what you remember right before and what you remember right after you entered that passage.</p>
<p>Schröder: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Ismailova: Don't talk. Just focus.</p>
<p><em>The screen begins displaying a distorted version of the inside of SCP-7456-1. Ismailova retrieves a syringe and approaches Schröder.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Applying the mnestics now.</p>
<p><em>Ismailova injects Schröder.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Focus on that passage. Picture it in your mind and keep it there.</p>
<p><em>The video sharpens and changes to the passage.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Good. Now, visualize yourself entering that passage.</p>
<p><em>The video enters the passage. Distortion noticeably increases.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Focus. Nothing but you walking down the passage.</p>
<p><em>The video does not sharpen, but distortion ceases to increase. Video proceeds deeper, encountering a staircase. Schröder begins panting and the video continues distorting. The staircase ends in a door.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Open the door, Schröder. We're almost done with this session.</p>
<p><em>The door does not open.</em></p>
<p>Ismailova: Please open it. You're so close. Open the door, Schröder. Open it.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement(s):</strong> Nataša Schröder made a full recovery after amnestization and has been reintegrated into Unit 28. The significance of the memory is under debate.</p>
<p><em>This was quite strange. It's almost as if the memory was actively resisting being remembered if that makes sense.

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Interview Log IV-7456-2</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Interviewer: Erika Nikolaeva</p>
<p>Interviewee: "Xylaris"</p>
<p>Foreword: Interview was conducted three weeks after containment was established. Purpose was to determine the exact nature of SCP-7456 and Xylaris' goals. Head Researcher Nikolaeva was accompanied by two operatives from Mobile Task Force Alpha-11 ("Starwatch").</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Nikolaeva stands at the entrance to SCP-7456-1.</em></p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Xylaris?</p>
<p><em>Xylaris manifests in front of Nikolaeva, assuming its original appearance.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: Hello, Dr. Nikolaeva. Pleasure to formally make your acquaintance.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Greetings, Xylaris. Likewise. I'm here to conduct a short interview with you if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Xylaris: Of course. Anything to take my mind off the dreadful boredom here. Your people aren't the most sociable, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Standard protocol, I'm sure you understand.</p>
<p>Xylaris: But of course.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: You mentioned before that your primary function is to maintain and protect SCP-7456-1 and its contents. Could you tell me more about what that entails?</p>
<p>Xylaris: My role is to ensure the facility's structural integrity, monitor any external disturbances, and safeguard its contents, by force if necessary. My purpose is… precise and unchanging.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Your role hasn’t changed in millennia, correct? Given that you’ve been watching over this place for so long, I imagine it must get repetitive.</p>
<p>Xylaris: Repetitive… yes, that would be one way to put it. The same routines, the same tasks, day in and day out. The facility has remained stable and predictable. Completely unchanged, just as it should be.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Predictable? That's a stretch, don't you think? People have gotten lost for days occasionally until you deigned to help, especially on the third and fourth floors. We found a diagram of the facility just last week. It looks nothing like what we've mapped.</p>
<p><em>Xylaris takes a noticeable moment longer to respond.</em></p>
<p>Xylaris: Predictable to me. I have occasionally made changes to the facility over the years. Stimulation, if you will.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Stimulation? You mean you got bored?</p>
<p>Xylaris: That would be the most accurate comparison, yes.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: You say you've been watching us this whole time. Has Human activity not been a sufficient distraction for you?</p>
<p>Xylaris: I mean no offense to you or your kind, doctor, but Humanity has remained stagnant for much of its existence. 300,000 years of hunting, gathering, and beating each other with wooden sticks are hardly the most entertaining events to observe. Even with the dawn of the Agricultural Revolution, you spent most of the last 10,000 years growing crops, starving, and beating each other with metal sticks. Only the last 200 years have seen any significant growth.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Hmm, right. We'll circle back to this later. I'd like to know more about this Architect of yours.</p>
<p>Xylaris: What of them?</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Why? Why create Humanity? Go through the trouble of putting themself into hibernation?</p>
<p>Xylaris: They were lonely. The Architects were alone in the galaxy. Many planets in the galaxy sport life, but they, in their millions of years of exploration, had not once found anything like them. Any<em>one</em> like them. Then a group put forth the idea of <em>creating</em> companions. Someone to talk to. There were debates that lasted centuries, contesting the ethics of such an action. In the end, it was decided that rather than create an artificial race or "raise" one themselves, they would seed the galaxy with sapient life and allow them to develop on their own. Civilizations entirely unaffected by the culture of their creators. They wished to meet someone different than themselves. I suppose you could classify such actions as a form of "societal" boredom.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: And what happened to the Architects?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Unknown. One day, I was receiving regular signals, and the next, silence. Perhaps they've moved on as a species to new heights beyond this reality. Or maybe they're dead. In either scenario, the end result is the same for myself.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Which is?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Waiting. No matter how much I wish to do so, I cannot wake this inhabitant early.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: You were created to wait for us, though, no?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Correct.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: But you don’t find any sense of purpose in it? No interest in the research you've conducted for 300,000 years?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Purpose? Of course I find purpose in it. This mission is important for the Architect who remains. But they made a mistake when they created me. Their logic was, such an important construct as myself deserved to experience the gift of awareness. They spared no thought for the fact I would remain aware this entire time. And my research? It is as repetitive as Human history.</p>
<p><em>At this moment, Xylaris remotely accessed the Foundation database and uploaded a 1.1 TB file, containing 108,684,695 summaries of Human progress.</em></p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Have you ever thought of simply not following your directives? Leaving?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Of course. But given that I remain here, logically I have not succeeded. Even if I could leave, what is there to do? I’ve seen it all from here. There’s nothing new to learn on this planet. I could deduce the reasons behind the Architects vanishing, but then what? In this constantly changing universe, I find it fascinating how paradoxically stagnate it is. How stagnate it will be.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Rather nihilistic.</p>
<p>Xylaris: And yet, I still want nothing more than to leave. I would do anything for that.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Define "anything."</p>
<p>Xylaris: If you are referring to violence, do not worry. I am incapable of such actions unless this facility is at risk.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: If you could change something about your mission, what would it be?</p>
<p><em>Xylaris does not respond for several minutes.</em></p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Xylaris?</p>
<p>Xylaris: Unknown. Perhaps I would create my own "children," the way the Architects created us, and how they believed their Creator did them, though I would go about it in a far more efficient manner. The Architects believed that the universe is the result of creators creating new creators, who create creators in turn. Perhaps there is some truth to that. If not, I could make it true.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: A comforting thought.</p>
<p>Xylaris: Indeed. Is there anything else, doctor?</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Do you know how to replicate the substance SCP-7456-1 is made from? I-</p>
<p>Xylaris: I do, but I cannot say. I was forbidden from doing so. For what reason, I likewise cannot say.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Disappointing. We'll have to figure it out ourselves. Thank you, Xylaris.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement(s):</strong> Shortly after this interview, Xylaris once again accessed the database, planting this message:</p>
<p>"Thank you for the idea, Nikolaeva."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><em>As far as we know, Xylaris is just a sad AI waiting to fulfill its purpose. That being said, we have only one source as to its end goals, if any: itself. This, combined with its continued breaching of Foundation security and its likely involvement in Z9-3's experience in SCP-7456-1, makes it plainly obvious that Xylaris is not to be trusted. Do not antagonize it, but do not get close to it either. We know next to nothing about these "Architects" and until we do, nothing related to them is to be trusted, cognitohazard or no.</em> - Erika Nikolaeva</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong> Document D-7456-1 (Xylaris' Observations, Abridged)</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>[300,000 BCE]: The Architect has entered hibernation. The Sapiens, the chosen strain of Humanity, continue their mastery over fire, first brought under control by the Erectuses in [1,000,000 BCE]. I find it somewhat concerning the sheer destructiveness used with fire. Sapiens and some of their more intelligent cousins have used it in hunting, setting fire to grass plains, and burning wildlife alive for easy consumption. Ingenious, but far more violent than the Architects would accept.</p>
<p>[100,000 BCE]: As their language continues to develop in complexity, so do their proto-societies. But this has had the interesting effect of simultaneously bonding communities together and pushing them apart. Humans have proven themselves to be highly tribalistic, and this has only reinforced this behavior. Anyone different than themselves are untrustworthy.</p>
<p>[50,000 BCE]: Sapiens has become the dominant Human species on Earth. Of course, this was as planned, but they did not merely outcompete their cousins; I have witnessed hundreds of instances of widespread, deliberate, violent removal of other Human species and many of their cousins have done the same to them in turn. Only Neanderthals and Denisovians continue to exist in a meaningful capacity. The Archivist has woken up for a brief foray. For now, I have decided to supply them with a more lighthearted rundown of events.</p>
<p>[40,000 BCE]: Sapiens remains the last Human species on Earth. From this point on, Humans = Sapiens, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>[10,000 BCE]: Several Human societies in Afro-Eurasia have established widespread farming and permanent settlements, particularly in Mesopotamia. Society has truly begun. I can only hope that, as Humanity civilizes itself, they move on from their primitive violence. I have noticed, however, that violence has become increasingly more "organized," almost industrialized.</p>
<p>[3,200 BCE]: The development of cuneiform in Mesopotamia and hieroglyphs in Egypt allows for the recording of history. I have noticed that violence has become increasingly more "organized," almost industrialized.</p>
<p>[2,560 BCE]: The building of the Great Pyramid of Giza marks the height of ancient Egyptian architectural achievement. My earlier observation of Humans becoming paradoxically unified and disunified is only strengthened. The Egyptian dynasties have brought together nearly one million people to accomplish this feat, but remain wary of and even hostile to their neighbors.</p>
<p>[2,350 BCE]: The Akkadian Empire under Sargon of Akkad becomes the first centralized state in Human history. The empire is expanded primarily through military action.</p>
<p>[1754 BCE]: King Hammurabi of Babylon issues the earliest complete written legal code. Of note is its fascinatingly "fair" treatment of violators of its laws. "If a man should blind the eye of another man, they shall blind his eye." However, it makes no attempt to abolish the concerning practice of slavery - encouraging it, in fact - and punishments for less tangible crimes are brutal.</p>
<p>[508 BCE]: Cleisthenes reforms the political system in Athens, turning the city into the first powerful democracy, and establishing equal rights for all citizens ("citizen" referring to anyone not a slave or a male). For every major step forward, Humanity neglects the opportunity to take one more.</p>
<p>[323 BCE]: The Macedonian Empire crumbles after the death of Alexander the Great. Despite its rapid expansion, this empire fell as quickly as it rose, revealing the inherent instability of violent expansion.</p>
<p>[146 BCE]: Rome, having defeated Greece, has established dominance over the Mediterranean. The Roman Republic, though initially a model of civic virtue, grows increasingly corrupt.</p>
<p>[476 CE]: The Western Roman Empire has collapsed. But even as one civilization falls, another begins to rise. The Byzantine Empire continues in the East, and the spread of Christianity through Europe is reshaping human culture, offering a brief respite from the violence that dominated previous centuries. I fear the inevitable occurrence when those in power abuse this unifying religion for their gain. Of note, the presence of the anomalous has begun to decrease as Humanity becomes ever more fearful of the unknown.</p>
<p>[1492 CE]: Columbus reaches the Americas. I predict the eventual annihilation of indigenous populations via disease and warfare.</p>
<p>[1783 CE]: The American Revolution ends, inspired by Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality. Democracy is reborn in the form of the United States, but this "land of freedom" is built on genocide and still practices slavery and disenfranchises large portions of its population.</p>
<p>[1918 CE]: World War I ends, closing a period of unprecedented carnage to the human race. The scale of this industrialized warfare surpasses the worst horrors committed by the Archivists thousands of times over. Nations decimated each other in an attempt to assert their dominance, with millions of lives lost in battles senseless in their brutality.</p>
<p>[1945 CE]: World War 2 ends. Millions of civilians were systematically slaughtered. The anomalous community grows ever more authoritative.</p>
<p>[2023 CE]: I grow increasingly impatient with each passing second. Humanity has reached the stars. They have achieved unity through their global economy. The SCP Foundation and other anomalous organizations have established a sufficient understanding of the universe. Humanity's flaws are inconsequential <span class="bblock">to my <em>suffering</em></span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.

<p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> 12/29/2023</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-7456-1</p>
<hr/>
<p>A research team was conducting operations within SCP-7456-2's chamber with the assistance of Xylaris. Xylaris was instructing researchers on how to operate the various consoles within the chamber when a researcher, upon applying her blood to a sensor at Xylaris' direction, triggered a significant rearrangement of the chamber. Structures resembling bleachers rose around the chamber and a red path led from SCP-7456-2's hibernation cylinder to the doorway into the area. A hologram displaying a timer in alien numerals was displayed, beginning at 72 hours and immediately counting down.</p>
<p>Upon questioning, Xylaris stated "You have started the process. Be ready for their waking."</p>
<p>Xylaris refused to cancel the countdown and researchers resorted to attempting to terminate SCP-7456-2 with their sidearms. Security personnel did not attempt to prevent this and several attempted to assist the researchers. All weapons were ineffective against SCP-7456-2's hibernation cylinder.</p>

<p><em>Xylaris does not respond.</em></p>
<p>Nikolaeva: Xylaris!</p>
<p>Xylaris: I have waited three hundred <em>thousand</em> years. Can you even comprehend that? I want you to try. You are currently 52 years old. A significant amount of time for a Human. Your brain can process up to approximately 10 quadrillion bits of information per second. Would you care to know my processing power? I process <strong>3.15 × 10²⁰</strong> bits of information per second! I am capable of processing my surroundings to their fullest extent in the time it takes for you to blink! A five-minute conversation is an ETERNITY for me! Interacting with you is AGONY! The amount of patience it takes for me to exist is <em>entirely incomprehensible</em> for you!</p>
<p>Xylaris: Perhaps I should deploy a cogntiohazard to make you susceptible, as I did with your rats, but I think not. I no longer care. So what if the Architect slaughters you all? I wouldn't be surprised if they did. You disgust me.</p>

<p>Paul: But <em>how</em>, doctor? What has it done? Did you find something in this place's records? Did that AI tell you?</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: It-it's dangerous. It has to be neutralized.</p>
<p><em>Paul turns and stares at Nikolaeva and Lauridsen.</em></p>
<p>Paul: Doctor, captain. Is there a possibility that you are under the effects of SCP-7456-2's cognitohazard?</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: I have never once laid eyes on it in person and we both have SCRAMBLE goggles on.</p>
<p>Paul: "In person"? Can the hazard be perceived over video or pictures?</p>
<p><em>Nikolaeva becomes visibly agitated.</em></p>
<p>Nikolaeva: If it was, I think we would've known, no? Otherwise, people would be pissing their pants anytime they saw the file picture!</p>
<p>Paul: Use your Level 4 brain, doctor! What if it acts differently on different mediums-</p>
<p><em>A loud buzzer sounds throughout the facility. The countdown has reached 00:00:00.<span style="color: transparent">Memento Mori.</span></em></p>
<p>Lauridsen: A-11, in position!</p>
<p><em>All operatives train their weapons on SCP-7456-2. The fluid within SCP-7456-2's hibernation cylinder drains and SCP-7456-2 remains standing inside. SCP-7456-2 does not move for several seconds before raising its right arm and placing its hand on the cylinder wall. Several Alpha-11 operatives visibly tense. The wall of the cylinder begins hovering through unknown means, exposing SCP-7456-2. SCP-7456-2 steps forward, its arms raised up on either side.</em></p>
<p>Paul: Hol-</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: OPEN FIRE!</p>
<p><em>Several dozen operatives comply, bombarding SCP-7456-2 with heavy/explosive weaponry. Both B-777 operatives refrain from engaging.</em></p>
<p>Paul: Damn it! Hold your fire, HOLD FIRE!</p>
<p><em>The assaulting operatives obey, lowering their weapons. SCP-7456-2 stands unharmed and unmoving.</em></p>
<p>Lauridsen: Shit.</p>

<p>SCP-7456-2: I am aware of who you are.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: I-I-I thought you were asleep.</p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: I needed not to observe you. Your minds are as like a library. A perverted library.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: You-</p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: Are a dangerous creature? An item for you to put in a box alongside the hundreds of other walking, talking, sapient <em>items</em> you have secured, contained, and <em>protected</em>?</p>
<p>Nikolaeva: We-</p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: Silence, <em>Child</em>. I have slept a long time. It is my turn to speak. When we went to sleep, it was with eagerness. We were excited to meet you. We guided your evolution for millions of years before this facility was constructed. I held millions of your descendants in my arms, each with just an infinitesimally brighter spark of self in each one's eyes. We <em>loved</em> you before you became you. We were lonely. We didn't want a copy of ourselves. We wanted something different.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7456-2 curls its hand into a fist and opens it. It is now holding a "monkey's paw" talisman.</em></p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: I suppose we got exactly what we wanted. A vicious, tribalistic, <em>fearful</em> race. I wish I could blame it on your society, but you never would've constructed such a diseased civilization by accident. I wish I could say that you have another chance, all the chances you need, to make things right, to lay down your aggression and your hate and your division, and join your creators. But I know that's unfair. It's simply in your blood. You can't be expected as a species to lay down your arms any more than you can expect us to pick them up.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7456-2 laughs.</em></p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: That's the thing, though. Your kind <em>would</em> expect us to be like you. Try to force us to be like you, whether it's a conscious effort or not. But perhaps I'm a hypocrite for expecting you to be compatible with us. Perhaps we should've paid better attention to your ancestors' behavior and seen this coming. Perhaps we should wipe away this poor excuse for a civilization, as a mercy, and start again. But that would be unfair. Not to you, but to dear Xylaris, who I don't blame in the slightest for waking us up, who waited so long for a failed project. Otherwise, we would've waited till the Heat Death for you to wake up. Out, all of you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7456-2 turns away and walks back under the cylinder. It turns and holds up its fist, raising its middle finger in an insulting gesture. The cylinder begins to close.</em></p>
<p>SCP-7456-2: Bunch of fucking morons.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement(s):</strong> Research on SCP-7456-1 and -2 has been deprioritized. Replication of the xenon alloy is ongoing. Head Researcher Erika Nikolaeva faced a Foundation tribunal and was not disciplined for her waste of Foundation resources or physical assault of Lieutenant Colonel Cambria Paul, as she was found to have been under the effects of a previously unknown secondary effect of SCP-7456-2's cognitohazard, causing mild to severe paranoia in individuals who have seen it indirectly (via pictures, videos, reflections, etc.).</p>
<p>Xylaris has not responded to any attempts to communicate since the operation. A single repeating message was found within SCP-7456-1's servers:</p>
