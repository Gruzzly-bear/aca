<p>SCP-5980 prior to containment.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5980</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5980 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 83. SCP-5980 does not require sustenance. SCP-5980 is allowed outside of its containment cell once per day for two hours for recreational activities, but is strictly prohibited from entering the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Food offered by SCP-5980 should be declined by personnel in order to maintain their mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5980 is the designation given to Ethan Chin, age 33.</p>
<p>SCP-5980 is capable of perfect cellular regeneration and is, by definition, biologically immortal. Given the regenerative properties of SCP-5980's cells, research into utilizing SCP-5980 for medicinal treatment is currently underway.</p>
<p>Extensive testing of samples taken from SCP-5980's body has revealed that its skin, as well as its organs, nerves, and fingernails, possess a flavour that is universally enjoyed by those that consume it. The flavor of SCP-5980 will vary depending on the consumer. SCP-5980 exhibits a pleasant aroma regardless of the seasoning it's cooked with.</p>
<p>SCP-5980 is amicable and will often encourage Foundation personnel to "have a bite" of it when they pass by. It is important to note that SCP-5980 does not exhibit any cognitohazardous properties.</p>
<p>Consumption of SCP-5980, while safe, is often detrimental to a subject's mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-5980 was discovered after several complaints were made in an establishment called Cannibal Chin's in northern New Jersey. A food critic claimed to have witnessed SCP-5980 remove its fingers with a kitchen knife before deep-frying them. These were later served as french fries. Several other civilians claimed to have caught glimpses of SCP-5980 self-mutilating in the kitchen moments before serving them food, and a Foundation investigation was instigated.</p>
<p>When questioned, SCP-5980 claimed to have no idea what it was doing wrong, and insisted that Foundation operatives have a complementary order off of the menu. Its requests were denied by all attending agents except for Agent ██████. Agent ██████, who was unaware of SCP-5980's anomalous properties, consumed the entirety of an order of fries, sized large, dipping each fry in a dark green milkshake. Agent ██████ was psychologically evaluated and later requested an amnestic, and for his name to be expunged from the official record.</p>
<p>SCP-5980 willingly came into Foundation custody once apprehended.</p>

<p>Cannibal Chin's was shut down using <a href="/scp-4670">Cover Story 14 ("Health and Safety Violation")</a> after four years of continuous operation.</p>

<p><strong>Interview 5980.4:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Owen Andrews</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-5980</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> Tell me again what you were doing at the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Growing food gets expensive, like, the costs was wayyy too steep man. I wish it 'didn't have to be that way, but when life gives ya lemons.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> Right, of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Didja try the Finger Fries?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> I'm afraid not.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5980 holds out a finger.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Tastes jus like chicken, I swear. Mmm mmm mmm! Have a bite, it doesn't hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> Umm… Noo… Thanks? I had something to eat already.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Suit yourself, man. You're missing out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> How exactly did you make the items on the menu?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Oh, that's easy. I crank up the heat real high if the water's running low, and I keep all my <a href="/scp-5918">spare meat n' shit</a> in the cooler. God, I think I'd die if I made every order at once.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> And what did people say to you when they found out that <em>you</em> were the source of their meals?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5980:</strong> Eh, forget about it. I didn't do nothing wrong. They're just a bunch of unappreciative bastards is all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Andrews:</strong> That'll be all for now.</p>
