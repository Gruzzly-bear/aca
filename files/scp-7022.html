            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7022</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Pending</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7022, as well as its potential to cause problems within the command structure of the Foundation, are to be thoroughly investigated by its designated research task force. Once a protocol to decommission SCP-7022 has been devised, it is to be implemented with utmost haste.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7022 is the designation given to the Foundation's current state of decline in certain aspects such as government support, technological development, and available funding. This currently causes an increasing amount of problems such as mass containment breaches, issues regarding the funding of various projects, and the possibility of external Groups of Interest overtaking the Foundation in certain sectors of research or technology.</p>
<p>While the cause of SCP-7022 is unknown, current theories vary from the possibility of SCP-7022 being non-anomalous to it being the result of an unknown entity. On discovery of the true nature of SCP-7022, the Overseer Council will convene to discuss adjusting the procedures for handling SCP-7022.</p>

<h4><span><strong>Addendum 7022.1: Expanded Incident Report</strong></span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-19</p>
<p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> 7/14/2020</p>
<p><strong>Description of Incident:</strong> Potential containment breach and/or anomalous interference.</p>
<p><strong>Responding Unit:</strong> Nu-7 Breakaway Battalion 5 ("All-Seeing Eye")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to the incident, Site-19 was fully stable and operational before becoming unresponsive to communication attempts for several hours. Attempts to access security camera footage were unsuccessful. As a result, a task force battalion was quickly assembled in nearby Area-726 to arrive at the site on near thirty minutes notice.</p>

<p>Ah, how good it is to be the Site Director at the largest (and nicest, I might add!) Foundation facility in the world. Hiding in plain sight right outside the city of Atlanta, we use an counterconceptual obscuring device, a machine developed from the fruits of our local antimemetic division's research. Many other sites have tried to replicate it, but we were the ones that made it work first, so a pat on the back for us!</p>
<p>I still remember the good ol' days of the site in its early days, before we had all these fancy devices that keep us safe. I was only 22 years old, the youngest of any Site Director of my time, and yet I got appointed to be the guardian of what was then one of the more… lower quality sites around. Think less of a Foundation facility, and more like some Area-51 dump. So not very good, and we started with only a handful of anomalies and… I think around a hundred people? O, I forget the numbers, but you get my point.</p>
<p>You remember 173? <em>[Chuckle]</em> Oh, who am I kidding, you are probably rolling your eyes at my mere mention of it. It was one of our first, and hell, I even took the picture for the darn thing and put it on the file! But apparently that's "unprofessional" and… <em>[Distant murmuring]</em> … oh, you hush, I'll rant all I goddamn want, its <em>my</em> memorandum! Hm, where was I? Oh, right, early days. I tried to live up to that one quote about a king leading his men into battle. Who said that? Sun Tzu?</p>
<p>Anyways, I was much more of a risk taker then, and now I'm stuck in this damn wheelchair and can't do squat except paperwork! I had a dream, to expand our site as much as I damn well could and look where it got me! Our oh so hardworking team made discovery after discovery, creating new departments where applicable, and saved the world a couple times, here and there. Our tiny facility couldn't handle this amount of anomalies, so we had to keep expanding underground! This spiraled, and what the hell, you probably get what came next. 1 basement turned into 60 levels!</p>
<p>I think us alone are now approaching nearly five thousand anomalies in our care. Quite a large number, I might add! Think about it, can you even name five thousand people? I think its made everything a bit confusing now. We now even have a group of Sub-Site Directors for micromanaging some things. Not what I imagined for a greater Site-19, but if it works, it works!</p>
<p>Regardless, whether you are transferring over, trying to find information for an anomaly, or just browsing, I'm happy to have made your acquaintance, and I hope we can work together to make the best Foundation we can! Signing off.</p>

<p>The assigned task force arrived at the site at 13:42, approaching the building from behind. The initial task force consisted of five personnel, with more prepared outside the facility as reserves in the case of the initial task force becoming unresponsive.</p>
<p>The purpose of the mission is to investigate the given problem and remaining personnel with the containment of any anomalies.</p>

<p><strong>Foxtrot:</strong> Begin to examine our surroundings.</p>

<p><em>A cracking sound is heard from above, interrupting Foxtrot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Hell was that?</p>
<p><em>The other task force members begin to look up and make sounds of shock. There is a man, elderly in appearance, hanging from one of the windows with no signs of life.</em></p>

<p><strong>Echo:</strong> <em>[Sigh]</em>… Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> After the body was collected and sent back to mission command, an autopsy confirmed its identity as the Site-19 Director. No information regarding the cause of this has been uncovered.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<p>After entering, communications with the task force became difficult due to memetic interference. As a result, communications were limited to only brief reports sent out by the task force as mission command worked to counteract the interference.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Does anyone ever really read these things? Yes, the region is fully stable and active. Has been since I was transferred here. It's not like the machines are just going to grow wings and fly out of the room. Trust me, we've accounted for that possibility. Reality manipulation is weird.</p>

<li><strong>Ranker:</strong> Bravo</li>
<li><strong>Sapper:</strong> Echo</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>The mobile task force was covering floor 17 when the report came through. The floor was covered in a thick, unidentified black tar-like substance. The task force continued on, before coming across a hallway that was unable to be illuminated by their flashlights despite its strength.</p>
<p>Before they were able to react, a humanoid flesh-like entity burst out of the shadows and lunged at Foxtrot, before the other task force members began opening fire. Standard firearms had no effect, however an experimental weapon made by Echo was used, terminating both Foxtrot and the creature.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Entity was able to be identified as a human that underwent sarkic transformations. No sarkite-related items exist at Site-19, leading to the conclusion that the site was infiltrated by a terrorist. How they got inside is unclear. The task force was cleared for further descent.</p>
</div>
<p>After Foxtrot was confirmed to be deceased, a second breakaway battalion was prepared in case the rest of Battalion 5 was to become unable to continue.</p>

<p>Okay? This thing on? Sorry about the whole audio log thing, hands are kind of full and I don't feel like writing shit today. Currently in the <em>[Huff]</em> … uh … third psychometic reaffiliation deconstruction chamber … <em>[Pause]</em> … who in the hell comes up with the names for these things? Last week I had to perform maintenance on a machine with a seventeen word name, it's like there's some lazy sci-fi author who pulls out a thesaurus to name these so they can sound smart…<br/>
Anyways, second system here looks to be just fine… Ah, wait, shit, did I really… <em>[Yelling]</em> HEY! YOU DOWN THERE! WHAT TIME IS IT? … hm …. goddammit, I missed my damned lunch break. At least I … <em>[Huff]</em> … get paid extra for the time I missed.<br/>
Theses things are pretty big… You'd think that a lot of people end up screwing things up around these parts every now and again. And yes, you'd be right. Just last week I had somebody blow up a… long-named thingie. It's been happening more and more recently, it almost makes you want to slap our personnel recruiters… who manages that department again?<br/>
Seventh system here is also fully operational. If it wasn't that, then what's causing this leak? Oh yeah, forgot to mention, was called here because this machine was leaking some no-no hume emitting fluid. Don't know what it does, those big burly guys won't let me anywhere near the substance. Who knows, maybe its an SCP of some sort?<br/>

<p>Due to the combined presence of potentially dangerous heavy machinery at the lower levels as well as the lack of encountered personnel throughout the facility, accessing the lowest levels was deemed a top priority.</p>
<p>Using a hatch to access a series of maintenance tunnels, the team found a way to bypass another 16 levels of the building.</p>

<p>The task force approaches floor 33 from a maintenance tunnel located on the side. There is a brief argument on who should open the door and head in first, before Zulu orders Bravo to undergo the task. After opening the door and preparing for any potential threats, the entire floor actually seemed to be filled completely with dirt.</p>
<p>The task force continued on through floor 32. Floor 32 abnormally took on the appearance of a still-in-construction part of the facility, noted by building materials laid out over the floors, scaffoldings, and unfinished walls, and no anomalies despite normally being one of the largest floors.</p>

Fun little history fact! Nobody knows the origin of this thing… now that I think about it, that describes over half of our anomalies…<br/>
…I'm walking through the halls of this thing. Just looks old is all, I think that may have caused it. I'd recommend a new thermal plating on the exterior, that should be all.

<p>The task force walked into the floor, before being greeted with personnel conducting experiments on anomalies on the floor. Under interrogation, they all claimed to be active Foundation personnel, despite any checks inside the database for their names turning up no results. All of the personnel claimed that there was no containment breach within the facility.</p>
<p>The team checked in the space behind the containment cells, however the chamber for the containment specialist appeared to be completely removed. With no containment specialist chamber, there was no chance that the containment for anomalies present on the floor would still be functional.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the contents of the floor, the O4 Council gave orders on behalf of command to kill the personnel claiming to be part of the Foundation. The task force members refused at first, but after some repeated negative reinforcement, the task force members complied and shot at the researchers. One of the researchers pulled out a revolver, shooting and killing Zulu before dying.</p>
<p>Reasoning behind the order is redacted.</p>

<p>After the previous report, a second team was sent down to aid with the containment of anomalies. In the meantime, the team was instructed to continue with their efforts to reach floor 60 of the facility.</p>

<p>Funny thing about those site directors and other higher-ups. They're completely out of touch with reality. Not really anything new with powerful people, that's kind of been a problem since the dawn of man. But with the Foundation, there usually isn't any other option than trusting them, since the alternative is death.<br/>
What if I told you that the main option also leads to death?<br/>
Yes, I'm talking to you lot reading this from the comfort of your own level 4 lounge after the mass site containment breach — fuck you.<br/>
If you weren't aware, my last request was to replace the thermal plating for a key component to keeping this place running. It got rejected for budgetary reasons. But there's no budget problems, so why would they do that?<br/>
Well, loyal listener. Looking through blueprints in the archives, or rather the lack thereof, it turns out that there was no blueprints for this machine. No records of it ever being built. Just showed up, with a dead body in it. The people here have been using this thing to clean up their own messes without even knowing how it works or where it came from. And now that it's causing problems, the irreplaceable resource that they've built their whole organization around is now running out, and they continue to extract favors from it.<br/>
Yes, I was demoted to level 2 and assigned to fix the air conditioner. And I'm fucking livid.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The task force arrived on floor 51, an advanced technological region for maintenance of both digital anomalies and experimental machinery. The floor also seemed to be covered in a thin coating of the same tar-like substance found on floor 17. Two bare skeletons bearing several burn marks were found in the corner of the entrance, right by the ventilation shafts.</p>
<p>After walking through to the other end of the facility, the existence of the black-tar began to cease. However, while preparing to walk out and go down the final staircase, a solidified, black, tar-like substance broke through the ventilation shaft right by the entrance and latched onto both Bravo and Kilo. Both task force members began to scream for Echo to do something, as Echo began to open fire. Both task force members were pulled through the ventilation shaft before Echo was able to aid.</p>
<p>Echo was instructed to keep moving.</p>
</div>
<p>Echo left to go down the final staircase at 16:33.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things come to a head today.<br/>
Funny thing, knowing you're about to die. Normally the first rule of dying would be not to, however, knowing it's inevitable, it makes you feel almost at ease.<br/>
Yeah, this isn't a standard tech report. Was assigned to unclog the toilets. Instead I'm in my office accessing secret files. People outside are preparing to use a battering ram to break open this barricade I set for myself.<br/>
I found a couple… disturbing things. Those random appearances of floors? Turns out, I wasn't going crazy. The reason this site has expanded this much was because things kept popping up out of nowhere, meaning an increase of size for the facility, meaning more funding. And things keep disappearing too. And when they do, "oh no, tragedy", and an increase of funding as a "Get-well-soon" gift to their dear biggest site.<br/>
But what is causing these things to swap places in both different times? What if, since the time anchor is now breaking down, and said time anchor was fueling the whole site's activities, it's now malfunctioning and sending entire floors from our fully developed site to the past?<br/>
And what do we get back from the past?<br/>
You know the answer to this question, Echo. Yes, I know you're reading this, with a surprised look on your face. I'm kind of a genius, I can do some looking into the future if I wish, present of our time-bomb. You know exactly what you need to do.</p>

<p><strong>Echo:</strong> Too bad you couldn't tell me not to read the files. Woah, what a scandal that would be if it got out.</p>
<p><em>Echo stops and examines the temporal anchor before her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> I was the top of my class. A mechanic I was, before I got assigned to mobile task force duties. Apparently I was good enough to turn my duties, y'know, mobile.</p>
<p><em>Echo stops to sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> The others were never meant to make it here. Or I guess the better phrasing would be that you didn't care if they made it here. You only cared if I did. And for what reason?</p>
<p><em>Echo continues to walk around the temporal anchor</em></p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> To fix the problem that you sat here and caused. You want me to fix this to sort out the paradoxes that you created, and you can go right back to abusing it. Yes, I know how to fix this situation, but it probably wasn't what you were hoping for.</p>
<p><em>Echo begins to start tampering with the inside of the temporal anchor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> This <em>thing</em> showed up because it just appeared out of nowhere. But, behold the greatest paradox yet to be sorted out, who made it appear? This thing doesn't just change timelines on its own.</p>
<p><em>Echo finishes tampering around with the temporal anchor and takes a step back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> You want something to sort out your paradoxes? Well guess what the best temporal anchor in the universe is — surprise, it's the universe itself!</p>
<p><em>The temporal anchor begins to undergo some form of self-repair. As it begins to go active once more, it causes the room to begin to shake.</em></p>

<p>On the 14th of July, 2020, an explosion has occurred in the region formerly designated Site-19, thereby completely destroying the site. The explosion is estimated to have a size of over 1 megaton<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-843661-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-843661-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h4><span><strong>Addendum 7022.2: Foundation High Command Meeting</strong></span></h4>
<p>The O4 council meeting room has thirteen machines each designed so any one of the overseers can communicate with the O4 council from a remote location, however this function has never been used due to a possible security breach. However, given the situation, it was decided to be used as the O4 council convened with full attendance for the first time in 43 years.</p>

<p><em>The entire meeting room goes quiet.</em></p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> Thank you. Now, as you all know, we will be hosting the thirteen overseers in our meeting room today. They are currently logged in. I hope you all remember protocol when it comes to them, correct?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> <em>[Unintelligible static]</em></p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> Sorry, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Ah, sorry, connection error. Just wanted to say not to worry about that stuff, we've got more… pressing matters… to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> Raph!</p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> It's true!</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Gentlemen, if you'd please. Yes, yes, the rumors are true. That's actually what we're here to discuss with you all today.</p>
<p><strong>K. Bernet<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-843661-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-843661-6')">6</a></sup>:</strong> How are we supposed to discuss if half of the damn document is redacted?</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> You aren't to be concerned with <em>why</em> the site exploded. The effects of it have just been… problematic.</p>
<p><strong>L. Donna<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-843661-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-843661-7')">7</a></sup>:</strong> Did anybody die in the explosion?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Unclear. It went off near a major population center, so you can come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> …Right. We're currently dealing with the fall-out of the incident, including a possible breach of the veil, and…</p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> Humiliation by the anomalous community?</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> …Yes.</p>
<p><em>A pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> The Site under my control is also a major site. If something like <em>this</em> happened, then my first action would probably be to cut back funding from other departments and try to build up a new pillar.</p>
<p><em>Sounds of dismay are heard throughout the meeting room. Kowalski puts his hands up.</em></p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> <em>What?</em></p>
<p><strong>L. Donna:</strong> The only reason you suggest that is because <em>you</em> own over the next-largest site, and would be the benefactor of said funding. None of the rest of us want our paychecks cut for your idiocy.</p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> A large amount of Foundation-owned machinery was in Site-19. It has to be replaced one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>L. Donna:</strong> Site-19 made their own technology from the ground-up. If you want some of your own, just go make it yourself!</p>
<p><em>More arguing all around is heard, continuing until all sounds are unable to be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> SILENCE!</p>
<p><em>The meeting room goes quiet once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Thank you. Site-19 hasn't been the only problem to the Foundation. A downward trend has been present in almost all sectors of the Foundation for a long while now. If we can pinpoint the cause of this downward trend, then we could possibly stop it.</p>

<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> We've been working on the solution to that problem well over 5 years. These guys haven't got a clue.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We think it may be anomalous activity. It's our duty to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> Is it? Well, once you figure out whether it's the hand of god doing this or if it's little 'ol Johnny down the street causing our downfall, do you think that will really change the situation?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>

I think our main solution here is that we need to put on a face for everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> A face?</p>
<p><strong>I. Carnigee:</strong> Yes. That's how we get all of our funding, no? We contain the anomalies. They give us money to keep the ball rolling and the pits of hell out of their back doors.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Right. This happened in the United States, we can request emergency funding for them under the pretense of defending against potential threats. Donna?</p>

<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> We're not fucked.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Our funding just got cut by 32%!</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Actually, I think it was 38%.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Fucking hell.</p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> Why were we brought in here, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Don't talk that tone with me. I made a chance allowing you lot Site-01 access.</p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> <em>Former</em> most powerful person.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> Jesus, you can smell the testosterone from here.</p>
<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> He did have a good question, though. What is the purpose of this meeting exactly?</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> Budget cuts. Veil is under threat. Personnel quitting. Whole shebang. Call it SCP-7022 duties.</p>
<p><strong>S. Kowalski:</strong> You don't seem very cut-up about this whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> That's because, hey, if this whole thing doesn't work out, I can just move out and become an Alaskan snow fisher.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Get your head out of your ass, dammit.</p>
<p><strong>K. Bernet:</strong> Where's Donna?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Gone. Thirteen took over their duties for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>I. Carnigee:</strong> Oh, thank goodness, now instead of Donna bothering me, I'll have an overseer up my ass every five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We're not here to bicker. Ideas, people.</p>
<p><em>Silence. O5-1 stands there staring at all the faces before him.</em></p>
<p><strong>R. James:</strong> Our budget and worldwide trust has dropped significantly, but we're still just barely leading in most statistics. I suggest we just reap our losses and continue reconstructing.</p>
<p><em>O5-1 walks up to James and slaps him.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> <em>I'm</em> not going to settle with "barely leading". We are going to find someway to crush those other <em>insects</em> under our boot. And if any of you think otherwise, you can leave this room.</p>
<p><em>The people before O5-1 stare blankly at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> Question.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>C. Raph:</strong> During my research, I saw that around the Foundation's creation, there were already other players in the anomalous. I'm sure that they had the same mindset. How did they collapse?</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> We dismantled the other organizations, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>K. Bernet:</strong> And now you're the one at the top, sitting on your asses as we are slowly being clawed down?</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> It doesn't work like that. We can't go and—</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Wait!</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> That's it! We've been sitting around and working on putting on a show that we're all right so everybody can come and help us. But then our organization will just be taken over by the next. What we need to do is strike first, and strike hard.</p>
<p><strong>O5-13:</strong> I don't… understand?</p>

<p>Image of initial incident</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On 8/15/2020, a Foundation bomber from its department of non-anomalous warfare flew over Global Occult Coalition airspace surrounding a standard military operations site. The pilot was notified over radio of the mistake, but continued to fly onwards.</p>
<p>What is noted to be anti-memetic weaponry was dropped from the bomber and onto the facility, where it then destroyed a large piece of the Coalition's air-way. The bomber was able to flee before being destroyed by the anti-air in the region.</p>
<p>The Coalition has notified the Foundation of a potential error, with no response made. Instead, several more similar incidents have occurred across various Global Occult Coalition owned regions, leading to the assessment that this was a coordinated strike of some kind. A retaliation response is being prepared.</p>

<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> War?! That's your solution to this problem? War?</p>

<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> Do you realize how mind-bogglingly stupid this idea is?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It's not stupid. The Foundation rose up from conflict. What's a little more to continue the cycle?</p>
<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> You sound like a stereotypical movie villain right now.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I've heard that one before. Listen, we've run all the calculations. Our manpower may not be as large, but our technology allows us to outrank all other militaries combined. If we win in conventional combat, our longstanding problem will go away and we can go right back to growing. All of the other overseers agree with me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>D. Ingram:</strong> Just last year, the Foundation stood behind its vast amounts of intelligent solutions to difficult problems and its brains-behind-the-operations. What are you now apart from a warmonger?</p>

<hr/>
<p>As for your weekly report, the number of containment breaches has skyrocketed in the past few weeks. Apparently since we didn't have the funds to recapture them, they were acquired by various other groups of interest.</p>
<p>As far as exact numbers go, we've had 73 containment breaches across all Foundation sites with an estimated 182 anomalies lost.</p>

<p>That should be fine. We are currently in the process of reclaiming those anomalies anyways. Just do your best to stretch out whatever funding we have for containment of remaining anomalies.</p>

<p><strong>A. Mariano:</strong> I'm sure it goes without saying why we are here?</p>
<p><em>The other members nod, and Mariano continues his speech.</em></p>
<p><strong>A. Mariano:</strong> Right, well, in the past few weeks, it has been a tough time for the Foundation. I've understood that. As a result, I was willing to turn a blind eye to some of the… extraneous… measures that the Overseer council has put in place.</p>
<p><strong>E. Chase:</strong> And I've told you from the beginning we shouldn't have let that slide. Now we're at war.</p>
<p><strong>A. Mariano:</strong> Yes, yes, I know. I got the report too. But what caught my eye was what was being done with SCP-2000. Alice, debrief?</p>
<p><strong>H. Alice:</strong> Yes, of course. We've been in a real pinch with manpower. It's been hard to find new members, and people are now quitting left and right now that the Foundation has mobilized.</p>
<p><strong>P. Prish:</strong> Yes, we read the report.</p>
<p><strong>H. Alice:</strong> But, what's interesting is, to combat this, the overseer council has given certain commands to SCP-2000… they're using it to generate clones to cover the manpower deficit.</p>
<p><em>The committee bursts into loud talking and arguing in reaction to this new piece of information. Mariano slams his hands on the table in front of him, and everybody goes quiet.</em></p>
<p><strong>A. Mariano:</strong> This is the exact thing we are here to prevent. These anomalies are meant to save humanity, if we use it for combat, we're no better than the insurgency I say.</p>
<p><em>Sounds of agreement are heard across the committee chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>A. Mariano:</strong> Then it's agreed. We will hold a vote in 10 minutes, and decide what to do next.</p>

<h4><span><strong>ABRIDGED OPERATION REPORT:</strong></span></h4>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Estimated Personnel:</strong> 5,103</p>
<p><strong>Reserve Size:</strong> Unclear</p>
<p><strong>Regiment Leader:</strong> Kernal Bernet</p>
<hr/>
<p>An offensive was led towards Global Occult Coalition headquarters on 9/1/2020. Due to the facility's presence on a lake island, Kernal Bernet ordered a makeshift bridge to be created to allow the personnel access through the lake. Establishing a footing on the facility was designated top priority.</p>
<p>However, halfway through construction of the bridge, Global Occult Coalition bomber planes, as well as artillery lined up around key points begun firing on the bridge, destroying it before Foundation soldiers could make a landing. Mission designated a failure, and orders given to retreat.</p>
<p>Upon attempting to retreat, the task force was surrounded by what appeared to be guerilla forces, and were systematically wiped out. Casualties estimated at 4,482 personnel.</p>

<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> I was going to vote against it all at first, but after what happened to the Ethics Committee, I didn't want to take any chances.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Yeah… the thing about the Ethics Committee is that it needs the power over the council under circumstances like these, otherwise it doesn't actually work.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Right. And if we have nothing we can do without causing worldwide mayhem, then we need somebody who still <em>does</em> have power over the council.</p>

<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> He may not even be alive anymore.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> If they were even real in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> But that's all we have. I made sure to develop an .aic to locate and send a file to them pleading for help.</p>

<p><em>All overseers raise their hands.</em></p>

<p>On 9/5/2020, the entirety of staff at three different Foundation sites and five departments have refused to work, despite repeated attempts at coercing them into doing the work. This has resulted in the theft as well as escape of an unknown number of anomalies.</p>
<p>The O4 Council has unanimously voted to pass a resolution in support of the protestors.</p>

<h4><span><strong>Addendum 7022.10:</strong></span></h4>
<p>Why am I even still updating this file? I haven't been contacted about SCP-7022 in quite a long time. I think they may have forgotten I still have my permissions.</p>
<p>Sorry, I know this isn't meant to be a personal diary or anything, but this is important that there's somebody knows what happened when the dust settles. That is, if there <em>is</em> anybody here then.</p>
<p>Just last week I've experienced 19 containment breaches at my home site. I don't think anybody's coming to help us though. It's all hands on deck regarding the war. Kowalski tried to voice concerns, and ended up getting declared impure, purged, and replaced. Strikes and resignations are rampant. Don't even know how many <em>actual</em> researchers are still left here, the cafeteria is empty at lunchtime.</p>
<p>A bunch of other sites fell to the forces of external GoI's. The Foundation is collapsing. Some world governments have even seized the opportunity to loot this organization's dead remains. How do the Overseers respond?</p>
<p>Well I was tuning into a Foundation meeting yesterday, which now has turned to one simply babbling to himself like a madman. Discussed the potential use of nuclear weaponry. If that happens, we're all fucked.</p>
<p>The Foundation has turned into nothing but a cobra.</p>
