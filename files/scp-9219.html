<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> Following its restoration by a Foundation front company, the location of SCP-9219's occurrence was monitored for 30 days. The at-first fluctuating Hume levels have since stabilized. As SCP-9219 is believed to have been a one-time event, no further measures are currently planned. All records of the anomaly's presence have been confiscated.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-9219 refers to the events that occurred on [REDACTED] 2025 in an attic in [REDACTED], Hamburg, Germany (<em>see Addendum 1</em>).</p>
<p>SCP-9219-1 describes the suspected perpetrator of these events, one Martin Feldt. It is believed that Feldt was a reality bender, but whether he was aware of this remains unclear. Investigations into his background have yielded no information. Feldt was 27 years old at the time of his demise and a carpenter by trade. He had never previously come to the attention of the Foundation or public authorities.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>Update:</strong></span> Persistent odors of smoke within the attic in question are to be explained as harmless residues from the fire.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>Addendum 9219-A: Log of SCP-9219's Occurrence</span></h3>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> [REDACTED]</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Attic in [REDACTED], Hamburg, Germany</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> The following log has been derived from the analysis of damaged security camera footage. Due to the poor original quality and the absence of audio recordings, only fragmentary dialogues could be extracted via lip-reading.</p>
<p>The attic belonged to Martin Feldt's apartment, one floor below. He apparently used it for leisure activities with his group of friends.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>[Begin Log]</p>
<p>[The attic is on display. Its furnishings resemble a small living room, including two windows, couches, garlands, and plastic plants. Beverage crates and gaming consoles can be seen next to a television.]</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>17:41</strong></span>: A person enters. Based on the reddish hair, lanky stature, and pale complexion, it is confirmed to be Martin Feldt. He places his phone on the couch table and walks to one of the two sloped roof windows, gazing outside. He is periodically seen kneading his hands absentmindedly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>17:45</strong></span>: With a thoughtless motion, Feldt's right sleeve touches the chest of drawers between the two windows. A deck of cards lying there falls down. The cards scatter across the floor. Feldt looks down at them abruptly. He doesn't move.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>17:46</strong></span>: The cell phone presumably emits a signal tone as Feldt suddenly turns to look at it. He moves toward the table and retrieves it to read a message.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>17:47</strong></span>: He sighs, puts the cell phone down again, and collects the cards. As he approaches them, he opens and closes his hands several times. He places the collected cards on the couch table.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>[Twenty-four minutes pass as Feldt cleans the room, presumably in anticipation of guests. He then proceeds to sit on the couch with his phone. Feldt opens and scrolls through several social media pages.]</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:12</strong></span>: It appears that the doorbell rings, as Feldt looks toward the door and stands. The camera captures him closing open apps, including a YouTube video about mental health.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:14</strong></span>: Three newcomers enter the room: Annalena Kirchhofer (26, graphic designer), Fabian Seitz (27, railway employee, Kirchhofer's partner), and Maximilian Beck (26, florist). Greetings and hugs are exchanged.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:14</strong></span>: The camera feed experiences brief interference but stabilizes after 8 seconds.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:17</strong></span>: The group gathers on the two couches. They discuss the weather, a recent soccer game, and then personal news. Feldt occasionally gives nonverbal signs of agreement and, when addressed by Kirchhofer, shrugs his shoulders once before fetching drinks for those present. Beck begins showing the group a series of memes on his phone, to everyone's amusement.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:39</strong></span>: Feldt suddenly looks across the room for seven seconds, where the television, a desk, and a cabinet are located. He stands up and moves in that direction, but then slows and turns left to open a window.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:40</strong></span>: Seitz prompts Feldt to turn on the television and a console. Feldt does so without hesitation. He then points to the controllers next to the couches. As everyone present focuses their attention there for four seconds, Feldt's shadow stretches unnaturally across the parquet floor and bends toward the cabinet before resettling.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>[The group begins playing. Feldt sits on the right-hand couch, while the other three occupy the other one. All present commence drinking beer from the storage boxes in the process. Feldt is partially out of view, but can be seen repeatedly checking his phone instead of partaking.]</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:58</strong></span>: Kirchhofer prompts Feldt to take a controller. He declines. She inquires as to his mood and well-being. A draught pushes the half-open window further open. The closet door rattles.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>18:58</strong></span>: Feldt gestures casually towards Kirchhof. He explains that he is feeling a little under the weather and moves to the window, closing it. Upon turning, he suggests ordering pizza. The group agrees after some mostly ironic debate on the details of the order.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:05</strong></span>: While the others continue to follow the games, Feldt orders via his phone. As he finishes, he looks for the spare controller on the couch table.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:05</strong></span>: Kirchof invites him to join again. They exchange a smile.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:05</strong></span>: Without any visible influence, the cards previously placed on the table fall off the edge. Feldt freezes, Beck notices the cards but picks them up without commenting.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:07</strong></span>: Feldt still has not moved. He remains tense.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:08</strong></span>: What appear to be ice crystals are seen forming on Feldt's clothing and skin. The others do not appear to notice.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:09</strong></span>: The air directly around Feldt begins to shimmer. The ice rapidly evaporates. The group does not react, but cheers on the ongoing game.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:10</strong></span>: The ceiling light flickers twice, then begins to pulse with increasing frequency. Feldt remains motionless.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:11</strong></span>: The cabinet door shakes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:12</strong></span>: Feldt's left hand tightens on his knee.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:12</strong></span>: A spatial anomaly occurrs. The room is warping along the X-axis from north to south. The structures of the walls and floor move in conflicting directions. Despite the circumstances, the others present seem oblivious. Kirchhof makes a joke about the air quality and suggests opening the window again. The room contracts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:14</strong></span>: The rotation through the center of the room approaches 40 degrees. Feldt does not move. Drawers, bottle caps, the door, and the cabinet doors are tightly sealed by an invisible force.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:14</strong></span>: The whole cabinet is seen vibrating.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:15</strong></span>: Feldt opens his mouth as he stares ahead. He does not speak. The room settles back to its normal form. The light is pulsing in deep, quick flashes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:16</strong></span>: The floor dents inward. An expanding hole appears. It expands until Feldt is sitting on its edge. Neither his friends nor he react to this.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:17</strong></span>: The group cheers at the game again.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:17</strong></span>: Feldt's lips tremble, but he does not appear to speak.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:18</strong></span>: The cupboard suddenly opens. Visible inside are cleaning products and a vacuum cleaner. A person who appears to be identical to Feldt steps out. He is furthermore wearing a rainbow-colored band on his right wrist.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:18</strong></span>: The figure steps to the opposite edge of the hole.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:18</strong></span>: Feldt and his double stare at each other. Neither speaks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:18</strong></span>: Doubes of Kirchhof, Seitz, and Beck stand up, while the presumed originals remain seated. They stand still for a moment, then point to the Feldt double.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:18</strong></span>: The Feldt-double plunges into the hole in one fluid motion and disappears. The hole closes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:19</strong></span>: The room deforms again, toward Feldt. Sharp edges and points begin to move toward him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:19</strong></span>: The remaining three doubles turn toward Feldt. Their expressions warp until their faces are unrecognizable. They abruptly vanish.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:21</strong></span>: Kirchof, still unaware, turns to Feldt.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:21</strong></span>: Kirchhof touches Feldt's shoulder. All movement stops.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:21</strong></span>: Kirchhof asks Feldt what is up with him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:21</strong></span>: Feldt looks at her. Kirchhof's expression changes to concern.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:22</strong></span>: The lightbulb bursts. Beck is hit by the splinters and recoils.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:22</strong></span>: Seitz screams upon realising the room's unnatural state. Pipes and cables burst through the wall and begin wrapping around Feldt in rapid succession.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:22</strong></span>: The room commences falling in on Feldt, who remains sitting motionless.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: Kirchhof is seen reaching for Feldt.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: All objects and structures then suddenly invert their trajectory within moments, but do not fully return to their normal state.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: The cabinet doors fly open again. A mass of fire erupts into the room.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: Feldt jumps up and stretches his arms toward the blaze. It visibly slows down.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: Feldt seems to realize what he is doing. He looks at the other three, who are staring at him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: Beck, open-mouthed, raises a hand and points at Feldt.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:23</strong></span>: Feldt freezes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #9179e7"><strong>19:24</strong></span>: All present are engulfed in the flames. The fire alarm triggers.</p>
<p>[End Log]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The Hamburg fire department arrived in a timely manner and brought the fire under control, but the attic burned down completely. All present lost their lives; however, SCP-9219-1's remains are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>The Foundation only became aware of the incident through comments exchanged between the police and fire department via telephone regarding unusually deformed objects and furnishings, and subsequently intervened. As far as is known, however, the incident did not attract further attention and was dismissed as a fire caused by a faulty gas pipe.</p>
<p>According to investigations by Foundation personnel, it is in fact probable that the fire was caused by electrical and gas lines accidentally damaged by SCP-9219, and not intentionally by SCP-9219-1 directly. Further investigations revealed that the building's infrastructure was outdated and dilapidated.</p>
