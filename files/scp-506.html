            <h1>SCP-506</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-506</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-506 grows in a 3 m x 3 m patch of soil, kept watered and fertilized via an automatic system. The air of the room where SCP-506 is kept must be filtered to prevent release of SCP-506 seeds into the environment. Personnel entering the enclosure must wear biohazard suits composed of inorganic material, and must be decontaminated upon leaving the area.</p>
<p>Due to the potential dangers associated with cross-contamination, SCP-506 and <a href="scp-124.html">SCP-124</a> are not to be stored at the same Foundation site under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-506 is a genetically engineered variant of zucchini (<em>Cucurbita pepo</em>) created by the ████████ Corporation as a hardy and rapid-growing food plant. SCP-506 exhibits several undesirable and dangerous qualities:</p>
<p>(1) SCP-506 will attempt to grow on any organic material, including on living beings. The seeds germinate on contact.</p>
<p>(2) SCP-506 grows extremely rapidly, reaching full size in five minutes or less.</p>
<p>(3) Due to its rapid growth, SCP-506 drains its growing medium of nutrients at an accelerated rate. Nothing will grow in soil that has harbored SCP-506 plants without extensive nutrient replacement.</p>
<p>(4) SCP-506 seeds are much smaller than typical squash seeds, and disperse easily in the wind.</p>
<p>SCP-506 is inedible, as the seeds will [DATA EXPUNGED] if any are consumed. To the best of the knowledge of The Foundation, SCP-506 has not escaped into the wild, and ████████ Corporation has destroyed all samples in their possession.</p>

<p>(<em>Note: Labeled as a time lapse in case of accidental public release.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-506 is evolving rapidly, as indicated by the incidents below.</p>
<p><strong>[Incident Report 506-1 5/16/20██]</strong><br/>
SCP-506 plants observed attempting to grow on the walls of the containment facility. Although the plants died of malnutrition, testing indicates the latest generation requires 35% fewer nutrients than when originally contained. Research in progress to find materials that do not support SCP-506 growth.</p>
<p><strong>[Incident Report 506-2 9/1/20██]</strong><br/>
Dr. K██████ found dead in the SCP-506 enclosure, covered with plant growth. The means by which his suit was compromised is unknown. SCP-506 roots have been found to secrete a powerful anesthetic, explaining why Dr. K██████ did not sound the alarm or attempt to escape the area.</p>
<p>Researchers must be under video surveillance while working with SCP-506, with another researcher ready to assist in case of accidental infestation. Reclassification as Euclid recommended.</p>
