<p>SCP-8167.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8167 is to be contained in a closed cardboard box within a climate controlled storage room at Site-19. All 152 individual components (designated SCP-8167-1 through SCP-8167-152) are to remain together within this single box.</p>
<p><em><strong>Testing involving the destruction of SCP-8167 instances is prohibited barring Site Director approval.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8167 is a collection of Hot Wheels toy cars originally found in an auctioned storage container that also contained several loose papers marked with the logo of the Department of Abnormalities. 134 of these cars are entirely distinct while the remaining 18 appear to be the same make, model, and color as another in the set. When a subject falls asleep within the same enclosed space as the complete SCP-8167 set, they experience a sudden increase in REM sleep cycles and a decrease in time spent waking up during the sleep period. Subjects report waking with an elevated sense of cognitive clarity, although it is unclear if that is an additional anomalous property of the cars or merely a result of the subjects sleeping.</p>
<p>If the collection is split apart and distributed across multiple rooms, the anomalous effect manifests only in the room housing the largest total mass of SCP-8167 components. Sleep tracking devices indicate that the quality of REM sleep decreases with each subsequent car removed from the collection. The minimum number of units required to display noticeable anomalous properties in a subject is 4 vehicles. When stored in a closed cardboard box, the anomalous properties of SCP-8167 are temporarily suppressed.</p>
<p>SCP-8167 units can be physically destroyed. Destroying a car results in the immediate onset of a coma-like state in which the perpetrator is sent into REM sleep. In the event that destruction was ordered by one individual and carried out by another, both individuals were immediately subjected to these effects. Subjects in this state show no brain activity outside of REM sleep and have not recovered to date.</p>
<p>Destroyed units may be replaced with a commercially identical toy car to that which was destroyed, but only if the replacement was acquired from a supermarket. Acquisitions from online ordering platforms, toy stores, and garage sales fail to trigger re-integration with the anomaly. This new unit must be taken to the largest mass of vehicles before it starts to display anomalous properties. While these new units appear to retain the same anomalous effects as the previous vehicles, they receive the designation SCP-8167-XXX-B (or -C, etc.).</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 6/8/19██</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> SCP-8167</p>
<p><strong>PRESENT:</strong> Researcher Adrian Torgerson, Researcher Aliya Reynolds, and D-15272</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Researchers set up Research Lab 13 by partitioning it into a smaller room, then bifurcating the smaller room via a twin bed on one side and a table on the other. A ball hammer, needlenose pliers, machete, lighter, fabric scissors, a filled water balloon, and bowl of ice water were placed on the table. A cardboard box containing SCP-8167 is placed underneath the bed.</p>
<p>D-15272 was selected as the test subject for his history of violent outbursts. As these outbursts appear to be exacerbated by reminders of his past, the bed was covered by a quilt similar to one previously found on his daughter's bed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>11:02 AM:</strong> D-15272 enters the room and the door is closed behind him. He rubs his wrists and appears to notice the objects on the table first. He picks up the hammer.</p>
<p><strong>11:03 AM:</strong> D-15272 appears to notice the bed. He states, "Oh, you f██████." He throws the hammer at the bed and picks up the machete from the table.</p>
<p><strong>11:04 AM:</strong> The subject brutalizes the bed with the machete. His goal appears to be the destruction of the quilt, but the mattress is ripped and scores are left on the wooden bed frame.</p>
<p><strong>11:08 AM:</strong> D-15272 takes fluff from the quilt and sets it on fire using the lighter. Ventilation systems are triggered to quickly pull smoke from the room.</p>
<p><strong>11:11 AM:</strong> D-15272 locates the box containing the components of SCP-8167 and dumps it out on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>11:12 AM:</strong> D-15272 separates a green sports car (designated SCP-8167-01) from the pile and uses the lighter to blacken the plastic for 41 seconds. The plastic does not light.</p>
<p><strong>11:13 AM:</strong> D-15272 rediscovers the hammer and smashes the car four times with the hammer. On the fourth blow, the car flies across the room. This appears to be due to physics and not an anomalous effect.</p>
<p><strong>11:14 AM:</strong> D-15272 attempts to slice the car with the machete unsuccessfully.</p>
<p><strong>11:15 AM:</strong> The subject lights more of the bedding on fire and places the car within the flames. The car is then again smashed with a hammer.</p>
<p><strong>11:16 AM:</strong> D-15272 collapses to the ground. 33 seconds later, the flames go out.</p>
<p><strong>11:30 AM:</strong> Reynolds enters the room to check the vital signs of D-15272.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8167-01 is found to be missing the front right wheel, with significant scratches on the exterior of the vehicle. D-15272 is found to be deep in REM sleep. No other adverse effects recorded.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p>Director Bold,</p>
<p>As requested, I recruited some other researchers to hold a postmortem on the incident. Here are our findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>All afflicted personnel appeared to fall asleep at the moment each instance of SCP-8167 was destroyed</li>
<li>Afflicted personnel remain in REM sleep and cannot be awoken</li>
<li>Introducing a replacement vehicle to SCP-8167 may awaken the afflicted individuals</li>
<li>Torgerson may have been afflicted because he picked out the car for destruction</li>
<li>Torgerson may have been afflicted because he gave the order for destruction</li>
<li>Torgerson may have been afflicted because he was the second-closest person to the car's destruction</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to continue testing to ensure keeping this anomaly onsite won't be a security risk.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Researcher Reynolds,</p>
<p>Under no circumstance are you to continue destructive testing. We're not the GOC – our mission is to secure, contain, and protect. Despite what stories you may have heard, we do not destroy. You should not have undergone destructive testing in the first place.</p>
<p>You may test your replacement theory. When not undergoing testing, store SCP-8167 in a fireproof and bulletproof box.</p>
<p>In the future, your postmortems should be focused on the process, not the experiment.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Director Bold,</p>
<p>We don't know. We sourced 22 different cars (14 were matches for SCP-8167-A, 8 were matches for SCP-8167-B) and physically placed each in the collection. However, we observed no indication of anomalous effects, nor did any of the afflicted personnel awake. We checked each vehicle by adding it to a group of three cars and seeing if by adding the fourth it would prompt anomalous effects. Sleep quality is inherently variable so it is possible that we missed something when testing the fleet, but there were no positive indicators.</p>
<p>Nearly sixteen hours after we concluded testing, Researcher Jason Allred and Matthew Heineke from Procurement fell asleep in different sections of the facility. There's no clear connection between them that we've found yet, other than they attend the same weekly pick-up basketball game. But no one else from that group was affected. And while Allred both had the idea for replacing the vehicles and collected all the failed attempts at the end, Heineke wasn't involved in the project at all. Jocelyn French in Procurement acquired everything and confirmed that she didn't hand any piece of the order off to Heineke.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Reynolds,</p>
<p>Janet Higgins from the AWD was also found asleep on her shift at the incinerator this morning. There's fear it may be spreading. Make this your top priority, and keep me apprised of your testing.</p>
<p>If you believe that there is no other recourse and have exhausted all other tests, then you may destroy one more sample. Until then, anything introduced to SCP-8167 is to remain quarantined and intact.</p>

<p>Report came back. Allred handed the collection replacements to Heineke, likely as there was already a disposal order under Heineke's name. Higgins executed the incineration.</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> SCP-8167</p>
<p><strong>PRESENT:</strong> Researcher Aliya Reynolds, D-14109, D-15538, D-15599, and D-20010</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All instances of SCP-8167 were placed on a shelf in the corner of Research Lab 13. A pair of bolt cutters (the same as used in Incident-8167-B) was also placed in the room. Two different observation chambers (one with the same terminal and cameras as the previous experiments, and one with just a red button and camera feed) and an additional room with no observation capabilities were also prepared. A voice recording of D-14109 was acquired approximately 48 hours prior to the onset of the experiment.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>2:22 PM:</strong> Reynolds enters the primary chamber and turns to face SCP-8167, which is placed just below a camera. She speaks for eighteen seconds, the contents of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"I believe that the REM sleep is caused by the willful destruction of SCP-8167. Today's experiment is meant to ascertain what counts as willful destruction – but I disagree with this experiment. I do not wish for any destruction. I hereby disavow this project, and am not associated with the outcome."</p>
<p><strong>2:23 PM:</strong> Reynolds exits the main testing chamber and enters the observation room with the computer terminal. She does not interact with the terminal and chooses just to watch the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>2:28 PM:</strong> Reynolds states something unintelligible, believed to be "All before knowledge."</p>
<p><strong>2:30 PM:</strong> D-15538 is admitted into the testing chamber. She selects a car from the box (a white and blue RV, designated SCP-8167-3), and places it in the center of the room beside the bolt cutters.</p>
<p><strong>2:32 PM:</strong> D-15538 leaves the room and enters the room with no observational capabilities. D-14109 is also admitted into that room.</p>
<p><strong>2:33 PM:</strong> D-15599 enters the room with the red button and camera feed.</p>
<p><strong>2:35 PM:</strong> D-20010 enters the primary testing chamber. Seven seconds later, D-15599 presses the button in front of her. The voice of D-14109 plays in the main testing chamber, stating "Destroy the car."</p>
<p><strong>2:36 PM:</strong> D-20010 picks up the bolt cutters and snaps the car in half. D-14109, D-15538, D-15599, D-20010, and Reynolds all fall in place.</p>

Teeth marks were left on the metal chassis of several units before SCP-2245 appeared to become distressed and retreated to the corner of the room, where it stayed until the subject awoke. There were no signs of the human subject undergoing SCP-2245-2 while it slept.</p>
