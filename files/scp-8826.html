<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration (RAISA) is to keep a master list of all personnel with access to this document. The list is to be available only by physical access and must be kept on an air-gapped system secured by mechanical locks. Contrary to standard procedure, no cryptographic integrity validation shall be used, and the integrity of the list is to be maintained exclusively by mechanical access control systems and redundant backups. The personnel shall be under constant Foundation surveillance in compliance with the relevant internal security regulations.</p>
<p>The concealment of information about the subject shall be coordinated by the Foundation Front <strong>Aletheia Group</strong> operating under the Public Systems Integrity Compact (PSIC) and executed through collaborative frameworks with civilian agencies, academic institutions, and major technology platforms via standard deniable influence mechanisms.</p>
<p>Public understanding of the relevant statistical threshold must remain anchored to the value <strong>≥23</strong>, in accordance with falsified, underexaggerated mathematical models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundation influence cells within major academic publishing bodies and journal review boards (notably <em>[REDACTED]</em> and <em>[REDACTED]</em>) shall maintain authority over textbooks and scientific publications related to the subject.</li>
<li>Mathematical educators shall be periodically provided with "quirky examples" and curriculum notes designed to discourage further research.</li>
<li>All search engines and research forums shall be seeded with fake publications and sockpuppet accounts discrediting the subject as a "party trick" or "math trivia."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This misinformation model currently has 97.8% estimated global stability.</em></p>
<p>The subject's effects manifest only within a defined population cluster; therefore, prevention efforts must focus on suppressing precise attribute comparison within small, well-defined groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundation social analysts shall promote norms of data ambiguity through public media and influencer culture ("don't overshare," "no one needs to know that," etc.).</li>
<li>Services offering detailed demographic or account metadata shall be subject to lobbying, discontinuation, obfuscation, or data tampering.</li>
<li>Governments shall be encouraged to pass legislation severely limiting the collection of personal datapoints (the GDPR being our most successful project to date).</li>
<li>Foundation-aligned consultants shall advise companies and public institutions to avoid grouping individuals based on shared attributes unless explicitly randomized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject incidents most commonly originate from informal experimentation ("fun tests"); therefore, online challenges, puzzles, and social games that involve user datapoint comparisons shall be neutered through throttling, fraudulent entries, and shadowbanning.</p>
<p>In the event of a complete containment breach, all digital copies of Foundation archives are to be mechanically destroyed. The original, stored in Area-██, is to be re-encrypted with a pre-generated one-time pad generated from radioactive decay (a truly random process) measurements stored at Site-██. Additionally, all access control systems based on asymmetric encryption (access badges) shall be disabled indefinitely, relying on mechanical overrides.</p>

<p>There are still too many people doing “what are the odds” posts.<br/>
We’ve run over a dozen event trees showing that the actual damage doesn't occur from shared attributes, but from the realization of the match, especially when framed as statistically interesting.</p>
<p>Keep leaning into the “weird but harmless” narrative. The moment the public suspects the true threshold is lower than they think, self-experimentation will outpace suppression.</p>
<p>One tweet is manageable. A TikTok with a million views is a cascade event.</p>
<p>Suppress the instinct to compare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Location: Seattle, WA<br/>
Date: 2023-07-11<br/>
Event Summary: A viral coding challenge posted on an educational YouTube channel involved scraping user-supplied account creation data to identify overlaps. The video, titled “Mind-Blowing Probability: Let's Try It Live!” reached 600k views within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Observed Effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users began reporting "weird changes" in profile histories and email timestamps.</li>
<li>At least 42 commenters reported remembering different values for the data they submitted, even after screenshots were presented.</li>
<li>Backend logs showed auto-merge of unrelated database entries due to emergent collision conditions.</li>
<li>Localized power grid fluctuations (0.3% voltage variance) correlated with peak comment engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aletheia Group initiated a coordinated DMCA takedown using a fake plagiarism complaint.</li>
<li>Metadata injection into discussion forums triggered AI moderation bans on 76 related threads under the “conspiracy theory” tag.</li>
<li>A synthetic leak of a different, unrelated cyber event was seeded to redirect attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: Incident fully suppressed. Affected platform issued non-anomalous explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8826 is the statistical phenomenon commonly referred to as the birthday paradox; specifically, the counterintuitive probability that in a group of █ or more individuals (despite falsified public models suggesting &gt;23 required), at least two will share an identical value within a bounded attribute space (e.g., calendar dates, user IDs, timestamps). Unlike its textbook representation, SCP-8826 is an active anomaly: when a matching attribute is recognized within such a group, physical systems begin exhibiting synchronized distortions consistent with a probabilistic resonance event. Such an event would result in a retroactive reduction of universal entropy, making all pseudorandom patterns more predictable.</p>
<p>Modern cryptographic systems rely heavily on pseudorandom data to seed key functions, making them catastrophically vulnerable to SCP-8826 manifestations. The phenomenon would cause massive keyspace reduction, transforming encryption algorithms theoretically capable of withstanding attacks from every computer on Earth working together for multiple lifetimes of the universe into trivially breakable codes that consumer hardware can crack in under sixty seconds. Such a vulnerability would most definitely result in a global infrastructure collapse within the first hour per Foundation projections.</p>
<p>The anomaly does not require malicious input or intelligent agency; it emerges solely from the act of consciously observing near-impossible overlaps in a statistically constrained field.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> A summary of the falsified statistical model can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" target="_blank">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
