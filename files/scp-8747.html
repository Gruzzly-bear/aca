<hr/>
<p>Humans have evolved since the dawn of humanity. The range and scope of our cognitive function and capabilities spans across the multiverse. From what was once a little spec, now to the warden who seals the anomalous, we are the dominant species who reign supreme across the globe thanks to the advancement of our species.</p>
<p>One of these advancements were the creation of technology; an irreplaceable aspect that runs within the heart and lungs of the Foundation. Prior to its creation, any rumor someone made about a video game or incident would be called an "Urban Legend" because nobody would be able to verify if the rumor was true, or not. Today, finding out the answer would be a simple Google search on your phone. Of course, this advancement has birthed more progressive and complex anomalies. Such anomalies can be <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000">invaluable</a> to our goals, others would be <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-245">laughable</a>, or even change how <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3959">the world could function</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of their nature, the core directive of our Foundation hasn't altered; the question is, what's the best way to respond to these anomalies? Contain, study, supress information, and above all, protect humanity from their existence. While these containment procedures yielded successful results, they do not, however, develop the complete cessation of further and current digital anomalies, as the Foundation possess no feasible method for that field of action.</p>
<p>This is where you come in; whoever you are, you know you've been an invaluable member the research and advancement of Foundation technology. Our objective is to manipulate digital anomalies on a conceptual level, and you are here to help with that goal. We are not just looking for people who have an answer to the unknown and work with what they do not understand. We're looking for those to who can shape the capabilities of what the Foundation can do, and inspire others to achieve the same.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Construct a Foundation-made eigenmachine, designated AO-8747, capable of altering the nature of digital anomalies, and potentially enact containment to GoI-6183 ("<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deleted">SCP Foundation Department of Deletions</a>").</p>
<p><strong>ELUCIDATION:</strong> Data regarding the ever-increasing number detailing computerized abnormalities, followed by higher demand of containment efforts, has led to analysis concerning means of amelioration. Additionally, GoI-6183 refers to a hostile group of interest comprising of extradimensional entities. This Group of Interest is believed has been responsible for the destruction of a Foundation timeline<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, in accordance with documentation gathered from multiversal Foundation sites.

<p><strong>PROCEDURE:</strong> Development of <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> will take place at the 10th basement level of Foundation Containment and Research facility, Site-19, to obtain a medium of security and secrecy from hostile Groups of Interest, as well as a feasible method of retrieving resources. Four Scranton Reality Anchors have been installed to protect construction from a potential CK-Class scenario. Once pre-development for <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> has been concluded, the following machinery must be implemented for <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong>'s continuation:</p>

<p>Schematic drawing for AO-8747.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SECTION A:</strong> Central Computing Node</p>
<p>AO-8747 will be manually operated by human cognitive and locomotive function. This engineering decision will enable personnel to access greater control and precision based on personal skepticism and professionalism. This also avoids non-human, automotive errors staff encountered from AI systems, and allow personnel to adjust to conditions that an Artificial Intelligence Conscript may fail to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION B:</strong> P. H. Ontokinetic Sink</p>
<p>The Placeholder Ontokinetic Sink will be added to read the sum of our reality's quantum informational content and converting said info into a comprehensive configuration, enabling AO-8747 and other connect systems to process and react data from our universe, whilst also allowing AO-8747 to access the Cybersphere.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION C:</strong> Dual Cylindrical-subconscious Transfer.</p>
<p>Two handpick subjects with surgically implanted Cognitive Adapters<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> will enter one of two of these devices. One inside and activated, their subconscious mind will be transferred to whatever esoteric medium AO-8747 has been selected; as of writing, AO-8747 is designed to specifically access the Cybersphere only.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION D:</strong> Resh-Norma Digital-rot Applicator.</p>
<p>Once the supposed extradimensional entities have been located, the RNDA will be manually operated by Foundation personnel to apply a conceptually application of accelerated digital rot towards the desired target. This process will result in selected data to be unusable, though this applied digital rot may result in Foundation or civilian computerized systems to become inoperable.</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Why are we this having this Summit again? I've already filed a report to the Overseers, yet I've received no response. I only think of this as a distraction from my own work.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> This Summit was an order by the Overseers, as they currently have their hands full right now; to recap, this was called upon to determine whether Dir. Roseanne should be disbarred from her position due to her unprofessional actions, or not.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> A direction that I heavily disagree on; I am, or at least was, responsible for leading <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong>. I know more about the ins and outs of AO-8747 more than anyone in this room. So, if you give me your unconditionally support-</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Support? You think you are the only here that needs "support", and no anyone else?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> That's not what I was trying to imply-</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Look at how much shit the Foundation has to clean-up because of <em>your</em> mess; over 500 hundred containment breaches of anomalies needing to be deleted, tech staff can't code because if they make a mistake, they won't be able to undo it, people are questioning what's going on, we're burning thousands of Foundation resources, do I need to remind you that some "account" is leaking info about the formation of an anomalous terrorist group in Spain?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> Before we proceed, I may recommend that Dir. Arezu try to relax before continuing.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> looks toward Dir. Arezu.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> Agree?</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> presses his temples.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Agree.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> then looks toward <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span>&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> Now, I share the same thoughts that several of our members possess; what made you, and O5-8 believe this Group of Interest was, specifically, at the Cybersphere in the first place?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> I can't speak for the intentions of O5-8, but what several Cybersphere staff and I believe, is that this group is comprised of "deleted data"- what I mean by that is it's possible this Group of Interest came from an extra-dimensional timeline, or timelines that were "overwritten" in some manner; wherever that "deleted data" went to, it's like the Cybersphere.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> So, you're not 100% sure whether this "Department of Deletions" is actually in the Cybersphere or not?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> … No.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> So why invest lots of Foundation resources to deal with a threat that you're not even sure of?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> It was a direct Overseer order. I had no say on the project's direction, other than leading <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> staff to its completion. Besides, it was an Apollyon-Class priority; does that speak for itself?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> It doesn't, however, mean we should disregard confirming whether the anomaly's there, or not.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> We? Who is this "we"? There was only me, staff, and Overseer. I don't recall you being involved.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Fair argument.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> What this all means is, you were either correct in believing that this extradimensional group of entities were in the Cybersphere or got it wrong and wasted Foundation resources on nothing.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> That's… That might be it.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> Regardless of whether this group was truly in the Cybersphere or not, the fact of the matter is that your actions were incredibly irresponsible and led to the creation of an anomaly impacting both civilian and Foundation technology. So, I want to ask you this; why should anyone trust you in continuing to the project if you are going to create results this disastrous?</p>
<p><em>&lt;There is silence in the transcript.»</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> I… I had no illicit intent. As stated earlier, I know the ins and outs of the project, more than anyone else, even some of the staff. I want to try, and work on fixing things.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Like how you worked on the PH OS?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> What do you mean?</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> pulls out a series of documents from his lab coat, and places them onto his table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> This is the latest report from maintenance staff working on AO-8747.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Where did you-</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> Just listen. In this report, they've conducted an inspected on the PH. OS, as it was the only part of AO-8747's schematics that didn't function properly; they've found out it was faulty, as during AO-8747's deactivation, the PH OS didn't because it was still trying to anchor itself and process data from the Cybersphere, whilst not registering the deactivation due to its faultiness. Therefore, this is another case of Foundation staff incompetence.</p>
<p><em>&lt;The room erupts with members berating over the discovery. <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> flinches.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> How, how come I wasn't briefed by this?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff2400"><strong>Dir. Arezu:</strong></span></span> I was having with a discussion with your staff about the matter and when I found out about what caused this disaster, the O4 Summit was scheduled to start in 40 minutes. I convinced them to hold-on to it, until the summit started.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> stands-up from her chair.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> But, but I can still fix this-</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4169e1"><strong>Dir. Calvin Bold:</strong></span></span> I believe you've "fixed" enough.</p>

<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> Due to the aftereffects of O5-8's actions, containment projects relating to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8474</span></span> must be approved by the O5 Council. All personnel, regardless of clearance and position, are welcome to provide their own proposals. Please note, many proposals have been omitted for brevity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Intentionally sever association with <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> within the Cybersphere via ontokinetic anomaly. (<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-239">SCP-239</a>)</p>
<p><strong>COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</strong> <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ffc60b">APPROVED</span></span> (6-4-2)</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Upon Overseer order, SCP-239 was allowed to be awoken from her medically induced coma. SCP-239 was then clarified about a "giant monster" affecting central computers, and was provided a brief description, casual description of <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> and -A. She was then instructed both anomalies to be erased from existence and non-Foundation lifeforms to lose recall of said anomalies.</p>
<p>SCP-239 commanded the anomaly to be removed from existence, only for Foundation staff to report no noticeable changes from computerized systems<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. Civilian populations and Groups of Interest worldwide lacked recall regarding <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>, only for the anomaly to be reported shortly after. This, however, has temporarily lessened Foundation resources in concealing the veil.</p>
<p>SCP-239 was re-contained shortly after.</p>

<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Engineer a machine capable of severing connections between our reality and the Cybersphere, thus invalidating <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>'s effects.</p>
<p><strong>COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</strong> <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff0000">DENIED</span></span> (4-8-0)</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><em>Even if this machine worked as intended, it would render all digital systems useless worldwide as we are too dependent on the Cybersphere's existence, hindering Foundation operations significantly. AIAD, IT, and relevant staff required for developing and maintaining Foundation technology would be rendered obsolete. Finally, civilian populations are highly likely to believe anomalous phenomenon should all digital systems become dysfunctional. - O5-3</em></p>

<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Establish contact or influence a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal/">hypernarrative entity</a> to contain/decommission <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</strong> <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ffc60b">APPROVED</span></span> (10-2-0)</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Five minutes following deployment of a specialized memetic agent into a medium containing high-energy narrative structures, O5-1 received a verified email from a SWN-001 entity, reading, "Do you guys ever learn from your mistakes?"</p>
<p>No further communication was received.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Create an ontokinetic eigenweapon, capable of encapsulating <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> in a dome-like medium, suppressing it's effects and potentially eradicating <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:</strong> <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ffc60b">APPROVED</span></span> (8-2-2)</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The proposed eigenweapon was created and <strong>PROJECT CYBERPSHERE</strong> staff confirmed it's intended, functional use of encapsulating <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span>; however, it was later discovered the capsule had no effect of suppressing it's effect. 20 minutes following usage, the capsule housing <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> began to "corrupt" and 1 minute later, <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span>'s size has increased by approximately 5km in diameter. Reports of more digital systems rendered inoperable were followed.</p>
<p>Future similar proposals will not be accepted.</p>

<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> One D-Class is to be surgically implanted with a Cognitive Adapter within their cerebellum. He is then to be provided false information of <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> and directed into AO-8747's subconscious transfer device. From there, he is instructed to traverse to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> and vocalize infohazardous data of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2521">●●|●●●●●|●●|●</a>, theoretically inducing a hostile attack onto it's position.</p>

<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><em>While a creative theory, it is likely that ●●|●●●●●|●●|● will not attack <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> itself, and instead attack the D-Class. Furthermore, there is even the possibility that ●●|●●●●●|●●|● will be virulent towards AO-8747's structure, which cannot be allowed as it is one of the few methods the Foundation possess of accessing the Cybersphere. - O5-7</em></p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Okay, look, the O4 voted to kick you out of the project, but so what? You've still got a job here.</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> You've got my support, Rose. Is there anything I can do that'll make you feel better?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Well, I've looked at the full file for the 8747 containment attempts; surprisingly, none of them work. I've already sent my own proposal, but I haven't heard from the Council since.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> I, I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Don't be, it's not your fault.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> But I was involved, wasn't I?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Yeah, but because of me and the O5's; speaking of which, I haven't heard from that bastard Eight for a while.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> What about him?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> I'll get to that later, but for now, you said you want to help me, right?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Yeah. Do you want me to get you a snack, coffee, or…</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> How about this; you take this proposal I have and send it to the <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> staff about it, okay? Maybe they'll respond to you sooner, since people here care more about you.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> You know they don't accept duplicate proposals, right?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> So, how about I just, rephrase it and it'll work.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Why are you even doing this, Rose? I find that unprofessional from a Department Head.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne</strong></span></span> leans forward, her arms now rest on her desk.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Listen, Parker. My face and name are spread all over Foundation news, even outside of our universe, as the biggest bitch the Foundation's ever hired. And during this, I've called Eight <em>many times</em> about how I could get out of this, and he's ignored me since the project went to shit. You know what that means?</p>
<p><em>«Silence again.»</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> It means he just left me on the dust and out there doing God knows what, and I even could wind-up losing my job here; someone could easily say, "Overseers, this bitch who was the cause of your system's fuckups is not fit for the role Containment Director", and they'll be like, "Alright, let's fire this whore".</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Don't say that about yourself.</p>
<p><em><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> wipes a tear from her eye.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> I'm sorry, I just… I hate. Hate it so much. This project idea was such a horrible idea, I never should've accepted the offer.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Hey, hey. It's okay. I don't blame you. You were just following orders and we know what happens when you don't listen to an Overseer.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Fuck the Overseers.</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #4dff4d"><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong></span></span> Oh, and don't worry too much about losing your job because of this, too; we've seen <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6747">worse after all</a>, yet they still work here, so I don't see why you would not. And if they do try fire you for this, we could say, "Overseers, if you think she should be fired, why does this man with a ridiculous name still work here, despite the trouble he almost caused?"</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne</strong></span></span> bursts into laughter.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff00d4"><strong>Dir. Roseanne:</strong></span></span> Oh yeah, good luck arguing that.</p>

<p><em>&lt;Footage depicts O5-8 sitting in-front of his desk, with the two-armed officers standing behind him. Omar is sitting on the opposite end of O5-8, as the two guards mirror the ones upfront.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Hold on, hold on, hold on. Stop for a moment, I didn't understand. You want me to what?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Plead guilty to what happened on the project. That way, we could negotiate a reduced sentence between us and the Ethics.</p>
<p><em>&lt;For a moment, <span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8</strong></span></span> tilts his head slightly to the ground in annoyance as he slowly raises his right palm in the air. He then raises his head to face Omar, his arm descending down.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Listen, I didn't bring you here to tell me to incriminate myself about <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> and let the Ethics take a shit on me. I told you to help me get out of this, because I got 12 other people wanting me gone for good, and nobody else wants to help me, but you. So please, give me that.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8</strong></span></span> leans back on his chair&gt;.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Review the case properly, figure out whatever decision that nobody else could come up, testify for me, do something.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Testify to what? I wasn't even involved.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Well, you could say that someone or something, like some outside anomaly sabotaged the entire thing, and maybe with that, I'll get less of the blame.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> That's deceptive, Overseer, and we both know that won't work- but, I'll try to "review the case properly", as you've instructed.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> pulls out a pen from his pocket, and shuffles with his sheaf of papers.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Where were you during the failure of <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong>?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> In my office, doing paperwork and waiting for updates from Roseanne.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Do you suspect Dir. Roseanne had anything to do with this?</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> looks down on his desk&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Not really.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Did you, and Dir. Roseanne ever performed previous tests and maintenance check-ups of AO-8747 to see if there were any deficiencies?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> No.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Do you believe that lack of maintenance check was what led to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> being created in the first place?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Yeah, but-</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> So that's the issue, more evidence that you, the one who ordered AO-8747 to be constructed, are responsible for the creation of <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> and -A; normally, these kinds of ambitious projects needs all of the Overseers to vote, but because it was an Apollyon-Class priority, you and the rest of the Council decided it was okay to only allow one. Not to mention, you are an Overseer responsible for overseeing Foundation projects, so to have someone like you take the role of that kind is questionable.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Speaking of which, we both know the remaining Overseers are going to vote on whether they should kick you out, or not for that matter. The only ones who can overrule that are the Ethics Committee, and Administrator, which is unlikely they'll side with you because most of the Ethics Committee are working hard to make sure you are punished for what happened and figuring out who could take your place. More than 300 sites can't even work properly because of what you've caused, and more than a thousand digital anomalies have experienced containment difficulties thanks to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>, so from here on out, <em>you have to plead guilty to the Ethics Committee</em>.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> places both of his hands onto his face, as his elbows are placed onto the desk to provide support. He lifts off his right arm and points it towards Omar&gt;.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> You are very close to getting kicked out of <em>my</em> office, Amandi. Tell me you have at least something that I can work with, or leave before my guards do it for you.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> You could also go recommend a vote to go with Dir. Roseanne's idea to the Overseers, since you can overrule the O4's decision.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Why should I do that? You know most of everyone's opinions are not on our side.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Since when did an Overseer care about what people think of them?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> Omar…</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Okay, okay. Well, there isn't much of a choice for the Foundation to deal with containing <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> itself, so the idea reprogramming AO-8747 to repair the Cybersphere isn't out of the question thanks to it's systems and hardware. Lots of engineers are constructing their own machines to deal with the anomaly, but why make a brand-new machine when we already have one?</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8</strong></span></span> lets out a chuckle.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #395e7f"><strong>O5-8:</strong></span></span> That's the best idea I've ever heard from you, Omar; using AO-8747 that caused <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>, to fix <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>. Love it.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Joke about it all you want. It's not going to get you anywhere, just like your idea of lying to the Ethics Committee. As dumb as it sounds, it's still a possibility that it could work and when we're in a situation where were spending millions a day just to keep the public hush-hush about what's going on, we need to explore every idea we have.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #b49f60"><strong>Omar Amandi:</strong></span></span> Remember, Roseanne's involved because you made her. If there's anyone at all who could show some sort of compassion- and who knows, get a <em>lesser sentence</em> thanks to said compassion- it's you.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Based on evidence gathered, security footage, and testimonies of <strong>PROJECT CYBERSPHERE</strong> staff, it is the opinion of the O5 Council that O5-8 has majorly violated extensive Foundation policies, specifically those detailing Foundation project management and safety requirements, which led to the formation of an <span class="bt"><span style="color: #db5000">EKHI-</span></span>Class anomaly, resulting in the containment breach of over 1,000 digital anomalies and near collapse of the veil. As such, the O5 Council has deemed O5-8 to be unfit for an Overseer role and must be preemptively replaced. Below contains a summarized vote regarding O5-8's position.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As the vote is directed towards a Foundation Overseer, O5-8's vote will not be considered.</p>

<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Despite attempted negotiations, O5-8 failed to appeal his removal and demotion to the Ethics Committee. O5-8 will not be allowed to return to Overseer status, regardless of his contribution and improvement prior to D-Class demotion. During afterward discussions following the Council vote, O5-8 recommend the Foundation approve of Dir. Roseanne's proposal.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>INTENT:</strong> Eradicate <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span>'s current nature, thereby neutralizing the anomaly, and anomalously repair its sector to pre-<span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span> status. This requires re-engineering of AO-8747's mechanics and functionality, whilst omitting usage of human sub-conscious transfer.</p>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> By eradicating <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span>, and repairing its sector within the Cybersphere, <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>'s effects will be invalidated. Though while this is a hypothesis, the accurate outcome of <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747-A</span></span>'s eradication is uncertain; therefore, all IT, technical, and AIAD personnel must commence preparations for misplaced scenarios by this attempt.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Decommission attempt successful; Foundation computerized systems are now able to successfully overwrite undesired data prior to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span>'s effects. Furthermore, future Foundation projects involving manipulation of the Cybersphere has been indefinitely suspended, with the exception of unanimous approval by the O5 Council.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #52a3cc">SCP-8747</span></span> is pending reclassification to NEUTRALIZED by the Classification Committee.</p>
