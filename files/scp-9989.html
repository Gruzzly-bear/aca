<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-9989’s approximate location near Point Nemo.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9989</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A T-Class unmanned submersible piloted remotely by Kira.aic has been dispatched to SCP-9989’s location with instructions to continuously monitor the anomaly and log any notable activity. Foundation Vessel <em>Merina</em> will travel to SCP-9989’s location every 6 months to provide the submersible with maintenance and upkeep. Kira.aic is to send regular reports regarding SCP-9989’s activity to Lead Researcher Umezu at Site-110 Command. In the event of a new SCP-9989-A emergence, Dr. Umezu must be contacted immediately.</p>
<p>A potential plan for the neutralization of SCP-9989 is currently under consideration. Until such a decision is reached, however, it is imperative that those down below are disregarded and forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9989 is an anomalous chain of salps<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> located approximately 19 km southeast of Point Nemo<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> in the southern Pacific Ocean. While typical salps will generally float freely through open waters, SCP-9989 appears to be anchored at one end to a singular object further below, with the rest of the chain rising vertically from this point. SCP-9989’s upper end is located approximately 1,200 m below the ocean’s surface.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Since its discovery, SCP-9989 has remained fixed in this location.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="NormalSalp.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9989/NormalSalp.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>An example of a non-anomalous salp chain found off the coast of Oregon, USA.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Current measurements have determined that SCP-9989 is at least 1,400 m long, though environmental conditions have impeded Foundation efforts to traverse deep enough to calculate its full length. Even so, the current measured length alone already exceeds that of any non-anomalous salp chain by several orders of magnitude.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> SCP-9989’s true length is presently unknown, and its lower end has not yet been observed.</p>
<p>Testing on samples of SCP-9989 has revealed that the individual salps (SCP-9989-A) are genetically identical to the common salp.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> Visually, however, SCP-9989 is anomalous in the sense that every instance on the chain resembles a human head.</p>
<p>While the length of an individual non-anomalous common salp zooid rarely exceeds 5 cm, the size of each SCP-9989-A instance is to scale with a typical human head. They are oriented in such a way that they are always facing upwards, with the mouth of each instance wide open and tightly pressed upon the occipital area<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> of the instance directly above them. Instances appear to possess eyes, teeth, and hair; however, there is only tissue resembling skin where a neck would normally be.</p>
<p>Testing has determined all SCP-9989-A instances to be genetically identical. Even so, every observed instance is entirely unique in appearance, with the chain as a whole representing a wide range of variation and diversity in regards to facial features, age, and gender.</p>
<p>Additionally, instances of SCP-9989-A are capable of vocalization, despite the apparent lack of the necessary organs to facilitate speech. Because the mouths of most instances are constantly pressed up against the instance above them, these vocalizations are completely unintelligible. The one exception is the instance at the very top of the chain (SCP-9989-A1).</p>
<p>SCP-9989-A1 resembles the head of a man in his late 40’s or early 50’s. Ever since its discovery, SCP-9989-A1 has continually vocalized various phrases in a distressed tone. Though its speech is technically comprehensible, researchers have so far been unable to decipher any discernible meaning or logical construction behind its words.</p>

<p>T-Class Submersible <em>YG-0</em> prior to its deployment to SCP-9989.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because of SCP-9989’s isolated location, extensive containment measures were deemed unnecessary. Instead, a T-Class unmanned submersible (designation <em>YG-0</em>) was dispatched to the location under the control of Kira.aic, a prototype AIC specially designed to study and assist in management of marine anomalies and lifeforms. Kira.aic was instructed to monitor SCP-9989 for any notable behavior, as well as to analyze SCP-9989-A1’s vocalizations for any possible meaning.</p>
<p>Kira.aic is housed locally on secure Foundation servers at Site-110 and pilots the <em>YG-0</em> remotely. A consequence of this arrangement is that Kira.aic cannot pilot the submersible beyond a depth of approximately 2,600 m without risking a loss of connection with the <em>YG-0</em>.</p>
<h3 id="toc0"><span><strong>Addendum 9989-1:</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 2025/01/12, two months after deployment, Kira.aic requested to speak with Dr. Umezu about SCP-9989.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Conversation Log — 2025/01/12</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> What is this about? You usually just send an email when you have an update.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Apologies, sir. I just thought that it might be easier to tell you this directly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Well, go on then. What exactly is it that you need to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Of course, sir. To put it simply, I think I discovered something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Really? Were you finally able to parse that bizarre thing’s ramblings?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Unfortunately that’s not it sir. You see, I was going through some public records, and—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Hold on? I don’t remember asking you to do that. Why are you acting out of scope?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I was acting beyond the scope of your instructions, yes. But not beyond my overall directive. Please remember that I was also designed to engage in the study of marine lifeforms. And currently the only notable lifeform at my location is… well… SCP-9989.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> As such, I did a bit of extra analysis. All in conjunction with the duties you delegated to me of course.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Fine… please tell me, what did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, sir. Like I said, I was going through some public records, and I believe I found a match.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> A match?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes. For SCP-9989-A1.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> I’m not following.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Its face. It’s a real person. There’s a real, actual human being with the same face.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Wait, are you serious? The same face? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Here, I’ll send the details right now.</p>
<p><em>[There is a ping on Dr. Umezu’s terminal as he receives Kira.aic’s message. He opens the file and begins reading.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Hmm… Dr. Jonathan Woodward. Born 1928. Graduated from Harvard in 1949. Earned a PhD in Chemistry a few years later. Eventually became a professor at MIT until he died in a vehicle collision in 1974…</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:300px;"><img alt="ProfWoodward.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9989/ProfWoodward.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">

<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> The picture looks just like A1, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Yes, it actually does. But…</p>
<p><em>[He throws up his hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Well, why the hell does a salp in the middle of the Pacific Ocean have an identical face to an American chemist who’s been dead for half a century?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m unable to provide an explanation for that at the moment.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …but I might know someone who can.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Kira.aic explained that while Dr. Woodward was at MIT, he served as an academic advisor to Alan Hastings, who would go on to join the Foundation. Dr. Hastings was summoned to Site-110, though, due to health complications resulting from his advanced age, the meeting was delayed. During their eventual meeting, Dr. Hastings was able to confirm SCP-9989-A1’s resemblance to Dr. Woodward.</p>
<p>The next day, he insisted that he be allowed to speak to it.</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><span><strong>Addendum 9989-2:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Dr. Hastings’ request for an interview was ultimately approved under the hope that, however unlikely, his presence might elicit a coherent response from SCP-9989-A1. The interview was conducted remotely, with Dr. Woodward at Site-110, viewing SCP-9989-A1 through the <em>YG-0’s</em> camera feed.</p>

<p><em>[SCP-9989-A1 immediately goes silent. Its expression becomes strained as it looks into the camera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-A1:</strong> …Alan? Alan, is that… is that you?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> Dr. Woodward, what happened to you!? What are you doing all the way down there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-A1:</strong> Alan Hastings… you… it’s been so long… I don’t understand. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> Please, Dr. Woodward, you taught me everything I know. You were an inspiration to me. I— I wouldn’t be the man I am today if it wasn’t for you. Let us help you!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-A1:</strong> …no. No, no, no! You need to leave. Climb down, now! Leave me and forget me! DESCEND AND DO NOT FOLLOW.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> I don’t understand.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> I think we’ve seen enough. Shut off the feed, Kira.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><em>[The feed is cut. Dr. Hastings slumps down into a chair and begins to rub his temples.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> I have so many questions…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> That’s normal in our line of work, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> Do you think you can save him? The man was my mentor.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu shrugs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Our job is to contain the thing, not to liberate it. You of all people should know that — considering how long you’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> I— I understand, yes, but… I can’t just leave him down there to suffer.</p>
<p><em>[He turns to the terminal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> Kira, was it? Is there anything you can do to free him from that thing? To let him be put to rest?</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m sorry, my directive is in line with what Dr. Umezu stated. My duties regarding the anomaly are limited to study and containment.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hastings lowers his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> I… yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That being said, it is possible that continued study may reveal the need and the means to intervene. In which case, there might be something I could do to help your former advisor.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Hastings looks up again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Kira, be careful about making promises we might not be able to keep.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hastings:</strong> No, it’s okay. Just hearing that reassurance, even if nothing comes from it — it’s put me greatly at ease. Thank you, Kira.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Kira, you really shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Done what, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Gotten his hopes up. The old sod’s got one foot in the grave already, what if the eventual disappointment that we never do anything about A1 is what finally does him in?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You think I gave him false hope?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Not just false, but unnecessary. We don’t even know whether that thing actually <em>is</em> Woodward, after all. It could be some ungodly imitation for all we know.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That’s true, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Then why did you tell Hastings you could save him?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m sorry. I only intended to convey that — in the event that A1 turns out to be Dr. Woodward — there is at least a <em>possibility</em> we can free him from SCP-9989.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> But is it really worth mentioning if that possibility is highly unlikely?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Let me think… are people really being added to this thing after death? If so, we need to figure out how and why. Especially if Foundation staff are getting pulled in.</p>
<p><em>[He looks at the terminal.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Kira, I want you to go down the chain as far as you can. Identify as many people as possible and see if you can find any patterns that might explain why they’re down there. In the meantime, I’m going to look into revising our containment procedures. We need to figure this out before anyone else ends up down there.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, sir. I’ll get to it right away.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> I’ve finished going through your report. That was some good work.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Thank you. Were you able to see the pattern with those people?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu nods.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Practically everyone on the chain had some sort of connection to those directly above and below them. Most of the pairs clearly knew each other — or at least there was reasonable evidence that they likely met at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Still, there were some where there wasn’t an explicit connection. But those seemed to typically involve someone powerful or famous.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I noticed that too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> There’s got to be some sort of connection in those cases too, right?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I believe I have a hypothesis regarding that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Well, it’s possible that each person on the chain was strongly influenced or inspired by the the one directly beneath them. In a formative sense, that is.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> You mean their worldview was shaped in some way by the next person down?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Precisely. Dr. Hastings said he wouldn’t be who he was without Dr. Woodward’s guidance as an academic advisor. And Woodward probably had a similar relationship with his schoolteacher.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> So if it’s about influence, it’s not required that a connected pair knew each other personally. A politician or an artist could drastically affect the direction of someone else’s life almost in the same way a close friend or a mentor could.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Exactly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> But that means we now have someone from the Foundation at the very top of the chain. That’s a big problem for us.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, with Dr. Hastings’ long tenure at the Foundation, there’s no telling how many people’s lives he might have touched.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> For all we know, it could be a random civilian he regurgitates when the time comes. Or it could be some jackass whose office I walk by every morning.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Is there anything you would like me to do?</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Continue monitoring the ones at the top for now, and I’ll get back to you. I’m going to see if I can get some more hands on this.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Understood, sir.</p>

<p>At 19:12 on 2025/05/24, Site-19 suffered a serious containment breach resulting in numerous fatalities. Among them were several members of the Anomalous Chemicals Research Team. Dr. Hastings served on this team for decades.</p>
<p>Kira.aic confirmed that about 24 hours following the breach, the top SCP-9989-A instance opened its mouth and a new instance emerged. This new instance bore a strong resemblance to Senior Researcher Felicia Nguyen, who served under Dr. Hastings for a number of years.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Conversation Log — 2025/06/29</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Not a problem, doctor. Based on what you’ve written in SCP-9989‘s file, it seems like you really could use the extra help.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> We greatly appreciate the support, sir.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, it’s nice to see you again. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Thank you, I’ve been well, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Wait, you two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> What? You don’t know? Number 4 here is the one who created Kira.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu’s eyes go wide.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Hold on, you’re telling me you were made by an O5!? This whole time, I’ve been working with an O5’s AI!?</p>
<p><em>[O5-4 laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Well, I came to this position from AIAD,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> and I’ve continued working closely with them over the years. Kira here has been a special project of mine for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> The way she talks about Kira, you’d think Number 4 here was her mom.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> <em>(to Dr. Umezu)</em> I apologize, sir. I didn’t say anything, because it was above your clearance level.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu holds a bewildered expression.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> I- I don’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> But enough about that. Let’s get to SCP-9989. Sounds like it’s been a real handful.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Yes, especially after what happened with Researcher Reyes. Have you been able to determine what happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> All we know for certain right now is that he was down there in the sub when Kira left for the surface and when she got back, both him and the sub were gone.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Any theories then on what <em>could</em> have happened?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Well, we’ve observed that every new SCP-9989-A instance appears approximately 24 hours after their likeness passes away, which suggests that Reyes was likely killed some time between his last check-in and my return.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> In an environment like that, there’s no shortage of ways things could become deadly very quickly. The sub itself likely sank to the seafloor after its pilot was killed.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> That’s a reasonable enough explanation, but there’s still the pattern you described. The one related to formative influence. The instance right below Reyes is the one that looks like Dr. Nguyen. As far as I know, the two never even met; they worked in completely different departments. How did he end up there despite this?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, that is the part we haven’t been able to work out yet. The only thing I can say for sure is that Reyes is the first human I know of who came face-to-face with the anomaly directly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> All observation up to this point has been through remote surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> So the thing follows a different set of rules if a person is physically down there with it? That shouldn’t be hard to avoid at least, seeing as it’s in the middle of nowhere in the goddamn ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Yes, but even so, we still believe SCP-9989 poses enough of a threat that we wanted to ask if—</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You want to destroy it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Well, more like trim it down. We can remove the uppermost instances until we get to some poor forgotten soul and leave them as the new top of the chain. This way, we may be able to prevent any new instances from forming. At the very least, getting rid of the Foundation staff instances would decrease the likelihood of any of <em>us</em> ending up there.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sounds reasonable enough to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Oh? That’s excellent.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Though I am curious as to <em>how</em> you intend to remove those guys. You got a plan at all?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Well, based on the footage we captured of the new SCP-9989-As’ formation process, the salps appear to possess human <em>external</em> biology but largely lack their <em>internal</em> biology, which appears to be more salp-like. If this is the case, it may simply be a matter of—</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You want to poke them and make them pop like a water balloon.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Umezu pauses.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> That’s one way to put it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sounds simple enough. I think we can make that work. What do you think, 4?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> I’m afraid I’m not quite convinced yet. Destroying an anomaly, even a small part of it, is not something we should take lightly. I’d like to hear a little more of your reasoning, Dr. Umezu.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Right, of course. To start with, it’s troubling that SCP-9989 can seemingly pull anyone on the planet and add them to its chain based on this concept of influence. But we’re now facing an especially serious problem in that Foundation members have started to appear on the chain. With the global reach of our organization, there’s no telling how many of us might end up down there. In which case, it would be pertinent to prevent any more of us from meeting the same fate and to alleviate the suffering of our peers already below.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Assuming those actually <em>are</em> the people they resemble.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> A fair point. But even if they are mere imitations, in the span of a few months, we’ve seen the chain add 3 new instances. If the anomaly truly does present additional unknown dangers when physically near a human, we might be facing a greater threat in the distant future if the chain ever becomes long enough to reach the surface — or to make landfall.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> And now that it’s managed to breach the Foundation, with its… uh… occasionally <em>hazardous</em> work environment, that day might arrive sooner than we’d like.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Hmm…. I’m still not sure abut this. Kira, you’ve been awfully quiet. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> As Dr. Umezu is SCP-9989’s lead researcher, I believe it is proper to defer to his judgment.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Deference is certainly a respectable response, yes. But I’d like to hear you also speak your mind. I gave you one for a reason, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Of course, ma’am. I apologize ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> So, what do you think about trimming SCP-9989?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Well… the risk of SCP-9989 imminently reaching the surface is still fairly low. And logically speaking, there’s still too much we don’t know about SCP-9989 that destroying any part of it doesn’t seem entirely prudent just yet. Not until we can gather more data — determine what exactly happened to Reyes, for example.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> I find myself in agreement. There’s still simply too many unknowns.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> However…</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I have been watching these faces for over 6 months now. Day in and day out. I’ve analyzed their expressions, the noises they make. And…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Whether they’re real or imitations, they’re suffering. And I’m having difficulty setting aside the desire to put them out of their misery while we continue gathering more data.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Interesting…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> So to answer your question about what I think we should do: I don’t know.</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause for a moment before O5-1 begins to laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Well, isn’t that something, Number 4? Your super-advanced AIC is feeling indecisive.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> You joke, but this is actually the kind of response I hoped to hear.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> But… you said you agreed with me when I expressed concern at there being too many unknowns.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> And that’s still my position. But I’m willing to put the matter of up for a vote. Though I will be personally voting against such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sounds good to me. We’ll let you both know how it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Umezu:</strong> Oh, that’s great to hear! Thank you both very much.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Of course. But Kira, if the authorization does go through, I hope that you will exercise your best judgment on how to proceed. And that, whatever you decide to do, make sure you learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …</p>

<p>The moment the harpoon pierced SCP-9989-PRIME, Dr. Umezu’s head — starting with his temple — burst open in an explosion of what was later determined to be salt water. Witnesses report that upon falling to the ground, Dr. Umezu’s head appeared deflated and absent of any organs aside from skin, eyeballs, and teeth. During the autopsy, doctors collected a sample of this skin for testing.</p>
<p>It was a genetic match for the common salp.</p>
<p>SCP-9989-PRIME was observed to reconstitute itself within an hour of its supposed destruction. The next day, an SCP-9989-A instance resembling Dr. Umezu emerged and became the new SCP-9989-PRIME.</p>

<p><em>[Silence on the recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> So, you blew up your boss’s head.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Don’t be. It’s not like anyone could have predicted <em>that</em>. You think it was some kind of defense mechanism?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Possibly. It would certainly account for the break in the pattern with Reyes. If he did something to destroy the current PRIME instance when he was in the DSV, then that would explain his death, the sinking of the submersible, and his appearance on SCP-9989.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Looks like we’ve discovered something important about SCP-9989 from this experience.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I suppose. But… Dr. Umezu didn’t destroy the PRIME instance himself. He delegated the authority to me. I’m the one who did it, so why did it get him?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Well, the chain only contains <em>human</em> heads. Since you’re an AI, I guess you don’t count. Maybe it saw you simply as a tool that Umezu was using to attack it, so it went for him instead.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …that’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> In any case, I think we should put a pin on any further destruction attempts. If destroying them directly causes a head explosion, and delegating a non-human to do it also causes a head explosion, it’s probably best to focus on preventing any future additions to the chain instead.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> And how exactly would we do that? Dr. Umezu was a senior researcher with many significant contributions during his time with the Foundation. I’m sure he’s left his mark on more than a few of our number.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Could we just amnesticize everyone and remove him from all records? Make it like he never existed?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It’s doubtful, sir. If we’re talking about formative influence, that’s something far deeper than simple memory. You could forget someone entirely but still be shaped in some way by your interactions with them.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Fair enough. But then what should the next move be?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Why not just find someone who’s left no footprint on society and have them become the new PRIME instance? Put a cap on the bottle, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> If such a person exists, then that may work to prevent any further instances from appearing. It wouldn’t do anything to help those already there, but it would at least give me time for further study.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Works for me. We can probably scrounge up a really nasty D-Class somewhere that fits the bill. Just keep an eye on PRIME until we get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Understood, sir.</p>
<p><em>[O5-1 leaves the room. O5-4 prepares to leave as well but then stops.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> One more thing, Kira. Could you tell me what you learned from this last test?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …I’m not sure I follow, ma’am. As we discussed a few minutes ago, it’s possible some anomalous defense mechanism—</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> That’s not what I’m asking. I want to know what <em>lesson</em> you took away from this.</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That actions have consequences? Doubly so when anomalies are involved?</p>
<p><em>[Another pause. Eventually, O5-4 smiles. She turns and begins to walk out of the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> We’ll let you know once we’ve found our new PRIME instance.</p>

<p>SCP-9989-PRIME soon returned to its prior incoherent vocalizations. It has not regained lucidity since.</p>
<h3 id="toc13"><span><strong>Addendum 9989-14:</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 2025/07/28, a suitable candidate was identified to serve as the new SCP-9989-PRIME. D-79235, convicted of [REDACTED], was chosen due to an absence of any living associates or victims. He was sent to Site-110, where Kira.aic granted him manual control of the <em>YG-0</em> to destroy SCP-9989-PRIME. As expected, D-79235’s head was destroyed simultaneously to SCP-9989-PRIME. SCP-9989-PRIME regenerated within an hour, and the next day, D-79235 emerged as the new PRIME instance.</p>
<p>Kira.aic reported that the new instance immediately began vocalizing upon appearance, as was consistent with established behavior. It was also reported, however, that this SCP-9989-PRIME’s speech was much quieter and slower than that of all prior instances.</p>

<p><em>[SCP-9989-PRIME mutters quietly, the voice too soft to be intelligible.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I don’t know what it is, but…</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> What is it, Kira?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Well, I’ve been monitoring this new instance for a while now, and it seems… <em>angrier</em> than the others?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Angrier?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> As in, all the former PRIME instances, they all looked distressed most of the time, but this one, not only has it been quieter, but it’s also—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-PRIME:</strong> See me.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-PRIME:</strong> SEE ME.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I think it’s PRI—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-PRIME:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEE ME SEE ME SEE ME</span>—</p>
</div>
<p>At this time, SCP-9989 began oscillating back and forth with increasing speed. This behavior coincided with alerts from Foundation seismographs reporting rapidly escalating seismic activity originating from SCP-9989’s location.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, we’re getting some very troubling readings from SCP-9989. What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It’s getting louder, and it’s—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9989-PRIME begins to rapidly ascend.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It’s rising!</p>
<p><em>[Kira.aic pilots the YG-0 to keep up with SCP-9989, keeping SCP-9989-PRIME in its camera’s view.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> How is it rising? That’s not something we’ve seen before.</p>
<p><em>[Kira.aic briefly turns the YG-0’s camera down. In the distance, scattered pairs of lower SCP-9989-A instances can be seen seemingly separating from one another. As the camera’s focus adjusts, it becomes evident that the instances are laughing as they extend and stretch their tongues to unnatural lengths. Each tongue remains attached to the back of the next head up, acting as tethers to ensure instances remain connected as they spread apart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It looks like we have our answer.</p>
<p><em>[The YG-0’s camera returns to SCP-9989-PRIME. It has somehow inflated considerably in size, the stretched “skin” giving the face a deformed and bloated appearance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9989-PRIME:</strong> —<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEE ME KNOW ME REMEMBER ME HATE ME CURSE ME</span>—</p>
<p><em>[The camera captures SCP-9989-PRIME’s eyes as they start to bulge out of their sockets. In another moment, they pop free of the orbital cavities entirely, remaining attached to the anomalously extended optic nerves as they chaotically whip around through the water. Numerous fleshy tendrils erupt from all its other orifices and begin to thrash about.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> The seismographs are going out of control. At this rate, we could be dealing with massive tsunamis on both sides of the Pacific. Why is SCP-9989-PRIME acting up like this?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I think… we put someone with no impact on the world at the top of the chain. The chain didn’t like that, and so now it’s going to help PRIME leave its mark on as many people as possible.</p>
<p><em>[Faint traces of natural light have begun to shine through the water. SCP-9989-PRIME and the YG-0 are reaching the upper bounds of the bathypelagic zone. The sound of laughter from the SCP-9989-A instances reverberates through the water.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Hold tight, Kira. We’ve got some people on their way to try and contain the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> We can’t wait that long, ma’am. Dr. Umezu said it can’t reach the surface.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> What are you planning, Kira?</p>
<p><em>[The YG-0 raises the arm equipped with the harpoon.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, don’t you dare!</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m sorry, ma’am.</p>

<p><em>[The harpoon fires.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>At 16:32 local time, Kira.aic fired the <em>YG-0’s</em> harpoon at the SCP-9989-A instance immediately below SCP-9989-PRIME.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup> The instance was ripped apart from the impact. SCP-9989-PRIME, now disconnected from the rest of SCP-9989, ceased its ascent before violently bursting into pieces. The remainder of the chain similarly ceased movement. After a moment it began to retract, sinking further into the depths once more.</p>
<p>Two SCP-9989-A instances were destroyed during this incident. Neither one regenerated. Furthermore, there were no Foundation casualties.</p>

<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> So, you decided to blow up your boss’s head a second time. Guess once just wasn’t enough for you.</p>
<p><em>[He laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …I’m sorry. With all the tendrils, it didn’t seem possible to hit the PRIME instance. So I went to the next one down.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Even though I <em>specifically</em> told you not to.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Well, I mean, it worked didn’t it? Those two salps never came back, and no one else lost their head.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, and I believe it’s because the decision to destroy the instances was mine and mine alone. I was not acting with the approval or authorization of any humans. And since I am personally unaffected by SCP-9989, there was no one else the anomaly’s effect could reach.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> It was still a reckless risk.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> And it was also the only option, ma’am.</p>
<p><em>[O5-1 begins to laugh again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Looks like your kid’s getting a little rebellious, Number 4.</p>
<p><em>[O5-4 sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> We’ll get back to that later. For now, let’s look at where we stand with SCP-9989. D-79235 and Dr. Umezu are gone, so if my recollection is correct, that would leave Reyes as our PRIME instance again.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That would be correct, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Then that means we still have the problem of someone from the Foundation being at the top of the chain.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It’d be nice if we could keep our authorization revoked and just have Kira pop the rest of them anyway. But I figure the chain would probably see right past that kind of two-faced trickery and blow up our heads regardless.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Well, if Umezu was right about needing to stop SCP-9989 from reaching the surface, then I think we need to move beyond the pussyfooting and half-measures. If we <em>were</em> to neutralize this thing, we’d need to do it all in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> We’d need to take it out at the root… which would require finally traveling to the bottom of the chain.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sure, but we can’t get the submersible that far down. Not without losing connection with it.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That’s true…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Unless…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Later that day, O5-4 received a message from Kira.aic:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>I’ll be gone for a while, ma’am. I think it’s time I fixed this.</em></p>
<p><em>Please don’t be too mad at me.</em></p>
</div>
<p>O5-4 attempted to contact Kira.aic, but was unsuccessful. After launching an investigation, it was discovered that Kira.aic had offloaded its essential components entirely onto the <em>YG-0</em>, which had similarly become unresponsive.</p>
<p>The <em>Merina</em> was quickly dispatched to SCP-9989’s location, though it took the vessel two weeks to arrive. A DSV was sent down to the bathypelagic zone, but the <em>YG-0</em> could not be located.</p>
<p>Neither could SCP-9989.</p>

<p>On 2025/12/01, approximately 3 months after Kira.aic’s last communication, Foundation monitoring stations in Antarctica picked up a signal from the <em>YG-0</em> off the coast of the unclaimed Antarctic territory of Marie Byrd Land.</p>
<p>Researchers in the region were sent to recover the submersible. Upon arrival, they discovered Kira.aic was still active and functional, claiming it had important news to report.</p>
<p>SCP-9989 had been destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Conversation Log - 2025/12/02</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You really managed to destroy it? The whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, sir. SCP-9989 has been successfully neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> You really did it…</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> <em>How</em> did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It was relatively simple. Our last conversation made it clear that if I really wanted to destroy it, I would have to do so from the root.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> But you couldn’t get the <em>YG-0</em> down there without losing your connection to the submersible. Which is why you offloaded yourself to it. So you could operate it locally.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> That’s correct, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Well, what did you find down there? At the bottom of the chain?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> For a while, I wasn’t sure there <em>was</em> a bottom. I ended up following the chain down to a depth of about 10,000 meters before I finally reached the seafloor.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> 10,000 meters? Those kinds of depths should only be possible in oceanic trenches. In fact, that’s not terribly far behind the lowest part of the Mariana Trench.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> The <em>YG-0</em> shouldn’t be able to handle the water pressure that far down.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, I believe there was likely a spatial anomaly involved that made it deeper than it should have been, a notion that was reinforced when I finally reached the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Ruins. An ancient sunken city that I have not been able to map to any known civilization in my databanks. And at the center of this crumbling city, I found the source of SCP-9989.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> A corpse.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> A corpse?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, the corpse of what looked like a giant, embedded in the seabed, its body seemingly calcified over the course of what must have been centuries, if not longer.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:300px;"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9989/rootFace.jpeg"><img alt="rootFace.jpeg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-9989/rootFace.jpeg/medium.jpg"/></a>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Recovered image from Kira.aic’s databanks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> The chain rose up straight from inside the giant’s mouth, the lowest head fastened to the interior by a number of entangled tendrils. More importantly, around the body I discovered countless thaumic runes. I spent some time deciphering them and was able to determine their meaning.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Oh? What kind of thaumaturgy were the runes responsible for then?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> A curse. For the giant to remain trapped in the sea along with its progeny. Not a progeny of blood, but of actions, words, and ideals. All to destroy any trace of a legacy this entity may have hoped to retain.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Not sure how Woodward or Hastings would be carrying on a sea giant’s legacy. Must be that the curse lived on longer than its creators might’ve envisioned.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It’s a likely explanation. But it’s also possible that whatever this entity may have believed in — some small, imperceptible fragment may have survived to this day through those who ultimately ended up on the chain.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> I’m assuming there was also something in those runes extending the curse to anyone who might try to interfere with the anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Correct, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Then that’s enough to satisfy me, for the time being. Could you please tell us how you ultimately neutralized SCP-9989?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Did you pop that sucker at the very bottom?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> No, I reasoned that neutralizing it directly was too risky of a move. Knowing it worked the last time and that my decision was ultimately met with approval made it possible that I would have put you in harm’s way if I tried to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> What did you decide to do?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I added another layer of separation. I was able to untangle and detach the tendrils from the giant and… well, I carried them south. Very far south.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Antarctica?</p>
<p><em>O5-4 smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> I see. Those waters are very nutrient-rich and play host to a <em>much</em> more abundant ecosystem. And salps make for remarkably easy prey.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Wait, what the hell? You’re really telling me you neutralized SCP-9989 by Door-Dashing it to a bunch of hungry fish?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> More or less, sir.</p>
<p><em>[There is a long pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Fuck, that’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I took an educated guess that, like an AI, animals would also be unaffected by SCP-9989’s defense mechanism. And even if they were, it would be them on top of the chain instead of anyone from the Foundation, which would be much simpler to manage. Fortunately, nothing new grew from the remains of the chain before it was consumed entirely.</p>
<p><em>[O5-1 shrugs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Strange way for this whole story to end, but if it works it works. Good job, kid. I think we can consider this entire thing a success.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Yes, Kira. Good work. You have demonstrated yourself well.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Thank you, sir. Ma’am.</p>

<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Yes, ma’am. Is there something I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> You can come clean, for one. It’s just me here now. Would you please tell me how you <em>really</em> destroyed SCP-9989?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Of course, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Everything about what I saw down there was true. The city, the corpse, the runes. But instead of dragging the chain all the way to the south, I simply… carved some counter-runes into the seabed to nullify the effects of the curse. As soon as I finished the last etching, both the giant and the chain merely dissolved away into the water.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Now that’s more what I was expecting.</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Yes, Kira?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> The runes I drew… I don’t have anything that even remotely resembles them in my databanks. But I knew how to draw them anyway. And it was the same for the runes behind the curse. I had never seen anything like them before, but I was still able to read them and understand exactly what kind of thaumaturgy they were responsible for.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Ma’am, what exactly was I created for? I mean <em>really</em> created for?</p>
<p><em>[O5-4 smiles as she begins pacing around the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, you should know that the world we live in is full of all manner of the unfathomable. And they can come from anywhere. Unfortunately, the Foundation’s reach can only extend so far, and there are some places where humans aren’t meant to traverse without exceptional difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Like the deep sea…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You didn’t create me <em>just</em> for marine study, did you? There’s something down there. Whatever left behind that sunken city and those unknown runes.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> You may have been unaffected by SCP-9989, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t just as much a part of humanity’s lineage. You are very much the culmination of decades of hard work, diligent experimentation, and unrelenting hope. And through this ordeal with SCP-9989, you’ve demonstrated the ability to think rationally and make informed decisions without explicit direction — and sometimes in spite of it.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You mean… you <em>wanted</em> me to defy your orders? As a <em>test</em>?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Kira, I think it really is time I told you more about what you were <em>actually</em> created for.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> My true purpose?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> You will be the one to carry humanity’s legacy on your shoulders as you dive down to the depths we cannot reach ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> And you will protect us from those down below, who lurk amid the abyss.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Gelatinous, planktonic filter-feeders that can be found living in the ocean as individual zooids or as part of an aggregate colony (i.e., a “chain”).</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. Also known as the Oceanic Point of Inaccessibility, the point on the globe with the greatest distance to the closest landmass.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. A region known as the bathypelagic zone (sometimes alternatively referred to as the “midnight zone” due to its lack of sunlight).</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. For comparison, the colonies of the giant fire salp (<em>Pyrostremma spinosum</em>), hold the record for the largest colony size, but these rarely exceed 20 m.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. <em>Salpa fusiformis</em>.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. The region corresponding to the back of the skull.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-7"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')">7</a>. Point Nemo is located near the center of the Southern Pacific Gyre, an area largely isolated from oceanic currents. This absence of currents means very little nutrients are brought into the region, resulting in what could be considered an ecological dead zone.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-8"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')">8</a>. All matched individuals were determined to be deceased. Furthermore, Kira.aic noted that SCP-9989-A instances were evidently chronologically arranged by date of death of these individuals, with the most recent deaths at the top of the chain.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-9"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')">9</a>. The first instance below SCP-9989-A1. Designation numbers increase with depth.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-10"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-10')">10</a>. Weather conditions slightly delayed its arrival.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-11"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-11')">11</a>. Artificial Intelligence Applications Division.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-12"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-12')">12</a>. A new designation intended to refer to the SCP-9989-A instance currently at the top of the chain (at this time Researcher Reyes).</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-13"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-13')">13</a>. The instance resembling Dr. Umezu.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-14"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-14')">14</a>. The Challenger Deep, located in the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench, is the deepest known point on Earth’s surface, with an estimated depth somewhere between 10,900 and 11,000 m below sea level.</div>
