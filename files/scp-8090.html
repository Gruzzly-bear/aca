<hr/>
<p>SCP-8090 is a facility located within the Southern Alps mountain range of New Zealand, belonging to GOI-850 ("Order of the Archine Eclipse"), acting as the group's main base of operations.</p>
<p>SCP-8090's exterior is weathered and run-down, appearing as an abandoned fortress church overrun with overgrowth and showing signs of an advanced state of disrepair. This persists into the courtyard, with the only exception being an antechamber at the back of the facility, which gives way to an opening into the main complex of the anomaly.</p>
<p>Inside, SCP-8090 opens into a palatial foyer (See Fig 1.1) consisting of three layers leading into an elaborate series of rooms, chambers, and hallways. Most of the aforementioned spaces are decorated with vast displays of artwork and artifacts lining the walls and ceilings depicting the mythical icons of GOI-850, as well as a significant amount of anomalous history<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">An extensive amount of the past that has ties to or can be explained through the anomalous, much of which has been either lost or intentionally forgotten.</span>. This area demonstrates non-Euclidean geometry as its interior dimensions exceed far beyond those of its exterior, pending proper measurement.</p>
<p>Some subjects of interest within SCP-8090's complex are a collection of three chambers, labeled SCP-8090-A, SCP-8090-B, and SCP-8090-C, which refer to a labyrinth, a tower seven hundred meters in height, and an artificial outside field, respectively. <em>[See Addendum 8090.2 for more information]</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> Female humanoid entity capable of minor yet rapid acts of thaumaturgy as well as excessive violence. Missing both its arms, it utilizes prosthetics.</p>
</div>
<p>During its securement, a total of one hundred and twenty members of GOI-850 were present within SCP-8090, each of which has been arrested and contained. Among them, GOI-850's leader POI-8090-1 was detained, as well as the previously uncontained <a href="/scp-3580">SCP-3580</a>. <em>[See Addendum 8090.1 for more information]</em></p>

<h3><span>GOI-850: Order of the Archine Eclipse</span></h3>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Presented by Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper</sup></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Initially discovered in the late 17th century, GOI-850 has proven itself as a small, concentrated, and powerful group composed of both humans and humanoids. Utilizing their anomalous capabilities, they have engaged in multiple and repeated acts of theft, murder, and terrorism across an international scope.</p>
<p>GOI-850 acts as an international clandestine organization operating with very few members. Despite this, however, it is capable of orchestrating conspiracies in its search for artifacts related to its sacred figure. It stores these relics within SCP-8090, creating new displays for each recovered item.</p>
<p>From what has been gathered, it is believed that GOI-850 worships a mythical figure known as Archine - one of the very first human beings, as well as a valiant hero and brilliant tactician - and has gone to great effort to advance the capabilities of its followers - like the iconic figure - to an unknown end.</p>
<p>At present, eighteen confirmed instances of these enhanced humanoids - referred to as "knights" by the Order - are contained. Each of these entities shows extraordinary physical capabilities and or thaumaturgic prowess, making them extraordinarily dangerous, as well as useful for the group.</p>
<p>The leader of this group is among these augmented humanoids. Referred to as the "Apex Monarch" (POI-8090-1), it is believed to be the oldest living member of GOI-850, acting as both its commander and religious head.</p>
<p>Notably, SCP-8090 was originally located in Europe and acted as GOI-850's sole facility. This was changed following the Foundation failing in its first attempt at containing it, after which GOI-850 managed to thaumaturgically transport the entirety of SCP-8090 to its present location in New Zealand.</p>

<p><strong>17:09:</strong> <em>The humanoids shout at the agents in English and French. Backing up, the operatives ready their rifles at the entities.</em></p>
<p><strong>GOI-850/1:</strong> Begone! All of you! Leave this sacred place!</p>
<p><strong>GOI-850/2:</strong> <em>[Take up arms, brother! Fight!]</em></p>
<p><strong>17:09:</strong> <em>GOI-850/2 charges forward, sword raised.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. DeMarcus:</strong> Fire!</p>
<p><strong>17:10:</strong> <em>Agents open fire on GOI-850/2 while others aim at GOI-850/1. While they are both visibly affected by this, GOI-850/2 continues, with GOI-850/1 joining it after.</em></p>
<p><em>GOI-850/2 swings at a cluster of agents, but is immediately intercepted by Michaels. He points the shotgun upward and shoots at the humanoid's head. Racking the shotgun, he repeats the process until he runs out of ammo. The entity's head is shredded, terminating it and sending it to the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>GOI-850/1:</strong> No, no! No!</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. DeMarcus:</strong> Hold!</p>
<p><strong>17:10:</strong> <em>GOI-850/1 puts its sword in front of it while backing away. Michaels turns to face it. The agents stop shooting.</em></p>
<p><strong>GOI-850/1:</strong> How, how dare you!?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Michaels:</strong> Fan out! Secure the area!</p>
<p><strong>17:11:</strong> <em>DeMarcus reaches for his communicator, commanding half of SIGMA-4's forces to move in and hold the lobby. Michaels and two operatives arrest GOI-850/1 while the rest spread out through the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>17:13:</strong> <em>Eight agents from SIGMA-4 arrive and take up positions around the chamber. Michaels, Vega, and DeMarcus join with their teams and move deeper into the facility down four separate halls. Two agents from Beta-777 accompany Roufhous as they walk up the stairs and into the central hallway. GOI-850/1 stares at GOI-850/2's corpse.</em></p>

<h3><span>Timeline<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Truncated list of relevant events since GOI-850's discovery.</span></span></h3>
</div>
<div class="smallmodal">
<p><strong>1793:</strong> Several reports are put out across the United States of America detailing unprovoked attacks by a giant humanoid creature. These accounts were spread out over several months and separate locations, however, they were consistent in their descriptions of the figure and its accomplice.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Larger than a single-story house, dressed in dark black armor, glowing green eyes, and with a "witch child" in tow.</span></p>
<p><strong>1794:</strong> Records of this same entity begin appearing across the ocean in France. The string of these accounts shows the humanoid having landed at Nouvelle-Aquitaine as it made its way westward towards Grand Est before leaving the country.</p>
<p><strong>1808:</strong> After following the trail of the entity's attacks to its home base, Foundation forces launch an assault on LOI-850 ("Yhiloyehyra"). GOI-850's leadership is severely crippled but manages to escape. LOI-850 disappears along with them.</p>
<p>Because of the numerous potential threats observed during this operation in conjunction with the location's relocation, Project Labyrinth was conceived to track down and contain GOI-850.</p>
<p><strong>1968-1970:</strong> The Federal Bureau of Investigation begins a two-year-long series of inquiries into international shipping agent Kevin Gibson under suspicions of communist affiliations. During a raid on a freighter operated by Gibson, containers were found carrying an unknown number of missing persons.</p>
<p>During this operation, Gibson had been captured and the cargo ship was seized. This was until one GOI-850 member was found on the ship, which then proceeded to terminate all but three federal officers on board, leading to Gibson escaping with the ship's cargo. The officers' testimonies proved vital to linking Gibson to GOI-850, and Gibson was subsequently designated as POI-9112.</p>
<div class="floatbox right">
<p><strong>SCP-3580-A:</strong> Humanoid knight entity, four meters in height equipped with a Gatling gun on its left arm. Presently terminated.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>1971:</strong> SCP-3580 attacks Site-41, killing fourteen personnel, obtaining confidential Foundation information, and terminating the Site's Director Malkin Fallen.</p>
<p>The Foundation locates POI-9112 and attempts to capture him. This endeavor failed, as a member of GOI-850, later designated SCP-3580-A, intervened, killing all but Agent Mortimer Woodlock out of the Mobile Task Force agents responsible for the operation as well as POI-9112.</p>
<p><strong>1978:</strong> SCP-3580 attacks Site-102, executing twelve personnel in the process, and discovers the location of Area-55 - the main base of Project Labyrinth. Later, the same entity intercepts an armored van escort delivering one POI-1492, killing four Foundation personnel and escaping with POI-1492.</p>
<p><strong>1979:</strong> SCP-3580, joined later by SCP-3580-A, attacks Area-55, killing five personnel and stealing half of a parchment detailing the thaumaturgic incantation previously used to teleport SCP-8090.</p>
<p>One week later, SCP-3580 and SCP-3580-A utilized that incantation to transport the Bagger 288 excavator from Germany to Turkey. Four teams of Mobile Task Force operatives from Nu-7 were deployed and engaged the two entities.</p>
<p>The event ended with SCP-3580-A being terminated, an as-of-yet unknown cost in damages to Foundation equipment, the Bagger 288 being severely damaged, SCP-3580 escaping, rising tensions between Germany and Turkey, and a total of sixteen agents killed in action.</p>
<p>Four days after this event, an email was sent to all Project Labyrinth personnel from a terminal in New Zealand. After 26 hours of organizing, Nu-7 was deployed and led a campaign to contain LOI-850 - later redesignated as SCP-8090.</p>

<p><strong>Lobby:</strong> The central foyer measures eighteen meters in width, thirty-one meters in length, and twenty-eight meters in height. Above, there is a split mural, depicting GOI-850's icon Archine defeating Alnilam, a large raven-like creature multiple times her size. The other then shows her imprisoning it in a cage. In both, Archine stands proud, holding a blazing sword overhead atop a shameful Alnilam.</p>
<p>The lobby then connects to nine separate passageways connecting to SCP-8090-A, SCP-8090-B, SCP-8090-C, a lush garden, five chambers for training activities, a vast weapons arsenal, six stores of anomalous artifacts, as well as personal accommodations for most of GOI-850's members.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-8090-B:</strong> Located at the westernmost end of the second floor, entering through this hallway leads into a massive corridor, each end connected by a series of catwalks situated 1.4 kilometers above the ground. At the bottom, there is a mound of corpses comprised exclusively of failed GOI-850 knight entities (SCP-8090-A1).</p>
<p>At the other end of this chamber, the bridge expands to accommodate a spiraling staircase spire extending 700 meters into the air. Alcoves are situated all along the walls, acting as stores for a consistently similar series of artifacts, as well as a collection of displays detailing a species of four armed humanoid entities engaging in acts of warfare utilizing advanced thaumaturgy.</p>
<p>At the top of the tower is a miniature garden with a constantly flowing fountain in its center. At the base of this structure is a string of text, glowing with a bright yellow light, that appears to visually automatically translate into the reader's primary language. The text reads:<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>
<p>A gift to serve<br/>

<p><strong>17:15:</strong> <em>Entering the hallway, operatives overhear a loud, echoing sound from within the chamber. They move in, overlooking the space heavily inhabited by GOI-850 members, far more than seventy in total. They all cheer and shout at the show beneath them, where dozens of monstrous creatures brutally fight amongst one another.</em></p>
<p><strong>17:17:</strong> <em>Captain Michaels commands his team to stay back, where they remain unnoticed by the crowd. Michaels converses with his men on how best to control the situation. Michaels asks for reinforcements from SIGMA-4, leaving four men to hold the entrance.</em></p>
<p><strong>17:18:</strong> <em>Michaels receives a notice from Captain Vega's radio, informing him of the facility possessing non-Euclidean geometry. The agents arrive just as he receives this information.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Michaels:</strong> Non-Euclidean geometry. Know what that means, lads? Means we may very well be in trouble. I had a buddy some while ago. Walked into one of those kinds of anomalies. He never came back out. We might not come back out.</p>
<p><strong>17:18:</strong> <em>He sighs, moving a hand up to his forehead, pushing the hair out of his face. He racks the shotgun.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Michaels:</strong> So now, I guess it's all or nothing. Let's make this count, eh?</p>
<p><strong>17:19:</strong> <em>Michaels charts out a plan of attack, instructing each agent's movements and targets. Once everyone is ready, he leads the charge. The men break up and cover as much distance as possible as the agents' presence is noticed.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>17:15:</strong> <em>The two Beta-777 agents follow shortly behind Director Roufhous into the corridor as they take a sharp turn into the second room on the right. Their microphones pick up the sounds of a brief scuffle, accompanied by the crunch of metal. Shouting is heard inside, and they turn the corner to see Roufhous facing SCP-3580, one of its prosthetic arms ruined on the ground beside a deceased GOI-850 member.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>17:16:</strong> <em>It charges at Roufhous, its last arm stretched behind it. They swipe with their cane, slicing through the arm at its base before they slam into SCP-3580 with their shoulder, knocking it to the ground. With its back against the wall, they hold the cane to its neck and arch down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Roufhous:</strong> <em>No. More. Witchcraft.</em></p>
<p><strong>17:16:</strong> <em>They look towards the Beta-777 agents before standing and stepping away. The agents walk over and secure SCP-3580 while Roufhous exits the room and continues down the hall.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-8090-C:</strong> Located on the easternmost end of the facility, the corridor ends at a threshold of fifteen meters, whereupon subjects will begin to experience visual and auditory hallucinations for a period of twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>The vision opens to view a flat, cracked plain at night. The sky is heavily clouded, and distant shouting can be heard. To the north, hundreds of large chunks of rock can be seen floating in the sky, smoke rising from many of them. Upon closer examination, fortresses can be observed inside and above these parts, which crumble, and slowly rotate around a central vertical palace.</p>
<p>Explosions, thunder, and a distant roaring can be heard as well. In the clouds, there are occasional flashes of dark red and orange light, and a silhouette of a massive winged creature can be seen.</p>
<p>After eighteen minutes, the city begins to fall and soon after collides with the ground. The beast makes one final dive overhead from the subject, briefly coming into view and revealing a black hide before drifting back above the clouds. Sometime later, an army is seen moving out from the ruins of the city bearing banners like the ones observed in SCP-8090-B.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ground erupts. Crackling can be heard all around, capable of causing temporary hearing damage in subjects, as mounds begin to form on the Earth. Hume levels visibly begin to rise lie heat distortion as those mounds escalate and grow into mountains and reach further and further into the sky, each of them situated around the army. Glowing blue light emerges from the group as the mountains become kilometers tall, and begin to arch towards one another.</p>
<p>At twenty-four minutes, the mountains fall into one another, converging upon the group. A violent shockwave is felt, and the vision ends as the crashing mountains obscure the legion.</p>
<p>The room then returns to baseline - a small chamber with only a podium and its item as its features. Atop the stand is a spear, well out of human proportion and inscribed with the following:<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>
<p>Be proud, not mourning.<br/>
His price paid, our battle won.<br/>
Be free but warned. Should you challenge my progeny, you will not be spared.</p>

<p>Following the securement of SCP-8090, a team of Project Labyrinth personnel was selected and flown out to the location, where two armed outposts had been constructed. Given the severity of the humanoid anomalies being contained, it was decided that one facility would be dedicated to holding the captured members of GOI-850 and the other for housing faculty.</p>
<p>Three days after their arrival, interrogations began with the POIs to learn more about the group, its functions, the missing persons, and SCP-8090 itself. Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper has been chosen to perform the majority of these interviews.</p>

<p><em>POI-8090-1 is seated in its cell. Its hands are cuffed to the table; anti-thaumic wards are etched into the specially designed thick chains. It hums to itself, occasionally singing in an unknown language. It scratches into the table with its abnormally sharp fingernails, etching nullified symbols into its surface.</em></p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Pepper opens the door and pulls up a seat at the other end of the table, facing it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> POI-8090-1. Do you understand why you are here?</p>
<p><em>It does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> POI-8090-1. I know you understand me. Do you understand why you are here?</p>
<p><em>It does not respond. It hums louder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> If you continue to ignore my requests, then I cannot guarantee the fair treatment of your followers.</p>
<p><em>It stops humming.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> I thought you were all impartial. Then what can you guarantee, child?</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Do not refer to me in that way again, POI-8090-1. I am prepared to allow certain amenities for the Order's followers, first and foremostly a modicum of freedom in their containment, including some access to Archine's texts.</p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> But what can you offer me?</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Should you prove to be of lesser value, any special attention we are affording to you currently can be placed onto another from your group, and you would then be left alone in your dimly lit containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> That would not matter for long.</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Why is that?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> POI-8090-1, if you will not elaborate then I see no further point in continuing this.</p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> You know what lies beyond the maze. You've seen it. You've been there. Generations of work cut off now. Centuries of lifetimes cut short. What did you think of it?</p>
<p><em>She leans in closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Tell me what we saw in there.</p>
<p><em>Its hands come to a stop. It looks up at Pepper.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> God. You saw a god, my child. And it is in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>POI-8090-1:</strong> Put it all together. Then you can tell me.</p>
<hr/></div>
</div>
<p>Following this interview, POI-8090-1 refused to provide any actionable information for twenty-five hours. Attempts at interviewing other high-ranking GOI-850 members yielded almost exclusively unhelpful results, save for one interaction with SCP-3580, logged below.</p>

<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> What kind of mission would require transporting the largest machine in the world to another country?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> I'm sure there could have been other ways to go about that process. Other quieter options that wouldn't have led to so many deaths.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Nor the death of your associate.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> We know neither of you two planned out the event. You were just the operators behind it. What did this "Apex Monarch" say was the point of it all? What could be the purpose of such a stunt?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> I said piss off.</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Not without an answer, SCP-3580, now answer the question.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3580 struggles in its bed, thrashing around wildly until it faces Pepper.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> He told me it would be easy. He said it wasn't buried that deep underground. He assured me that we could handle it. Then four planes descended down onto us, and you criminals all came out with your guns in droves! It didn't matter how many of you I struck down when two more men would take the first's place! We should have been able to handle it, but then more and more and more came, and we were drowned in the blood of the lives you people threw away that day!</p>

<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> But what was the point of the excavator?</p>
<p><em>It breathes heavily, staring at Pepper for a moment. It slumps back.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> You don't even care, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> That is not up for discussion. Please, what was the point of the excavator?</p>
<p><em>Taking several seconds, its breath slowly returns to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> It was his plan.</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> Hmm. And what was it that you took from that dig site?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> How could you not remember?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3580 growls as it sits up on its bed, meeting Pepper at eye level.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3580:</strong> I was shot at. <em>Repeatedly.</em> What was the worst pain you've ever endured, princess?</p>
<p><strong>Pepper:</strong> That is not up for discussion.</p>

<h3><span>GOI-850: Archine's Eclipse</span></h3>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Presented by Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper</sup></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Divinity is fallible. Divinity is not above humanity. Divinity too may die.</p>
<p>These are the core beliefs of GOI-850. That humanity is separate from the divine, and should not be made to serve them. As put forth by Archine herself when she brought down the demigod Alnilam.</p>
<p>The group's icon is a legendary testament, proof of the potential within every person for greatness. To follow in her footsteps, though grueling, is to walk the path of striving for improvement and perfection. But to fight for her cause is to enter a war against the order of reality; eclipsing the original to bring forth a new one in mankind's favor.</p>
<p>GOI-850's most revered tale details Archine conquering a beast, described much like a European dragon, named Yharlashaye, in order to gain favor with the goddess of magic.</p>
<p>Needing a weapon capable of killing the monster, she ventured into the domain of the Archdaemon Carnis and battled her way through escalating challenges, eventually to face off against a semi-humanoid entity coated in impenetrable bone armor. Archine outmaneuvered the beast in swordplay and fashioned an unbreakable blade from the carcass.</p>
<p>Then, joined by her brothers and sisters, Archine led them into battle against Yharlashaye on a mountain. Fighting for hours, the beast had cut them down to their final three. It then took to the sky, preparing to rain fire down upon the remaining mortals. Running up to the tallest hill, Archine lept into the sky after it, and the two clashed in the sky.</p>
<p>Stabbing her blade into Yharlashaye's neck, Archine disarmed its most devastating weapon and rode it back down to the ground where her comrades then began restraining the animal with chains. Removing the edge from the creature's neck, the creature's fell blood had caused it to burn bright as Archine enchanted it.</p>
<p>Presenting the beast as a gift, the goddess rewarded Archine amidst the climactic first Storm, where she would serve as one of three generals for the city of Hyphera.</p>
<p>According to GOI-850, humanity has always had to take from the world to change it; this act was no exception. I am inclined to agree.</p>

<p><strong>Associated Passage:</strong> "<em>Soulless now as it is, it is useless compared to its elden glory. I am so sorry, my sister. I will carry your flame with me always.</em>"</p>

<p>On 23/3/1979, after exploring the top floor of the facility as well as examining the detained participants found within SCP-8090-A upon its securement, a sizeable number of persons originally reported missing due to the actions of POI-9112 were found, most unharmed, many having converted to GOI-850's religion.</p>
<p>Interviews with these people are ongoing, headed mainly by Senior Researcher Krow. Current plans are to amnesticize and release them once it has been concluded that they are safe for reintegration into their respective societies.</p>

<p><strong>16:00:</strong> <em>Six operatives enter the lobby, joined by Woodlock and Roufhous. Multiple sections of the chamber have been closed off, including the passages to SCP-8090-C. Guards are stationed all around the room carrying assault rifles. A team of junior researchers, as well as Senior Researcher Krow, are standing around a foldable table, discussing their findings.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:00:</strong> <em>Senior Researcher Krow notices the group and leaves the table, coming over to meet with Woodlock.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Director. Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Do you think this will be enough?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> It'll be plenty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Hm. If you say so. One, two - Eight in all.</p>
<p><strong>16:02:</strong> <em>Walking back to the table, he picks up a series of small items. He spins around and tosses one at Woodlock. He catches and examines it. It is a small ball, inscribed with four carvings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Thaumic?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Pocket-sized wards. Little glimpses of magic for the uninitiated. We picked up a trick or two from the Order and added a dash of our own wizardry. Break one, and it should instantly transport you back here.</p>
<p><em>Krow points at a collection of dust circles in the center of the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> <em>Should</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> It's still rather prototypical. But, it should act as a last resort. With any luck, you'll be fine either way.</p>
<p><strong>16:03:</strong> <em>He hands one out to each member of the team, then faces Woodlock again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Let me see yours.</p>
<p><strong>16:04:</strong> <em>Holding his hand out with the ball in it, Krow takes Woodlock's wrist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Uh, doc-</p>
<p><strong>16:04:</strong> <em>Pulling out a knife, Krow slices into Woodlock's thumb. Woodlock pulls away, closing his hand and clutching it. The other agents ready their rifles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Ah, what the… eh… <em>heck</em>!?</p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Don't be a baby. Have to get a bit of blood on them to work. Now it's bound to you, and vice versa. You all should all have your own knives, right?</p>
<p><strong>16:05:</strong> <em>Looking down at his hand, the ball has begun to glow a faint white light. The other operatives begin the process of activating their wards, except for Roufhous, who immediately stomps it under their boot before continuing towards the staircase.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Uncalled for.</p>
<p><strong>16:06:</strong> <em>Reaching into his pocket, he removes another sphere and hands it to Woodlock.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sr. Krow:</strong> Luckily, I was expecting a proper team. Now quit loitering already.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Fine. Thanks for the concern. Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>16:06:</strong> <em>The team follows Woodlock as he passes Krow and the staircase, entering the hallway preceding SCP-8090-A. They enter the antechamber where the way ahead remains open. They continue.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:10:</strong> <em>At the end of the passageway, the team arrives at the previously sighted thaumic barrier. Agents from Beta-777 move up to deal with it. They draw inscriptions into the air, glowing dull white.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:14:</strong> <em>The glyphs accumulate in the air, all of them placed in articulate positioning around the lock of the barrier. Sparks released from the barrier decrease as the seventh rune is drawn.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:19:</strong> <em>Agents complete the sixteenth symbol and place it on the lock. The barrier briefly shines brighter before blinding the camera in white light. As visuals return, the barrier crumbles apart. The sound of falling sand is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:20:</strong> <em>Operatives file out inside, looking around at a large, window-domed interior, where the sky can be seen with radiant stars. A large globe is placed in the center of the room, dotted with various markings written in an unknown language, with inaccurate representations of the continents, of which there are eight. There is a grand table situated before the globe, stacked high with papers, many of which are written in English or other known languages. Lining the walls is a collection of dead plant life. Banners hang from rails on the ceiling, tattered and ruined.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:21:</strong> <em>Past the globe, there is a staircase leading to a platform at the back of the chamber. In the center, placed all the way at the back, there is an enlarged, polished bedframe, its contents having been severely withered. Lying atop the decaying mound, however, a skeletal frame is visible, draped in thick armor and bearing a crown with four horns.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:22:</strong> <em>Approaching the anomaly, Agent Duke calls over to Captain Woodlock, and he comes running, followed by the rest of the unit. They all stare at the corpse that is SCP-8090-Ω.</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>16:23:</strong> <em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>16:25:</strong> <em>Agents look to the left of the bedframe, where a descending set of steps obscures a glowing structure down below. Flames rise up from the depth.</em></p>
<p><strong>16:26:</strong> <em>Operatives look closer, observing a swirling maelstrom of light between two large white structures set alight, generating a noise of crackling lightning intermixed with the low gusting of wind, comparable to a quiet wail.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Cowrite:</strong> What on Earth is that?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Woodlock:</strong> Call it in. We found the target.</p>
