<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span></p>
<p>All exploration of HD 50655 Ad is to be uncrewed and conducted exclusively by the SCP Foundation. Any infringement is to be considered a lost cause.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>SCP-8523 is a gravitational phenomenon observed in the ocean of the terrestrial planet HD 50655 Ad, located 20 light-years away from Earth.</p>
<p>The anomaly is activated when an object crosses HD 50655 Ad's bathypelagic zone<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, correspondingly adjusting the gravitational pull for the object to sink indefinitely.</p>
<p>It is currently believed either SCP-8523 does not affect organic matter anywise or the several creatures inhabiting HD 50655 Ad's deep ocean have simply adapted to survive in an anomalous environment.</p>
<p>The behavior of matter itself and other laws of physics in the areas affected by SCP-8523 is equally deviant from Normalcy, although throughout irregular periods of time. Extensive investigation of this phenomenon is being conducted.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Item History:</strong></span></p>
<p>On September 6, 2344, the United States Space Administration (USSA) designated the astronauts Agatha Ripley and Leah Weaver to the Nyx Project, a human spaceflight program intended to discover extraterrestrial life on the ocean world<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> of HD 50655 Ad following the detection of high concentrations of dimethyl sulfide<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> by the Elizabeth Kane Telescope.</p>
<p>Although the operation was primarily focused on remote data gathering and field researches of the mesopelagic zone<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, Weaver eventually embarked on the submarine Nyx 1 to commence exploration of the deep sea, activating SCP-8523. This led to the mission being called off on October 9, 2353.</p>
<p>The Foundation would only discover SCP-8523 on December 24, 2363, following suspicions regarding the inconclusive details released about Weaver's death.</p>
<p>The transcriptions below were conceded by the USSA for archival and further research; original footage was recovered with the help of the multi-information system connecting Nyx 1 to the spaceship Hermes 1, where Ripley was stationed.</p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> July 27th, 2353</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Upon reaching a depth of 1,336 m, Nyx 1 began preparations to return to the surface. SCP-8523 is seen for the first time.</p>

<p><em>Weaver is sitting on a chair in a white room built out of titanium. In front of her, panels to operate the submarine functions are adjacent to a sonar, displaying readouts of her route and position. She is tampering with the ballast control while monitoring the readouts but stops after a few minutes to reach for the communicator, a confused look on her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I do. Any problem?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Not going up. 1,339 m as of now.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Have you double-checked?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Yeah. I'm sinking—</p>
<p><em>She turns to check her position again on the sonar when an abrupt ping reverberates through the sub. It is the proximity alarm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> What's wrong?</p>
<p><em>The alarm pings twice. It is closer. There is a beat of silence, then it pings three more times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Nyx 1?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> There's something around here.</p>
<p><em>Weaver takes a photo.</em><br/></p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Ripley:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I wouldn't know. It's hidden.</p>
<p><em>The pinging stops. The presence remains in the sonar for a few seconds, then disappears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Weird. It seems to be gone.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I'm preparing the ROVs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. Hang in there.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> You sure that's necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Better safe than sorry. Call me if you need anything, ok?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Alright. Thanks.</p>
<p><em>Three hours pass as Ripley prepares all the equipment, coming back from time to time to check on Weaver. She is nervous, restlessly tapping her fingers against the panel. Nyx 1 is at a depth of 1,391 m when the ROV Soteria 2 is finally launched, with Soteria 1 prepared to intervene and support its sister at all times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> A bit anxious.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Oh, Leah. Wanna talk about it?</p>
<p><em>Her fingers stop. She lets out a sharp exhale.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I don't know what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> See, it's not because future is unknown that it'll hurt us. Mom loved to say that.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> She loved to say you're a magnet for 'weird stuff', too. Maybe that's why this is happening.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> She would include you among the 'weird stuff' as well.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I prefer to ignore that part.</p>
<p><em>The two chuckle. A few seconds later, a sharp noise echoes across the sub, followed by a faint scratching. Soteria 2 has arrived, and Weaver follows Ripley's instructions for the next few minutes without any complications.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Your position, please?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> 1,419 m. Sinking yet again.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Ok. Sending Soteria 1 down there.</p>
<p><em>The sonar displays an amorphous presence nearby, but there's no pinging from the alarm. Weaver doesn't seem to notice it, and then it quickly surrounds Nyx 1 before fading away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> It's ready. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> 1,431 m. What about the ROVs?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Both are at 1,425 m.</p>
<p><em>The proximity alarm pings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Hold on.</p>

<strong>Weaver:</strong> There are three… things nearby. They're small. Remind me of a hive.</p>
<p><em>She zooms in on the photo.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Should we investigate?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> You're the priority for now. I'll just change our route.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Roger that.</p>
<p><em>She sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> What a shame.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Relax. We'll have time for them later.</p>
<p><em>The operation is conducted for the following hour with no further results. The two are silent throughout, and the sound of water crashing against the sub is prevalent, heavy and close.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Can we call it a day, Leah?</p>
<p><em>Radio silence for a few moments.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Leah?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Sorry. I'm nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Hey, hey. It'll be fine. Accidents happen.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> It's worse when you're far from home.</p>
<p><em>Weaver pauses and shakes her head. Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> What do you say when I'm down?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Love today, and seize all tomorrows.</p>
<p><em>Weaver nods to herself, sighing. A slight smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Ok then. I will try my best.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> <em>We</em> will. Tomorrow is another day.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Following the loss of communication with Soteria 1 and 2 on August 1st, as well as two other fruitless rescue attempts on August 2nd and 4th, a message was sent to the USSA asking for support. Response expected in two months. Nyx 1 is at a depth of 6,038 m.</p>

<p><em>Weaver is lying against a wall in the command room, reading a book. She has an exhausted look on her face, noticeable bags under her eyes, and her curly, big red hair is mussed up. As soon as Hermes 1's communicator turns on, she gets up to sit on her chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Morning. How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Hey. Still tired, but I have found some motivation to keep reading your books.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> That's good! What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas</em>, by Jules Verne. Very old piece.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Won't that one make you paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Not really, to be honest. Relatable experiences usually make things easier for me.</p>
<p><em>Weaver smiles as she lets out another yawn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> But now that you mention it, you think giving me this doomed me? By any chance?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Come on, that's nonsense.</p>
<p><em>A pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> It's a funny coincidence though.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> <em>Funny</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> A dark one, sure, but mostly funny.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Weirdness really is your charm, huh.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Oh, not this again—</p>
<p><em>The sub is suddenly hit by something outside, moving back and forth as Weaver is thrown to the ground and her head crashes against the panel. The proximity alarm begins to ping over and over, its echoing overlayed by that of the security alarms illuminating the room in red.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I'm just messing around. But hey, only three more weeks until our birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Same word in Portuguese. It's tricky.</p>
<p><em>Weaver chuckles, leaning back on her chair.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Well, I'm not adding up the hypersleep years to my age, so I'd say I'm still fine.</p>

<p><em>For the first time, Nyx 1 stops sinking, and there is only silence until a sharp, guttural sound is heard outside, echoing and coming back to itself in a moment. The sub shudders and goes back to sinking; the water flows yet again, faster; and the presence moves away.</em></p>
<p><em>Half an hour later, hurried footsteps are heard from the hallway leading to the command room. When the door opens, Weaver is seen with her body covered in sweat. She seems to be experiencing an episode of sleepwalking and begins to cough aggressively, her knees shaking. She places her hands over her belly and vomits water on the floor before leaving.</em></p>
<p><em>After three hours, Weaver is back at the room. The water has completely evaporated at this point, and she turns on her communicator.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Always. What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I'm scared.</p>
<p><em>Ripley pauses and sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I know, my love. Me too.</p>
<p><em>She proceeds to sing Weaver to sleep.</em></p>

<p><em>Weaver has an apathetic look on her face, and the bags under her eyes have grown. She has been talking to Ripley for the past three hours until a moment of sudden silence follows. She stares at the ceiling, unmoving. The footage shudders a bit as the sub is caught in a stream of water.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> You seem worse.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I'm just tired.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> You don't wanna talk about it?</p>
<p><em>Weaver sighs. Her expression is reluctant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I don't wanna give you more problems.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> You're not a burden, Leah.</p>
<p><em>Weaver covers her face with her hands, and takes a deep breath. Her shoulders are tense.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> 'For sickness and in health, and not even death do us part.' Remember?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Hush. It's ok.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Rip, we've been failing time and again.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I'm not giving up on you.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Sometimes I think you should.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> That would be giving up on myself.</p>
<p><em>Radio silence for 20 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Of course I hate this — and of course I'm afraid of losing us. But what else can we do? I wanna believe it'll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> It's all good. Let's just… move on.</p>
<p><em>Weaver gives light slaps to her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> A nightmare's been bothering me.</p>
<p><em>A pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I'm underwater, surrounded by darkness. And nothing ever happens there. Nothing. But everytime I wake up, I'm drenched in sweat and there's this feeling telling me it wasn't a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> You shouldn't trust <em>anything</em> your mind tells you when you're not ok.</p>
<p><em>Ripley pauses for a moment, thinking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Look, have I ever told you about the nightmares <em>I had</em> when I was younger?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> … Not that I recall.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Então senta que lá vem a história<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>She clears her throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Back then when I was 13, I started having dreams where I'd walk through a dark hallway and find a cryptic old man at the end. They lasted for a good couple of years, and it was a pain to go through the night terror over and over. But <em>one</em> day, it went away and never came back. That was the first night I had you by my side.</p>
<p><em>Weaver sighs, hesitating for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I miss you. I really do.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> We'll meet again. I promise.</p>
<p><em>Weaver swallows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Don't you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I just wish this wasn't so hard.</p>
<p><em>She chuckles while rubbing her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> In retrospect, visiting a planet orbiting a neutron star wasn't the best idea.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> At least we'll have a good story to tell when it's over. Our future daughter will love it.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Oh– you're still thinking about that?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Mhm. Her name will be Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> What if it's a boy?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I was thinking of Hugo or Diego.</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Neither?</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> They'll figure it out eventually.</p>
<p><em>Weaver leans over the panel. A light smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> You know, I like those.</p>

<p><em>Hurried footsteps from the main hallway break the silence present for the past few hours. Weaver is seen panting in fatigue when the door opens and runs to get her communicator.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I need help.</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Hm? What's wrong?</p>
<p><em>Weaver places her hands on her head and groans in pain, her knees trembling as water emerges from the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Leah? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Leah are you okay?!</p>
<p><em>Weaver quickly turns around and heads to the exit. The soaring water slows her down and makes her often trip along the way.</em></p>
<p><em>When she finally reaches the door and opens it, she runs through the flooded hallway and turns to the right, the safe room at the end of the corridor. Weaver jumps into the water to swim towards the door, and when she arrives, she presses her hand against the scanner.</em></p>
<p><em>The door opens. There is a small white room filled with several boxes and shelves with supplies and medical equipment, protected by locks and glass. She slams the door and falls panting to the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> What do I do?!</p>
<p><em>Water begins to permeate through the walls in the room as the sub's entire structure creaks, the sounds overlaying each other repeatedly, accompanied by a series of thuds in the inside and from the outside. Weaver covers her ears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Ripley, I swear—</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Fucking listen Leah!</p>
<p><em>The water is now at her knees. It begins to disperse and tumble everything in the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Sorry, I didn't mean to.</p>
<p><em>The walls crack apart and the windows are shattered in quick succession. She swallows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Leah? What happened now?</p>
<p><em>It reaches her shoulders. Her body shivers. Weaver seems to hesitate at first, but turns the communicator off and leans against the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Why—</p>
<p><em>An implosion is heard, followed by the brief, moist sound of Weaver's body being crushed. Communication with Nyx 1 is lost definitely, and the recording's point of view switches to Hermes 1. Footage shows a large room where several stars are visible through the windows. Ripley is shaking. Her breath begins to fail.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Are you there?! Leah are you there?!</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Answer me! Please answer me!</p>
<p><em>She calls out Weaver's name for the next few minutes. Her panicked expression becomes one of anger as there is no response. She begins to punch the panel in front of her over and over, each punch stronger than the last.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> For God's sake, just answer Leah!</p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> I know you're there! Don't do this–</p>
<p><em>She stutters. Her voice softens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ripley:</strong> Please Leah–</p>
<p><em>Her eyes grow in a sudden shock. As her head slowly gets up to look at the ceiling, a small drop of water falls onto her forehead.</em></p>
