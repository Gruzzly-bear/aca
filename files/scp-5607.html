<p>SCP-5607 is held within a specialized medical stasis unit in Research Lab 14-B, at Site-52. All basic life functions are supported through the stasis unit and maintained by the Research and Development Division.</p>
<p>SCP-5607-1 is to be extracted via a catheter and stored within pressurized biologic storage tanks. The extracted SCP-5607-1 is given to Development Team 14 to be repurposed into Compound-5607/P.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-5607 within its stasis unit.</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-5607 is theorized to be an extraplanetary humanoid entity originating from outside of the Sol System. Measuring 11 cm in height, SCP-5607 is bipedal, with elongated arms, and a large head relative to its body (approximately 4 cm in diameter). Similar in biological function to native Earth plants, SCP-5607 subsists off water, UV radiation, and carbon dioxide. Since its discovery, SCP-5607 remains in a self-induced comatose state, though all bodily functions are fully operational.</p>
<p>SCP-5607 was discovered in 1976, during a Foundation-backed mission to the lunar surface. During surveying operations in the Montes Secchi range, astronauts discovered a disk-shaped vessel (designated SCP-5607-0). After SCP-5607 and its stasis container were removed from SCP-5607-0, a self-destruct sequence initiated leading to the destruction of the vessel in its entirety. The salvaged remains were declared unsuitable for experimentation and subsequently left at the point of discovery (2.65°N 42.97°E, Montes Secchi, Earth 1).</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-5607-0 prior to its destruction.</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-5607-1 is the designation for urine created by SCP-5607 and is currently considered anomalous due to an unexplained biological reaction caused by its inhalation. During the examination of the spacesuit worn by SCP-5607, an unusual urine disposal method was discovered. Utilizing a catheter and an advanced vaporization unit, the suit redistributed vaporized SCP-5607-1 through the respiratory systems. Inhalation of SCP-5607-1 was subsequently tested on 28 different species, including humans. These tests concluded that SCP-5607-1 unilaterally causes a substantial increase in physical and mental dexterity, far beyond pre-exposure parameters. It is theorized that this facilitates the acuity needed for piloting the high-speed interstellar vessel used by SCP-5607.</p>

<p>The Research and Development Division has developed an inhalation device utilizing Compound-5607/P, an SCP-5607-1 derivative capable of a temporary and substantial increase in the effectiveness of Mobile Task Force agents. The device was designated the Personal Inhalant Service Stimulant, or PISS device. Testing concluded a ~175% increase in performance-related scoring in all participants.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The R&amp;D division requests the use of a high-engagement Mobile Task Force in order to test the long-term use of the PISS Device.</p>

<p>Dr. Millgate, the new flavoring is satisfactory to say the least, mixed berry was an excellent middle ground. My men have begun using the devices during almost every engagement.

<p>I am glad to hear the new flavor is to your men's liking, Captain. I am likewise pleased in the successful missions, though I would like to remind you that Compound-5607/P is for high-intensity situations and should not be overused. Additional devices will be included in your next shipment.</p>

<p>Captain Wells, while I am thrilled with our results over the past few weeks, I have an area of concern that needs to be addressed. As per the protocol laid out in our trial, <strong>all</strong> empty Compound-5607/P canisters must be returned upon delivery of the next shipment. The last two weeks you were short eight canisters.</p>
<p>Please make sure your men return the canisters once they've been depleted.</p>

<p>Dr. Millgate, it has come to my attention that several of my men have been keeping the spent canisters to get the "final bits" during tight situations. Two other operatives threw away their canister by mistake. I will make sure this does not happen again.</p>
