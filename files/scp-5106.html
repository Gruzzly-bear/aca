<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong></span></h4>
<p>Foundation WebCrawler Galileo.aic is to continuously monitor law enforcement agencies within the migratory path of the Canada Goose for increased reports of petty theft and other SCP-5106 related activities. Galileo.aic is also tasked with monitoring social media and video-sharing platforms for any mention of SCP-5106, or its associated activity. All evidence is to be discredited or removed, and all direct witnesses are to be amnesticized.</p>
<p>If SCP-5106 is located, a joint task force comprised of <a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/task-forces">MTF Eta-4 ("Begone Thoth")</a> and MTF Victor-17 (“Nature Boys”) members is to track and attempt to contain the anomaly.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong>Description</strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5106 is an avian entity resembling a Canada Goose (<em>Branta canadensis</em>), capable of communication in fluent English. SCP-5106 has heightened intelligence, though the extent of its cognitive capabilities is unknown. SCP-5106 displays a rudimentary understanding of subterfuge, slang terminology, interpersonal relations, and the barter system.</p>
<p>SCP-5106 is capable of commanding non-anomalous fauna to follow basic commands. It is unknown whether SCP-5106 uses some form of anomalous influence or if faunae follow the orders of their own volition. Though the full extent of this ability is unknown, SCP-5106 seems incapable of using it to affect humans and other species of higher intellect.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong>Discovery</strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5106 was initially discovered by civilians within Cattus Island State Park in Toms River, New Jersey. Following a drastic increase in theft-related incident reports, patrons of the park began reporting strange behavior in the local avian population. On 2020/08/13, a video depicting SCP-5106 related activity was uploaded to the media-sharing platform YouTube. The following is a transcript of the aforementioned video evidence which was flagged and transcribed by Galileo.aic:</p>

<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Carlos Vega is walking in front of the camera through a dimly lit playground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Man, when you said we was goin' to see the birds, this isn't what I thought you meant.</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Nah dude, I told you, the birds sold me this camera.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> The fuck you mean though?</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> I was eating lunch with Daniele over there. <em>[Randall points around the camera toward a pavilion in the distance]</em> and a fuckin' goose came up offering to sell us an iPhone, and I didn–</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> How's a goose offering you shit, bro? You trippin'.</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> 'Ight, bet. You'll see when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Yeah, I'll see you're dumb as fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Over here, this way.</p>
<p><em>[The two men walk through tall underbrush and several trees until they reach a small clearing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> <em>[Speaking loudly.]</em> Hey man, it's uh, it's me again. I brought my boy to come see you.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Check em!</p>
<p><em>[Several dozen squirrels emerge from the treeline and encircle Carlos and Randall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> The fuck man, what are the– back the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> It's cool, they're just checkin' us out.</p>
<p><em>[The squirrels can be seen running over the two men and checking their pockets, waistbands, and ankles. After removing a pocket knife from Carlos's left sock, the squirrels retreat back into the trees.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> On some real shit– did I just get robbed by a bunch of squirrels?</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> I don–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Don't worry, they'll give it back when we're done with our transaction.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5106 is seen entering the clearing encircled by eight Canadian geese.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> How can we help you, boys?</p>
<p><em>[Several of the geese honk in the two men's direction. Carlos is visible confused.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> I, uh– I…</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Yeah we wanted to do some business with you, ma– you got a name bro?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Yeah, I got one. But you can call me Don, kid.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> My man, what was in the blunt before, this goose just– Is this for real?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Oh we got wise guy, huh? <em>Your boy</em> is eyein' me hard– he better quit gawkin' before <em>my</em> boys get squawkin'.</p>
<p><em>[Several of the geese flap their wings and honk in response]</em></p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Nah Don, we cool– right C.</p>
<p><em>[Randall nudges Carlos.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Uh– yeah, we good.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5106 and its accompanying geese walk several meters closer to the two men.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> We've been here too long, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> My boy needs a new phone.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5106 extends its neck towards Carlos and inspects him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Android or iPhone?</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Uh– Android.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5106 turns its head toward Randall.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> You got the bread?</p>
<p><em>[Randall holds a stuffed manila envelope toward SCP-5106.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Five big ones, just like you said.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> 500? Bro, that's a lot of doe, wher–</p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Don't worry man, Ma gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Flaps, go get it.</p>
<p><em>[One of the geese flies into the treeline. It returns approximately one minute later carrying a plastic shopping bag in its beak.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Galaxy S20.</p>
<p><em>[The goose drops the plastic bag at Carlos's feet before waddling back to SCP-5106.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><em>[Randall makes an exaggerated coughing noise.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> I mean– good looks man, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Yeah, just pay up and scram– we've wasted enough time on you already.</p>
<p><em>[Randall opens the envelope revealing five slices of marble rye bread; he gently removes them from the envelope. Randall rips the bread into small chunks and spreads them on the ground. SCP-5106 and the other geese honk and flap their wings; in unison, they swarm and consume the bread pieces. After finishing the bread, SCP-5106 and its geese fly away.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> That– that was some, I don't ev– who the fuck's gonna believe this shit.</p>
<p><em>[Randall shakes the camera towards Carlos.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Randall:</strong> Everyone, man, I got that shit on here.</p>
<p><em>[The two men walk out of the clearing and back through the underbrush.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos:</strong> Yeah but, even on film, I don't know if I'd believe that shit– and I was there, man.</p>

<p><strong>Depicted:</strong> Agent Lazzo Finch, Agent Dillon Crane, Site-51 Avian Unit 3</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The agents set a live animal trap rigged with rye bread within the clearing SCP-5106 was previously encountered in. Finch and Crane are to remain hidden in the tree line for SCP-5106 to appear, at which time it will be tranquilized. Avian Unit 3 will remain on standby within the treetop and will pursue SCP-5106 if it attempts to escape.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Agents Finch and Crane are crouched in the underbrush facing towards SCP-5106's clearing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> How long is this gonna take? Do you think they're on to us, Crane?</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> No, I don't think so, the bird unit hasn't noted any movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Maybe they're off trying to sell people stolen junk.</p>
<p><em>[Both agents laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> What a fuckin job.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> You can say that again. Shit, this is probably one of the least weird cases we've had in months.</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Yeah, I know–</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Shhh. Look, over there.</p>
<p><em>[Finch points towards the western end of the clearing, movement can be seen in the underbrush. A total of 14 geese exit the tree line and enter the clearing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> That trap isn't holding all of them. How many tranq rounds do we have?</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Five.</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Shit, run back to the truck, grab another case of rounds. And be quick about it, we don't want them getting spooked.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> You got it.</p>
<p><em>[Finch crawls through the brush for several meters before standing and running towards the truck.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Just cause he's old as shit I gotta do the grunt work–</p>
<p><em>[Agent Finch stops several meters from the truck, the back doors are open and a large quantity of geese footprints can be seen on the ground. Finch quickly sprints to the back end of the truck and looks inside.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> Uh, Crane, we got a problem.</p>
<p><em>[The truck previously filled with various equipment is now empty; the five parrots composing Avian Unit 3 are unconscious and bound together with vines.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> Hurry up, I think they're on to us.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> Avian Unit 3 is down, and I– I think we've been robbed.</p>
<p><em>[Finch unties the unconscious parrots.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> What?</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> All of our equipment is gone!</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> Those little fucks! Get back here.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> Coming.</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> <em>[Over radio.]</em> I'm sending a backup request to command.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Finch sprints back to Crane.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch</strong> What's the plan?</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> We don't even know if one of them is the one we need. If we scare them off we won't have a pursuit team.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Why don't one of us wait here and the other go out there and try talking to them? If one of them answers we shoot that one with the tranq.</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Since backup is 40 minutes out, it's worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> OK, take this.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Finch hands Crane the tranquilizer rifle. Finch stands and walks into the clearing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> Okay, guys, looks like we got off on the wrong foot, how about we just talk this out?</p>
<p><em>[The geese immediately face Finch and begin to honk.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> I know at least one of you can talk– let's just work this out.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> I think this has worked out just fine for us.</p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Finch, I can't tell which one is talking– you gotta get it to step out of the group.</p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> As far as I can tell you're a business ma– goose, so let's do business.</p>
<p><em>[One of the geese steps from the group, a black rectangular object can be seen on its back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Okay then, let's make a de–</p>
<p><em>[Crane fires two tranquilizer rounds into the goose after several seconds of stumbling the goose falls to the ground. The remaining geese fly away in response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><em>[Crane exits the treeline and the two Agents approach the fallen goose.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5106:</strong> Only thing you got was played! <em>[Various honks can be heard in the background.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Finch:</strong> What the fuck…</p>
<p><em>[Finch pushes the goose over revealing a Foundation issued handheld radio attached to its back. Honking can be heard from above. The two Agents look up in time to see a Foundation issue electrified capture net falling on them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Crane:</strong> Ah shit.</p>

<p>Containment Team Alpha 4 arrived within a half-hour; the two MTF Victor-17 agents were discovered unconscious within the clearing. The entirety of Cattus Island State Park's Goose population, as well as SCP-5106, could no longer be located. The tracking devices within the stolen Foundation equipment were found in a trashcan within the park. The Foundation Parazoology Division is currently formulating possible migration patterns for SCP-5106 and its flock.</p>
