<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8672 is contained in a reinforced 25m × 25m containment unit located in the High-Security Containment Sector of Site-52. The interior of the chamber has been modified to include extensive electromagnetic interference shielding to prevent the disruption of SCP-8672's cybernetic components by external forces or events.</p>
<p>Given the level of internal damage sustained by SCP-8672,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-1')">1</a></sup> it is to be fed once every three days with a specialized, easily digestible paste rich in proteins, vitamins, and other essential nutrients. This paste is to be delivered directly into SCP-8672's gastrointestinal tract via an orogastric feeding tube. Hydration is to be maintained through standard water administration.</p>
<p>Due to the continued existence of SCP-8672 being dependent on the correct functioning of several poorly understood paratechnical components, all requests to dismantle or reverse-engineer these mechanisms — excluding non-essential weapon platforms — have been preemptively denied to prevent the accidental neutralization of the anomaly. Routine maintenance of the aforementioned components must be performed once a month by a team of specialized engineers.</p>
<p>SCP-8672 must be rendered dormant prior to the performance of either its feeding or maintenance procedures to ensure the safety of the personnel assigned to interact directly with it. This is to be accomplished via the dispersion of aerosolized sedatives throughout its containment chamber. Staff in charge of delivering the sedative agent must first verify that the dosage was properly administered prior to authorizing entry into SCP-8672’s containment chamber; failure to do so will result in immediate disciplinary action, which could lead to demotion and/or contract termination.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Under no circumstances are personnel of Slavic descent, or those who hold positive views of the Soviet Union, communism, or adjacent political ideologies, allowed to interact with SCP-8672 to avoid aggravating it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8672 is an artificially created instance of a common western dragon (<em>Draconis ignis</em>) exhibiting a large number of genetic and cybernetic physical augmentations. Sequencing of its genetic material indicates that its genome has been altered to include spliced DNA belonging to the common wyvern (<em>Draconis ferox</em>).</p>
<p>SCP-8672 measures approximately 4.7 meters in height, 7 meters in length (from head to tail), and possesses a wingspan of 4.9 meters. Its scales are of a yellowish-gray coloration, and four keratinous protrusions emerge backward from its head. The prominence of scar tissue located on its lower abdomen suggests that it was subject to sterilization procedures.</p>
<p>SCP-8672 possesses standard anomalous traits expected of its species, such as the capacity to fly in spite of its size and weight, and the ability to emit streams of thaumaturgic fire from its oral cavity. In addition, a combination of both mundane and anomalous experimental technologies, developed by GoI-616 ("Pentagram")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-3')">3</a></sup> in conjunction with GoI-014 ("Prometheus Laboratories Inc."), has been surgically incorporated into its body as part of a classified military project known to the Foundation as "Project Sundown."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-8672's set of augmentations and modifications include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A light, anomalous metallic alloy that has been grafted onto SCP-8672's skeletal structure for enhanced durability.</li>
<li>A multi-spectrum optical sensor that functions as SCP-8672's right eye.</li>
<li>A thaumic resonance engine, located inside of SCP-8672's rib cage, that serves to enhance the temperature of its fire.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-5')">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Subdermal armor plating made of a composite material resistant to small arms, medium arms, and some large-caliber arms fire.</li>
<li>Retractable, plasma-infused talons enhanced for close-quarters combat.</li>
<li>A limited self-repair system.</li>
<li>A perception cloaking device.</li>
<li>Modified adrenal glands capable of producing a synthetic combat stimulant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information on the more experimental paratechnical components and weapon systems found on the body of SCP-8672 is classified behind Level 5 security clearance.</p>
<p>External examination of SCP-8672's body has uncovered considerable signs of physical trauma, injury, and necrosis that would otherwise be fatal to other living organisms, including other instances of <em>Draconis ignis.</em> This suggests that its cybernetic augmentations serve a critical role in the maintenance and repair of its vital biological functions.</p>
<p>Neural scans indicate damage to key regions of SCP-8672's brain responsible for cognitive and emotional processing. As a result, SCP-8672 exhibits signs of psychological instability, erratic behavior, sudden aggressive outbursts, impaired long-term memory retention, and distress over fragmented recollections of past events. In spite of these impairments, SCP-8672 still retains most of its personality, which is described as immature, short-tempered, and naive. It displays an above-average level of intelligence, is capable of communicating in at least four separate languages,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-6')">6</a></sup> and often attempts to engage with personnel stationed outside of its containment unit in discussions on a variety of topics.</p>
<p>SCP-8672 holds extremely patriotic sentiments and loyalty toward the United States of America and its government, and often expresses a series of extremist beliefs against its political enemies and perceived threats, primary among them being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communism and its followers</li>
<li>Socialism and its followers</li>
<li>The now dissolved Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</li>
<li>The People's Republic of China</li>
<li>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>These extremist beliefs stem from long-term exposure to specialized anti-communist and pro-American propaganda developed by Pentagram during the early developmental periods of its life.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8672 was discovered on December 27, 1992, after having crash-landed in the Mojave Desert, California, when a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/history-lesson">nearby Foundation facility</a> detected several high-frequency distress signals being broadcast by it. Given the facility's sensitive nature, a Mobile Task Force was quickly assembled and mobilized to the location of the signal's origin. Upon arrival, the Task Force found SCP-8672 in a damaged state and partially buried in the sand. Following its discovery, SCP-8672 was transported to Site-52, the second nearest Foundation facility in the area, for further study.</p>
<p>SCP-8672 was believed to have been neutralized as a result of its collision against the ground and, as such, was being considered for dismantling. However, SCP-8672 suddenly regained consciousness two days later in its temporary containment unit and immediately attempted to breach containment.</p>
<p>The ensuing confrontation between SCP-8672 and Site security lasted for a total of 15 minutes, culminating when a low-yield EMP was detonated in the vicinity of SCP-8672, resulting in its incapacitation and allowing for its recapture and subsequent recontainment. Post-incident reports indicated that Site-52 incurred considerable losses, both financial and in personnel, and required severe restructuring of damaged areas and restaffing.</p>
<p>As a result of this incident, SCP-8672 was initially classified as Keter by Site-52's containment specialist, Dr. Alexander Dwight; however, this classification was later changed to Euclid by decision of the Foundation Classification Committee following the removal and/or disabling of most, if not all, of its known weapon systems.</p>
<p>Initial analysis of SCP-8672 and its paratechnical components did not reveal any significant information regarding its origins, and what little could be extracted only served to reinforce suspicions of its suspected allegiance. As such, all investigations into this aspect of SCP-8672 was suspended in order to prioritize research into other areas of interest.</p>
<p>On 12/31/1992, Dr. Emilia Turner was assigned the position of Research Lead for SCP-8672 by Site-52's director. This action led to a verbal disagreement between the two, which has been recorded and is attached below.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The door leading to the office room opens, and footsteps are audible as Dr. Turner makes her way into it.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Good day, Director. You wanted to see me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Correct. Please have a seat, Emilia.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner moves toward the chair placed in front of his desk and sits down.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Thank you, sir. I'm assuming that this is about the reassignment notice I received this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Yes, I wanted to speak with you in person before the official paperwork made its way through. As of today, you’ll be taking over as Research Lead on SCP-8672.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner nods slowly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Which one is that, again? I don't think I've read the file for it.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> It's the dragon, Emilia. It's the dragon.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …With all due respect, sir, may I ask why I was chosen for this? I have ongoing projects with SCP-632 and—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> —And they’ll be redistributed. I understand this is abrupt, but SCP-8672 requires someone with your specific background.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What do you mean by that, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Your personnel file mentions that you submitted an application to be reassigned to the Dragonology Department relatively early in your career. As far as I understand it, one must be somewhat knowledgeable about dragons to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That is… you aren't wrong, but that was a long time ago. Besides, it was rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> After some consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Yes, but—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> —But, that means that you're the most qualified person on this facility to deal with this situation. Besides, between the two of us, consider this not as an assignment, but more as a… how do I say this… a way to fullfil an old dream.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Well? you can't deny that you aren't curious about the prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I… maybe, but I'm not a dragon tamer, sir. I'm barely more knowledgeable than the average person.</p>
<p><strong>[Director Blake chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> I'm not asking you to be one, Emilia. I'm just asking you to try.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. After a few seconds, Dr. Turner sighs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Okay, I'll take care of the dragon. Just don't expect much.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> I'll expect whatever I have to. In any case, that's all I wanted to discuss with you right now. You're free to go.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Very well.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner stands up from the chair.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I suppose that I'll have to wait for my credentials to be updated to get access to its file?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> That shouldn't take very long. In any case, you can contact me IT or me if you're having any troubles with that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I know. But, if that's all, I should be moving.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Yes, we'll talk some other time.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/03/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following interview was conducted one day after SCP-8672 regained consciousness via a two-way communication system to avoid the risk of fatality or containment failure.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is lying on the floor of her containment unit, lazily scraping at it with one of her claws. A burst of static is released from the speaker in the room, which causes SCP-8672 to stand up on edge.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What the— Who's there?!</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 wraps her wings and tail protectively around her body and slowly retreats into a corner while making direct eye contact with the security camera present in the room.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> He— <strong>[Static]</strong> llo? Hello? Is this working— oh, never mind, it is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Identify yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Ah, right. I suppose I should.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner clears her throat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> My name is Emilia, Emilia Turner. We found you in the desert after receiving your distress signal.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence. SCP-8672's expression turns quizzical.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh… hey, wait! Are you a communist?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …No.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent for five seconds, then lets out a sigh of relief and takes on a more natural posture.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Well, that's good to know. Sorry about that little outburst there, miss Turner, but I had to make sure I hadn't been captured by the enemy, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. It's a normal reaction to get defensive when you're placed in an environment you don't recognize—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Precisely! And as you know, commies are very insidious. They will try to lure you into entering a false sense of security before attacking you. You can't ever trust them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Um… yeah, that's uh… you're correct.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Damn right I am!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …In any case, I answered your question, it's only fair that you answer mine now.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence. SCP-8672 rolls her eyes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> <em>Fine.</em> What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What's your name? Do you remember what you were doing before you crashed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Those are two questions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hmph. My name is Sentinel-9, or just Sentinel. You can also call me "Your Radiant Glory" if you want to. I'm okay with either, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I… think I'll stick to Sentinel, thanks. Moving past that, it's interesting that your name is a designation.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 squints her eyes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What's the difference?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It's… uhm, you know what? Never mind, please continue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> As for before the crash… there was a mission. I don't… I don’t remember my objective, but I was flying really high with my siblings and— no, wait! I <em>do</em> remember! There was a base… a launch site, maybe? And I was supposed to destroy it. No, protect it? Gah!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hey, it's alright. If you don't remember then there's no point in pushing it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… <em>guess</em> so? Everything’s kind of… jumbled up in here, you know?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 taps her head twice with a claw, producing a faint metallic echo.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It's so… incredibly annoying, just like the ruskies.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I imagine it must be.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Anyway, my turn. What's this place?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> A specialized facility in the west coast of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 grimaces in disgust]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Eww, California…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I take it you’re not a fan?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> The views are nice, bur they're just <em>so</em> many hippies. I hate them. They're all just a bunch of good-for-nothing socialists who hate their own government, can you believe that? It's disgraceful, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I see… well, you won’t be interacting with any hippies here, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Good. I'd burn them to a crisp if I could.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Duly noted. Let’s stay away from any incineration talk for now, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Ugh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Great. Now, could you perhaps shed some light on who created you, and for what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. SCP-8672’s posture becomes tense. Her head lowers slightly, and she begins scraping at the floor again, slower this time.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Yeah, no. That’s classified.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Classified? By whom?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That's also classified. But since you wanna know so badly, I was made by the brightest minds this nation has ever birthed for the sole purpose of serving it and its citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That's a bit too self-important, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Self-important? <em>Self-important?!</em> I’ll have you know that I was made to defend freedom, justice, and the American dream! That’s not self-importance, that’s duty!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Alright, alright, sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hmph!</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 sits down, her tail wrapping around her hind legs, while her face frowns in indignation. After a few seconds however, her facial expression softens.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> But… since you've been so nice to me so far, I suppose I can let this one slide.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Right, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You're very welcome, miss. Now, if you don't mind, it's <em>my</em> turn to ask a question.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sure thing, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Who are you, exactly? Who do you work for? The Air Force? The CIA?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Neither.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> We're a… private research institution that's allowed to operate on US soil. We aren't affiliated with the government in any official capacity.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh… oh! Wait! I do know you! You're— the uh… "ess pee cee" or something, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Eh, close enough. But, correct.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Ha! I knew that already! I just… uh… wanted to… confirm my suspicion, yes!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Right, sure thing. You mentioned having siblings earlier. Are they like you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Of course they're like me. Well… not <em>exactly</em> like me. I was the smartest, and the fastest, and the best-looking. It's hard to replicate perfection, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Where are they now? Do you remember any of their names?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 suddenly goes silent. Her eyes begin to squint again.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh, you know, just curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Well, sorry miss, but I won't just snitch on my siblings like that. Specially not to someone I can't even see. What's up with that anyways? I know I'm pretty scary, but not <em>that</em> scary.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It's just… standard protocol. You know, for security.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Security from who? You guys took all of my weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> You're still a 15 feet tall fire breathing reptile.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… uh… alright, touché. I guess I can humor one of your questions for outsmarting me, but don't get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Trust me, I won't.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 rolls her eyes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> My siblings, hmm. They're… they're called…</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> You don't remember them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> No, I do. I remember them, and their names, but I… don't remember which is which. 11… Or 12? One of them was loud and always roared too much. 13. She was blue, maybe? She liked flying loops. We used to… we…</p>
<p><strong>[Silence again. SCP-8672 remains motionless for several seconds.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sentinel?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Are you feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Uh, yeah. I… guess my mind just got lost for a moment. It's not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Are you sure? We can continue this at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 opens her snout but says nothing. She then closes if again.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yes, I… think I'd like that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Very well. Thank you for your time and cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, whatever.</p>

<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is standing in the center of the chamber, wings slightly spread, posture stiff. She appears to be attempting to “stand at attention,” though the gesture is awkward in execution given her size and body structure.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[She clears her throat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh say can you see… by the dawn’s early light…<br/>
What so proudly we hailed… at the twilight’s last gleaming…<br/>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars… through the perilous fight…</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 pauses and narrows her eyes, visibly attempting to concentrate.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> O'er the ramparts we watched… were so gallantly… uh… streaming?</p>
<p><strong>[Another pause. SCP-8672’s expression tightens. She takes a deep breath and starts the verse again, slightly louder.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> O say can you see, by the dawn’s early… wait, no, I already did that part. Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 begins to walk slowly in circles. She then glances up at the ceiling after a few seconds.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I know this! I know this! I used to sing it before every mission! We all did!</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 slaps a claw against the floor, creating an audible thud. It begins muttering under her breath.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What the hell comes after the ramparts?! And why were they watching them? Who watches ramparts!?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 lets out a frustrated growl, sits down heavily, and glares at the security camera.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> This is your fault, you know.</p>
<p><strong>[The camera remains stationary.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Don’t look at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>[After a few seconds, SCP-8672 circles a spot on the ground and lays down on it. She then sighs.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/09/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 can be seen walking in circles within the containment chamber while muttering something inaudible. Her wings twitch sporadically.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hello again, SCP-8672.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 stops.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> SCP-8672.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> W… What's that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That's your numerical designation. It's what we give most anomalies in our database to distinguish them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Well, I don't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'm sorry, but it's what I'm supposed to call you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I. Don't. Like. It.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Fine. Sentinel it is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> See? Isn't that just way better than your weird, four digits code? Anyway, back already?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It’s been almost a week since our last interaction, actually.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It has? Huh, time’s weird in this place.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I imagine it must be for you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It is, especially without windows. Or a clock. Or sunlight. Or, I don’t know, <em>anything</em> that makes it feel like the outside world still exists.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Yeah, our chambers aren't exactly designed to be comfortable. Especially not to a dragon, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 scoffs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Figures.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Moving past that, how are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 stops pacing and glances toward the security camera.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Like someone jammed a radio inside of my skull and then broke the tuning knob. It's mostly just static, flickers of stuff, dreams, nightmares, that sorta stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Sometimes. Other times it’s just… voices, or orders, or memories playing over and over like broken tapes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Can you describe them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yes… kinda… well, not really. I mean, I could <em>try</em> to, but it would just be a jumbled mess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hmm, understood. Do you feel ready for another round of questioning?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Eh, sure, it’s not like I’ve got anything better to do. So, ask away, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Thank you. I’d like to go back to something you said during our last interview— about you knowing us. The Foundation, I mean. What do you know of us?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent and places a claw on her lower jaw.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> To be honest, not a whole lot; and if I did then I don't remember. But I get the gist and basics of what you guys do.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …But so does everyone else in the world, so now I feel kinda dumb. What I <em>do</em> remember though is that we were told to ignore you if we ever came across you lot, unless ordered to engage in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Huh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> But I don't understand why we'd be ordered to do that. You guys are an American organization, not a… <em>commie</em> one.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> You're right, we aren't. But we also aren't a government agency either.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> So you’re… independent? Freelancers?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> More like global custodians. We protect people, all people.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 narrows her eyes. Her tail flicks behind her.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That sounds dangerously close to neutrality.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I suppose, depending on how you look at it. Our priority is protecting people, not involving ourselves in politics.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hmph. I never liked fence-sitters. Pick a side or get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Things are not always so simple.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> But they are! You either have enemies or you don't. And if you don't know who your enemy is, then you’re probably the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s a… stark worldview.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> No, it's a clear worldview. You can't hesitate when you're airborne at Mach 3 with surface-to-air missiles locking onto your flank. You either act or die.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That may be true in war, but things aren't always so black and white.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hmph, maybe not for you, but I was made to destroy the enemies of the most righteous country in the world, and I'm damn good at it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> And what happens when there’s no one left to fight?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 stops moving. Her gaze shifts upwards, and for a few moments, she remains silent.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Uh… I don't know. Something cool… maybe. I never really thought of that. But I'm sure I'll be assigned to do something afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 averts her gaze for a moment, her tail twitching slightly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That uncertainty bothers you, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Kinda. I’m… not supposed to feel uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> But you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Maybe. Sometimes. Look, I don't like thinking about this kinda stuff, alright? It's complicated, and I wasn't made to wax philosophical.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That's perfectly fine by me. It's not like I graduated in dragon psychology anyway. I'm just here to ask you some questions and maybe make your stay more tolerable if you're cooperative enough.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> So, what? I talk, you write it down, and then someone upstairs decides if I get an extra pillow? Is that how it goes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Basically. Or would you rather just have four grey walls to stare at all day?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 turns her head towards the camera, then moves her eyes around to inspect the chamber.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I'll… think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Don't worry, you have all the time in the world.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is looking directly at the entrance of her containment chamber as puffs of smoke continually exit from her nostrils.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Good day, Sentinel. How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I'm trapped in a gray room with only a bowl of water and nothing else to do. How do you <em>think</em> I'm feeling right now, doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Fair enough. What have you thought of my offer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Can I leave?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> So… you want me to spill the beans and betray my country in exchange for not getting bored to death in this place?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I wouldn't put it like that, but it's rather accurate.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I'm not going to lie to you, doc. That's pretty cruel, and also very tempting.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hey, it's not like I'm asking you for state secrets. I just want to understand you, the reason you were created, and what your creators hoped to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… alright. I guess I won't get in too much trouble for disclosing just the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'm listening.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I was… well, my siblings and I, were made as part of a national security program by the DoD. At least, that’s who funded it. The actual brains behind..</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 gestures theatrically at herself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> <em>All</em> of this, and the weapons you took from me, were some guys from a company called "Protheus-whatever," or some weird name like that. Maybe. I don't remember their name too well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I… think I have a good idea who they may be. What was the goal of the project?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Nope, nuh uh, I am not telling you that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Because that part <em>is</em> a state secret. There would be a lot of trouble if the commies found out, and I'm not taking any chances with this, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Alright, understood. What can you tell me about your training?</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Not a lot? I don't remember much of my formative years. A lot of my memories are like a blur after I got shot down, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Flashes. Targets on a screen. Drills. Videos of a bunch of presidents saying stuff. I remember sometimes being chastised, other times praised. You know, standard military training.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That… doesn't sound very standard.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Eh, true. Mine was far more intense, but… what do I know? It's not like I've got a point of reference to know what's intense and what isn't.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s fair. I suppose context is hard to come by when your entire life was orchestrated behind locked doors.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah. Like trying to read a book after someone tore out all the middle pages and lit them on fire.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Do you remember anything from before the training?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What part of "my head's a damn mess after I fell from the sky" do you not get, doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Fair point. But memory loss can be unpredictable. Sometimes bits come back when you least expect them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> If they do, I’ll let you know. Assuming they’re not just another fever dream wrapped in one-liners.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s all I can ask for.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, yeah. Next time bring me books.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Books? Alright. Any preferences?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Fantasy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sure, I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Still here. Still not exploded. Go, me.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 sits upright, her tail curls tightly around one of her legs. After a pause, she picks up a book, flips it open, reads a single paragraph, and shuts it again with a groan.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> This guy sounds more confused than I am.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 tosses the book to the side, narrowly avoiding its water bowl. A short while later, she retrieves a stray paperclip that was tucked between pages. She holds it up to the light, seemingly fascinated.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Wonder what I could do with this…</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 attempts to bend the paperclip into a crude shape, possibly a triangle. When it fails to hold form, SCP-8672 huffs and flattens it between two claws like a press. She holds the result in her palm for a moment before flicking it across the room.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Useless.</p>
<p><strong>[At 17:02, she approaches the chamber wall and leans against it with a grunt, her wings tucked low. She traces the edge of a previous scratch in the concrete, making the mark deeper.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong>"One ring to rule them all"… yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>[At 17:10, SCP-8672 lies down again and rests her lower jaw on one of claws, her eyes are fixed on the door. She does not move for the remainder of the observation period.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/20/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is lying on the ground next to a pile of stacked books. She is currently reading "The Fellowship of the Ring" by J.R.R. Tolkien.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I wasn’t expecting you to start with Tolkien.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah well, t's the one that grabbed my attention the most… even if there aren't dragons in it. I like the dwarf though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Gimli?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah. Short, angry, loud. The guy knows what he wants and doesn’t waste time with nonsense. I can respect that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I had a feeling you’d find someone to relate to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Don’t push it, doc.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner laughs. SCP-8672 flips a page delicately with the tip of a claw.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It's weird, y'know. Reading something that has nothing to do with training or politics. It's like… my brain doesn't know what to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s kind of the point. Stories are just another form of escapism.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hm. Escapism is when people use things like books, movies, or games to take a break from reality. To forget about their problems, even if just for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Huh. I don't think I've ever had that before. Even when I was "off duty," they always had me watching something. Studying enemies, reviewing tactics… But this is just a bunch of guys walking around talking about rings and trees and swords and magic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It can be a bit weird, I imagine, but not everything has to be part of a mission. Some things are meant to just… be experienced.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I'm… I'm not sure I like it, but I don't hate it either. It's complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s okay. Complicated isn’t a bad thing, or so people say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Maybe for humans it isn't, but I'm not supposed to feel like this. I'm not supposed to be reading this. I'm not… I'm not supposed to even be here. I should be out there, you know, killing the bad guys and protecting my country from the red menace.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> "Your" country? I doubt that you'd be considered a citizen in any state.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, yeah? Tell that to the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-8')">8</a></sup> I was made in this country. I'm as America as every other citizen here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'm pretty sure that the Fourteenth only applies to humans and not to dragons.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Well, many people didn't consider blacks to be human either, and look at them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Wha— I… that… <em>moving on.</em> You do realize that there's no red menace anymore, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …What?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Dr. Turner sighs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Crap, you didn't know, okay.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Know what?</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner clears her throat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sentinel, the Soviet Union collapsed recently. The Cold War is… well, it's over.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence. SCP-8672 remains unresponsive for several seconds.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> The… the USSR officially dissolved on December of last year. Gorbachev stepped down. There’s no more Iron Curtain, or red menace. Or at least, it's not as big.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. SCP-8672 slowly closes the book and rests her claw on top of it. Her wings shift, folding in tightly as shr stares at the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> So… we won?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Technically, yes. But it wasn’t like World War II. It just… ended one day.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You mean… there was no fanfare? No mission accomplished? Just… gone? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Politics really aren't as interesting or exciting as Hollywood makes them out to be.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>[More silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Are you feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Huh? Oh, yeah, uh-huh, definitely. I just… I don't think that I want to continue talking anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s… alright. We don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 doesn't move or respond.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That means… that means we won. That means <em>I</em> won, right?</p>

<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is lying on the ground, hiding her head beneath her wings.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Good day Sentinel, are you feeling better now?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 does not respond.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sentinel.</p>
<p><strong>[Several seconds pass. SCP-8672 shifts her body slightly, but keeps hear head hidden. Her voice comes though as muffled through its wings.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Yeah, should have expected that. I guess I should—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You know what’s funny, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> No, I don't. What is?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 moves her wings off of her head, and looks at the recording camera directly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I always thought I’d go out in a blaze of glory. You know, fire in the sky, teeth bared, screaming at missiles and red banners in my wake. I thought I’d die for something, and instead, I just woke up in a cage one day, and someone told me the war was just over… just like that. One second I’m gearing up to be history’s biggest patriot, and the next I’m an afterthought in a cold box somewhere underground in goddamn <em>California</em> of all places.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I imagine it must be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It’s more than that. It’s… like finding out the world kept spinning without you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That must feel… hollow.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It’s straight up insulting.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I can understand why you'd feel that way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Can you, though? Really? Have you ever woken up and realized that your entire purpose in life is just gone?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …No, I haven’t. But I do know what it’s like to question your path. To wonder if all the work, all the time, was worth anything.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 shifts, finally lifting its head.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah? And what’d you do when that happened?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I kept going. I found something new, slowly, painfully. You don’t just move on overnight, but you don’t have to stay stuck either.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Were it so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It's not. Believe me. But it is possible if you try.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/29/1993</p>
<p><strong>Anomaly Involved:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> During a routine feeding session, SCP-8672 prematurely regained partial consciousness despite the prior dispersal of aerosolized sedatives. The entity exhibited sudden and immediate violent behavior toward all attending personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Key Events:</strong> See below.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Camera feed from the containment chamber shows three personnel in protective gear entering the chamber with a feeding apparatus. SCP-8672 is lying prone, apparently sedated. Its respiration is heavy but stable.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technician Alvarez:</strong> Alright, you know the drill. Let's keep this quick.</p>
<p><strong>[The team wheels the feeding apparatus toward SCP-8672. As Technician Jones begins inserting the tube into SCP-8672's throat, its left wing suddenly twitches.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technician Jones:</strong> Hold up. Did you see..?</p>
<p><strong>[Without warning, SCP-8672 snaps its head upward and lashes out with its right wing. The strike impacts Technician Alvarez in the chest, throwing him several meters into the chamber.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Security Officer Daniels:</strong> Shit, back, back! It’s awake!</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 thrashes violently, taking out the feeding tube from its maws. It then proceeds to bite down on Technician Jones' left arm, shaking him violently. Security Officer Daniels attempts to intervene, striking at SCP-8672’s snout with a shock baton. SCP-8672 releases Jones but immediately pivots and clamps its jaws onto Daniels’s left shoulder, lifting him briefly before slamming him to the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technician Jones:</strong> My arm— my arm!</p>
<p><strong>[Technician Jones attempts to crawl away, leaving a trail of blood. SCP-8672 rears back, preparing another strike, but collapses abruptly as secondary sedative systems are triggered via remote dispersal from the control room. SCP-8672’s thrashing subsides, and within 30 seconds it is fully incapacitated.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Damage Evaluation:</strong> Technician Alvarez suffered multiple rib fractures, a pulmonary contusion, and internal bleeding due to the blunt-force trauma caused by SCP-8672’s wing strike. He is currently in intensive care.</p>
<p>Technician Jones suffered severe lacerations and severe crushing trauma on his left arm. Surgical amputation of the damaged limb was deemed medically necessary.</p>
<p>Security Officer Daniels suffered multiple bite wounds to his left shoulder, clavicle, and upper torso. Extensive tissue damage was noted, but no major arteries or organs were affected.</p>
<p>The apparatus used to feed SCP-8672 suffered partial damage, but it is still operable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The incident prompted a meeting between some of Site-52's administrative personnel and Dr. Emilia Turner to discuss the event and which measures should be taken in relation to SCP-8672 as a result of it.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/30/1993</p>
<p><strong>Attending:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Director Nathaniel Blake</li>
<li>Containment Specialist Alexander Dwight</li>
<li>Doctor Emilia Turner</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> I generally don't do this in order to keep some professionalism between me and my peers, but I feel that the situation demands it: I fucking told you so.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> This is not the time for that, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> No, I <em>did</em> tell you. I explicitly warned all of you that something like this would happen sooner or later, and lo and behold, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Dwight, I get your point. But three people are in the ICU right now, rubbing salt in the wound isn’t going to help.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> I'm not "rubbing salt," Emilia. I'm pissed off. There's a difference. We were sitting on a powder keg and we just kept tapping it with a hammer hoping it wouldn't blow up, and it did.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> This isn't very productive. We need to focus on the actual issue at hand instead of complaining that it happened.</p>
<p><strong>[Dir. Blake turns towards Researcher Turner.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blake:</strong> Has 8672 calmed down?</p>
<p><strong>Turner:</strong> For now. She’s heavily sedated, should be under for several hours at least..</p>
<p><strong>[Dir. Blake then turns towards Containment Specialist Dwight.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Damage report?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Not much. A wreked feeding apparatus and, as she said, three people in the ICU. One tech caught a wing to the ribs, the other two were mauled. One of them’s going to lose an arm.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> …Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Hey, on the bright side, there weren't any deaths. Considering what it did last time, that’s almost a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Maybe not a miracle. She didn’t go all out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I've been reviewing the security feed. The strikes weren’t random. They were heavy, yes, but pulled short. Every time she had a clean chance to kill, she stopped just shy of that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Someone’s going to lose an arm because of those “pulled” strikes. How can you call that "holding back"?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Because she had all the opportunities in the world to tear them in half if she had chosen to, but she didn't. I’m not excusing it, I'm merely saying it wasn’t blind rampage. There’s a difference</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> So you think it was showing… control?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> In a limited sense. As controlled as a heavily sedated, traumatized, cyborg dragon/wyvern hybrid can be, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Jesus Christ. You’re giving it credit now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'm giving her context. Understanding intent is part of our job, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> <em>It.</em> Not <em>"her."</em> That thing is a weapon, not a colleague. Besides, our job is to keep people safe, not to psychoanalyze a dinosaur with PTSD.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Enough, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>[Dir. Blake exhales sharply and pinches the bridge of his nose.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> We need to figure out what the hell happened and reassess its containment procedures in the meantime, alright? And we can't do that by bickering at each other like children. So, I'll just ask this once: does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>[Silence for a few seconds. Containment Specialist Dwight then raises a hand.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> How about we just keep it sedated all the time? It doesn't need to be awake to eat. And as we've seen, it both can't and won't tell us anything of value, so why even bother with the interviews anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> That’s not viable long-term. We don't fully understand how her synthetic brain components process that kind of strain. It's likely that constant sedation at that level would burn her out, or she could just get used to it, and we'd be back at square one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> So what, we just gamble next time it wakes up pissed off?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> No. I suggest we either up the dosage or change the sedative formula and continue doing what we've been doing thus far until a comprehensive investigation into what happened is made.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Unbelievable. You’d rather tweak the recipe than solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I’m just saying that your "solution” risks destroying a potential information source before we’ve learned anything useful.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> And, Dwight, even if I agreed with you, the Ethics Committee wouldn’t. Times have changed, and we can’t just write anomalies off anymore <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8241">now that the public is aware of our operations.</a></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Humane treatment aside, we need pragmatism. Shutting her down isn’t pragmatic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Pragmatic? This is a creature that can melt steel like a hot knife through butter. You can’t manage that like it’s a workplace safety hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> And that's exactly why we can't treat her like she's a monster in a cage, because then she’ll start acting like one.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Alright, that's it. I've made my decision: we'll keep 8672 fully sedated until the report comes out, and then we'll figure out what to do with it afterwards. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Thank goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Understood. For the record, I disagree, but I’ll comply.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Duly noted. This meeting is officially adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log.&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three days after the previous meeting took place, a post-incident investigation revealed that the amount of sedatives that had been dispersed into SCP-8672's chamber prior to the performance of its feeding procedure was considerably below the recommended average dose, and thus had a reduced effect on SCP-8672.</p>
<p>The cause of this was determined to have been human error on the part of the individual assigned to administer the sedatives. As such, the decision to keep SCP-8672 sedated was reverted, and its Special Containment Procedures were altered to include that personnel in charge of delivering the sedative made sure the appropriate dosage was administered.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/03/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-8672 was still under the effects of the sedatives during the conduction of this interview.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is seen lying on her back. Her wings are completely spread, and she giggles occasionally while reaching for nothing with her claws.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Good morning, Sentinel.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 becomes startled and shifts her body. She attempts to stand up straight, however, her body falters and she sighs dramatically.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Mornin' doc. How's it goin'?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'm fine. You?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, y’know… I’m a tad bit uhhhhhhh… Ima— I am… Imma bit high, hehe…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I can tell. Do you feel capable of answering some questions?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672's tail flickers.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Queshons, questions… you got a lotta those eh? Doncha' ever get tired of asking queshtions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Well, it's my job. I don't really have much of a say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Mm. It sure shucks to be you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Only sometimes. Turns out that I really like asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 laughs softly. She then rolls onto her side and squints her eyes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> So, whaddya wanna know now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What the hell happened four days ago?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Mm. Yeah. That.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 sigs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …'Tis the part where I'm supposed to say I don’t remember… <em>o algo</em>,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-9')">9</a></sup> right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I’d prefer if you were honest with me.</p>
<p><strong>[A long pause. SCP-8672 stares up at the ceiling.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Fine. I… was confused. I woke up with ma throat jammed full of somethin'. I couldn't breathe right. There were faces, a lotta faces, but… none I could made sense of. Everything began to move fast… to fast, I think. I panicked. The adre-adra-adre… adrenaline, kicked in. I… I thought I was bein', y'know, killed, so I just… I crossed the line.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> The line?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Reflex. Fight or flight, ya get me? But I can't… I can't do the flight part anymore, eh?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 chuckles, then begins to cough.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I didn’t wanna hurt ‘em. I saw… I saw their eyes doc, they all were scared shitless. I pulled back when I could. I bit one of 'em, but I let go. I didn’t finish it. You saw that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I did. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You… you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I believe that you tried to hold back. I also believe you’re dangerous when cornered.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 laughs bitterly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That's just weapons for you, doc. Build somethin’ to kill, it’ll kill.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> You think of yourself as a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Aren’t I? It's what I was made to be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Maybe, but weapons don't make choices. You did by choosing to spare the lives of those people.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> But… but that's worse, right? Allat means is that… is that I knew. It means that I <em>chose</em> to do it regardless. It don't matter if I didn't go all the way. Don't matter why I did it, or if I was scared, or how much I don't wanna do it… I still hurt 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> But it does. Intent matters, Sentinel. Intent is the difference between an accident and a senseless act of violence.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yah well, tell that to the people I almost ate. “Oh I'm sorry, my bad. I just have some real bad PTSD goin’ on.” Is that gonna make 'em feel any better?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> No… probably not.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is quiet for several seconds. She folds her wings around her body like a cocoon.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hey doc, you think I should just… y'know, get put down?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …No, no I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Because you’re something we don’t fully understand yet, and that means there’s still a chance to learn from you, maybe even help you. But that can’t happen if we just shove you into the trash bin. Besides, we keep worse things around. In comparison to those, you're not really that bad.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 laughs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Damn, "not that bad" huh? That's some real high praise.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I’m just being honest with you. You’re dangerous, yes, but you’re also self-aware and regret what happened. That’s a lot more credit than I can give to half the other anomalies contained in this place.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Regret don't fix any broken bones, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> No, but it’s a start.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Proposal for Psychological Evaluation – SCP-8672</p>
<hr/>
<p>Liaison Heller,</p>
<p>I’m writing to formally propose the assignment of a qualified Foundation psychologist or psychiatrist to SCP-8672.</p>
<p>Over the past week, SCP-8672 has demonstrated pronounced signs of psychological distress and depression. While some of this behavior could be attributed to the damage sustained by its brain, there are substantial reasons to consider psychological trauma as a primary factor. SCP-8672 is sapient and, I believe, capable of engaging with therapeutic dialogue.</p>
<p>If nothing else, such an intervention may aid in its behavioral stability and reduce the risk of further incidents.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Proposal for Psychological Evaluation – SCP-8672</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dr. Turner,</p>
<p>Thank you for your submission. I appreciate your initiative and continued professionalism in handling a case as complex as SCP-8672.</p>
<p>Having said that, I must emphasize that the Ethics Committee approaches such decisions with caution, and the fact that SCP-8672 is a non-human entity with highly aggressive tendencies still remains. Introducing psychological personnel to the subject, particularly in a therapeutic capacity, poses non-negligible security risks. If a mental health professional <em>were</em> to be assigned to SCP-8672 and subsequently harmed, it would not only endanger the individual, but also jeopardize Site-52's entire operational integrity, as we have seen happen twice already.</p>
<p>Before I escalate this proposal to proper Committee review, I’ll need a revised version that includes safety protocols and measurable outcome goals.</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>Marcus Heller<br/>

<p>Liaison Heller,</p>
<p>While I recognize the inherent risks associated with my proposal, I believe that inaction poses an even greater risk. SCP-8672 is not simply dangerous; it is actively suffering. If we want to control or understand it, and what it was made to be, then this is the next logical step.</p>
<p>Attached is the revised proposal, including outlined contingency procedures and performance benchmarks.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Dr. Turner,</p>
<p>The Committee has reviewed your revised proposal. Conditional approval has been granted.</p>
<p>A provisional assignment has been authorized for Dr. Elaine Marris (Level 4, Xenopsychology Specialist, Dragonology Department), with preliminary sessions to be conducted in a reinforced room equipped with an observation chamber. You are to oversee all sessions and remain as the primary liaison to the Committee regarding the evolution of SCP-8672’s psychological condition.</p>
<p>I hope, for your sake, that you're right about it.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/14/1993</p>
<p><strong>Attending:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Director Nathaniel Blake</li>
<li>Containment Specialist Alexander Dwight</li>
<li>Dr. Emilia Turner</li>
<li>Dr. Elaine Marris</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The group is seated in the Site-52 administrative conference room. Director Blake has a notepad in front of him; Turner and Dwight are on opposite ends of the table. Marris sits beside Turner, reviewing a folder.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Thank you all for coming on short notice. I’d like to formally welcome Dr. Marris to Site-52. She’ll be serving as the assigned psychologist for SCP-8672, pursuant to the Committee’s conditional approval.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Appreciate the introduction, Director.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> About time the Dragonology Department got involved in this mess. Took you guys long enough.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Oh, no. We've been involved since day one. Every dragon related anomaly falls directly under our purview.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Sure doesn't seem like it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Our involvement's been from afar. We've been handling the investigation for 8672's connection with Pentagram, while you guys take care of her physical containment. Just because it doesn't seem like we're doing anything doesn't mean that we aren't doing something.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Enough. We’re not here to argue jurisdiction. We’re here because the Committee wants a controlled psychological intervention, and Dr. Marris is here to provide it.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris puts her folder on the table.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Right. I’ll be blunt: 8672 is in bad shape. Brain trauma aside, she's showing classic signs of PTSD; depressive episodes, and — if I'm reading Turner’s observations correctly— a deep identity conflict. You can sedate it all you want, but that won’t solve those underlying problems.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> So what, you’re going to talk it into behaving?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I’m going to talk to her like the sapient being she demonstrably is. That’s the mandate I’ve been given, and that's how we've approached dragons in general.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Maybe, but were any of those other dragons purposely built for war?</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner leans forward.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I don't think she's necessarily saying it'll work, Dwight. But pretending that she's just a weapon won't work at all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> It almost killed three people. Sorry for not being fully on board with treating it like a puppy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> And yet, she didn’t finish the job. That tells me there’s something still in there worth saving.</p>
<p><strong>[Director Blake raises a hand before Dr. Dwight can reply.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> We’re not going to resolve that debate right now. The point is, this is happening, so arguing about it is practically a waste of our time. Marris, you'll be given everything you neeed. Turner, you'll be observing their interactions. Dwight, I expect you to make sure that everything's working as intended before Marris goes in.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you if something goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Don't worry about that. If something does happen, the first thing I'll do is go to your office and sign my resignation letter in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Dwight leans forward.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Alright, bet.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris audibly clears her throat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Ookay. I’ll prepare my first session outline and submit it for review. With luck, we’ll have something constructive to show for this instead of another incident log.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Good. That’ll be all for now I suppose. Meeting adjourned.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 wakes up. She is disoriented and alert, and looks around frantically while walking towards the nearest corner.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What the…</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 then looks up at the observation chamber and stares directly at Dr. Marris.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Ehh, not quite. My name is Elain Marris, I’ve been assigned to assess your mental state.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Assigned by who?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Sorry, but I can't disclose that information. They're a pretty big deal though, that much I can say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, great, you're one of <em>those</em> people. Classic spook response. What happened to Turner?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I'm not replacing her, if you're wondering. She'll just be taking a more hands-off approach for a while. Think of me as a second opinion of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You make it sound like I'm a car engine. "Check the fluids, tighten the bolts, make sure the death-lizard isn't spiraling into madness." Hell of a checklist.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Well, you <em>are</em> a volatile, heavily augmented, and traumatized combat asset with overtly nationalistic tendencies and unresolved identity issues. That does requires some form of oversight.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence. SCP-8672 moves slightly, her tail coils along the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Wow, you don’t pull any punches, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I find honesty more effective than flattery.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Cute, but you still haven't earned the right to be in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I’m not trying to be in your head, Sentinel. I’m trying to understand where you're—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Nope, you don't get to call me that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Very well, SCP-8672 it is then.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …I take that back.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris smiles and takes some notes.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Okey dokey. Let’s start simple, shall we? How have you been feeling lately?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Like I was just… a tool made to be used up and abused by history and then thrown away in a padded cell like trash when I'm no longer useful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Are these feelings persistent?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Lady, have you ever woken up one day knowing that the entire reason for why you exist is just gone? Yeah, they tend to stick around.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Can't say I have. What have you done with those feelings?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Ignored them by reading a damn book. That’s what I’ve done. I've been reading about elves and hobbits on some suicidal trip over a piece of magical jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> And did that help?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Maybe. I don't know. It gave me something to think about that wasn't me, or the walls around me, or the Cold War, or the fact that I don't even know how old I am anymore and can't figure out which of my siblings is which.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> So it did help.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 snorts.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You have a sense of humor, I'll give you that. I still like the doc better though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> That’s fine, I’m not here to win a popularity contest.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Then what are you here for?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> To evaluate your mental state, as I've said, but also to determine when — or if — you're ready to take the next step.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What next step?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You know. Lessened containment measures, more privileges, perhaps even integration.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …So I <em>am</em> a tool again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Only if that’s what you choose to be. No one’s forcing your hand— er, claw, but if there’s something useful you can offer the world beyond mindless aggression, we’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Hmph. “Freedom” served on a leash.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> It’s still more than you had before, is it not?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 does not respond immediately. Her breathing slows.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… guess so. Tell the doc I said hi.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I will.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> And tell her…</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Never mind.</p>

<p><strong>[IRRELEVANT INFORMATION OMITTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, it's you… again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Yup, it's me. Again. You're going to be seeing me around a lot.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Lucky me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I know it may be frustrating, but think of it this way: consistency helps with trust. And trust helps with progress.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Trust, huh? You’re really leaning into the therapist angle today.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Well… I <em>am</em> a therapist.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You sure you're not just here to poke around my brain until something breaks?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Only if what breaks was already cracked to begin with. I'm here to help you make sense of things, whatever shape they’re in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Cute. Real clinical. I bet that line works great on broken soldiers and sad executives.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Sometimes. Sometimes it doesn’t. You’re not exactly a typical case, even for my standards, if that wasn’t clear.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, no kidding. Depressed fire-breathing reptile with a severe case of identity crisis. Real textbook, I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Eh, I’ve treated worse.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Lady, if you’ve seen worse than me, I feel sorry for your file cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You should see what’s over at <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-17-hub">-17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Uh, never mind.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 sighs and shifts slightly, her claws scrape gently against the concrete.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …You know, I used to think the worst thing that could happen was getting captured. That the commies would tear me apart, dissect me for my tech, and leave my wings pinned up in some Kremlin lab. But now? I think the worst thing might be this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Isolation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Irrelevance.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> That's a heavy word.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I mean, it fits, does it not?. You don’t make something like <em>me</em> unless you plan to use it. Purpose, deployment, glory. All those words were drilled into my brain the moment I came out from that egg, and they just don't mean anything anymore. I’m just… a museum exhibit nobody’s allowed to see except a bunch of nerds in lab coats.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You say that like there’s nothing left for you. Just because your mission is over, doesn't mean that you are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Spare me the motivational poster talk.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> It’s not about motivation. It’s about adaptation. You were designed to destroy, sure, but I do not believe that being a weapon is everything you're capable of.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 laughs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What, you think I’m going to become a poet? Start finger painting? Read bedtime stories to orphans?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> No. But I think you’re not the same entity they built in the lab you came from, and I think you’ve started to realize this as well.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent for several seconds. Her tail wraps around itself.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …You keep saying that like it’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I don’t know. It feels like everything they put in me is rotting away. Like there’s this… thing inside, rusted and grinding and falling apart. Every day I wake up a little more broken and a little less sure of what I was supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Some would call that growth.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Well, it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> It always hurts. Identity isn’t a switch you flip, it’s a bruise you poke at until it stops bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 growls.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> What if I don’t want to grow? What if I think that maybe I was better when I knew what I was?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Then I’d say you’re grieving. Not just for what you were, but also for the certainty that came with it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, certainty. That was the good stuff. No questions, no hesitation, just targets and orders and fire, and… and…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> And no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yes, exactly. No second-guessing. Just… clarity. The mission <em>was</em> the meaning and everything else was just noise.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> And now?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Now… now the noise is all I hear. Every time I close my eyes I just ask myself questions I wasn't meant to have.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> The fact that you’re asking those questions means you’re not just a weapon anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That’s the problem, though. I was built for war. You take that away, and I don’t know what’s left. What’s a gun without a trigger to pull?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Maybe something more dangerous. Maybe something freer.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 scoffs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> From where I'm standing, freedom is more of a curse than anything else… which is painfully ironic for me to say.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> If I may, what does the word "Freedom" mean to you?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 opens her snout, but does not say anything. She closes it after a few seconds, and blinks.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I don't know, I never really thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris nods.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Well, to most, freedom is the ability to do what you want, free from oppression. The opportunity to choose what matters next.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 lowers her head.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… don’t know how to choose. No one ever taught me that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Then that’s where we start.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 breathes deeply, smoke curling faintly from her nostrils.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> God, you’re annoying, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris chuckles.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You wouldn't be the first dragon to call me that.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/05/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Elaine Marris</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is standing on her back legs, seemingly inscribing something on the far wall of the chamber with her right talon. Dr. Marris enters the observation chamber and stares at SCP-8672's actions in mild confusion.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 quickly turns back around and sits on the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> W-Who, me? Well uh… y'know, I was um… I was just… look, I'm bored alright?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Hey, it's alright. I'm not chastising you. I'm just curious, it's all.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You like to write, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… guess so. I only did it like, twice in my entire life, but it's not like there's much else to do in here besides talk or read, and I'm getting sick of the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I suppose that’s fair. What were you writing?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 hesitates, her tail twitches slightly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Just… thoughts. Nothing important.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Would you mind reading them for me?</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, I'm… I'm not doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Fair enough. You know, writing things down is a good way to make sense of the noise inside you. It's certainly better than bottling it all up until it explodes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, well, explosions are kinda my specialty… or well, they were.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Maybe once, but you’ve been showing a lot more control lately.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Or maybe I’m just too tired to throw a tantrum these days.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Even exhaustion speaks to progress. You’re not lashing out. You’re thinking and reflecting, even if it stings.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence. SCP-8672’s eyes flick briefly to the wall behind her, where her faint scratches are still visible.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You’re allowed to process things in your own way. No judgment here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I think I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Sentinel, that’s good! That’s <em>really</em> good!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Don’t go jumping around in excitement. I’m not about to start journaling my feelings in cursive or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Trust me, I wouldn’t dream of it. But you are expressing yourself, and that matters, that matters a <em>lot</em> more that you think.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, great, I’m evolving from cold war death machine to angsty teenage poet. What a glow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> You jest, but it is. You're beginning to try and figure out how to survive without a war to anchor you, and that takes more strength than people give credit for.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> That’s the thing though… I don’t know if I want to survive. Not like this. Sitting around, thinking too much, remembering too much. It’s like… every day I get a little smarter, and it just makes everything worse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Because it means you have to confront it all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Not really. I still don't regret killing commies if that's what you're wondering… But if that's all I'm good for, then I worry I'll just become more of a liability than I already am.</p>
<p><strong>[Silence.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You know what’s funny? If you told me a year ago I’d be stuck in a box talking about “processing emotions,” I’d have torched you out of sheer principle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> And now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Now I just sigh dramatically and go back to scratching nonsense into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 gives a low, dry chuckle, then slowly turns back toward the wall. There is silence as its claw traces over a half-finished line.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I… I want to see the doc.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Marris tilts her head slightly to the side.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Dr. Turner?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, her. I… want to see her, just once. Talk to her without glass and cables in the way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> That’s… a big step.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Sure must be. I'm just… I'm tired of talking to shadows and strangers. She was there when I woke up, you know? She was the first real voice I heard that wasn’t shouting orders or reading a clipboard. I think… I think that mattered to me more than I realized at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> I can talk to her. See if it’s possible to arrange something, but I can't make any promises.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Sure. It's not like I'm asking for a field trip or anything. Just her, here, on the ground. For five minutes. No mirrors, no speakers. Just… human to dragon, or whatever this counts as.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> …You miss her.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672’s head drops slightly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Marris:</strong> Hey, that's okay, it's perfectly normal to miss people, even if your only interactions with them was through a disembodied voice.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> If you say so.</p>

<p>Following the conclusion of this interview, Dr. Elaine Marris submitted a formal statement to Site-52's administration to, at the very least, consider the request made by SCP-8672 of speaking to Dr. Emilia Turner in person.</p>
<p>This request caused considerable turmoil and disagreements among Site administration; however, it was ultimately approved by Director Nathaniel Blake two days afterwards, who cited trust in the judgement of Dr. Turner and Dr. Marris regarding the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/07/1993</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following extensive discussion and deliberation between Dr. Elaine Marris, Dr. Emilia Turner and Site-52 administration, a direct, in-person meeting between SCP-8672 and Dr. Turner was authorized with contingencies in place should they be deemed necessary.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The door to the chamber opens, and Dr. Turner enters slowly, wearing no visible protective gear. SCP-8672 sits quietly in the center of the room, with her wings half-furled and her eyes fixed on the door.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[After a brief silence, Dr. Turner speaks up.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Uh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You… actually came.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Well, you asked.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Guess I did. I didn't think they'd say yes, or that you'd come, though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Well, I had to fight for it a little. But it's the least I could do after putting you through all that awkward therapy.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 laughs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You look exactly like I thought you would.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh, really? What did you think I looked like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> A nerd.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Guilty as charged.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 chuckles again.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Still, it’s… weird, seeing you in person.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Trust me, the feeling is pretty much mutual.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner takes a slow step forward, then another. SCP-8672 does not react.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> You’ve… come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Don’t patronize me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I’m not! If I were, I’d be handing you a sticker and telling you how brave you’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Would it be a star-shaped one?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Naturally. Gold foil and everything.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Heh. I might have actually framed that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh yeah, no doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>[They both share a laugh.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> So, I heard you were writing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Yeah, a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Would you share any of it?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 hesitates. She turns her head slightly to the side.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It’s… not good. Like, <em>really</em> not good.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Well, in that case it's a good thing I didn't ask whether it was any good.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 looks at Dr. Turner for a long moment, then breathes in deeply.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Alright, here goes nothing. Just… don't say I didn't warn you. <em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> <em>I dreamed in smoke once.<br/>
Ashes on my tongue, stars in my teeth.<br/>
I flew, not toward battle—<br/>
but away from it.<br/>
No flags, no orders, no war cries.<br/>
Just wind and wings and the ache of old fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> <em>I didn’t know if I was running from something,<br/>
or toward something else.<br/>
But for the first time…<br/>
it didn’t matter in the end.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Silence. Dr. Turner smiles softly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I think that’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> It’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> But it's honest, and that’s what matters.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> You really think there’s anything worth saving in me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> If I didn't think so, we wouldn't be having this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 looks down.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Why do you bother? Why aren't you afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause. Dr. Turner sighs and sits on the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I'd be lying if I said I was sure of the reason myself. You probably don't remember, but you caused an incident that cost many lives. I was lucky to be on the other side of the facility when it happened, but it still hit too close. I even objected after being assigned to handle you because of it…</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …But, life has a way of surprising everyone, I guess. I came to realize that you weren't just another murder monster after getting to know you for a bit, and… well, here we are now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Doc… you're either very brave or very stupid.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner snorts.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Yeah, well, tell me something I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Something you don't know… Well, I guess that I haven't been <em>entirely</em> truthful with you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I mean, I… I remember more than I let on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh, yeah. I always suspected that. I just never pressed you about it. It's good to know, regardless.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Unless there's something you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …Yeah. There is.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 exhales slowly, her wings tightening against her back.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I remember when I went down. More than I ever told you, or anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> <em>Oh</em>, that's, uh… Sentinel, it's fine, you don't have to tell me if—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> No, no, I want to tell you, doc. Opening up is the least I could do after everything you've done for me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Alright, if you wish to. Just, take your time, there's no hurry.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 nods and stares at the floor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …We were going back home after being told to return from duty. Me, my siblings, all of us. We were flying across the desert, happy for once, laughing on the comms, racing each other like we used to. Then—</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 snaps her fingers.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> A missile just… appeared out of nowhere and hit 11, just like that. We were together one moment, and the next…</p>
<p><strong>[Pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> …The others followed closely. I couldn't do anything to save them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent. Her claws scrape the floor as she exhales.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I somehow barely managed to avoid a direct hit from the missile that was following me, but the shockwave almost knocked me out. I lost control of my flight systems and… well, you can guess what happened afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I… I can't imagine how that must've felt.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 forces out a laugh.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Oh, you haven't even heard the best part, doc. None of those missiles appeared on our radar, which means the Soviets pulled some miracle cloaking tech out of their ass, or…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Or those missiles were made specifically to be completely undetectable for you, which means that only Pentagram could have made them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> Bingo, we've got a winner.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Oh, Sentinel, I'm so sorry. I can't imagine how that must feel.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 scoffs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> No, no, it's okay. Why would… why would I feel bad about what happened? I—</p>
<p><strong>[The voice of SCP-8672 cracks.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I mean, it makes… it makes perfect sense, right? What do you do when you've got no more use for something? You just— you just go and throw it in the trash, right?</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 begins to sob. Dr. Turner stands up and moves closer to her, putting a hand on her right forearm, and causing SCP-8672 to recoil.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Sentinel, I won't pretend to understand what you're going through right now, but you're not a thing. You're a living being, and your life holds as much value as mine or anyone else's in this facility.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 is silent; her snout begins to quiver.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What happened to you <em>was</em> monstrous. Nobody deserves to be discarded like that. And… you don't have to keep pretending like it doesn't affect you.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 begins to hyperventilate; her gaze is fixed on Dr. Turner.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8672:</strong> I—I miss them. I miss my s—siblings. I miss all the stupid, loud, dumb little things we did between missions—I keep expecting to hear 12 on the comms telling me to slow down. I… I miss her. I miss all of them. I—</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner leans forward and wraps her arms around SCP-8672's body. SCP-8672 becomes frozen in place.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Hey, it's okay to miss them. It's okay to hurt. You don't have to hold your emotions back.</p>
<p><strong>[SCP-8672 begins to sob again, first slower, then harder, until she breaks into full cries. Dr. Turner remains still the entire time.]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8672-6:</strong> Project Sundown debriefing.</p>
<p>All of the Foundation's knowledge regarding Project Sundown comes directly from the testimony of SCP-8672 and classified documents intercepted and retrieved by operatives of Mobile Task Force Delta-5 ("Front Runners") embedded within Pentagram. According to both sources, Project Sundown initially began as a Pentagram initiative intended to secure uncontested aeronautical superiority for the United States during World War II.</p>
<p>While both the Allies and the Axis powers pursued this goal by either incorporating anomalies into pre-existing aircraft or constructing anomalous vehicles from scratch, Pentagram opted for a more unconventional approach: instead of modifying or manufacturing their own aircraft, they resorted to the cloning and modification of organisms belonging to the <em>Draconiformes</em> family for this purpose.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-10')">10</a></sup></p>
<p>While there are many hypotheses as to why Pentagram chose such an approach, the three most prominent are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of performing cloning and augmentation procedures on dragons is significantly lower than the cost of R&amp;D required for the manufacturing of new, experimental, and anomalous aircraft.</li>
<li>Dragons are lighter and possess far greater maneuverability in the air in comparison to any known man-made aircraft, anomalous or otherwise.</li>
<li>The time and costs of training new pilots are eliminated, as dragons serve as their own pilots.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first generation of subjects produced by Project Sundown (1942–1945) featured minimal cybernetic enhancements, with most modifications being focused on purely genetic and biological alterations, most of which were carried out via carnomancy performed by sanctioned practitioners of the Nälkä faith<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-136127-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-136127-11')">11</a></sup> employed by Pentagram.</p>
<p>The overall effectiveness of Gen-I subjects was heavily dependent on the situation. While they were well-suited for quick dogfights and surprise attacks on enemy territory, they proved highly ineffective in active conflict zones, which led to large numbers of casualties among instances. Nonetheless, Pentagram declared the project a success and, fearing a confrontation with the Soviets following the end of WWII, began production of the second generation of units.</p>
<p>Generation II of the project was the most unique compared to its predecessors and successors. In contrast to Gen-I units, Gen-II units featured heavy mechanical augmentations in addition to more radical biological and genetic modifications, intended to compensate for the rather large shortcomings and limitations of Gen-I subjects. This resulted in its own drawbacks, however, as the few Gen-II subjects that were manufactured required constant, extensive, and expensive maintenance of numerous pieces of paratechnology to function properly. As such, and given the high costs incurred by their upkeep alone, Gen-II units never left the testing stage, and all manufactured specimens were decommissioned two years after their creation.</p>
<p>Given the failure of the Gen-II units, Project Sundown was shelved by Pentagram high command and its funds reallocated to other projects. In 1955, Pentagram began the planning stages of Generation III subjects by order of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who revitalized Project Sundown and repurposed it from a military initiative to a covert black-ops program meant to ensure plausible deniability during the Cold War. Production of Gen-III units officially began in January of 1958.</p>
<p>Gen-III units, much like Gen-II, featured a considerable number of paratechnological implants. However, unlike their predecessors, the modifications of Gen-III specimens were lighter, more cost-effective, and less oriented toward direct combat. Instead, they were geared more toward reconnaissance purposes and surprise aerial attacks on unsuspecting targets and isolated military bases.</p>
<p>Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1993, and in order to prevent any international incidents with the newly formed Russian Federation, Pentagram high command issued the order to retrieve and decommission all active Gen-III units. This action is believed to have been the direct cause of SCP-8672’s crash-landing and subsequent discovery by Foundation assets.</p>
<p>As no further subjects related to Project Sundown have been discovered thus far, it is assumed that SCP-8672 is the sole remaining active Gen-III unit worldwide. How Pentagram managed to acquire genetic material of both <em>Draconis ignis</em> and <em>Draconis ferox</em> remains under investigation by the Foundation's Dragonology Department.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8672-7:</strong> Incident 8672-Gamma.</p>
<p>On July 30th, 1997, a raid was carried out on Site-52 by the Chaos Insurgency; during this raid, SCP-8672 escaped from containment and engaged the hostiles directly. The report of the incident in question has been attached below.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 07/30/1997</p>
<p><strong>Anomaly Involved:</strong> SCP-8672</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> An armed incursion carried out by hostile elements affiliated with GoI-044 ("The Chaos Insurgency"). Following the onset of a facility-wide blackout, the hostiles breached several lower-level access points and initiated armed engagements with on-site security staff. Concurrent to this, Dr. Emilia Turner released SCP-8672 from its containment chamber. SCP-8672 proceeded to engage with hostile forces, contributing directly to the neutralization and retreat of the raiding party</p>
<p><strong>Key Events:</strong> A coordinated series of explosive charges detonate simultaneously, disabling Site-52’s primary power grid and forcing the facility to rely on emergency backup generators. Simultaneously, Chaos Insurgency operatives manage to breach multiple entry points into the facility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security personnel engage the first wave of hostiles. Despite initial resistance, Site defenses were gradually overwhelmed due to numerical inferiority and lack of electronic support systems.</li>
<li>Dr. Emilia Turner makes her way to SCP-8672's containment chambers and inputs emergency access codes, prompting the door of the chamber to open.</li>
<li>SCP-8672 ascends to the upper levels of the facility after a short verbal exchange between it and Dr. Turner. It immediately initiated direct combat with hostile operatives. Recorded behaviors included: the emission of controlled streams of fire to disperse concentrated groups of hostiles, close quarters combat, use of physical intimidation to block access/exit routes, and coordination with Foundation security personnel.</li>
<li>Insurgency forces begin a tactical retreat, abandoning equipment and injured operatives.</li>
<li>SCP-8672 ceased pursuit once Foundation forces regained operational control of upper levels. Without coercion, SCP-8672 voluntarily returned to its containment chamber under Dr. Turner’s direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Damage Evaluation:</strong> 14 Foundation personnel were confirmed deceased; 27 sustained non-fatal injuries. 18 Chaos Insurgency operatives were confirmed deceased; 6 were captured.</p>
<p>Site 52 suffered moderate damage. Primary and secondary electrical systems suffered considerable disruption. Various parts of the facility sustained structural damage during firefights.</p>
<p>A total of three Safe-class anomalous objects were reported as having been stolen.</p>
<p>SCP-8672 suffered minor physical damage as a result from sustained gunfire.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following the conclusion of the assault and the restoration of Site-52’s main power grid, an emergency meeting was convened between Site-52's administrative personnel and Dr. Emilia Turner to discuss her actions.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 07/31/1997</p>
<p><strong>Attending:</strong></p>

<li>Director Nathaniel Blake</li>
<li>Containment Specialist Alexander Dwight</li>
<li>Chief of Internal Security Morgan Hudson</li>
<li>Dr. Emilia Turner</li>

<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Dwight bursts through the door of the meeting room and stares directly at Dr. Turner.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> What in the actual <em>fuck</em> were you thinking?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> What? I just didn’t want more people to die—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> So your answer was to unleash that thing?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> W— Yes! All I did was make a calculated decision, and it paid off.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> That's not your call to make!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Dwight, that's enough. Sit down, or I'll have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>[Dwight hesitates and clenches his left fist. He then sighs and drops into a chair.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Alright, alright, cool.</p>
<p><strong>[Director Blake sighs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Emilia, please explain yourself. Clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Well, Site security was losing ground fast, external communications were down, and backup would take too long to arrive. I made a judgment call based on the situation and options I had at hand.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Hudson:</strong> That was one hell of a call though. 8672 torched three hostiles and mauled two more in under thirty seconds. I won't lie, it probably saved my ass, but it still was reckless.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> Understatement of the century. She intentionally breached an anomaly without any kind of approval. That's a <em>severe</em> violation of protocol.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Dwight sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> You are <em>very</em> lucky that it didn't turn on us, Turner. What if it had, hm? What then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Then I wouldn't be trying to excuse myself in this very moment. Either way, she didn't. You know why I made that decision so quick? Because I've spent years working with her. I know her, and I knew what she would and wouldn't do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> You're admitting to having gambled with lives based purely on intuition.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It's called trust. Maybe you'd understand that if you spent more than five minutes treating her like something other than a bomb with scales.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Alright, enough. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>[There’s a long pause. Dr. Turner sits back, as Dr. Dwight stares down at the table.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> Look, Turner, I’m not saying I agree with your decision, but I’ll admit it likely prevented a higher casualty count. That said, you put this entire Site at risk. You understand that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> I do.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Hudson:</strong> To play devil's advocate for a moment, I can see where she's coming from. We were boxed in and falling back. If 8672 hadn’t stepped in when it did… I might not be here. None of us might be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> I get that, Hudson, but we don’t put out fires with flamethrowers.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Hudson:</strong> I'm sure that she was well aware of the risks. But sometimes you have to take the only shot you have when you're backed into a corner. Lord knows I've been in her shoes enough times to get it.</p>
<p><strong>Die. Blake:</strong> The question is whether this was the right shot to take. We can’t afford to repeat this kind of situation.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Hudson:</strong> If you ask me, it turned out to be.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> That’s not the issue. Whether it worked isn’t the same as whether it was right. Protocols exist for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Hudson:</strong> And sometimes protocols don’t hold up under real fire.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> We are not rewriting decades of procedures based on one lucky incident.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> It wasn’t luck, it was informed trust backed by four years of direct observation, analysis, and interaction. You love quoting the risks, but you don't sit across from her every day, I do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dwight:</strong> And that’s exactly why your judgment’s compromised.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Turner stands slightly, her eyes narrow.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> My judgement is perfectly fine, yours is based on paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Blake:</strong> This conversation is circling, so here’s what’s going to happen: Emilia, your actions are under review. There'll be a formal hearing by the Disciplinary Review Office, and until then, you're suspended. Do note that you're not getting demoted or kicked out… yet, at least</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> …Understood.</p>
<p><strong>Hudson:</strong> For what it’s worth, I still think you made the right call, kid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Turner:</strong> Thanks, but I'm 33.</p>
<p><strong>Dir Blake:</strong> Whether or not it was the right choice, this can't become a precedent. Regardless, this meeting is adjourned. I'll decide what to do after the Office gives a verdict.</p>

<p><strong>Case №:</strong> 1997-08-05-52</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Closed.</p>
<p><strong>Jury:</strong> Thomas R. Shaw, Susan Westbrook, Jacqueline Rios.</p>
<p><strong>Defendant:</strong> Emilia Turner, Senior Researcher, Site-52.</p>
<p><strong>Matter under review:</strong> Unilateral release of contained entity ("SCP-8672") during a hostile incursion by Group of Interest-044 ("Chaos Insurgency") on July 30, 1997.</p>
<p><strong>Corpus delicti:</strong> Dr. Emilia Turner is formally charged with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Violation of Foundation Code of Conduct, Article III, §12 (“Unauthorized release of anomalous entities”)</li>
<li>Breach of Internal Security Protocols, Article II, §7 (“Reckless endangerment of Foundation personnel”)</li>
<li>Dereliction of Duty</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Findings of fact:</strong> Upon examination of testimony, records, and incident reports, the Office finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>That Dr. Turner’s actions, while grounded in a situation of extreme duress, represent a clear violation of established protocols in both the Foundation's Code of Conduct and the outlined procedures for the containment of anomalous objects and entities.</li>
<li>That while Dr. Turner's actions represented a breach of procedure, the decision produced a material benefit by reducing projected casualties and property damage.</li>
<li>That SCP-8672 demonstrated compliance beyond expected parameters, mitigating potential risks that would ordinarily render such an action reckless.</li>
<li>That Dr. Turner’s decision, though effective in this instance, establishes a precedent that cannot be institutionally condoned.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The Disciplinary Review Office finds that Dr. Emilia Turner did, in fact, exceed her authority in releasing SCP-8672 during an emergency situation without command approval.</p>
<p>While the Office acknowledges that the defendant acted under extraordinary duress and with the intention of safeguarding Foundation personnel, intent does not absolve responsibility for procedural violations. Dr. Turner’s reliance on personal judgment in direct opposition of established protocols is deemed severely irresponsible and a lapse of her duties as a Foundation employee.</p>
<p><strong>Sentence:</strong> Reduction of salary by 60% for a period of twelve (12) months. Mandatory participation in five (5) seminars detailing Site security procedures and appropriate responses in the event of a raid and/or containment breach. Formal censure entered into Dr. Turner’s personnel file for a period of five years.</p>

<p>Per Disciplinary Review Office decision, Dr. Turner remains as SCP-8672's lead researcher.<br/>
