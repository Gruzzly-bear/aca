<p>SCP-8229-B.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8229</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The door leading into SCP-8229 is to be permanently blocked off from the public to prevent further incidents. Testing within SCP-8229 must only be conducted with express approval from the lead researcher. SCP-8229-B shall remain in Storage Room 6D at Site-26 until specific testing protocols are solidified.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8229 is the office in Hanson McGillivray's residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico. On 2 July 2024, this was the site of a two-week-long event dubbed Incident 8229 which involved McGillivray and SCP-8229-B.</p>
<p>Hanson McGillivray, hereafter referred to as SCP-8229-A, is a non-anomalous 23-year-old male and the primary victim of Incident 8229. Prior to this event, he was a graduate student at the University of New Mexico studying journalism, described by others as ambitious and creative. In his free time, SCP-8229-A was an amateur writer of science fiction and horror stories.</p>
<p>SCP-8229-B is an Underwood-brand mechanical typewriter purchased by SCP-8229-A. An otherwise standard typewriter, its sole physical peculiarities are the rusted, blood-stained spikes jutting out of its keys, each spike approximately one inch long. These spikes were not present at the start of Incident 8229 and gradually developed as SCP-8229-A continued to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 8229:</strong> On 2 July 2024 at 1500 hours, SCP-8229-A entered his office, closing the door behind him, and sat at his desk to write. After writing with SCP-8229-B for approximately thirty minutes, SCP-8229-A rose from his seat to leave the office, only to discover that the door was locked. He tried unlocking the door before frantically slamming his hands against it, screaming for help to no avail. A few more minutes of panicking passed until SCP-8229-A abruptly stopped, bolted upright, and slowly walked back toward SCP-8229-B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> before continuing his writing.</p>
<p>Over the course of two weeks, SCP-8229-A wrote 204 short, fictional stories - which range from standard sci-fi / horror tales to incoherent ramblings - with SCP-8229-B without stopping to eat or sleep. It is currently unclear whether the events of Incident 8229 were caused by SCP-8229-B or the office itself (i.e. SCP-8229).</p>
<p>Surveillance footage captured the Incident in its entirety. Below are the most notable events that occurred over the two weeks SCP-8229-A was in captivity:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Date / Time</th>
<th>Event</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 July, 1612 hr</td>
<td>SCP-8229-A types with SCP-8229-B, stopping every few seconds to recover from the pain. This goes on for slightly over an hour; eventually, SCP-8229-A is able to type for around ten minutes at a time before stopping. Regardless, he audibly winces with each key press.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 July, 1904 hr</td>
<td>SCP-8229-A finishes his first story. His fingers are covered in a thick layer of blood as he takes the draft and slides it under the office door. He waits for a moment. There is no response. SCP-8229-A sits back at his desk and continues to write, visibly frustrated. Notably, as he does this, a painting on the wall suddenly vanishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 July, 0805 hr</td>
<td>SCP-8229-A finishes writing his 9th draft and slides it under the door. At this point, the nails on SCP-8229-B are about half an inch long, nearly all decorative items in the room are missing, and SCP-8229-A's fingers have bones visibly protruding from the tips.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6 July, 0145 hr</td>
<td>SCP-8229-A's desk and chair are both missing. He writes while sitting on the barren floor. He pauses partway through writing his 21st draft to remove the fingernail on his left-middle finger, letting out a quiet yelp as he does so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7 July, 0504 hr</td>
<td>The office is now completely devoid of any furniture. SCP-8229-A writes while resting against a wall. The dimensions of the room have shrunk by approximately one foot on all sides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8 July, 2121 hr</td>
<td>All of SCP-8229-A's fingernails lay in a small pile next to him. The protrusions from SCP-8229-B are now three-quarters of an inch long. At this point, SCP-8229-A's drafts start to contain bizarre tangents randomly placed within the stories. The room has shrunk by another two feet in all directions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10 July, 0450 hr</td>
<td>In the middle of writing his 174th draft, SCP-8229-A suddenly becomes enraged and violently slams his fists against SCP-8229-B's keys. Blood splatters in all directions as his hands are reduced to torn, fingerless stubs. He severs an artery in his arm and stops to tend to the wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11 July, 0606 hr</td>
<td>The room is now approximately 27 cubic feet, and SCP-8229-A, now extremely thin and visibly shaking, hunches over SCP-8229-B as he writes his 200th draft, pus and blood pouring from what remains of his hands.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>On 12 July 2024, SCP-8229-A typed his final "story" before curling into a fetal position on the floor of his office for the remainder of Incident 8229. The "story" simply read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><tt>i dont want to do this anymore.</tt></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Addendum 8229.1:</strong> On 16 July 2024, authorities were called to the McGillivray residence after SCP-8229-A's girlfriend, who had just returned from holiday, discovered a large heap of SCP-8229-A's stories piled in front of his office door. She opened the door to find SCP-8229-A's corpse mangled beyond recognition and drained of all fluids, and SCP-8229-B sitting next to it in perfect condition.</p>
<p>The Foundation intervened and took possession of SCP-8229-B and the stories written with it. The stories were analyzed to confirm, among other things, whether or not there was a notable improvement in SCP-8229-A's writing. After assessing all 204 written works, it was found that, although the technical aspects of writing improved somewhat (i.e. better grammar, more complex plotlines, the presence of mildly-complex characters, etc.), the objective quality of the works as a whole did not improve.</p>
