            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1873</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1873 is to be kept in a standard containment locker from the 1st to the 18th and from the 22nd to the end of each month. Three days prior to the object's transportation event, it is to be moved to a cold storage chamber alongside a cadaver of the specifications shown further into this document. After the object's transportation event, its contents are to be recovered, logged and stored appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1873 is a metal tin, of the design adopted by Crayola for its Dustless Crayons in 1905. During its initial manifestation, SCP-1873 exhibits slight damage suggestive of natural wear and tear.</p>
<p>SCP-1873 undergoes a repeated cycle. At midnight (local time) on the 21st of each month, SCP-1873 undergoes a transportation event and instantaneously transports itself into physical contact with the nearest human cadaver which conforms to the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cadaver expired as the direct result of the violent actions of another human.</li>
<li>The cadaver expired within the last seven (7) days.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the majority (&gt;97%) of documented cases, SCP-1873 is transported in such a manner as to appear balanced atop the cadaver or placed within the cadaver's grasp. However, in rare (&lt;3%) situations, the object may appear within the cadaver in question, displacing matter from within the cadaver. Any objects contained within SCP-1873 during the transportation event disappear, and are currently presumed unrecoverable. Upon the completion of the transportation event, SCP-1873 is found to contain one or more objects, alongside a handwritten note. Notes are usually written in American English with black or blue ballpoint pen on torn pieces of lined paper, although other forms are not uncommon.</p>
