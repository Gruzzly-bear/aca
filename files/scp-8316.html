<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Pure samples of SCP-8316-1.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8316 is the designation given to the human remains discovered on 27/2/2001. The corpse, while mostly consistent with baseline humans, contained some dissimilarities that were noted during an autopsy.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-8316 is heavily antimemetic</li>
<li>SCP-8316 had dark blood, noted to be thicker than baseline</li>
<li>SCP-8316 had black bone marrow</li>
<li>SCP-8316 had no eyes within its sockets, presumed to have rotted</li>
<li>SCP-8316 lacked a brain</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon discovery, it was noted that its damaged skull and facial orifices contained SCP-8316-1.</p>
<p>SCP-8316-1 is the 1.2 liters of substance that was recovered during cleanup. It is a thick, black, iridescent ooze of unknown nature and unknown origin. It is not yet clear if SCP-8316-1 was a part of SCP-8316, or was a poison within its systems that lead to its death.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the removal of SCP-8316-1 from SCP-8316's skull did not alter the heavy antimemetic cloaking on the remains; it has thus been deduced that SCP-8316-1 is not antimemetic, nor the source of SCP-8316's own antimemetic nature.</p>
<p>The properties of SCP-8316-1 are currently under analysis.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Composition Analysis</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> The following elements have been identified in order of concentration: C (65%), H (8%), S (6%), Cu (5%), Fe (3%), Na (&lt;1%), Br (&lt;1%), K (&lt;1%), Rb (&lt;1%), Se (&lt;1%).</p>
<p>Among these, the remaining roughly 23% of SCP-8316-1's concentration includes a series of anomalous compounds. While majority are chiefly unknown, less then half have been identified to share similar structures and elements to that of various amnestics, and some antimemetic chemicals.</p>
<p>Biological enzymes were found within SCP-8316-1.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
SCP-8316-1 has the potential to be biologically alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Temperature Reaction</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> SCP-8316-1 dried out entirely at 338 kelvin. Substance froze at roughly 254 kelvin, broken off pieces crumpled into powder.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
Attempts to rehydrate and return both experimented samples to their previous states resulted in failure. The samples are considered unable to be retrieved, and will be disposed of.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Microscope Analysis</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> Structures within SCP-8316-1 bared a strong resemblance to neurons, albeit with a far increased amount of thin synapses and darkened appearance. These cell-like structures appear to still be functional and communicating.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
SCP-8316-1 may have held function within the biology of SCP-8316. It is now believed it is unlikely that SCP-8316-1 was the cause of SCP-8316's death.</p>
</div>
<p>Research has come to the conclusion that SCP-8316-1 is biologically alive, and perhaps once held functionality analogues to that of a human brain when SCP-8316 was alive.</p>
<p>See below for details on biological testing.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Re-assessment of SCP-8316's autopsy, secondary analysis</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> SCP-8316-1 was found in mild concentrations within SCP-8316's blood — seemingly having binded to, or replaced, the body's white blood cells — however in higher count than baseline. No DNA could be recovered from the remains.</p>
<p>Bone marrow was found to contain large concentrations, stained completely black.<br/>
SCP-8316's heart, lungs, and liver were the organs with the highest traces of SCP-8316-1. The flesh of these organs was notably stained by SCP-8316-1's dark color.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
It has been noted that SCP-8316-1 was found in heavy concentrations within the liver, leading to the assumption that SCP-8316's liver was attempting to (albeit unsuccessfully) filter it out.</p>
<p>Due to this, it is theorized that SCP-8316-1 was introduced and integrated into SCP-8316 as opposed to being a natural part of the remains.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Exposure to animal brain tissue, exposure to lab-grown human brain tissue</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> SCP-8316-1 sample did not react to animal brain tissue. Upon exposure to human brain tissue, SCP-8316-1 began to sizzle and hiss. The human brain tissue was then dissolved.</p>
<p>Reassessment of SCP-8316-1's mass showed that it increased.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
SCP-8316-1 is now theorized to have dissolved and replaced the brain of SCP-8316 at an unknown point in time. Due to the integration of the exposed tissue, it's also theorized that SCP-8316-1 may be capable of informational assimilation and transfer.</p>
<p>It's now considered that this replacement of the brain and connection to the rest of the body facilitated the spreading of SCP-8316-1 throughout SCP-8316's bodily systems.</p>
<p>How this occurred is currently unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Exposure to human eye, exposure to human eye saturated in SCP-8316's blood</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> Exposure of SCP-8316-1 to a human eye resulted in the substance coating the organ, and spread significantly more rapidly along the severed optic nerves. After approximately five minutes, SCP-8316-1 dissolved all tissues. The eye that was saturated by the blood of SCP-8316 underwent the same covering as the previous test, but was not dissolved.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
It is now theorized that SCP-8316-1 entered SCP-8316 through the eyes, utilizing the optic nerves to reach the brain.</p>
<p>How this occurred is currently unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test:</strong></span> Exposure to adrenaline</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Observations:</strong></span> See Incident Report 8316.1</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implications</strong></span><br/>
Under review.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report 8316.1:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following footage was captured on 10/03/2001 during the scheduled adrenaline exposure test on SCP-8316-1.<br/>
<strong>Test Supervisors:</strong> Dr. Holly Smith-Jones, Dr. Aster Owens, Dr. Samson Darrow</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Smith-Jones fills a syringe with liquid from a graduated cylinder. She flicks it twice to clear air bubbles from the bottom as Dr. Owens watches.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow is a few meters away, taking catalogue of three other set out samples of SCP-8316-1. His back is to the others.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> Gonna try to see if you can get a response from it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith-Jones:</strong> That’s the plan. If it’s some sort of brain-analog, we should see increased activity.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow nods, still faced away. Dr. Owens moves to the microscope, putting his eye to it and adjusting the dials.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Owens:</strong> Alright, should be good and set up for injection.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith-Jones:</strong> Will do. Administering in 3, 2, 1–</p>
<p><em>Dr. Smith-Jones inserts the syringe into the SCP-8316-1 sample, then pushes the plunger.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8316-1 begins to shimmer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Owens:</strong> Jesus Christ how much did you inject—</p>
<p><em>White light begins to pulse across SCP-8316-1 in a slow, rhythmic pattern.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith-Jones:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> It glows…</p>
<p><em>Both individuals fall quiet — staring at SCP-8316-1 as it continues its activity. Dr. Owens pulls away from the microscope to watch it directly.</em></p>
<p><em>After an extended moment of silence, Dr. Darrow turns around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> So did it d—</p>
<p><em>The camera within the room is briefly overtaken by static, though audio remains — a loud splattering sound, a series of crashes.</em></p>
<p><em>When the visual disturbances leave, it appears that SCP-8316-1 has burst. The substance is splattered across the table and microscope. Dr. Smith-Jones is collapsed on the ground, unmoving. Dr. Owens is partially strewn across the table — his eyes have been turned to a dark sludge, which now leaks onto the table and joints the other splatterings of SCP-8316-1.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow screams, clutches his face, and stumbles back. He hits the counter and crumbles down.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few moments, the doorknob turns. Drs. Kari Laine and Lenard Aamar stumble into the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> The hell is happening in here with all tha— Oh my god.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar visibly falters, their eyes widening. Dr. Laine rushes to Dr. Darrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> SAM! Sam, you breathing?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow wheezes, his head loosely turns to Dr. Laine. His left eye is melting into SCP-8316-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> …it's a mask…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> Oh my god it's in his eye — Aamar, where's the emergency phone in here?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar is staring at the motionless bodies of Drs. Smith-Jones and Owens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> They're dead—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> LENARD! Focus! Samson might end up like that too if we don't fucking <em>ACT!</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar makes a distressed sound, and rushes over to the side of the room. They pull the emergency phone from its hook and pushes the red button on the console.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> We need a medic in Lab 2B ASAP — there's been an accident with 8316—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Laine grasps Dr. Darrow's hand and keeps an eye on his face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> Stay with me, Samson — helps on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> It's a succession…</p>
<p><em>There is a pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> Faces — there are faces.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar lowers the emergency phone to stare at the two.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> Laine, what is he—?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> I don't know— I think it's fucking with him.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow's breathing has quickened, his voice cracks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> It's in me. I can feel it — it's worming past my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> Samson, please stay with me. What is <em>happening?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> I'm trying — I'm trying. There's just… there's something in my head. A hallway. I'm standing before someone — talking to them? They're looking past me. I'm not me — a woman. I'm seeing from her.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Laine looks on in confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> She's dressed in a grey suit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> …Wait, that sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> He's describing 8316. The body.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar rushes over to the two, they crouch down next to Dr. Darrow and puts a hand on his shoulder. Both of the man's eyes have become overtaken by SCP-8316-1. His head is drooped down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> No — no, not just that. Antimemetic, grey formal wear. Ain't that the <em>one</em> consistent thing with Nobody? The GOI?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> That seems like a stretch — wouldn't they have realized that when they found the body?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> That exact reasoning could've caused them to brush <em>aside</em> that possibility in the first place.</p>
<p><em>There is silence for a moment, aside from Dr. Darrow's breathing. Dr. Laine then shakes their head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> She succeeded her role.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> …what, like some sort of transfer? Transferring being… "Nobody" to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> Transfer. Succession. <em>[He coughs, black sludge drips down his chin]</em> The corpse. The body they found — it must've already happened.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> So, what? It's transferring to <em>you?!</em> Are you becoming—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> …I don't think there's any role for him to take, there's only one at a time. The body we found must've been the… previous Nobody? So there's already another.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Aamar pauses, squeezing their eyes shut. They back away from Dr. Laine and Darrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Aamar:</strong> He's <em>dying,</em> Laine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> He's not — Sam, you are not going to die — site medical is on the way, they'll do something—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow raises his head, stares at nothing. SCP-8316-1 leaks down his face, thick like mucous. It stains his shirt and coat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> Samson..?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> I… see something.</p>
<p><em>There are footsteps down the hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> Samson, please, please they're almost here — <em>hang in there—</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Darrow lets out a long, shuddering exhale.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Darrow:</strong> <em>…the Compass spins eternal.</em></p>
<p><em>His head drops down. He goes still.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Laine:</strong> …Samson..?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> By the time that on-site medical aid arrived to Lab 2B, Dr. Darrow was already deceased. His body, alongside those of Drs. Smith-Jones and Owens, were cremated after the removal of SCP-8316-1.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8316.1:</strong> On 12/03/2001, all samples of SCP-8316-1 were found to have vanished entirely from Lab 2B's cold storage. Investigation of security tapes discovered a figure with the characteristic informational-blackout silhouette of POI-000<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. The individual, now considered to be an iteration of GOI-000, had entered during the timeframe in which a portion of the site's antimemetic detection system was deactivated for troubleshooting. POI-000 proceeded to locate Lab 2B, retrieve all samples of SCP-8316-1 from cold storage, and depart from the site without detection.</p>
<p>The following note was recovered within Lab 2B:</p>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: black"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do not meddle with what is not yours.</strong></span></span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
</div>
<br/>
The implications of this statement — and Incident 8316.1 — have been considered, and the following actions have been made:
<p>SCP-8316-1 has been reclassified to SCP-8316.</p>
<p>SCP-8316 has been reclassified to POI-000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
