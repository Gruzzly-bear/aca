            <h1>SCP-6647</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6647</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6647 is currently stored in Item Locker 6647 at Site-19. Should any other instances be recovered, they should be stored within Item Locker 6647 after recovery <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and testing</span>. No further procedures are considered necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6647 is a liquid substance stored in a red glass perfume bottle. SCP-6647 is comprised of a lemon extract, a lime extract, an unknown liquid substance, and a human blood-like substance. The bottle is labelled "Imperception de Citron."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The bottom of the bottle possesses a series of unidentified thaumaturgical symbols carved into the glass.</p>
<p>When SCP-6647 is applied directly to the skin using the bottle's spraying device, the wearer's presence is forgotten by other persons at the wearer's discretion. These persons will be unable to perceive the wearer unless they are directly touched. Immediate memories of the wearer will be removed from the memory in a manner similar to the application of a Class-A amnestic. This is true for wearers being viewed on live video feeds and similar media as well, although recordings which are at least ten minutes old are unaffected.</p>
<p>The effects of SCP-6647 will dissipate within ten minutes, or when the subject is perceived by touch. Lost memories of the wearer, as well as memories of perceiving the wearer while under its effects, will return to those affected by it. This often creates brief moments of panic or confusion. The substance emits a Hume level of 100.25 and creates a notably strong citrus scent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-6647 was discovered on 8/1/2022, when Site-19 security personnel were alerted to a suspicious package which manifested in the site's mail room. The package was investigated and found to have a Hume level of 100.5. The package was found to contain SCP-6647 and a note. The note provides the global positioning coordinates of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shades-and-polo-act-one-the-show-is-about-to-begin" target="_blank">GoI-6696,</a> and a request to "clean them up." This information is included for its relevancy to Investigation 6647 to aid investigators and may not be relevant to this article.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6647-1:</strong> Testing Logs</p>
<p>NOTICE: Due to the nature of SCP-6647 and the possibility of successful escape attempts being made by Class-D Personnel, testing is to be halted indefinitely. Requests for testing may be made to your Site Director's office, accompanied by proof of Level-3 credentials.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 01<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 8/1/2022<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-8675309<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Believing the subject had not yet been brought to the testing lab, researchers contacted site security to request a new test subject be brought to them. On realizing this, D-8675309 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons, even while under SCP-6647's effects.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Thanks solely to the labyrinthine nature of this facility, D-8675309 was recaptured without issue, but they very easily could've left if they knew the route. I suggest we halt testing entirely, unless someone on staff would like to volunteer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 02<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 8/1/2022<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-8675310<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin.</p>
<p><strong>Foreword (opt.):</strong> This test was performed as a result of the previous test, prior to the effect wearing off.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Before researchers could contact site security to bring a new test subject, the effect from Test #01 wore off, causing researchers to panic and contact site security to locate D-8675309. On realizing this, D-8675310 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> D-8675310 managed to locate the exit and was apprehended at the front gate after the effect wore off.</p>

<p><strong>General Incident Report: 8/2/2022</strong></p>
<p><strong>Involved Items/Persons:</strong> SCP-6647, PoI-6647</p>
<p><strong>Incident Description:</strong> At 1655 hours, a young man dressed in a top hat and a suit and tie (PoI-6647) entered Site-19 via the primary garage entry while wearing SCP-6647.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> They held the door open as someone left and entered through the opened doorway. An automatic intruder alarm was triggered, however, due to the effects of SCP-6647, site security were unable to perceive PoI-6647 and the person entered the facility. PoI-6647 attempted to navigate Site-19 before becoming apparently lost, at which point the effects of SCP-6647 dissipated. Site security located PoI-6647, who was immediately detained and interrogated. A transcription of the interrogation is included below.</p>

<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> Yeah, alright, fucker. Let me explain something to you. Do you know where you are? Do you know what we do here? We lock things up. I mean we keep hold of some pretty fucked up shit. We kill things just to satiate horrors the likes of which you've never seen. I've killed people, I mean I have fucking slaughtered people. You think you're big game? You think you and whatever little gang you're part of is hot shit? We have ethics committees built just to stop me from breaking you into pieces, but you had better give us something, or I swear to god you will experience a level of pain the likes of which you will never fucking forget.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Patra sits in the interviewee chair, across from Agent Stromm.</em></p>

<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> So.. who's the M.O.M.?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patra:</strong> We don't know much, honest. They're magicians, best as we can determine.</p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> Okay? Why isn't thaumaturgy in here yet then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patra:</strong> Different kind of magic. Like.. like street magic, but real. Pulling rabbits out of top hats and the like. They use odd, jerry-rigged thaumaturgy that we don't understand to cheat some bigger tricks, but in general, it's some new kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> Not sure I'm following.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patra:</strong> Well.. his handcuffs, for example. He didn't flip a little secret lever or pull a key from his pocket. He just got out of them. Didn't pick the lock, didn't pry them off. It's the trick of a street magician, but it's not a trick.</p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> And you know all this because..?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patra:</strong> ..I can't say until the O's get back to me. If you ever come into contact with someone like him again, you need to tell me immediately. Anyone from the M.O.M., anyone who performs this sort of magic. Crash kids' birthday parties if you have to.</p>

<p><em>Roughly ten seconds of silence pass.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PoI-7746:</strong> .. do you like magic tricks?</p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> At least give me something so I don't have to break you entirely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PoI-7746 reaches behind his right ear and holds a set of car keys over the interview table.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PoI-7746:</strong> Are <em>these</em> your keys, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> How.. We patted you down twice, checked every crevice. Where did you get those?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7746:</strong> Well, <em>are</em> they your keys?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agent Stromm inspects them closer, then puts them into his pocket.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-7746:</strong> Are you <em>sure?</em></p>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> Yes, now-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The phone in the observation room begins to ring.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> You stay there. Don't move. You two watch him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Stromm points to the two other security agents in the room.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Stromm leaves the room and joins Dr. Patra on a call with the director of Site-19. PoI-7746 holds out the thumb and pinky finger on his right hand and holds his hand over the microphone in the interview room.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Site-19 Dir.:</strong> -understand you two are investigating some sort of security breach in there, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Patra:</strong> Yes sir, we are.</p>
<p><strong>Site-19 Dir.:</strong> Alright. I keep a tracker planted in the keys to my personal vehicle. To cut to the chase, and I'm not proud to admit this, but I seem to have misplaced them. Tracker indicates they're in that room, though I can't fathom why. I haven't been in there since my early days. Have you seen them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Stromm reaches into his pockets but doesn't find anything.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> Wha- I just had 'em here, sir. I'll get ahold of them.</p>
<p><strong>Site-19 Dir.:</strong> Thanks. I can come down there in a couple minutes and help dig them up. Treat them like they were your keys, alright? See you in a bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PoI-7746 begins grinning. He removes the keys from his sleeve again and holds them over the table as Stromm reenters the interview room.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stromm:</strong> How the h-</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PoI-7746's handcuffs and restraints fall to the ground. PoI-7746 stands from the table.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PoI-7746:</strong> Tadaa! Well, it's been fun, but I have things to do. See ya!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PoI-7746 snaps his fingers. He is obscured by a thick black smoke. After the smoke clears, PoI-7746 is revealed to have disappeared from the room.</em></p>

<p><strong>Additional Notes (opt.):</strong> Fuck Patra, shouldn't have even bothered with her "anger management" trash. Should've done something with him before all this got out of hand. -Security Agent Stromm<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>General Incident Report: 8/3/2022</strong></p>
<p><strong>Involved Items/Persons:</strong> PoI-6647, PoI-7746</p>
<p><strong>Incident Description:</strong> At 0310 hours, PoI-7746 escaped his interrogation room and appeared in PoI-6647's cell. PoI-7746 grabbed PoI-6647 by the arm and snapped his fingers, at which point the two were obscured by a cloud of thick black smoke. When the smoke cleared, PoI-7746 and PoI-6647 are shown to have disappeared and reappeared in the Site-19 Staff Parking garage. PoI-7746 produced a set of keys from his pocket and opened the site director's vehicle. The two climbed into the vehicle with PoI-7746 in the driver's seat, and the vehicle exited the building at a high speed. An escapee alert was sent out to site security, who quickly got into their vehicles within a couple of minutes and chased after the site director's car. For brevity and ease of reading, transcriptions of the recording devices in each vehicle have been spliced together into one, which has been included below.</p>

<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> First chase, kid!? You're gonna love it! Oop, hang on!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-7746 rolls down the window on the vehicle's passenger side.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Vomit on my ride and I throw you out of it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-6647 sticks his head out of the open window and vomits.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - <em>Security Agent Stromm rolls down the driver side window of his vehicle and holds a megaphone out of it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> You two! Pull the car over or we'll be forced to open fire!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-7746 rolls down the driver side window and sticks his left hand out, driving with one hand. He holds his fingers in the shape of a firearm and lowers his thumb like the firearm's hammer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - <em>A 9mm round strikes the vehicle's left rear-view mirror, shattering it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> God damnit!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - <em>Security Agent Stromm picks up the radio in his vehicle. The vehicles reach 90mph.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> All units, suspects are hostile, repeat, suspects are hostile! Open fire!</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Well, that ain't good!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All - <em>Site-19 security opens fire on vehicle 1. PoI-7746 reaches his hand out the window again and continues firing into the other vehicles. A 7.62x39mm round pierces vehicle 1's back windshield and lodges itself in the front windshield.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-6647:</strong> Oh shit! Oh god!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-7746 opens his mouth and pulls a screwdriver out of it, then stabs the screwdriver into the side of the steering column. He pushes the gear shift into neutral and throws the steering wheel to the left, causing the vehicle to spin violently around its center of gravity. The vehicle somehow continues moving in the same direction and at the same speed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Hang on to something, kid!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-6647 is yelling incoherently.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>The vehicle spins around the road erratically, though manages to avoid most gunfire, with most of the bullets striking non-vital portions of the vehicle's hull.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> Somebody call the locals before they manage to drive onto the freeway!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Security Agent Stromm's in-vehicle phone begins calling the local authorities.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>N/A:</strong> █████ Police Department, Chief Handlon speaking.</p>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> This is Chris Sturk for Shield and Cross Prison, we're chasing two escaped convicts! You need to shut down the I-██ immediately!</p>
<p><strong>N/A:</strong> Hah! What, you don't speak to us for months, and now you only call whe-</p>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> God damnit Handlon, do it or I cut so much fucking funding you won't be able to feed your kids! Put up a roadblock after the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>N/A:</strong> Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Okay, kid! I need you to take the wheel!</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-6647:</strong> I- what!? No fucking way!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-7746 slaps PoI-6647 across the face. PoI-7746 then removes the screwdriver from the steering column and pulls the gear shift back into drive. The vehicle ceases spinning and returns to a regular driving orientation, maintaining a speed approaching 105mph.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-6647:</strong> Okay, okay!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-6647 climbs over the divider and into the driver's seat as PoI-7746 climbs out of the driver side window and onto the hood of vehicle.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> What the fuck is he doing!?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-7746 stands on the hood of the vehicle, with his left foot against the passenger side of the windshield. Note that the vehicle's speed has increased to 110mph, which should ordinarily be fast enough to throw PoI-7746 over the roof. PoI-7746 holds his arms out as if holding a rifle.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - <em>Vehicle 3's left front tire is shot by a .22LR round, causing it to pop. The vehicle begins veering to the left uncontrollably, crashing into vehicle 6 and pushing them both off the road.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All - <em>The remaining vehicles open fire on vehicle 1 again. PoI-7746 takes a shot at vehicle 2, puncturing the vehicle's windshield and narrowly missing Security Agent Stromm's left shoulder. PoI-7746 climbs back into the vehicle through the driver side window, forcing PoI-6647 to move back to the passenger side while the vehicle sustains heavy gunfire.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Okay, new plan! Too much gunfire, we lose them in the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-6647:</strong> What!? How!?</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> It's a new trick I learned! Toss me your rit knife!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>PoI-6647 removes his hat and reaches into it, then removes a long knife with a slightly curved blade. PoI-7746 takes the blade from him and cuts PoI-6647 along the upper left shoulder, causing PoI-6647 to bleed a purple liquid. PoI-7746 covers the blade in the liquid, then stabs the blade into the front of the steering wheel, causing the airbag to deploy. PoI-7746 cuts away the airbag and quickly carves a series of thaumaturgical symbols in the steering wheel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>N/A:</strong> Roadblocks are set up, they won't know what hit 'em!</p>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> Good! We'll chase 'em into the tunnel and corner 'em there!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - <em>The vehicle's speed increases at a rate faster than should be possible, eventually plateauing at roughly 195mph.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2 - Stromm:</strong> Keep firing! They're coming up on the overpass tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>1 - PoI-7746:</strong> Meep meep!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All - <em>Vehicle 1 races through the tunnel entrance, at which point vehicle 1's video feed is lost. Bullets begin to strike the entryway to the tunnel, revealing that the tunnel has closed and has transformed into a hyper-realistic painting of the tunnel's entrance. The other vehicles collide with the painting, which has been made on solid concrete. In the painting, vehicle 1 can still be seen driving away from the entrance and out the other side. Due to the collision, five security agents, including Security Agent Stromm, are severely wounded and one is killed. Vehicle 1 does not appear at the other side of the tunnel.</em></p>
