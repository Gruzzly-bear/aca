<p>SCP-375, cognitohazard redacted.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-375</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The shopping mall where SCP-375 is located has been purchased by the Foundation and repurposed as Site 375, a Site for the monitoring of SCP-375 and storage of Safe-class SCP objects. The main sign on the front face of SCP-375 is to remain concealed at all times; test subjects are to be shown photographs during experimentation. Testing of SCP-375 is only to take place on D-Class personnel, who are exempt from <a href="scp-5865.html">monthly termination</a> in order to study the cumulative effects of SCP-375 exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-375 is a former Wells Fargo bank located in Casper, Wyoming. The signage on the building and front door has been anomalously modified to read “Temporal Credit Union” while retaining the original Wells Fargo typeface. A series of eleven humanoid entities (designated SCP-375-A) remain present within the building at all times, equipped in matching uniforms and claiming to be employees of SCP-375.</p>
<p>SCP-375’s anomalous properties manifest when any subject views its main sign and/or interacts with the SCP-375-A instances inside the building. During Phase I of SCP-375 infection, subjects will feel compelled to exchange items of personal sentimental value via deposit and withdrawal. Between 12-24 hours after a deposit has been made, the deposited item will be replaced with an extra-universal object (designated SCP-375-B) that is superficially similar to the original, but apparently from one of many alternate realities. Examples of items that have been retrieved from Phase I tests are provided in the table below.</p>

The author frequently expresses guilt for doing nothing to prevent the deportation and extermination of her friends and neighbors. A note has been added to the author’s signature which reads “To [D-12539] - may Europe rise from the ashes.”</td>

<p>Approximately 80% of affected subjects will not progress past Phase I and will continue to use SCP-375 to exchange their possessions indefinitely. However, 20% of affected subjects will experience Phase II of infection within six months of initial exposure. After this phase begins, SCP-375-A instances will begin asking about participating in the “Temporal Exchange Program”. Consent to participate will invariably be given by all affected subjects by the third time SCP-375-A instances ask about the program. Once subjects agree, they will follow instances to the employee section of SCP-375 and enter the building’s bank vault.</p>
<p>12-24 hours after their disappearance, a humanoid with physical characteristics identical or near-identical to that of the previous subject will exit from the bank. These humanoids (designated SCP-375-C) also appear to come from alternate realities and are often wearing dramatically different attire than the original test subject. Examples of humanoids that have been retrieved from Phase II tests are provided in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 375-A:</strong> In July 2018, it was discovered that Jr. Researcher Ólafsson, a researcher assigned to SCP-375, had been using SCP-375 on himself without authorization from his superiors. After this activity was uncovered and disciplinary action had been taken, close analysis of SCP-375-B instances produced by Ólafsson’s tests concluded that he had likely exchanged SCP object documentation with the SCP-375-A instances. Upon interrogation, Ólafsson admitted this was true and said each copy submitted was a printed documentation of an SCP object which had properties or containment procedures that personally interested him, thus fulfilling SCP-375’s item criteria. Several SCP-375-B instances produced by Jr. Researcher Ólafsson are summarized below:</p>

<td>SCP-375, an anomalous bank which compels subjects to deposit items into it and eventually themselves and their family members. Subjects’ body parts are then withdrawn in various states of dismemberment referred to as “compound interest.”</td>

</table>
<p>The altered SCP-375 documentation was recovered after an SCP-375-C instance similar to in appearance to Jr. Researcher Ólafsson emerged from SCP-375 unprompted. This marked the first known spontaneous manifestation of an SCP-375-C instance without an equivalent "Temporal Exchange."</p>
