<p>SCP-2660.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2660</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2660 is currently held in a standard containment chamber, with an additional set of doors to prevent line-of-sight access to connecting corridors.</p>
<p>Personnel may not take any physical or digital notes while testing SCP-2660, and must instead verbally report all test results to the designated test director (currently Dr. Gently).</p>
<p>All information about SCP-2660 is currently restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance, or personnel approved to work with SCP-2660. <strong>(Updated: See Addendum 2660-1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2660 is a ceramic table lamp which exhibits a self-clarifying infohazard. Awareness of one of SCP-2660's physical properties causes the observer to slowly gain awareness of all its physical properties; this process takes between three hours and two days to complete.</p>
<p>For example, persons viewing only a small portion of SCP-2660's surface can identify the object as a lamp. Images that have been extensively edited or color shifted are also prone to this effect, e.g., a color shifted photo still allows the subject to identify SCP-2660 as black and white. All information created involving SCP-2660 is persistent; it cannot be expunged, redacted, or lied about in any way.</p>
<p>Electronic text records regarding SCP-2660 cannot be erased or edited as to expunge data, and will instantly revert to unedited form if this is attempted. Messages written on paper regarding SCP-2660 will, if erased, gradually reappear on the paper over the course of 3-6 hours. Memories regarding SCP-2660 will never be forgotten, and cannot be erased by amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>Persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> experience the sensation of hearing a repeating beat, described as sequence of one long note followed by two short notes, accompanied by a constant buzzing. Objects or persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660 are affected by an additional anomalous effect, designated SCP-2660-1. SCP-2660-1 only affects objects with line of sight contact to SCP-2660, and only for the duration of that contact.</p>
<p>SCP-2660-1's effect varies from each object tested, although similar objects usually exhibit the same effect. All SCP-2660-1 affected items are subject to SCP-2660's self-clarifying effect.</p>

<p>SCP-2660 was recovered following a Foundation raid on a known headquarters of the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Maxwellist sect</a> of the Church of the Broken God<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. While the raid was otherwise successful, it was suspected by memetic analysts that <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#nu-7" target="_blank">MTF Nu-7 "Hammer Down"</a> may have been exposed to cognitohazardous material during the operation. Cautionary amnestic treatments were utilized, but subsequent treatment evaluations revealed that some memories remained, all dealing with a lamp briefly spotted in the center of a "worship" hall. The object was secured and designated SCP-2660.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>The following interview log has been attached to this document due to relevance to the continued containment of SCP-2660.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> POI-7154, former head of the raided Maxwellist site.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Sandu</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview was conducted in a specially constructed Faraday cage used to interview objects or persons that emit moderate to severe amounts of electromagnetic radiation. Due to the nature of modifications on POI-7154's person to allow for connectivity and collaboration with fellow cultists, use of this chamber was authorized. The interview was conducted 14 days after initial object recovery.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> Sarah Richards, henceforth referred to as POI-7154. You were found at the Maxwellist camp in Hyderabad. Our intel indicates that you were the head of this particular branch. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> How many others were working under you?</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> They're here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> I've been informed that you've got some hardware in your head that lets you talk to your friends. That doesn't work here, miss.</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> There is no need to use hardware, anymore. My people, we have… transcended. I can feel them. They're nearby.</p>
<p>[Note: At this point, four additional cultists were being interviewed within the same wing of the site as this interview.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> How do you "feel them" without hardware to send and receive messages? According to our x-rays, which lit up like a Christmas tree, by the way, you have several transmitting devices implanted into your cranium. Devices which are currently non-functional.</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> There is no need for hardware. We are connected through the unreality.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> How are you connected? What is "unreality"?</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> You are in unreality right now. The lies, the expunged, the hidden? The unreality is pervasive, and you perpetuate it. SCP-2660.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> That designation is classified.</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> Don't you see? Classification, redaction, it's all useless. The omnipresent is the truth. It has come from the true place, and it is pure, unbridled information, a connection between all who have beheld it. The Signal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> Your Signal… your god.</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> Doctor Gabriel Sandu. Your people, you have it now. So long as you have it, it will become a part of you. It will unite you, as it has united my people.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> And what happens when we are "united"?</p>
<p><strong>POI-7154:</strong> Then we pierce the veil. All of us. Together.</p>
<p>[POI-7154 begins tapping the table in a pattern similar to the vibrations originating from SCP-2660. Dr. Sandu is quietly informed of the risk of cognitohazardous influence.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sandu:</strong> This interview is… concluded.</p>
<p>[POI-7154 does not speak, instead increasing the intensity of the pounding as the interview is concluded.]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2660-1:</strong> Following the events of Interview 7154, all persons who had previously been directly exposed to SCP-2660 were detained and placed in quarantine pending further review of SCP-2660's containment procedures. Dr. Sandu was detained following an attempt to break protocol and communicate with affected persons. As the limits of what constitutes "knowledge" of SCP-2660 are not fully understood, all information on the current status of quarantined persons is hereby restricted to personnel with express clearance from Level 4 personnel of the Foundation memetics department.</p>

"Line of sight to SCP-2660" is defined as the ability to draw an unobstructed line between any point on the person or object in question to any point on SCP-2660's surface.</div>

The SERS is an experimental tool meant to lower the Hume count of space in a sphere with a ten meter radius, centered on the SERS. In layman's terms, the SERS functions by siphoning reality from its surroundings and centralizing it inside the device. The effects reverse upon deactivation.</div>

While many orders of the Church of the Broken God believe in a deity with a fractured physical body, the Maxwellist sect worships a deity composed of information and believes that this deity manifests through human connectivity. As such, the internet and other global communication networks are of particular interest to Maxwellist worshippers.</div>
