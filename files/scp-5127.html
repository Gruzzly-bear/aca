            <h1>SCP-5127</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5127</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-5127 is to be kept in a locked box in Site-19, under Dr. Newman's possession and should only be removed for testing by personnel Level 3 or higher.</span> SCP-5127 is to be kept in a Standard Containment Locker, which should remain inside a locked room of Site-19. Entrance of SCP-5127's room is only allowed to authorized personnel for periodic supervisions, and these should happen no more than twice a month. Moreover, personnel should go through a psychological evaluation each time before entering and upon leaving SCP-5127's room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5127 is a straw hat, adorned with red ornamentation. The object resembles a specific style of hat that is normally used during the traditional Brazilian party known as <em>"Festa Junina"</em> (June Festivals). SCP-5127, when worn by a human, will often cause time to dilate around the subject, making it "flow" in a slower pace to the wearer in comparison to everything else in the universe. From the perspective of any person witnessing, SCP-5127's wearers will appear to vanish. It is theorized that this effect occurs due to the different "temporal dimensions" created between the subjects involved.</p>
<p>The extent of the alterations in the flow of time caused by SCP-5127's anomalous properties appears to always vary with each "use" of it. In addition, SCP-5127's wearers appear to be unable to remove the object from themselves for approximately two minutes after putting it on their heads. The cause of this effect is still unknown. (See SCP-5127's Test Log for details). From the perspective of SCP-5127's wearers, the aforementioned 2 minutes are extended to unknown amounts, depending on how much their flow of time was altered. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">While SCP-5127 isn't being worn, it doesn't appear to cause any anomalous effects in individuals.</span></p>
<p>A new anomalous property of SCP-5127 was discovered during the last test done with it. The object also presented a species of mind-affecting effect, although it appears to occur in a less frequent proportion than its time-related anomaly. (See Incident Log 5127-015 for more details.)</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The object was acquired by the Foundation on 08/10/2017, five days after field agents were sent to investigate some unusual murder cases in the city of Poços de Caldas, Brazil. (Rumors of people getting attacked and stabbed randomly by an "invisible entity" were starting to spread around the city, which caught Foundation's attention.)</p>
<p>The object was found in the possession of a local citizen (later identified as Gabriel Silveira, a 20-year-old student), who was also captured after being witnessed by an undercover agent carrying a blood-tainted knife and the object. The agent stated that it witnessed the subject "manifesting itself" near a well-known tourist spot in the city. The corpse of Pedro Lopes Souza, an unemployed 23-year-old local, was also located near the place 11 minutes later.</p>
<p>Gabriel Silveira did not show any resistance against Foundation agents while being captured and has even provided important information about the object. Subject confessed the murder of 8 civilians within the period of 1 month prior to his capture and claims to be able to control SCP-5127's anomalous properties. The veracity of the last claim remains uncertain.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Gabriel Silveira</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Newman</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> After being captured by the Foundation and inquired about SCP-5127, subject related that the object is a "hat that slows down the time." Based on that statement, both the object and Gabriel Silveira were sent to Dr. Newman Locke, a temporal anomalies specialist and researcher of Site-19. The following is the transcript of an interview that was conducted by Dr. Newman two days after the capture of Gabriel and the object.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> Hello, Mr. Silveira. I am Newman Locke and I want to ask you a few questions. How are you right now?</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> I am just confused… This last week was insane to say the least. At this point, I have no idea what's going on or even who are you all. At first I thought you guys were from the police, but at this point I highly doubt that. Could you please tell me who the hell are you and all those other guys who brought me here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> I'm afraid I can't reveal that Mr. Silveira, but just know that we are here to help, as we are an organization meant to protect humanity from dangerous things. Although I understand that these past few days probably have been really hard and confusing for you, please focus on answering the questions for now. So my first question for you is: what is your relation to the hat and why were you carrying a knife 2 days ago in the streets of your city?</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> <em>(Subject pauses for 10 seconds before speaking.)</em> Sure… I guess it's time to share this with somebody, it's not like I have anything to lose at this point anyway… However, I highly doubt you guys can help me in any ways… Well from where do I even begin?… Oh, the hat. The hat was a present. A special gift from an old friend of mine who… <em>(The subject pauses briefly.)</em> committed suicide 7 years ago. We were really close back in school and she was my best friend for sure. We used to suffer a lot of bullying back then just for being you know… quiet and weird. But she was a really amazing person that I truly miss.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> I see. Please tell me more about her, Mr. Silveira.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> Her name was Amanda Fernandes. Unfortunately she couldn't handle the daily pain of being judged by the whole world and her abusive parents who didn't really care about her at all, so she eventually decided to end her own life… She gave me that hat for me to use while dancing with her in a traditional party from my country, 1 year before her suicide. It was just a normal hat back then, but it meant something for us. Even though we never admitted it, I believe the hat was the symbol of a greater love that was starting to born between us… <em>(Subject pauses and begins to cry.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> It must have been a really painful experience to lose somebody so important for you Mr. Silveira, I understand that. I know that it's difficult to you, but please share the rest of this story with me. I feel like you still have a lot to say.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> <em>(Subject wipes his tears using his shirt and starts speaking about 30 seconds after being questioned.)</em> Alright… Thanks for your words Newman. Well, I got very depressed after her death, and became even more lonely and angry at the world. Those years were really hard to me, but somehow I kept on surviving day after day, but never really got over what happened. Then on a certain night, I had a dream with Amanda…</p>
<p>She was just standing there on a vast green field, I can't remember seeing anything else around but her. The happiness I felt by seeing her again can't be described with words… In that dream I was unable to talk for some reason, but I wasn't too bothered by that as seeing her was enough to make me the happiest guy on Earth. I still remember clearly what she told me during that dream…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> So what did she tell you?</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> Her words were: <em>"Gabriel, do you still remember me? I have always loved you, but unfortunately I never had the courage to tell you this and now we will never be able to be together again… But you can still do something for me. Remember that hat I gave you years ago? I will enchant it using the strength of my love for you, and I want you to use it to make this world a better place, as I know that you have a good heart. But I want only YOU to use it, because it's only you that I have ever truly loved. I have always despised most of the humanity, so in other hands, it will only cause harm and chaos. Make sure that you take good care of it forever my love. Farewell."</em> Then she kissed me and I suddenly woke up. After some minutes processing everything, I concluded that it was obviously just a normal dream, but still, something made me get the hat that was somewhere in the depths of my wardrobe and put it on my head.</p>
<p>I didn't feel anything different in the beginning, but some moments after it, I looked at the clock of my room and… It was frozen! At that point I was getting really confused, so I decided to talk with my mother about it, I walked to the kitchen while still wearing the hat and that was when I realized that something was deeply wrong. My mother was paralyzed right there in front me… Not only her, but even the water drops from the kitchen's tap were frozen in time and space, stopped, almost as if the whole world was a game and the person playing it clicked the "pause" button. The only thing that was able to still move normally was me. That was when I figured out that it <em>was</em> really her during the dream. She somehow gave me that power.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> Thats a really unique story Mr. Silveira, but it's not something that easy to believe, don't you agree? I'll give you the benefit of doubt since you have been cooperating with us so far. But there are still certain things I need to know. How long ago did this happen and what have you been doing since you got this power? Also you still haven't explained about that blood tainted knife you were carrying. I need to know the truth, so please tell me everything you can remember.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> Yes, I am aware that this is something really unbelievable, but if there's something I have never been in my life, it's a liar, so I hope you can trust me Newman and I am grateful for that. It happened 2 months ago, and I decided to keep it a secret, especially because I thought she wouldn't want me to tell others about it. So I came back to my room, took the hat off and tried to learn how it worked. I did some tests and realized that I was able to control how much it affected the flow of time around me.</p>
<p>So at first, I started using it for things like saving some people who were being bullied in my university, and pranking some annoying guys, nothing really drastic. Honestly that was all I've done during the first 4 weeks after getting this power, since I was still trying to figure out how to use it to <em>"make this world a better place"</em>, as she wanted. But then around a month ago, when I was coming back home from university, I saw and recognized the group of guys who used to bully and annoy her daily, they were just talking and having fun near the center of the city.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed like they were still the same group of friends even after all of these years, and just seeing them made me feel really angry, because they were the main reason why Amanda decided to end her own life. Then I used the hat to get near and hear what they were talking about and that was when I lost my mind… They were making fun of a person who committed suicide in our city a few days ago! Those idiots were laughing and saying things like <em>"to be honest, the world just got better without that clown, nobody will miss that stupid loser."</em> That was when I decided to go after and… kill each one of them. <em>"THAT is how I will make this world a better place"</em> is what I thought at that moment.</p>
<p>So I followed them and learned about their routines and where they lived. Each week I went after 2 of them, and used the hat to make the job easier. Didn't really care about hiding the corpses as I wasn't really afraid of getting caught, plus I wanted everybody to know that those stupid motherfuckers were gone forever. Sorry, but every time I remember them I get too pissed off… But yeah, thats about it. <em>(Subject becomes silent at this point).</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> I see. Thanks for sharing this with me, Mr. Silveira. However, you did something really grave. Do you think that Amanda would have approved what you've done? Also, I suppose you could very well have escaped from us using the hat. It seems like you basically turned yourself to us. What were your motives behind this?</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Silveira:</strong> Well… I am just regretting it now. I am sure that she wouldn't have approved what I did… After I killed Pedro 2 days ago, I began to be consumed by a strong feeling of guilt, so I decided to let the police capture me, but seems like you guys found me instead. Right now, I'm wishing that the hat could also take me back in time, so I would have tried harder to control myself and my anger… But I have no excuses, since I can't fix my mistakes, I at least want to pay for my crimes. You guys can do whatever you want with me. Thanks for hearing my story Newman, you seem to be a good person. But hey, at this point who am I to judge who is "good" or who is "bad"? <em>(Subject starts laughing to himself.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Newman:</strong> I understand, but you don't need to thank me Gabriel, as I'm just doing my job. We will take care of the hat from now on. You will be conducted to one of our cells and remain there until further notice. Maybe in the future you can be useful for us in some way.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> After the interview, Gabriel Silveira was conducted to a standard cell of Site-19 while the object remained under Dr. Newman's possession. Afterwards, Foundation personnel contacted and visited subject's mother, Larissa Silveira, in order to confirm the statements of Gabriel during the interview. She confirmed that her son indeed has suffered from bullying and depression since his childhood, but stated that she can't remember anything about "Amanda Fernandes" or SCP-5127. Larissa also refuses to believe that her son would be able to murder anyone. She was treated with amnestics after the visit. Despite Foundation's best efforts, the existence of "Amanda Fernandes" could never be confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 5127-015</strong></p>
<p>The Incident 5127-015 occurred on 09/07/2019, during the last test done with SCP-5127. Three Class-D personnel were instructed to enter the testing chamber where SCP-5127 was being held. The object was on a table, inside an unlocked box. D-23502 opened the door and entered the room together with D-14628 and D-58016. D-23502 was ordered to open the box and put SCP-5127 on its own head.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes after the test began, D-23502 was instructed to remove SCP-5127 and the agents opened the door of the room in order to check the results of the experiment. They found the 3 subjects dead, D-23502 was in an advanced state of decomposition, while all that was left of D-14628 and D-58016 was their bone structure and some remains of their flesh spread through their skeleton and on the floor. SCP-5127 was also on the floor next to the subject.</p>
<p>Moments after entering the room, agent Edward Shawn, one of the 2 personnel supposed to ask questions to the subjects and return the object to its containment, started moving towards SCP-5127 while staring at it, grabbed the object and tried to wear it, however, he got stopped by his companion agent Nick Lambert before doing so. When questioned about what happened there, he said that the only thing he was able to remember is that "the object was calling him."</p>
<p>Afterwards, agent Edward Shawn was temporarily removed from his position, as he was diagnosed with clinical depression and his symptoms increased significantly after the incident. Edward also states that he currently feels "confused" and claims often: "It feels like I forgot something important from my own past." The agent still hasn't been fully recovered since the incident and remains unable to work, mostly due to a constant lack of focus.</p>
<p>It is also theorized that the reason why the 3 Class-D personnel involved died during the experiment, was due to the drastic alteration in the flow of time to D-23502. The subject possibly attacked and consumed the other 2 Class-D personnel while they were still alive. Since it couldn't remove the object from itself, D-23502 eventually died as well, due to lack of water and food.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> SCP-5127 was re-classified from Safe to Euclid on 08/10/2019. Its Special Containment Procedures were also updated.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> The realization of experiments involving SCP-5127 was prohibited by the Site Director since 11/24/2019. According to it, this decision was taken due to the extremely high risk of a Class-D personnel escaping during the experiment. In such case, the Foundation wouldn't be able to prevent it in time, due to the effects of SCP-5127.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Due to the progressive increase of SCP-5127's anomalous properties since its containment, Dr. Newman sent on 11/07/2020 a request to the Site Director requiring permission for Gabriel Silveira to participate in tests and possibly other uses of the object as a way to help Foundation personnel on their duties.</p>
<p>Moreover, Newman believes that this could possibly lessen the danger represented by SCP-5127, considering that what Gabriel Silveira stated during its interview was factual. The request got denied, since it was deemed as "too risky" by the Site Director. However, considering the effects of SCP-5127 over agent Edward Shawn in the past, more tests using Class-D personnel in order to confirm its capacity to affect, alter, remove and perhaps even insert false memories into humans is being considered.</p>
