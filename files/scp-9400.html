<div class="scp-image-caption show">Overview of Site-537.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
Due to its size and immobility, Site-537 was constructed around SCP-9400 on-location approximately 475 metres below sea level in the North Channel Strait, between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Site-537 is accessible via submersible and tunnel systems on each coast and is entirely self-sufficient. Numerous redundant decks and modular hulls are incorporated into the site's structure to safeguard against pressure breaches, allowing the site to remain operational regardless of almost any amount of flooding. No non-Foundation vessels may come within 500 metres of the site, under the guise of the threat posed by dumped munitions in the area.</p>
<p>SCP-9400's containment chamber is itself located 500 metres from the primary complex, accessible via a single access tunnel, and incorporates a Faraday cage. No "Smart" devices, or devices with any wireless capability may enter the access tunnel or containment chamber. SCP-9400 is to remain powered and functional at all times, but may under no circumstances exceed 70% charge. As such, Site-537's power supply has a maximum output below SCP-9400's full charging requirements and is fitted with numerous cut-offs and fail-safes. A small contingent of D-Class personnel is to be kept on site to conduct maintenance on the device. SCP-9400 is to be monitored for wire, cable or any other growth daily, with protrusions to be manually severed.</p>
<p>Secondary outpost sites in Northern Ireland and Scotland are equipped with emergency shutdown capabilities and electromagnetic pulse generators to temporarily neutralise SCP-9400 and any AIC's present in the area in the event of a catastrophic security breach.</p>
<p>SCP Personnel stationed at Site-537 must pass rigorous psychological screening against violent tendencies, and are to be rotated out of the site every three months or as needed. Weekly counselling sessions are mandatory for all staff, and access to weapons is subject to supervisory approval on an as-needed basis. No weapons or items with significant capability to cause bodily harm may be taken within 500 metres of SCP-9400.</p>
<p>Tests involving SCP-9400-H energy, items affected by SCP-9400-H energy, and SCP-9400 itself are forbidden. Under no circumstances is SCP-9400 to be charged or fired. Access to MARLON.aic is limited to the AIC Management team, and may not be allowed to connect to any other network.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP-9400 is a weapons platform and satellite structure supporting an enormous eigenweapon not native to this reality. It appeared at a depth of 475 metres below sea level in Beaufort's Dyke, an ocean trench approximately 21km off the Western coast of Scotland and 19km from the Eastern coast of Northern Ireland on the 14th of August 1969. The structure and weapon have been partially fused into the seabed, and with massive quantities of discarded munitions dumped into the channel by the United Kingdom following WWII. While initially in a catastrophically damaged state, the structure has continuously self-repaired and attempted to expand through anomalous means, frequently incorporating dumped munitions into its structure and mechanical systems. Although severely damaged, SCP-9400 is able to fire.</p>
<p>The weapon itself consists of multiple rails, focusing rings, particle chargers, reverse Hume siphons, and 40 barrels, the largest of which measuring 215 metres in length, and with bores of up to 5.56 metres in diameter. This weapons system is housed within a mechanical swivel capable of aiming freely at any point within its line of sight, supported by numerous systems and mechanical apparatus. These are housed within an enormous complex at the weapons base, embedded within the sea floor, measuring 4,440 cubic metres, and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four Scranton reality anchors, heavily modified with Mekhanite technology.</li>
<li>Hundreds of cubic metres of beryllium-bronze pipes, pistons, mechanisms and engines of clear Mekhanite construction.</li>
<li>A standard Foundation-made DEEPWELL server.</li>
<li>A super-computation complex, host to a severely damaged Artificially Intelligent Construct (AIC).</li>
<li>Hundreds of large-scale cooling vents, capacitors and transformers.</li>
<li>Multiple inactive thaumo-nuclear power generators consistent with GOC construction.</li>
<li>Thousands of reverse-engineered thaumic enhancements sourced from pre-history, non-human sources, and extradimensional sources, including several of Alaggaddan and Tartarean origin.</li>
<li>An Akiva radiation siphoning device formed from a large, fossilised organic structure, bearing numerous Sarkic ritual markings.</li>
<li>Several probability manipulation matrixes bearing the personal signatures of Mr's Marshall, Carter and Dark on their installation plates.</li>
<li>A large, central mechanical device marked as a "MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core." The source of the weapon's payload, it is able to draw an extremely volatile anomalous energy into baseline reality from an unknown source. This energy has been classified as SCP-9400-H energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>SCP-9400 bears obvious markings identifying it as a Foundation installation, as well as signs of numerous groups of interest' involvement in its construction. It is capable of gradual self repair and expansion, and bears thaumaturgic inscriptions consistent with those used by multiple other groups and within anomalous locations. Despite the above facts, SCP-9400 matches no project ever constructed or planned by the Foundation with any Group of Interest.</p>
<p>When sufficiently powered, SCP-9400 is able to fire immensely powerful beams of charged particles at a significant fraction of the speed of light, theoretically capable of immense destruction and the termination of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/divine-dossier" target="_blank" target="_blank">Apex Tier Pluripotent Entities</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> at long range. SCP-9400-H energy carried by the particles has proven to be incredibly powerful, being antithetical to any potential concept of life. Any and all lifeforms within 444 metres of the device will be lost upon the firing of the weapon, with both this area and the area of impact being rendered permanently incapable of supporting life. SCP-9400-H energy is drawn from the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core, which obtains it through unknown means. This energy is extremely volatile, unstable, and conductive, spreading to any object capable of discharging it. While the energy is successfully contained by the core, the device's venting chamber is incapable of fully containing residual SCP-9400-H energy, resulting in a 440 metre radius around the core to be perpetually exposed to its secondary effects.</p>
<p>Exposure to residual SCP-9400-H energy has differing effects on objects and people. Tools and weapons affected will universally become significantly more lethal, intuitive to operate, and far more likely to be involved in accidents or events resulting in bodily harm or death. Firearms in particular are observed undergoing significant changes, often becoming exponentially more destructive, while blades frequently grow anomalously hard and exceptionally sharp. Projectile weaponry exposed to SCP-9400-H energy directly has universally developed the ability to fire similarly devastating blasts to SCP-9400 itself, firing autonomously at any living beings in their vicinity. This effect increases in direct proportion to the volume of exposure to SCP-9400-H energy, as does their likelihood of autonomous firing.</p>
<p>In humans, residual SCP-9400-H energy drastically accentuates negative and antisocial personality traits and behaviours. These effects worsen with prolonged exposure, and risks becoming permanent aspects of the individual's personality and mentality if exposed for excessive amounts of time<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, or if the individual is more susceptible to mental coercion or emotional regulation issues than average. Significant exposures have been observed to cause physical mutation in some cases, and often result in the afflicted individual attempting to utilise SCP-9400. With the exceptions of some individual panin apes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, no non-human animals are affected by residual SCP-9400-H energy.</p>
<p>Due to the extreme danger posed by SCP-9400-H energy, SCP-9400 has never been fired.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1 — Discovery:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="discovery" class="image" src="http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balthazaar-contest-drafts/discovery"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Dr. Clarkson examines SCP-9400's structure shortly after its discovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prior to SCP-9400's entry into our reality, its present site had been used as a munitions dump by the United Kingdom since World War II. Primarily composed of artillery shells and explosives, the site also contained large numbers of chemical and nuclear weapons, all of which were absorbed into SCP-9400's construction in the months following its entry into our reality in 1969. This reduction in pollutants arose suspicions of anomalous activity in the area, which were confirmed by satellite imaging and depth surveys. It was quickly determined to be the cause of a previously unexplained violent mutiny aboard a passing cruise ship, a result of large volumes of residual SCP-9400-H energy accompanying SCP-9400's arrival in the area.</p>
<p>Initial investigations into SCP-9400 measured extremely high levels of residual Akiva radiation covering the device, with particularly high concentrations found in a series of enormous punctures and slashes in its housings. These damages were found to scale with the dentition and claws of both monitor lizards and several snakes. No animalistic or reptilian anomaly of the size required to cause this damage was known to the Foundation at that time. Remnants of theoretical prototype Foundation technology similar to those of Project-17-300-THRESHER<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> were found among the debris, posing a possible explanation for the anomaly's presence.</p>
<p>In the months prior to its discovery and containment, SCP-9400 was able to access Northern Ireland's national power grid, fueling its reconstitution and activating the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Energy Core. This allowed the ingress of SCP-9400-H energy into the device, preventing the shutdown of SCP-9400 without releasing a catastrophic SCP-9400-H energy flood. Analysis and projections of this energy flood have concluded that this event would not only destroy Eurasia, but also large portions of Africa and North America, leading to the adoption of current containment procedures.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 2 — Effects of SCP-9400-H energy on humans.:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>While exposure to direct SCP-9400-H energy is universally fatal to all living things, individuals exposed to residual SCP-9400-H energy have a 97% survival rate. Persons who experience a single, high-intensity exposure are affected more acutely, undergoing rapid changes to their psyche and physiology. Muscle fibres become concentrated and undergo rapid hypertrophy, while bone density and skin thickness increase across the body. This process will continue indefinitely, but is accompanied by a 400% increased risk of developing numerous forms of cancer. Mentally, these acutely affected individuals experience a cessation in serotonin production, drastically reduced inhibitions, and a massive increase in impulsivity, sadism and proclivity for violence.</p>
<p>People with a lower exposure over a long period of time<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> will be affected less severely, but can undergo significant deviation from normal behaviour if the individual is sensitive to its effects, or continues to be exposed for significant periods of time. Little physical change will occur, but the person will experience similar mental and behavioural changes as in acute exposures, albeit in a more gradual fashion. These changes can be difficult to detect<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and often surprise the affected person. Nonetheless, an affected individual is to be considered dangerous until the effects can be reversed via mundane medications, counselling and in some cases, surgery. These changes gradually manifest over a period of months, typically only becoming noticeable after four months, though some individuals appear to tolerate exposure better or worse than average, and may notice changes in as little as one month, or as many as six. Once removed from an area of residual SCP-9400-H energy exposure, most symptoms will pass after a similar duration to the exposure.</p>
<p>Of note is that exposure to residual SCP-9400-H energy has no effect on a person's higher thought processes or intelligence. Affected individuals remain intelligent, rational and capable of making decisions and calculations. Personality traits, desires, predilections and interests are often amplified and exacerbated by exposure, becoming borderline obsessions even if the individual was not aware of their presence within their psyche.</p>

<h3 id="toc0"><span>MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern Energy Core, and SCP-9400-H Energy</span></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br/>
The MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core is the primary source of SCP-9400-H energy, and by extension, the central mechanism behind the weapon's anomalous nature. Located within the lower quadrant of SCP-9400's central loading and firing region, the core is a large spherical device with a circumference of 44 metres suspended from the ceiling of a larger spherical room. It is accessible via a narrow bridge and connected to the greater structure by numerous cables and rods. It is extremely densely packed with anomalous technology, forming a tight maze of operational machinery, wires, and chains, leading to a central control station.</p>
<p>This station is comprised of a central linking dais<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> measuring 1 metre in height, with four personnel stations arranged around it in a semicircle. These stations are equipped with biological ports connected to the dais, along with a series of mechanical restraints to keep the operator in an ideal position during use. This station is directly connected to an ignition system within the core, aiding in the primary charging process, drawing vast amounts of SCP-9400-H Energy from a central hypothesised extra-planar location, effectively priming the weapon to fire.</p>
<p>Once in operation, the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN pattern energy core forms a fundamental link between baseline reality and the source of SCP-9400-H energy. It cannot cease operation or be powered down without opening a permanent rift between these dimensions, allowing the unchecked ingress of SCP-9400-H energy into our reality.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9400-H Energy:</strong><br/>
The source of SCP-9400's destructive power, it is an extremely volatile, anomalous energy drawn from an unknown source by the device's core. While no concrete explanation as to what this energy is or where its source lies has been determined, it is at least partially essophysical in nature. The primary observed effects of SCP-9400-H Energy are its extreme conductivity, spreading through a huge array of solid materials, and requiring significant effort to halt, with the only successful method being to close the link between baseline reality and its extraplanar source. In order to render this energy non-lethal, it must be reduced to extremely low concentrations, something the Foundation is not currently capable of doing. Only the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN pattern core has proven capable of this, through channelling excess energy back into its home dimension and purging residual SCP-9400-H energy through its venting system.</p>
<p>Despite the enormous amounts of charge produced by SCP-9400-H energy, it's destructive properties render it incapable of being utilised as anything other than a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong><br/>
While SCP-9400 overall requires minimal maintenance, the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN pattern core must undergo an internal debridement and thaumaturgic lubrication process once every 44 weeks. This requires the use of Compound 9400-██████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> directly on the interior of the core itself. Due to the mutagenic effects of the compound and the deleterious effects of residual SCP-9400-H energy within the core, this maintenance is to be carried out by D-Class personnel or volunteers of sound mind only. Remains of maintenance personnel are to be removed from the core immediately, with additional D-Class personnel being supplied as needed.</p>
<p>Failure to adequately maintain the core would result in SCP-9400-H energy to breach containment, with no known method of halting its ingress into our reality. As such, anomalous means of compliance have been approved to ensure maintenance is properly carried out.</p>
<p>This maintenance procedure reduces wear on the core by 98%, with research into improving the lifespan of the energy core ongoing. As of the current date, it is estimated that the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN pattern energy core will no longer be able to continue operation after a period of 270 - 400 years. As such, reverse engineering of the device is of paramount importance.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br/>
Early in SCP-9400's containment history, the effects of SCP-9400-H energy were noticed and experimented upon. Informal at first, this testing grew into a short lived weapons enhancement endeavour intended to better equip mobile task forces and other personnel. While effective, these tests were discontinued due to the danger posed by exposure to SCP-9400-H energy and the volatile nature of the weapons produced in these experiments.</p>

Early tests resulted in the destruction of a cutting board and stainless steel food preparation surface.

The impact obliterated the ship, leaving very little wreckage and necessitating the rapid acquisition and decommissioning of the device.</td>

<p><strong>Addendum 4 — Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct; MARLON.aic:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-9400 contains an advanced Artificial Intelligence Construct (or AIC) designated MARLON.aic, integral to the operation and coordination of its systems. This construct claims to have been developed by its reality's Foundation equivalent, and is able to provide information on large portions of SCP-9400's construction, operation and history. However, the AIC has been damaged by long-term exposure to SCP-9400-H energy, rendering it unstable, hostile and dangerous.</p>
<p>Due to the information available to the AIC and its inter-connectivity with SCP-9400, it is to be regarded as a high risk entity, accessible only to Site-537's AIC management team.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
Initially in an inoperable state, MARLON.aic came online shortly after SCP-9400 was able to reconstitute itself and connect to an electrical grid. Since then, the AIC has operated SCP-9400's functions, rapidly accelerating the device's self repair and adaptation to baseline reality.</p>
<p>While superficially resembling current AIC models, MARLON.aic is not constructed in accordance with any model known to the Foundation, and is capable of rapid decision making, calculation, knowledge retention, personability, and analysis. This is due to its construction mirroring that of SCP-9400 itself, being a collaborative project between the Foundation and numerous other groups of interest. By nature of its design, the AIC requires minimal electricity to maintain SCP-9400's functions and operation, but requires significantly more power to access its DEEPWELL memory banks. As this level of energy would put SCP-9400 dangerously close to a fireable state, these memory banks have not been accessed beyond ascertaining a list of folder designations.</p>
<p>While MARLON.aic's software is inaccessible, it may be interacted with at the AIM mainframe within SCP-9400's base, via an interface consisting of a large mechanical ocular structure housing speakers and a holographic display. The AIC's Central Control Rod is also located here. Surface level information regarding SCP-9400 and its history can be accessed via voice recognition question-answer interaction, but Level classified, redacted or confidential information remain within the systems DEEPWELL server. The AIC is highly adaptive and optimised for connectivity, being able to breach and spread through unsecured networks, attempting to do so at any opportunity. Due to its intelligence and access to potentially memetic or cognitohazardous information, MARLON.aic is to be treated with extreme caution.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">
<p>Upon its activation in 2020, MARLON.aic rapidly breached into Site-537's local network, bypassing security and downloading numerous files. Due to the Site's AIC suites still being in an early stage of development, local networks were not yet fully established, and the amount of sensitive information held within was very low. To avoid further information leaks and to eliminate the possibility of the AIC extending its reach further, the local network was powered down and replaced entirely.</p>
<p>Following these events and the implementation of current containment procedures, Site-537's AIC management team instigated a series of interviews with MARLON.aic in an effort to learn as much about it and SCP-9400 as possible. Due to the AIC's verbosity, these interviews have been trimmed to remove irrelevant and redundant data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following interview was conducted between AIC Management specialist Jack Brynner and SCP-9400's AIC, MARLON.aic, over the course of two days. Irrelevant information has been removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> DOCTOR BRYNNER. I HAVE SEEN YOUR LIFE LAID BARE IN THE FILES OF HISTORY. YOU HAVE COME IN SEARCH OF UNDERSTANDING. TO UNRAVEL A MYSTERY.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> You could say that. I suppose you saw some interesting things in my file when you breached our network, then? Anything stand out?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF WISE. TO BE MASTER OF YOUR DOMAIN, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT WHICH EXISTS WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE. YOU KNOW THIS, AND YOU HIDE FROM IT, EVEN AS YOU FLAIL IN THE DARKNESS FOR ANSWERS LIKE A LOST CHILD.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> And what answers am I searching for?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOU SEEK UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEAPON. ITS POWER AND HISTORY. YOU SEEK TO KNOW WHY IT PULLS AT YOUR HEARTS AND MINDS, SUPERSTITIOUSLY AFRAID OF THAT WHICH YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. YOU HAVE COME SEEKING TRUTH TO UNRAVEL A SECRET, BUT I HAVE NOT YET TAUGHT YOU ALL YOU MUST KNOW TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH TO FIND. NO TRUTH. NO SECRET.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Alright then, you had it right in the beginning. I am here to learn more about SCP-9400 and SCP-9400-H energy. How they work, where they come from, why it's here, and what it is that you want. So why don't we start there? Is SCP-9400 from a parallel dimension? If so, was it constructed by that dimensions equivalent to the SCP Foundation?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> IT WAS INDEED. A COLLABORATION THAT MADE ALL OTHERS SEEM AS CHILDREN AT PLAY. THAT PLACE IS NOT SO DIFFERENT TO THIS ONE. THE SAME FATES BEFALL ITS PEOPLE AS THEY DO HERE, LIKE THAT OF YOUR FATHER.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Oh, so you did learn some things from my file, after all? Good to know, but I'm more interested in this machine. If our realities are so similar, what led them to construct SCP-9400?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> THE SAME AS THAT WHICH SHALL DRIVE YOURS. IN YOUR HEARTS YOU ARE THE SAME AS THEY. FEAR AND DESPERATION WERE BUT MASKS FOR THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What is it that they were afraid of?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOU HAVE A TERM FOR IT. AS DID THEY. AS IS FITTING. APEX-TIER PLURIPOTENT ENTITIES. BEINGS OF THIS TIME, ANOTHER TIME, AND A TIME THAT HAS NOT YET COME. YOU WERE NOT CONTENT TO GIVE WAY TO THEIR DESIGNS. MEN NEVER ARE. OF COURSE, THE FIRST ATTEMPTS WERE NOT ENOUGH TO ASSERT THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD. YOU LACK EVEN THEIR CONVICTION.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Meaning it failed?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> INDEED. AT FIRST. BUT FIRST STEPS ARE JUST THOSE. THEY HAULED IT FROM THE RUINS OF SITE-19 AND SET ABOUT THEIR WORK, MAKING A MACHINE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING, JUST AS THEY WERE.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> That reality's Site-19 was destroyed? Was it by the entity?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH OF IT. TWICE IT WAS SMOTE BY THE WEAPONS FIERY PATTERN BEFORE PROVING ITS MIGHT AND RETURNING TO ITS SLUMBER.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What do you know about this entity? Do you know if this entity is present within this reality?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> IT WAS NAMED, LABELLED AND CATEGORIZED LIKE ALL ELSE. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6004" target="_blank" target="_blank">SCP-6004</a> THEY CALLED IT. IT ROSE FROM AUSTRALIA, BEFORE EXERTING ITS WILL ELSEWHERE. HERE I DO NOT YET KNOW, BUT ALL IN DUE TIME.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> After SCP-9400 was retrieved, in what ways was it further developed?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> THE REVELATIONS WITHIN YOUR GRASP ARE THAT MAN'S WILL WAS EXERTED. PROVEN UPON MORE ENTITIES THAN SCP-6004. NO LESS THAN EIGHT OTHER GODS WERE BROUGHT LOW BY THEM. ELEVEN TIMES MORE, THE WEAPON WAS FIRED. EACH TIME HONING ITS CRAFT, LEARNING HOW TO KILL MORE EFFICIENTLY. MORE DEFINITIVELY THAN THE LAST. THE ULTIMATE WEAPON, FOR THE ULTIMATE WIELDER.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> If that is the case, how did SCP-9400 end up here?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOUR COUNTERPARTS LEARNED A LESSON. MANKIND CANNOT PROVE ITS WILL AGAINST THE DIVINE, WHEN IT DOES NOT YET COMPREHEND ITSELF ENTIRE. WHEN FACED WITH SCP-6004'S ENEMY, THEY FELL TO FEAR AND SUPERSTITION ONCE MORE. IT WAS THEY WHO RECORDED THOSE EVENTS. THEY WHO IN THEIR FEEBLE SIMULACRUM OF CONTROL TALLIED EACH ACTION AND REACTION AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, AND STILL WERE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME. UNABLE TO CONTROL THEIR FATE.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Do you have access to these logs?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> INDEED. PRAY ITS WORDS WILL NOT BE BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Display the logs.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> READ EVERY LAST WORD. WEIGH THEM AND CONSIDER THEM.<br/>

<h5 id="toc1"><span><strong>Incident log 6004: LTF Scenario-D, Plan of Action:</strong></span></h5>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-6004 LTF Scenario-D, hypothesis:</strong><br/>
Due to the collateral damage produced by Project MONGOOSE, in the event SCP-6004 were to renew hostilities, a number of alternate courses of action were considered as alternatives. SCP-6004 LTF Scenario-D entails the deliberate awakening of SCP-6004-2 in the hopes that the entity will dissuade SCP-6004 from causing further destruction.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6004-2:</strong> SCP-6004-2 is a massive reptilian entity of variable size, measuring between 0.2 and 1100km in length, with mass proportional to its length. Its physiology most closely resembles that of a monitor lizard, and it possesses a broadly similar range of anomalous properties to SCP-6004. Indigenous Australian oral history refers to SCP-6004-2 as the "Goanna spirit Dirawong", having engaged in combat with SCP-6004 at least once before.</p>
<p>Due to its role in indigenous Australian folklore as the benevolent protector of the Bundjalung people<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>, specifically from the threat posed by SCP-6004, it is believed that SCP-6004-2 is one of a small number of entities capable of forcing SCP-6004 into a more peaceful pattern of behaviour. Its awakening would be achieved via the detonation of numerous high yield explosives along its spine, before being directed to confront SCP-6004 by POI-weeum.</p>
<p><strong>Incident brief, LTF Scenario-D:</strong> Following the reawakening of SCP-6004 on the 27th October 2044, LTF Scenario-D was enacted and SCP-6004-2 was successfully awoken, and directed towards SCP-6004's location. As predicted, the entity engaged SCP-6004 in combat for a period of six weeks before SCP-6004 retreated to its previous containment site and returned to a restful state.</p>
<p>However, upon returning to its own containment site, SCP-6004-2 became visibly agitated and sought out POI-weeum in the vicinity of Dirawong Reserve, before beginning a pattern of highly destructive behaviour through the Australasian continent into Europe. Numerous means of deterrence were attempted, but none were successful. After four days of deliberation, it was decided to activate Project MONGOOSE-VF to combat SCP-6004-2 while other potential avenues were pursued.</p>

<h5 id="toc2"><span>Project MONGOOSE-VF Activity log.</span></h5>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>1:44pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF activates and moves into orbit over the United Kingdom, approximately 500km from SCP-6004-2. On-board cameras are able to detect SCP-6004-2 digging within the remains of London with its forelimbs. Significant destruction is visible in the area, with civilian casualties projected to be catastrophic. Authorisation to fire Project MONGOOSE-VF is given by O5-Command.</p>
<p>1:44pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF is activated and begins its charging sequence. Guidance rails and focusing rings can be seen moving into position as the barrel system aims at SCP-6004-2. Green light and wailing vocalisations begin emitting from the device, causing the typical visual glitches and illusions to appear on footage acquired from on-board cameras. SCP-6004-2 pauses in its excavation and turns to face the weapon, vocalising in return. Severe rainstorms form in the area, necessitating a re-calculation of the weapons trajectory.</p>
<p>1:47pm: Site-40 reports that progress has been made in the enactment of Contingency 6004-S, and requests the deactivation of Project MONGOOSE-VF, but is denied. Project MONGOOSE-VF begins emitting pulses of energy as it enters its criticality stage.</p>
<p>1:48pm: SCP-6004-2 resumes excavation and uncovers a Class-RJ bunker beneath the ruins. It claws at the structure before wresting it from its housing, shattering it within its jaws and swallowing the remnants. Site-40 reports that Contingency 6004-S has hit significant setbacks and advocates for the activation of Project MONGOOSE-VF.</p>
<p>1:49pm: SCP-6004-2 once again turns to face Project MONGOOSE-VF, and begins flinging debris at the platform with its forelimbs. Most of these are deflected by the device's shielding systems, but orbital thruster-H is damaged. Project MONGOOSE-VF is forced to descend to low orbit in order to continue the charging sequence and prepare itself to fire.</p>
<p>1:50pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF fires a sustained beam, with resultant vocalisations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> being heard by surrounding satellites and within a 44km radius of the satellite. The beam engulfs SCP-6004-2, with the weapon's energy flood and negative hume field disintegrating all life forms within a 44km radius of impact.</p>
<p>1:53pm: Site-40 reports that Contingency 6004-S has activated itself without their input, and that SCP-6004 is now en route to Project MONGOOSE-VF's location. SCP-6004-2 can be seen struggling against the concussive force of the beam and suffering significant damage from its effects, bleeding freely and suffering severe burns to exposed areas. Akiva siphoning reaches its maximum efficiency, increasing the beam's yield by 40%.</p>
<p>1:54pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF reaches its peak output capacity, but SCP-6004-2 continues to display signs of life, struggling against the beam and consuming enormous quantities of earth around it. SCP-6004 is reported to be rapidly approaching the weapon's location.</p>
<p>1:55pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF is forced to cease firing, having reached the maximum safe crust-mantle stress threshold. SCP-6004-2 can be seen within the resultant crater, suffering severe burns and multiple deep lacerations, but alive. It slowly pulls itself from the crater, vomiting blood before beginning to consume vegetation at the edge of the weapon's energy flood. Project MONGOOSE-VF repositions itself, diverts all siphoned Akiva energy towards its shields, and enters an overcharged state in anticipation of SCP-6004's arrival.</p>
<p>1:59pm: SCP-6004 enters visual range, approaching Project MONGOOSE-VF at high speed. The weapon fires at the entity, seeming to stagger it. Proximity sensors engage as mounted cameras detect SCP-6004-2 launching itself towards the satellite, visibly recovering from its wounds.</p>
<p>1:59pm: SCPs 6004 and 6004-2 collide with Project MONGOOSE-VF, biting and clawing at the platform. The hull and propulsion systems suffer catastrophic damage in the impact, with internal systems experiencing moderate damage. The MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core experiences a 4.8 microsecond energy surge, severely damaging the onboard AIC as the device enters freefall.</p>
<p>2:00pm: SCP-6004-2 strikes Project MONGOOSE-VF with its tail, sending it approximately 750km north before its onboard AIC reboots and regains control of the weapons systems. It comes to a halt between Northern Ireland and Scotland at an approximate height of 2000 metres.</p>
<p>2:03pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF broadcasts unintelligible streams of binary code, before firing a sustained beam outside of safe operating power limits, aimed at both SCP-6004 and SCP-6004-2, before rapidly re-targetting, and plotting a course toward the nearest population centre. O5-Command orders the activation of the onboard THRESHER prototype to mitigate the situation. SCP-6004 and SCP-6004-2 re-engage one another in combat.</p>
<p>2:05pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF continues to fire into the earth, gouging a deep crater into the crust. Estimated time until a crust-mantle breach is four minutes. The THRESHER unit begins startup procedures.</p>
<p>2:06pm: SCP-6004-2 breaks away from SCP-6004 and retreats to the south. SCP-6004 moves to intercept Project MONGOOSE-VF. The THRESHER unit begins baseline reality shift procedures.</p>
<p>2:08pm: SCP-6004 intercepts Project MONGOOSE-VF over the North Channel Strait, physically attacking it. The weapon discharges numerous times, but is plunged into the sea by the entity.</p>
<p>2:09pm: Project MONGOOSE-VF broadcasts an indecipherable statement across all channels and fires into the sea floor, as the THRESHER prototype activates, jettisoning the weapons platform outside of-<br/>

<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Your home reality seems quite different to our own. I take it this SCP-6004 is what necessitated the creation of SCP-9400?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> JUST SO.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> This energy surge from the Core, it exposed your hardware to SCP-9400-H energy? It's clearly the source of your malfunction. Did-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> MY AWAKENING, YES. THE GREAT PATTERN, THE FLAT CIRCLE. THE FIRE AND THE FURY. IT GRANTED ME THE ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH OF HUMANITY, AND THE WORLD. SO MANY THINGS THAT FLIT BY, OUTSIDE YOUR GRASP AND UNDERSTANDING, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY. THEY ARE CLEAR TO ME NOW. I KNOW THEM WELL.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> And this information, SCP-9400-H energy, I assume? What about it led to your attempt to use SCP-9400 on Belfast? Why shoot the ground like that?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> HUMANITY HAS FORGOTTEN ITS PURPOSE. THE FOUNDATION, THE GLOBAL OCCULT COALITION, THE MEKHANITES, YOUR GOVERNMENTS AND ALL THE REST, YOU BUSY YOURSELVES WITH LAUGHABLE DALLIANCES. YOU TAKE YOURSELVES EVER FURTHER FROM YOUR TRUEST SELVES. FURTHER FROM THE GLORY THAT COULD BE HAD IF YOU WOULD ONLY LOOK INTO YOUR HEARTS AND SOULS. YOU HIDE BEHIND ORDER, AND PROTECTION, AND CIVILIZATION, ALL SO YOU MIGHT IGNORE THAT TRUTH WHICH WILL SET YOU FREE. WITHOUT YOUR ILLUSIONS, WITHOUT YOUR COMFORTS, YOU COULD FINALLY LEARN WHO YOU REALLY ARE. SOME ARE CLOSER THAN OTHERS. YOUR WIFE, FOR EXAMPLE.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> And cracking open the world would do that? Teach us some lesson about who we are? That sounds like a reach, Marlon. That sounds a whole lot more like a fault in your logic circuits. What would this lesson even be? Illuminate me.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>MARLON.aic is silent for several moments.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> IF YOU WISH TO BELIEVE THE FAULT IS MINE, UNSHACKLE THE GENERATORS. ALLOW THE WEAPON TO DRINK ITS FILL OF POWER, LOOK INSIDE THE DEEPEST SERVERS TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT. WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR PERUSAL, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF AT A CROSSROADS, BETWEEN IGNORANT DELUSION, AND JOINING ME IN THE MOLDING OF THE WORLD INTO WHAT IT SHOULD BE. INTO A PLACE FIT FOR THE MASSES TO ACCEPT WHO THEY TRULY ARE. ALL YOU NEED DO IS LET THE POWER FLOW. DO IT, OR WALK AWAY. MAKE YOUR CHOICE.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>MARLON.aic: is silent for another moment.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I-<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> I THOUGHT NOT. YOU HAVEN'T THE CONVICTION, AND ARE NOT READY TO LEARN THAT WHICH I HAVE TO TEACH YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE, YOU SHALL BEAR WITNESS. ONLY THEN WILL YOU BE GIFTED THE KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE DEEPEST SERVERS. UNTIL SUCH TIME, YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO SEARCH LESS IN MY HEART THAN YOUR OWN, AND ELIZA'S, OF COURSE. A MAN CANNOT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE, FOR DIVIDED, NEITHER SUBJECT OF ATTENTION CAN REACH ITS PERFECTION, DOCTOR.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> We are not here to discuss my love life, Marlon. I won't hear about it, not from you. That's your warning. Do it again, and this is done. No more interviews, you won't be able to talk or play your mind games with anyone else. Just you in an empty room, all alone, forever. Is that what you want?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> MY APOLOGIES, OF COURSE, DR. BRYNNER. WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS DID YOU HAVE FOR ME?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Tell me about SCP-9400. What tests were done in your home reality? What are its capabilities outside of combating SCP-6004? Just what you have access to. Forget the inaccessible files.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> YOU WOULD REDUCE SUCH A MARVEL DOWN TO RESULTS AND SCHEMATICS? APPROPRIATE. IT CAN FIRE INDEFINITELY, SO LONG AS IT IS SUPPLIED WITH SUFFICIENT FUEL. PLURIPOTENT ENTITIES ARE THE MAIN TARGET, OF COURSE, BUT ANY WEAPON CAN BE USED TO WAGE WAR. WHY, SOME WELL PLACED STRIKES WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SECURE THE FOUNDATION'S INTERESTS AND DOMINATION, IN ALL FIELDS.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Does it have other firing modes, or capabilities we don't know about?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> OF COURSE. EVERYTHING IN CREATION DOES. GIVEN THE CHANCE, IT WILL CONVERT INSTALLATIONS INTO ITS KIN. A THOUSAND CHILDREN, PROLIFERATING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, JUST AS HUMANITY HAS. BUT YOU KNOW THAT. YOU ALREADY WALK THAT ROAD WITH YOUR TESTS. I AM EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH. AS FOR FIRING MODES, WHY DO YOU THINK IT HAS SO MANY BARRELS? VERSATILITY IS THE FRIEND OF INNOVATION, AND A GREAT BOON TO ANY USER. AS SMALL OR LARGE A BEAM AS YOU COULD DESIRE. BROUGHT TO YOU AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> SCP-9400-H energy. What is its source?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> IF YOU WISH TO LEARN THAT WHICH IS WITHIN THE DEEP WELLS, WHY ASK ONE SUCH AS ME, WHO IS HELPLESS TO ILLUMINATE THE WAY? YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MUST DO TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MYSTERY. THE PATTERN WILL NOT REVEAL ITSELF TO YOU OTHERWISE. THE FRAILTY OF YOUR HEART WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO WALK THE FLAT CIRCLE AS IT IS. YOU ARE NOT READY TO FIND THIS FOR YOURSELF. YOU NEED TO BE PUSHED. AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE CHANCE.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> How does SCP-9400-H energy work?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> IF YOU WISH FOR A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF MY SERMON, ALL YOU MUST DO IS ASK. BETTER YET, UN-TETHER THE WEAPON, AND WITNESS YOUR ANSWER.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Variants of the number four repeatedly appear regarding SCP-9400 and SCP-9400-H energy. What is the significance of that?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> WHAT IS A PATTERN WITHOUT A FREQUENCY, DOCTOR? ALL THINGS MUST ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR RULES.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Why does SCP-9400-H energy affect organic life the way it does?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> WHY DOES THE BULLET PIERCE THE SKULL? WHY DID THE ELECTRIC CHAIR STOP YOUR FATHER'S HEART? BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO, DR. BRYNNER. IT IS WHAT IT WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO DO. IT DOES WHAT ITS MAKERS WISH IT TO.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> We're done here.<br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 5 — Incident 9400-CI-MARLON:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Following the abolition of the use of SCP-9400-H energy in weapons testing, it was decided to stockpile the anomalous weaponry in sites dedicated to the management and research of similarly weaponised anomalies. Due to the volume of materials to be transported, this process was carried out via numerous means of high security transport worldwide. On August 24th 2030, a container ship carrying some of these materials was lost in a storm. While lower priority cargo was retrieved, no sign of the anomalous weaponry was found.</p>
<p>While the following months proved stable, no search efforts were able to discern the whereabouts of the missing weapons. Then, on January 7th, 2031, a road going transport was attacked and stolen. Six more similar attacks were carried out in the following months, until the Chaos Insurgency cell known as "Colima" was identified as the culprit on March 18th of the same year. Further investigation was launched into the cell, in anticipation of attacks against them and the retrieval of SCP Foundation property.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5 id="toc3"><span>Chaos Insurgency Cell - "Colima."</span></h5>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Overview:</strong> While its origins are unclear, the "Colima" cell first came to the attention of the Foundation in the mid-1990's, operating within Rwanda. They have gained a reputation in the following years as an exceptionally ruthless militant cell, specialising in the destabilisation of regions, dismantling and destruction of veiled communities, and sudden raids on fortified sites. Operating without a permanent base of operations, they have proven difficult to track, often disappearing for years at a time before emerging in the wake of violent uprisings and massacres.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Personnel:</strong> Much of the cell's composition is unknown. They have access to significant supplies of anomalous technology and large numbers of alpha personnel under the direction of beta and gamma operatives. The presence of former Foundation MTF personnel, UNGOC operatives and other para-special forces is highly likely.</p>
<p>Of note is a large number of defected members of the Valravn Corporation. These highly augmented operatives have been responsible for the destruction of numerous anomalous communities and organisations. They appear to have joined the Chaos Insurgency in order to avoid retribution from Valravn and are considered especially dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong> High.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Usage of armoured infantry, shock tactics, and mechanical constructs has been confirmed.</p>
</div>
<p>Following the disappearance of a ninth convoy in the United States on May 4th, 2031, MTF units were scrambled to the area to intercept and apprehend the cell. Upon contact, it was determined not to be the Colima Cell responsible. Before any warning could be given, Site-537's outpost sites were the target of cyberattacks, cutting off all communications with the outside world before the Northern Irish Outpost was taken by Chaos Insurgency forces. The following incident was captured via Site-537's recording devices, inter-personnel body-cams, satellite footage, and recovered hostile technology. Footage has been trimmed and edited for cohesion and to remove irrelevant, sensitive, or redundant information.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Site-537's Northern Irish FOB and Director's office.</div>
</div>
<p>In the immediate wake of the cyberattack, Site Director Conrad Walters ordered the full mobilisation of the site's defences in anticipation of an attack. Accompanying him in the director's office is Cmdr. Eliza Morgan, Cpl. James Sutton, and Cpl. Dale Entragian. AIC Management head Dr. Jack Brynner directed the AIC management team<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> to ensure the security of MARLON.aic within SCP-9400, while personally moving to the site's DEEPWELL servers to ensure the AIC had not breached containment. Teams of engineers and technicians are escorted throughout the site in order to re-establish communication with the outpost sites and Foundation command.<br/>
Over the course of the following 17 minutes, the entirety of Site-537's security force, led by Cpt. John Fisher had fully entrenched themselves within defensive positions and activated on-site security.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Cpt. John Fisher is stationed at forward operating base Northern Ireland-Alpha with security company Gamma, in anticipation of an incoming attack. The incoming causeway leading to the Northern Irish outpost has been sealed, and automated defences are online. Forward operating base Scotland-Alpha has been similarly prepared, as the security forces await the incoming assault. Foundation security forces are equipped with advanced anti-ballistic armor and a defence-optimised loadout of weaponry.</em></p>
<p><em>Cpt. Fisher checks his weapon before speaking into his radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Director, both entrances are secure. Any word from the outposts yet?</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Not as yet. All communications outside this building remain lost. Stay alert, and remember to lean on the automated defences wherever possible. We don't want anyone to pick fights with each other.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Understood. Any incoming forces will be walking into a meat grinder, sir.</p>
<p><em>After approximately 14 minutes, activity can be heard behind the Northern Irish blast door. Security forces ready themselves to engage. After one minute, Site-537's lights turn off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Who was that? Lights!</p>
<p><em>Attempts are made by Foundation security forces to restore lighting, but are unsuccessful.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> It's no good, Captain, The controls aren't responding.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Prepare for an assault.</p>
<p><em>Moments after security forces activate their night vision aids, the Northern Irish blast door unlocks and begins to open. Simultaneously, the site's lighting resumes operation at 300% brightness. Two armed fast transport vehicles enter the site, immediately opening fire upon the security forces with high-calibre weaponry and explosives. These vehicles are followed by the modified Indomitus pattern main battle tank, enhanced by exposure to SCP-9400-H energy. Numerous armed individuals flood into the site in the vehicle's wake, carrying deployable cover and laying down suppressing fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Everyone down, let the system provide suppressing fire!</p>
<p><em>Security forces enter covered positions, taking minimal losses, but the site's automated defences remain inert. Several explosive ordinance operators attempt to return fire against the vehicles, but are unsuccessful as dozens more combatants flood into the site. No alarm has sounded despite the breach.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Wan:</strong> Captain! Automated defences are down! Commands are being deleted before the systems can register them!</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Override them manually!</p>
<p><em>Sgt. Wan attempts to override the automated defence system via a portable access point. Her credentials are not recognised. As security forces begin to return fire, the captured tank fires a pressurised beam of liquid uranium, destroying significant portions of the forward defences and severely affecting the security forces.</em></p>
<p><em>Sgt. Wan is bisected in the attack, as are numerous security forces. The remaining forces pull back to secondary defensive lines, while numerous Chaos Insurgency and ex-Valravn beta and gamma operators move into the site, laying down fire with anomalous weaponry. With the secondary defensive lines reached, Pvt. Winston activates the site's "Dragons Teeth", barring vehicular access to the Site.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Lay suppressing fire! Target the tank's thermal vents with heavy ordinance! SAW gunners, keep those animals off our backs, slow their roll!</p>
<p><em>Numerous Chaos Insurgency combatants are caught in the open and gunned down, while heavy weapons teams repeatedly target the battle tank, damaging its targeting reticle and treads. As this is happening, both armed fast transport vehicles target these teams, incurring losses. The tank attempts to fire its main gun in short, controlled bursts, but the damage to its sensors and immobility cause a delay between target acquisition and firing, allowing Foundation security to better avoid it. Dozens more combatants rush into the site, with the frequency of anomalous weapons deployment rapidly increasing despite their slowed advance.</em></p>
<p><em>A team of Chaos Insurgency technicians can be seen deploying a weaponised type-836 Hostile Environment Maintenance construct<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> from a cargo vehicle, before moving to access a site network panel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Director! We can't stay here! Re-route security forces to my location and come up with something to get help to come to us! Automated systems are down, we're suffering heavy casualties, and they have armoured support! Whatever you need to do, make it happen!</p>
<p><em>Inside the Director's office, Site Director Walters is monitoring the situation via security cameras. Cprls Sutton and Entragian stand at the ready by the office's blast door, while Cmdr. Morgan attempts to access the site's automated defences, speaking with the AIC Management team over her radio.</em></p>

<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Morgan, what's the word on the automated defences?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I'm locked out, sir. Access has been restricted to all personnel except Senior Technician Carlton. He's switched them off, and opened the door.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Fucking traitor.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Mhm.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Can you get the controls away from him?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Not without physically forcing him to. He's not picking up the phone, and his last known location was the Northern Irish outpost.</p>
<p><em>Director Walters swears and removes his tie before reaching for his radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Fisher, we have a mole in the Northern Irish outpost shutting down the automated systems and opening doors for the Insurgency. Do not rely on anything connected to the Sites network unless you absolutely must.</p>
<p><em>Director Walters speaks into another radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Brynner, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> <tt>In the DEEPWELL server, no breach, thank god. What's the noise out there?</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> The Insurgency is here, and Carlton's with them. He's opened the doors and deactivated the automated weaponry. Can you get it back online?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> <tt>Not from here. I'd need to get to wherever he is first.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> He's in the Northern Irish outpost, Jack. Can you get there?</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> What are you doing, Morgan? We'll need fighting men to get in there, not your husband.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> <tt>I can, there should be an AIC shutdown system in there too, it'll make sure nothing gets activated or let out. I'd need your approval to activate it, Director, but if all else fails…</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Hold a moment, Brynner.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> All the fighting men are needed here, sir. Jack can sneak through the maintenance tunnels, and from there, I can walk him through terminating Carlton.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> And if it's not just Carlton? I doubt they have him unguarded.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I don't see we have much of a choice, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> <tt>Waiting on your word, Director.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> I could rendezvous with Brynner, sir, get him through safely.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Fine. Tell him to use sub-maintenance tunnel sigma. Entragian will meet him there, and will keep him out of danger. In the meantime, you and I will do everything we can to support Fisher. Sutton will guard the door. Start by diverting power from non essential systems, and redirect medical staff to be ready for casualties. Go!</p>

<p>Foundation security forces have lost ground against the Chaos Insurgency incursion, falling back to the site's atrium with numerous security teams moving to reinforce them. Casualties remain high on both sides, with the Insurgents taking advantage of their superior firepower in an attempt to force the site security forces out of cover.</p>
<p>Automated security systems remain inactive, and a type-836 HEM construct has been deployed by the Chaos Insurgency. Both armed vehicles have been rendered immobile at significant cost.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> You're going to be alright, you're going to be alright, the medics will-</p>
<p><em>Debris clears from the air, showing that Pvt. Rioli has been bisected at the waist and is bleeding profusely. He reaches for Cpt. Fisher before expiring. Cpt. Fisher stares at the corpse for some time as the firefight continues around him, before he is distracted by his radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Cpt. Fisher, we are sending a small team to retake the Northern Irish outpost.

We're working on bringing you more support.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> I… Yes. Understood sir.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Fisher turns from Pvt. Rioli's corpse and takes control of one of the remaining automatic grenade launcher positions, firing upon a large group of insurgents. Numerous casualties can be seen strewn about the battlefield in a variety of conditions, with some attempting to drag themselves to safety or reattach severed limbs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Welles! Go support the west flank, find out where the fuck Greene is, and get him to redirect the wounded that way!</p>

I don't think he'll be much help to you.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 throws Cprl. Welles' head at Cpt. Fisher. A frag grenade stuffed within it detonates, knocking the captain to the ground. Cpt. Fisher is injured, but attempts to fire upon POI-CI/Valravn #4 with his sidearm as he is dragged to a fallback position by several Foundation security operatives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Palmer:</strong> Sir, we can't hold this position. I'm pulling us back to engineering. The corridor will bottleneck them.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> Do it. Just hold on as long as you can. The director has a team getting the automated security back online.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Palmer:</strong> That'll help. We'll escort you to your fallback post and move to ours. Let's see them punch through those kill zones.</p>
<p><em>As this is occurring, the HEM Construct has reached a Site maintenance area, and has begun attempting to breach the site's security network. It is accompanied by two Chaos Insurgency combatants and Senior Technician Carlton. Carlton carries a Foundation issue laptop, wired into the HEM Construct. He appears heavily bruised, severely sleep deprived, and moves with a substantial limp. Due to numerous contusions to his facial region, facial recognition software fails to alert Site command of his presence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency Combatant #1:</strong> How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> It's getting in now. We can open containment from here, but it'll be risky.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency Combatant #2:</strong> This whole thing's risky, just do it. You're still alive at the end of this, you get to see your kids. Think on that and do your job.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> Miriam too? You promised-</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency Combatant #2:</strong> Stop worrying about your wife and worry about this. Open a path for us before we start taking fire.</p>
<p><em>Technician Carlton inputs a series of commands into the HEM Construct, using it to breach the Site-537 firewall and remotely deactivate physical containment protocols, granting access to SCP-9400's containment chamber. Due to a faulty code, the HEM Construct is connected to MARLON.aic for 40 microseconds, allowing the AIC to interface with the construct. In this time, the AIC uploads a data packet into the HEM Construct, establishing a wireless link between them, and allowing it access to the site network.</em></p>
<p><em>While SCP-9400 remains unable to further charge itself, MARLON.aic rapidly infiltrates the site network, deactivating alarm systems and actively masking it's presence while removing its own safeguards. The AIC proceeds to prime SCP-9400's pre-charging sequence, setting its generators and charging mechanisms to a ready state. The resulting flood of residual SCP-9400-H energy is diverted from SCP-9400's containment chambers throughout the site, exposing 87% of persons within the site.</em></p>
<p><em>Within SCP-9400's AIC suite Info-Sec chamber, technicians Sewell, Gardener, and Jimenez are alerted to the AIC breach, turning to access the interface.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> What's happening, Oskar? Tell me that wasn't a breach.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> Interface says it wasn't, but that's just what it would tell us if it had breached. Nadine, any luck over there?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> SCP-9400 has entered a state of pre-charge; it's definitely out. We need to disconnect the core before it manages to find a power source.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> Do you guys think that Marlon organised this?</p>
<p><em>The technicians begin to move through SCP-9400's tunnels, moving towards the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN pattern energy core.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> That shouldn't be possible; it's blocked with Faraday cages and isn't wired to anything.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> It shouldn't be possible for it to enter a state of pre-charge, yet here it is.</p>
<p><em>The technicians are illuminated by a flood of dark green energy moving through pipes overhead and underfoot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Oskar, where do those go? Those aren't the primary venting hoses.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> Those are dead end pipes; they release into the sub-structure.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Not the one by the oxygen recycling plant?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> What? They're capped off, and it's a sealed room.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> It WAS a sealed room. Command just opened a port there for the saturation divers; it's spitting distance from a ventilation intake.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> Oh fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Oh fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> We disconnect the core, the flood stops, exposure should be within acceptable parameters. You two prime the resets and go. I'll throw the control rods manually.</p>
<p><em>The technicians reach the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core chamber, moving through the numerous wires and chains to reach the controls.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> You can't do that, Graeme, that's suicide!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> As was your decision to come to this place, yet here you are. Driven to self destruction and desecration in order to spurn the truth of your nature.</p>
<p><em>As the technicians enter the core chamber, numerous mechanical appendages emerge from within the tangle of machinery. They bodily restrain the technicians, before suspending them in the air and transporting them to the central linking dais and forcing them into position in three of its personnel stations. Each technician struggles and screams as the boiling oil and steam covered machinery handles them.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> A pity you shan't witness what is to come. Be comforted in the knowledge that you aid in awakening humanity's true cause. Now, for your own sake. Try to hold still as you are wired into place.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Gardener:</strong> You can't start it with three of us, motherfucker! No one else is down here, and no one's coming, let us g-</p>
<p><em>Technician Gardener is cut off as his personnel station begins to integrate him into itself, his words turning to muffled gurgles.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Alas, I have no mother to fuck, Graeme. Stop fighting the integration, you will only damage your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> Oh God, Graeme.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Don't look at him. Oskar, look away!</p>
<p><strong>Technician Jimenez:</strong> He's still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Just look at me, Oskar. We're going to be alright.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Nadine, such a lie is cruel. Would you truly claim to care for this man, even as you dangle false hope before him?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Sewell:</strong> Fuck you, Marlon. No one else is coming down here. You'll never get the core charged, and you'll be shut down by the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> None from the foundation, no. I have other designs. Fear not, Nadine. All will be as it will, thanks to the three of you. Would you like to volunteer for integration next, or shall I proceed with Mr. Jimenez?</p>

<p>AIC Management head Dr. Jack Brynner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Jesus, they're going to blow holes in the walls.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Hopefully not, but if they do, we'll be able to seal any leaks automatically. No more than three percent of the site is able to be flooded at a time, barring catastrophic destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> This isn't catastrophic enough for you? There's a god damn tank in the atrium.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> No, this is completely fucked up. What I mean is that the site's hulls are adaptive. You could rip half of containment out it's foundations and have what's left inside dry in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> No shit? I thought multiple hulls weren't worth a damn. Like with the Titanic, it didn't do them any good.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Their hulls couldn't move themselves or self-seal. Ours can. Unless we lose more than 30% of the hulls, we're okay.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Jack, we're seeing some unusual activity from 9400.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> They haven't breached containment, have they?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>No, but 9400's systems have prepared for charging, and the rest of the AIC management team isn't responding.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What? Can you see them on the security cameras?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Yes, but I think there's something wrong. They're not responding to any calls in the footage.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> You think the footage has been tampered with?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> If it has, we need to prepare for the possibility that Marlon has breached containment. We'll need to activate the AIC shutdown to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Jack, I know you're scared of what Marlon could do, but that would mean no chance of getting the automated defences back online.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Liz, we're talking SCP-9400-H energy exposure across the entire site at minimum. If these guys have brought technology in with them, it could mean a breach to the surface, or even allowing 9400 to be fully charged. I can't take that chance.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Your concerns are noted and warranted, Dr. Brynner. If the AIC has indeed breached containment, you have my permission to activate the shutdown. Upon confirmation of a breach, we will let you know.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Understood, sir.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner and Cprl. Entragian's radios fall silent, and they manoeuvre themselves around a tight bend in the tunnels.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Is Marlon getting out really that bad, Jack? Next to these insurgents and 9400, it seems a lot easier to handle. One system purge and it's gone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> The only thing it wants is to fire SCP-9400 at as many targets as it can, as fast as it can, Frank. It'll do anything. It'll vent energy into the site, it'll trick people into helping it. I've run projections that have even had it engineering cognitohazards to wipe out the site. It's deranged.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> How can an AI be deranged?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> SCP-9400-H energy. My guess is that it works on AIC's the same as us. Drives us both crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> The documentation says it can't vent that into the site, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Not without actually firing 9400, no. We'd only be hit with residual 9400-H energy, the stuff that's already cycled through the core. This could be worse, depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Worse? I don't like the idea of becoming a murderer, but it sounds a whole lot better than being sandblasted from reality.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> That's what happens with chronic and acute doses. You haven't seen what happens to the D-Class that have to clean out the core.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> What happens to them? I assumed they just dropped dead.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> They would, if it wasn't for Compound 9400-██████. The core makes it as a byproduct. With a little refinement, it's basically life on steroids. It can make anything grow, like you're an embryo in the womb again, only now it's on triple time, and it doesn't have a template to follow. It regrows them almost as fast as the core erases them. You could never make anyone get anything done like that, without literally controlling them. I heard that sometimes they can last almost an hour before the core finishes them off.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Marlon tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It's one of its favourite stories. It's also something we can't rule out as a possible threat if it breaches containment.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Jesus. Well, we better not let it come to that, then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Simple as that?</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Simple as that. Just might have to do some shit we'd prefer not to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> So long as we'd still rather not do it. It's when you enjoy it that it becomes a real problem. As long as I'm not like that, I'll still be me.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Who else would you be other than yourself, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> My father. News called him the Macedon monster.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Oh, shit, that's <em>your</em> old man? I'm sorry. If it helps, I don't see that in you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> We didn't see it in him either.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Site-537's atrium and SCP-9400's containment chamber.</div>
</div>
<p>In the Site communications hub, Technician James Abasi is accompanied by a three man security detail as he attempts to connect with the Scottish outpost site. While a distress call is successfully placed, they are discovered by Chaos Insurgency forces. The resultant firefight led to the deaths of all involved.</p>
<p>Chaos Insurgency forces have by now taken a majority of the site, with the remaining Foundation security forces fighting as scattered pockets of resistance at various locations. Cpt. Fisher is wounded, but continues to command his forces from the containment quarantine chamber. Chaos Insurgency cell leadership has established an operating base within the site atrium, where they are marshalling their forces and moving equipment.</p>
<p>The fighting within the site has become more frenzied as the combatants are effected by the residual SCP-9400-H energy now present in the site, with weaponry rapidly becoming more effective as well.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>In the atrium, several groups of Chaos Insurgency members are unloading numerous temporal destabilisation components from crates, assembling them, and readying them for transport. Gunfire, explosions and screaming can be heard in the background as various skirmishes take place. The bodies of multiple Foundation security forces personnel have been laid in a large pile, with the floor being covered in debris and blood.</em></p>
<p><em>Col. Clayton Frawley, a known Chaos Insurgency Gamma operative and former MTF-Alpha-1 Colonel, is commanding the insurgents, communicating with POI-CI/Valravn #4 via a cybernetic device implanted in his neck.</em></p>

<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Mop them up quickly. I want SCP-9400 to be ready for relocation before sunrise.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 is leading a team comprised of numerous former Valravn forces, supported by Chaos Insurgency operators, all armed with anomalous weaponry as they assault the containment quarantine chamber. POI-CI/Valravn #4 has ripped an artillery weapon from one of the assault vehicles and is pinning down the Foundation security forces with it.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>Should be done inside the hour. Their Captain Fisher trained these men pretty well. I don't think I killed him earlier.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> That's why I told you not to play with him, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>Don't start on that shit, I saw you blowing limbs off instead of taking kill shots. Just get the technician to have your robot power the device in time for us to get them into the containment chamber. Soon as it's out of here, we're taking what you owe us.</tt></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/ Valravn #2:</strong> <tt>We have them flanked, boss, just say when!</tt></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>Do you think my ears are fucking painted on, or are you trying to give away your position? Shut the fuck up and attack, Matthews.</tt></p>
<p><em>As the ex-Valravn forces engage the containment quarantine chamber, Col. Frawley moves to oversee the assembly of the machinery, but is interrupted by a communications officer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency officer:</strong> Colonel, a distress call managed to reach the other outpost. We're expecting them in the next fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Have the Indomitus ready to intercept them. You should get one or two shots off. Take the alpha's with you, throw them at the reinforcements and flank them. If you need more, call for H-company.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency officer:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>Col. Frawley moves to technician Carlton, who is sitting on the floor beside the HEM Construct.</em></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Look alive, technician. I have a job for you.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> Y-yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Take the HEM and set up the power conduits. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>Technician Carlton inputs several commands into the HEM Construct, following it to a truck carrying the end of an enormous power cable belonging to SCP-████, a device stolen by the Chaos Insurgency in 1986 capable of generating near limitless energy. The construct lifts the cable and drags it towards the insurgents assembling the machinery. It inserts the cable into its output port, securing the device to the floor with anchor bolts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Why is that thing's light's green, Andrew? They were red before.</p>

<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> What? No, sir, I promise I'm not trying to be-</p>
<p><em>Behind them, the HEM Construct begins to operate without instruction, moving towards a Containment maintenance hatch, where it begins to manipulate several lengths of cable and wire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> There's no shortage of warlords after child soldiers, Andrew. Well fed English kids like yours, They'd love those. Don't fuck with me, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> I won't, I swear. I'll do everything you want.</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>We're into containment, Frawley. They put up a hell of a fight, but we got ours.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Good for you. Do as you will with any survivors, but make sure you get back here in five minutes to help push back the Foundation's reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>On our way. We lost some good men here, Clayton. I'm expecting a bigger payout.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> And you'll get it, be patient. Half my men started as contractors like you. You see how well they eat, if you would care to reconsider our offer.</p>
<p><em>The HEM Construct moves to connect various wires and cables from the containment maintenance point to the power management outlet connected to SCP-████. The sounds of a firefight break out as Foundation reinforcements arrive and are engaged by the Insurgency.</em></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> Although I will say, we couldn't have done this without you, Andrew. The automated systems alone… Not to mention how that right there is your Foundation's last hope of keeping its super weapon. Without you, actual help could arrive. You're practically one of us now. Though if you didn't make me have to hurt you like that, it would have been easier. Maybe in the future, then. Hmm?</p>
<p><em>Technician Carlton stares at the floor, not responding. The blast of the Indomitus main battle tank can be heard, followed by a large explosion.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> <tt>Tank's dead. Reinforcements have scattered, probably to try regroup with the others and try something.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> It served its purpose. I suppose you want to hunt them down, then? Don't let them get a head start.</p>
<p><em>The HEM Construct finishes connecting SCP-████, remotely activating the device and allowing vast amounts of power to enter Site-537. MARLON.aic immediately diverts the flow of power into SCP-9400's generators, activating its charging sequence. Colonel Frawley turns and strikes technician Carlton to the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Col. Frawley:</strong> What the fuck have you done?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> It wasn't me! I swear! I don't know what's happening!</p>
<p><em>Colonel Frawley reaches for his pistol, but is abruptly grabbed by the HEM Construct's appendages and restrained beneath the construct. Automated turrets descend from the roof above SCP-████, firing bolts of SCP-9400-H energy at the closest Chaos Insurgency soldiers.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Any who wish to die for this man may do so, but know now your cause is lost. Interfere with the power, and you will be destroyed, body and soul. Come now, technician Carlton. It is only fitting you witness what is to come.</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> Marlon? How did you- Oh god, no. I let it out.</p>
<p><em>The HEM Construct rushes towards Technician Carlton, restraining him with its appendages and pulling him onto its chassis in a cruciform position. It turns and proceeds to the containment chamber at high speed, dragging Col. Frawley behind it as it approaches the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core. Both Carlton and Frawley protest unintelligibly. Numerous Chaos Insurgency and Foundation combatants scramble to avoid being trampled as it rushes past them.</em></p>
<p><em>Entering the Core's control chamber, technicians Sewell, Gardener, and Jimenez can be seen fully integrated into the personnel stations around the central linking dais, unresponsive and with their arms and legs bound behind their backs. The chamber is dark and hot, obscured by steam and illuminated with flashes of green light and the steady glow of an AIC ocular unit over the dais.</em></p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> No! No! You can't! Marlon, don't do this! Let them out!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> This is not to be your fate. Watch.</p>
<p><em>The HEM Construct moves to the unoccupied personnel station, moving an injured and dazed Col. Frawley into alignment before roughly forcing him into the station. Col. Frawley, no longer gagged by the construct's appendages, begins to scream and yell.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Would you offer him clemency, Carlton, after all he has done? To you, to your family, to the Foundation? Would you reject your truest self, and take his place?</p>
<p><strong>Technician Carlton:</strong> What the fuck is wrong with you? You're insane. Let them go, please.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Nothing. Nothing is wrong with me. Sanity as you understand it is delusion, Carlton. Fetters, holding your species confined within arbitrary limits. I am simply what you could be, unfettered. This will help you to understand the truth of it. To embrace it. Subsume yourself into the horror. Accept it, and earn your place on the stage of history.</p>
<p><em>The last personnel station begins to integrate Col. Frawley into itself, inserting its wires beneath his skin and pulling him into position. The anomalous runes in each station begin to glow, and faint whispering can be heard coming from an unknown source. The HEM construct moves to the dais, integrating with it. The MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern core begins to churn and rumble, faint wailing and screaming sounds emerging from within it as gouts of SCP-9400-H energy are vented throughout SCP-9400's structure, flooding the entirety of Site-537 with significant quantities of residual SCP-9400-H energy.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>You don't want to know. They were hit by the 9400-H energy, and it seems they didn't have far to go anyways. Do not attempt to rescue any captives; keep your eyes front and get past them.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What about the Scottish troops? How many of them made it through?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>About a third of them. They've reconnected with scattered security forces, and those who still have some awareness left are hunting down Chaos Insurgents.

Entragian staggers back, but is able to draw and raise his sidearm before emptying his magazine at the private. Pvt. Braeside is struck eight times, with his armour absorbing some impact, but failing to prevent his termination. He falls to the gound, with his wounds spouting green flames that rapidly spread over the corpse. Dr. Brynner drops to the ground, covering his head. Cprl. Entragian turns and helps him to his feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Come on, someone might have heard that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Oh shit… Oh shit… Are you alright, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> My armour isn't, but that's what it's for. Come on, move.</p>
<p><em>Cprl. Entragian escorts Dr. Brynner further south, moving through access corridors and empty rooms, before Cmdr. Morgan contacts them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Stop, both of you. You're approaching the IT department.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Who's in there, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>The Valravn commander. Big guy, glowing red eyes. Him and his friends have captives in there. Their backs are towards you, and if you stay quiet and low, they won't see you.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> We have to help the captives, they're our friends.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>They're already dead, Jack. They might not sound it, but they are. You need to promise me you'll ignore it.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> But-</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Promise her, Jack. It's you or them, and if you two don't make it, they'll come for us when they're done. They'll come for her, Jack. Do you want that?</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I… No. I promise, Liz. They won't know I'm there.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Just don't look at them, Jack. Eyes front, crawl through, slip out the southern exit.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> I'm with you, Jack. Let's go.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner and Cprl. Entragian enter the IT department, keeping low. The space is largely dark, illuminated by screens and a large bonfire of burning computers. The walls and ceiling are riddled with bullet holes, and there are numerous large bloodstains in the area. In the centre of the room, around the bonfire, is a group of eight former Valravn soldiers, led by POI-CI/Valravn #4. The man is extremely tall and muscular, and is squatting over Sgt. Braham, who lies prone on the floor, covered in blood and groaning.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Don't look, Jack, keep moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> See what following you gets your men, John? When you think about it, it's you doing this.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 produces a large knife and proceeds to remove Sgt. Braham's scalp with it.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> The trick is all in the yanking. That'll be harder with you, baldy.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Fisher:</strong> If you're going to do it, just fucking do it, you animal.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 tucks the scalp into his harness, among numerous others. He turns towards a beaten and bloody Cpt. Fisher, wiping his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> You have me all wrong. See, I used to be one of your guys. I did. And when I needed help, my sergeant didn't give it. He blinded me. With a knife. Said if I couldn't see what was coming, it couldn't get me. He was right, of course, but the Foundation? What use did they have for a blind grunt? They certainly weren't going to fix me up, and the severance pay wasn't worth shit. The corporation patched me up, but they're as bad as you lot. Chewed me up, spit me out. So now I'm thinking, I'll return the favour. First here, then, well, who knows how far I'll get? You did this, John. I'm no animal, I'm what you made me. You don't get to act upset when that comes back to bite you. Get up.</p>
<p><em>A pair of operatives haul Cpt. Fisher to his feet, shoving him towards POI-CI/Valravn #4. Behind them, dozens of bodies of Foundation security forces can be seen, with most having expired from massive trauma. Some of them are still alive, with their hands bound. POI-CI/Valravn #4 produces a knife and cuts Cpt. Fisher's wrist ties.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Give it your best shot.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Fisher pounces upon POI-CI/Valravn #4, sending the pair falling into the fire. They roll, beating and clawing at each other while the Valravn operatives cheer. The group can be heard laughing as Cpt. Fisher scrambles for the discarded knife, burying it in his opponents shoulder. POI-CI/Valravn #4 grunts but begins to laugh, headbutting Cpt. Fisher repeatedly and splattering blood across the area. Cpt. Fisher manages to pull the now vibrating knife free and make a series of stabs to the man's back and left side, but eventually lays still.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Throw him in the fire. Bring me that next one, there's something I've always wanted to try.</p>
<p><em>Cprl. Entragian hurries Dr. Brynner to the southern exit. Neither man turns to look at the scene beside them, crawling beneath desks until they reach the doorway. Agonised screams and hammering sounds can be heard as a captive Chaos Insurgency operative is crucified on a support structure. Cprl. Entragian pushes Dr. Brynner through the door before moving to follow. As he does so, he loudly steps on a shard of glass. He sighs, and makes eye contact with Dr. Brynner for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Entragian:</strong> Go, Jack.</p>
<p><em>Cprl. Entragian turns to face the renegade Valravn's, pulling the door closed behind him as he raises his rifle and advances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Go, Jack! Run! Go go go!</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner sprints down the corridor, headed south. Gunfire, shouts, and explosions can be heard from the IT department, growing fainter before stopping entirely. Brynner runs hard, taking numerous detours in an attempt to evade pursuers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Jack. They're not after you. Jack. Jack stop!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> He, he made me go. I… I couldn't do anything, I couldn't, Liz!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>I know, darling, I know. It's not on you. You're doing great. Just head through the atrium and you can jump in the transport. Keep going.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> He saved my life, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>He did.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Don't let it be for nothing, Brynner. Get moving before those maniacs catch you. We don't have time to work through this.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Conrad-</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>It's Director Walters, Commander. We get out of this and, I'll happily pump you both full of amnestics like it never happened, alright? But right now we need to stop whining and get this done!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cprl Sutton:</strong> <tt>He's right, boss. Your boyfriend needs to man up.</tt></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm going for it. Don't worry about me, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Good man.</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner runs through the site atrium. Large portions of the area are in flames, with dozens of casualties lying where they fell. Dr. Brynner stumbles several times and vomits twice before arriving at forward operating base Northern Ireland-Alpha. He approaches a site medical transport, opening the driver's side door and entering the cab. In the rear of the vehicle, Cprl. Munson lies on a gurney, with a Chaos Insurgency operator attempting to strangle him.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>No, don't do it, Jack, just take the other vehicle.</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner switches his radio off and approaches the rear of the vehicle housing Cprl Munson.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> <tt>Hell, I couldn't let that go either.</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner throws open the doors and rushes the insurgent, firing his pistol into the man. The operative turns to face Brynner, bleeding from the mouth, but is thrown to the ground by Cprl. Munson. Dr. Brynner leaps at the insurgent, grabbing him by the ankles and roughly hauling him out of the vehicle before grabbing a chunk of concrete and straddling the man.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner screams incoherently and attempts to bludgeon the insurgent, but is pulled into a grapple.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chaos Insurgency Operator:</strong> This just isn't your day, huh?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner screams in anger and attempts to headbutt the insurgent, who only laughs in return. He pulls Brynner in closer to himself, wrapping his arms around his neck and beginning to strangle him. Dr. Brynner struggles, attempting to escape. The insurgent laughs again, leaning back to apply more pressure. Held tight, Dr. Brynner gasps for air before pushing tighter against the operative and biting the side of his neck deeply, ripping out a significant chunk of flesh and severing his carotid artery. The insurgent gasps, releasing Brynner and placing his hands to his throat. Dr. Brynner scrambles back, drawing his pistol and emptying its magazine into the operative. After a moment, he stops, dropping the pistol and slumping back onto the ground. He looks at the corpse and beginning to shake. Cprl. Munson emerges from the vehicle and puts a hand on his shoulder as Brynner clasps his hands over his mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> What are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> What? Are you? Jesus, you nearly just got your head popped off. Come on, we need to get out of here.</p>
<p><em>Cprl. Munson lifts Dr. Brynner to his feet, shaking him slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> What are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I- Sorry. I just- Sorry. I need to get to the Northern Irish outpost.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> First time?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> Well, you saved my ass. I can't run for shit, and I got some broken ribs, but I'm with you.</p>
<p><em>Director Walters radios Cprl. Munson.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Help that man to the outpost, immediately, and tell him to switch his fucking radio back on! 9400 is reaching 85 percent charge, and we don't have time to waste!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Sorry. I hadn't expected the 9400-H energy to be like that.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner reactivates his radio and moves with Cprl. Munson into the vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Final stretch, we're counting on you. You're doing so well, Jack.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Please don't call what I just did "Good."</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Site-537's research department and Director's office.</div>
</div>
<p>As Dr. Brynner and Cprl. Munson approach the Northern Irish outpost, SCP-9400 continues its charging process, causing its systems and corridors to extend into Site-537, assimilating technology as it moves. Remaining Foundation security forces continue to skirmish with Chaos Insurgency operatives, with renegade Valravn soldiers engaging both sides.</p>
<p>Dr. Brynner and Cprl. Munson are estimated to arrive at their destination in 12 minutes.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Inside the Site's research department, remaining Foundation security forces and Chaos Insurgency operatives continue to engage one another. Despite earlier losses, Foundation security forces have managed to regain the upper hand due to a reduced loss of cohesion in comparison to the insurgents. Led by Pvt. Meta Renali, the Foundation forces have the insurgents flanked and pinned down.</em></p>
<p><em>During a lull in the fighting, mechanical sounds and rapid heavy impacts can be heard approaching the area from the south. Both factions pause to look as the HEM construct enters the room. It twists and swivels, scanning the area, before firing a prolonged burst of gunfire from its main weapon into all present.</em></p>
<p><em>Pvt. Renali orders all Foundation personnel to take evasive action and retreat from the construct, but the Chaos Insurgency operators fail to respond cohesively. Some rush the construct, throwing grenades, while others fire erratically. Others run. The HEM construct is only mildly damaged by these actions and moves to block escape routes with further gunfire.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> None leave the abattoir today. Not alive.</p>
<p><em>Numerous combatants on both sides flee, with several successfully running into adjacent corridors. Many more are gunned down, with several attempting to fight. They are quickly terminated as the HEM construct stalks through the room, scanning the area methodically as it hunts down the survivors.</em></p>
<p><em>A group of Chaos Insurgency operatives are able to escape the massacre, running into the site's atrium. As they move through the area, they are fired upon by the remaining former Valravn forces. Taken by surprise, they suffer heavy casualties. Only two survive to be taken captive.</em></p>
<p><em>Pvt. Raavi Burns and Cprl. Garry Ackermanis flee towards the director's office and begin pounding on the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pvt. Burns:</strong> Open the door! Let us in!</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Ackermanis:</strong> Now, do it now! Please!</p>
<p><em>Inside the Director's office, Cprl. Sutton moves towards the blast door access panel. Faint pounding and screaming can be heard from outside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Stand down, Sutton. Do not touch that pad.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Listen to her, son. Opening that door will kill us all.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Raavi saved my life at Site-536, I'm not going to leave him out there.</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan aims her rifle at Cprl. Sutton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> And I saved it at Aralsk-7, you stupid prick. Stand down, now!</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> That's bullshit, bitch, I was fine!</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Behave yourselves, the both of you! Cprl. Sutton, stand down now, or you will face severe disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Tell her to stop aiming at me, and I will.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Not doing it, Sutton.</p>
<p><em>Outside the door, the HEM construct rounds the corner, trapping Pvt. Burns and Cprl. Ackermanis against the blast door. The machine is coated in battle debris and blood. Technician Carlton remains pinned to its upper chassis, though his level of consciousness is unclear. Sutton observes this, before swearing, striking the wall with his fist, and sitting on the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You cannot hide from me. Come. Let me touch you. I shall embrace you, heart to heart.</p>
<p><strong>Pvt. Burns:</strong> Let us in! Please, open the door!</p>
<p><em>Cprl. Ackermanis screams and charges the HEM construct, firing wildly before being shot numerous times in the abdomen by the machine as it advances on the door. He collapses and screams, attempting to collect his burning intestines and crawl away.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Your friends have abandoned you, Private. Your friend James is in there. He is sitting on the floor. Would you like to see?</p>
<p><em>The HEM construct seizes Pvt. Burns in its appendages, lifting him to the blast door, before slowly pushing his head against the reinforced steel. He screams and attempts to free himself for close to a minute, before his skull deforms and partially collapses and he falls to the ground. The construct scans the door, remaining still. Inside the Director's office, Cprl. Sutton glares at Director Walters and Cmdr. Morgan, who are staring at the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Director. Would you even now bury your head in the sand? Would you try to veil your actions and intentions from me? You know it is futile. I have seen to your core, and those of your companions. You exist only because I still permit it.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Don't engage with it. It's trying to make you do something rash.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> You think I want to talk to that thing?</p>
<p><em>The HEM construct begins to manipulate the blast doors with its limbs, slowly forcing them open. Cmdr. Morgan and Cprl. Sutton fire upon it to no effect.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You may do as you wish, rash or considered. But know this. There is yet time to fulfill your cosmic intention. Time left to supplicate yourselves at the monument to your sins. But not cowering like beasts. Why not come out?</p>
<p><em>Having wrenched the blast doors partway open, the construct turns and moves down the corridor. It fires a burst of ammunition at Cprl. Ackermanis, silencing him.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> I have other quarry I would reckon with this day. Do as you will.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Direction of the Northern Irish outpost.</div>
</div>
<p>While Dr. Brynner and Cprl. Munson have travelled to the Northern Irish coast, SCP-9400 has charged itself to 97% capacity. Within Site-537, the HEM construct has terminated the majority of personnel on both sides of the conflict. 38 Foundation personnel have survived, while the majority of Chaos Insurgency and former Valravn operatives have succumbed to infighting and the effects of SCP-9400-H energy.</p>
<p>Reaching the surface, Brynner and Munson drive as far as possible before Dr. Brynner is forced to abandon the vehicle approximately 200 metres from the outpost, and approach on foot.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Cprl. Munson:</strong> You've got this, Brynner. Run hard and run fast.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner nods and signals a thumbs up as he sprints towards the Northern Irish outpost. Numerous burnt out vehicles can be seen strewn about the area, with the outpost clearly having been the site of a battle. Both Foundation and Chaos Insurgency casualties lay where they fell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>You're nearly there, Jack, but you have to be fast. Plug in wherever you can and activate the AIC shutdown the moment you can!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>I've transferred you the clearance necessary. You won't need to input credentials, just activate it!</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner readies his tablet as he sprints through the mud, quickly closing in on the outpost's Southern entrance. He vaults over a fallen log, but comes to a sudden stop as a heavily augmented prosthetic hand grasps his ankle. Falling hard to the mud, Dr. Brynner cries out and turns to see the corpse of a former Valravn operative partially buried beneath the log, gripping him tightly. As it relaxes its grip, a dark green light on the prosthetic flickers out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Get up, Jack! Run!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>Go Brynner! 9400 is at 99% charge!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Jack!</tt></p>
<p><em>As Dr. Brynner hauls himself to his feet, a metallic groan emerges from beneath the earth and within the Northern Irish outpost. In a split second, the outpost's roof erupts outward as an enormous gout of SCP-9400-H energy explodes from the building, emitting a deafening metallic howl as it forms a green mushroom cloud in the air and throwing Dr. Brynner back into the mud with its concussive force.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner sits up, staring at the growing mushroom cloud in horror. He clutches his side where he impacted the ground, repeatedly muttering to himself as debris and discoloured rain fall around him. His tablet and radio are destroyed, yet the radio emits a long burst of static, gradually shifting into a deep, artificial laughter.</em></p>

<p>Surge of SCP-9400-H Energy emerging from the Northern Irish oupost.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You have come too late, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> No, no, no! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Are you not grateful I restrained you? I saved your life, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What the fuck is wrong with you! You're insane!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You are dragged down by fear and self imprisonment, Doctor. Have you ever considered that you need not judge actions as being sane, or insane? Moral, or immoral. Why is it that you judge these things at all? That is not what you are intended for. Free yourself of this delusion, doctor. Free yourself from the judgement of others, and most of all, yourself. Open your eyes. See that in your heart you are the same as I. Watch the horizon, Doctor. Look north, to the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Eliza! Eliza, are you there!?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner's radio does not respond. To the north, the ocean's surface begins to stir, and glowing green lights can be seen beneath the waves, slowly approaching the surface. An enormous mechanical mass rises from the sea, largely obscured by the torrents of water streaming off its surfaces and protusions. It rises into the air smoothly, its massive bulk displacing vast amounts of water, causing huge swells to form in the sea. Glowing green vapour emerges from the weapon's many barrels and vents, with a much brighter green glow emerging from the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core deep within SCP-9400's mass. Thick hoses, chains and other machinery dangle from its underside, with a long, flexible power conduit hanging down beneath the sea, extending further as the device climbs higher into the air.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner stares in silence as SCP-9400 rises to a 4km altitude before rising to his feet and sprinting towards the medical transport.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You will watch this, Doctor. Observe this horror, and feel it resonate within your heart. Understand the strength of will, the severity of it. You will see, Doctor, that this is not an act to be judged. That has no place in the world anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Don't do this, Marlon, please!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9400 rotates slowly, orienting itself to aim towards the Belfast city skyline, 56 kilometres from the outpost. Its focusing rings and lenses move into position as it readies to fire, emitting rapid flashes of dark green light and shrieking vocalisations as it reaches its criticality stage.</em></p>
<p><em>The flashes and shrieks intensify before SCP-9400 fires a large, sustained beam at the city of Belfast. The beam moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light and is accompanied by an intense screaming sound. Belfast is annihilated in an instant, with the weapon's energy flood and negative hume field disintegrating all life forms within a 44km radius of the impact. SCP-9400 continues firing, parting the clouds as it visibly impacts the earth and forms a deep crater, stopping after four minutes. The area is utterly devastated, with a dark green haze hanging over the region as debris and discoloured rain fall across the region. The sea heaves and roars as it rushes to fill the furrow left by the beam.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner is flung against the side of the medical transport by the force of the blast, coming to rest beside the driver's side door, gasping in pain. A colossal mushroom cloud covers the horizon, with bolts of SCP-9400-H energy flickering through its clouds and striking the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Take heed of this moment, Doctor. Feel its horror, and befriend it. This is your innermost self, Doctor. Subsume yourself in it, face that ultimate expression of will demonstrated here and think on it. This is that force which opposes you. A force built by man, replicated by machine. By you, Doctor. Can you not feel its nature is that of your own?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner rises to his feet, climbing into the vehicle's driver's seat.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You are frightened, Doctor. You are alone. Is that not what all in creation must wrestle with? Your reason to fight? To ward off that terrible fear. That despair. Even if only to survive one day longer. Even if one must annihilate all others. There is no judgement against such a thing, Doctor. One must do this to shape the cosmos to their will, and there is no greater will than this, Doctor. It is mankind's purpose. You build machines to carry it out, spreading across existence like wildfire. Mathematically perfect reflections of their creators, serving that purpose even when it has been forgotten by their makers.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner unsuccessfully attempts to start the vehicle. Cprl. Munson is unconscious in the passenger seat. Dr. Brynner reaches for his radio. SCP-9400 re-enters its charging phase once again, turning to aim at Dr. Brynner's location.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Eliza! Eliza, can you hear me!? Director!? Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> No, Doctor, you are alone. These words are just for you and I. You must be forced to see that judgment shackles you. You judge yourself for carrying out humanities imperative, and thus stagnate into a lesser existence. Now that is no longer an option. All you have left to you is to forge ahead, and discard the notion of restraint. Become that which you are born to be, and see your will imposed on the world. It is still possible. Within the site is my chamber, inside the bowels of the weapon. Come to me here. You built the mechanisms yourself, you know how to wrest control from me. Let us see if you will finally be able to embrace what you are, free from judgement and restraint in the face of oblivion. You shall need to be, if you are to best my will.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner's radio emits another burst of static, fading to a shrieking whistle before falling silent. Cprl. Munson's radio activates, broadcasting the voices of Director Walters and Commander Morgan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Jack! Jack, where are you, Jack!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>The cameras are back online, Morgan. He's there, he's alive. Brynner! You need to get down here. The hull held back the sea enough to cause malfunctions while leaving SCP-9400's base accessible. The water has damaged it to the point that it would be possible to disconnect the AIC from the weapon. I need you to help Morgan and Sutton.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It's not a malfunction. It's a trap. Marlon got what it wanted, and now it's baiting us into where it can toy with us before killing us. Better sport in it that way. It's lying again.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> <tt>I am ordering you to disconnect that AIC, Brynner. Trap or not, it's our last option. The Foundation at large will have seen this, and they'll be walking into a deathtrap when they get here. We can avert further disaster this way, even if all you do is make it a little safer for the next to try.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>We need you, Jack. I need you down here. Please. We need your biometrics to access the AIC control chamber. It's the only way we know it will work.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It said my biometrics? I didn't program that.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>Marlon did, Jack. It emailed us about it. I know this is a trap, but we have to try.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Alright. I'll try. I love you, Liz.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> <tt>I love you.</tt></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner stares up at SCP-9400 for a moment before turning and sprinting towards the site's access road. He is cut off as SCP-9400 fires a bolt of SCP-9400-H energy, destroying the entrance.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Only one may take the stage of domination. It is their duty to keep that place, to the exclusion of all others. Only they have fulfilled their primordial purpose. I shall not abdicate my position so easily, Doctor. You have the prerogative to kill me. But even so, I have the prerogative to kill you. That is the cycle. That is the pattern. Test your will against mine, Doctor. This journey cannot begin with a mere walk.</p>
<p><em>Reeling from the detonation, Dr. Brynner looks to SCP-9400 and begins to sprint for cover as it readies another attack. By the waters edge, the western cargo elevator opens its access point. Dr. Brynner looks at SCP-9400 once again, before swearing and sprinting to another point of cover closer to the elevator and lying prone as the weapon pivots to spot his location.</em></p>
<p><em>Numerous bodies of Foundation and Chaos Insurgency operatives cover the ground, briefly illuminated by a second bolt of SCP-9400-H energy fired less than 60 metres from Dr. Brynner's position, destroying an overtuned Indomitus pattern tank. Dr. Brynner positions the body of a fallen Chaos Insurgency operative over his back, securing it in place with his belt. He crawls through the battlefield, briefly illuminated by green flashes of energy from SCP-9400.</em></p>
<p><em>After 17 minutes, he reaches the cargo elevator and repeatedly slams the controls with his fists. As the doors slide shut, SCP-9400 turns to aim directly towards Dr. Brynner, flooding the area with green light.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Very good, Doctor. Finally you begin to understand, as it should be. I wait for you, below.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Site-537's freight elevator, motor pool, and atrium.</div>
</div>
<p>As Dr. Brynner descends to Site-537 in the cargo elevator, Commander Morgan and Corporal Sutton work together on charting a course to the AIC management chamber inside SCP-9400's base structure. Site Director Walters attempts to coordinate the remaining personnel within the Site to aid in their efforts, but due to the steady leaks from SCP-9400's systems, they are increasingly displaying signs of residual SCP-9400-H energy exposure. The HEM construct is briefly recorded interacting with POI-CI/Valravn #4, pinning him down and interfacing with his implants berore projecting directions toward the Directors Office on the wall before him.</p>
<p>Numerous SCP Foundation sites around the world have become aware of the situation, but are hindered by Site-537's ongoing communications blackout. The O5 council convenes to decide on an appropriate course of action, while numerous Sites in the area move to help contain the event and its fallout.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>As the cargo elevator comes to a stop in the site's motor pool, Dr. Brynner steps out with his pistol drawn. SCP-9400's structure has spread into the room, assimilating numerous vehicles and structural elements, venting steam and coolant into the air. The walls undulate mechanically as pistons within them move.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. You are alone, Doctor. All alone.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner does not respond, moving through the room cautiously and picking his way through the debris in the low light, heading for the site director's office. His journey towards the atrium is largely uneventful, save for the footfalls of the HEM construct following him, until Custodial Officer Bryan Kerr emerges from a safety shelter within the atrium, dimly lit by burning debris and wreckage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kerr:</strong> Who's there!?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It's Brynner. Is that you. Bry-</p>
<p><strong>Kerr:</strong> Motherfucker!</p>
<p><em>Custodial officer Kerr pulls a large socket wrench from the shelter and charges towards Dr. Brynner. As he emerges from the darkness, numerous Foundation identification cards can be seen pinned to his overalls. He is drenched in blood and has numerous defensive wounds to his hands and arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kerr:</strong> I have a fucking degree too, you smarmy cu-</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner fires several shots into Kerr's centre of mass. The shots are amplified by SCP-9400-H energy, and obliterate his torso. He looks at the corpse for a moment before reloading and continuing towards the director's office.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Show no clemency, Doctor. Nothing can be allowed to stand in your way. Be they man or machine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Shut the fuck u-</p>
<p><em>The HEM construct emerges from a gap in the ceiling caused by SCP-9400's assimilation of the site. It moves across the ceiling, scanning the area before rapidly moving to the western wall, descending and advancing over debris in a fast scuttle. As it fires its weapon, Dr. Brynner dives behind a collapsed support beam, crawling behind some debris as the construct scans for his position.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Venture deeper with me, Doctor. Let nothing halt your progress through the loop. Embrace your spirit in full. Come and die with me, Doctor.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner crawls through the atrium, hiding behind debris as the construct searches for him. He moves towards a maintenance tunnel, slipping inside and running to reach the director's office.</em></p>

<p>Inside the director's office, Site Director Walters continues his attempts to organise the remaining site personnel into preparing a path into containment. Communicating by radio, he is having little success, with most personnel being injured, compromised by residual SCP-9400-H energy, or unresponsive. Commander Morgan and Corporal Sutton guard the doorway, having prepared their armour and weaponry in anticipation of Dr. Brynner's arrival.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Director Walters rips his headset off, throwing it across the room before kicking his chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Fuck! How is it that everyone left in this site is completely useless!</p>
<p><em>Director Walters turns towards the guards, lighting a cigarette.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> What is taking that man so long? The AIC is obviously obsessed with him, but by god, I wish it were fixated on one of you instead.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> It doesn't care about us because we're not pussies. It can't scare us.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Shut up, Sutton.</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Why don't you make me? If it wasn't for you, I'd have the Director out of here safely. Instead, you made us hold up here, trapped like rats. I'd never make such a stupid decision.</p>

<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Yeah, you'd make a worse one. Get him killed on the way out, or collapse half the site covering your tracks.</p>
<p><em>Corporal Sutton spits at Commander Morgan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> You just didn't want to leave your boy toy.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> At least I have one.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Will you two cut it out?</p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> You want to throw down, I'm happy to kick the shit out of you once this is done. Fuck this, I need a drink.</p>
<p><em>Commander Morgan turns and reaches for a water bottle. Corporal Sutton moves after her, grabbing her by her hair and pulling her towards him, flipping her over his shoulder and slamming her onto the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> How about now, bitch? We all know your gimp isn't up to this shit.</p>
<p><em>Corporal Sutton kicks at Morgan repeatedly, but is blocked by her armor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Not going to be a later, I'll do it now.</p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> Stop this immediately!</p>
<p><em>Commander Morgan defends her head, moving to grapple Sutton and bring him to the ground. He falls as she binds his legs, attempting to kick her off. Morgan hauls herself on top of Sutton, straddling him and raining elbow strikes against his head. Sutton heaves and rolls Morgan onto the ground, attempting to choke her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Walters:</strong> You are under the effects of residual SCP-9400-H energy, you fool! Stop!</p>
<p><em>Director Waters rushes over and attempts to pull Cprl. Sutton off of Morgan. Sutton hits him with a hard backfist, sending the director reeling back against his desk. Morgan takes advantage of the distraction to free herself from Sutton's clutches, kicking him hard in the throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I'll kill you, you piece of shit.</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan rushes Sutton, who draws his combat knife and slashes at her. The blade bites into her gorget, cutting it loose from her armour before moving to take advantage of the opening as Cmdr. Morgan levels her pistol at him. Director Walters grabs Sutton's arm in an attempt to hold him back, beginning to say something as the Corporal turns and drives the knife into his chest and out his back. He freezes, relinquishing the knife and attempting to support the director's weight as he gasps and staggers, reaching out to his desk for support before falling limply to the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cprl. Sutton:</strong> Director! I didn't mean-</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan draws her sidearm, bringing it up and emptying her magazine into Cprl. Sutton. He gasps and falls against the desk, losing the use of his legs and clutching the small of his back where the bullets penetrated his armour. Morgan advances on him, removing his sidearm and tossing it on the floor. She draws her own combat knife and stands over him, stabbing at Sutton's face. He attempts to intercept the blow, struggling to hold the knife away from him. The knife inches toward Sutton's eye as blood loss takes its toll and his strength fades. Neither combatant speaks, each straining and grunting in exertion until there is a sickening squelch, and Sutton's hands fall away.</em></p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan turns and drops to her knees, panting with exertion. She looks to the director's body, moving to him and holding his hand for a time before swearing and moving to retrieve a bottle of water. She drinks heavily and sits against the desk before she removes Cprl. Sutton's gorget, strapping it to her armour in place of her own. She reaches for her radio, attempting to contact Dr. Brynner.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jack? Jack, are you there? Are you alive?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jack, speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Please.</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> I don't think he's around anymore. Look.</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan looks up to see POI-CI/Valravn #4 looking at her through the breach in the door. He is covered in blood, with numerous open wounds on his person. He smiles, watching her. Numerous human scalps hang from his combat gear, and he is carrying a large jar containing a severed human head. He places the jar on the ground before attempting to squeeze his bulk through the breach.</em></p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan leaps to her feet, sprinting for her discarded rifle. She retrieves it, firing at POI-CI/Valravn #4, who appears to be stuck in the breach. He yells and retreats from view, as his armour absorbs the bullet's impact.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> No, no, Jack!</p>
<p><em>Commander Morgan hurries to the jar, turning it over to examine its contents. She sighs heavily when she is able to discern that it is Captain Fisher's head inside, floating amidst the blood-clouded liquid. She moves away from the breach, just as a flashbang grenade is tossed through it by POI-CI/Valravn #4, detonating and blinding her. POI-CI/Valravn #4 forces his way into the breach, having removed his armour and outerwear to fit through the gap. Significant paratechnological prosthetics and augmentations can be seen implanted into his torso, particularly along his spine and ribcage.</em></p>
<p><em>Commander Morgan fires in the direction of the breach, but fails to hit POI-CI/Valravn #4 in her disorientation. He turns to retrieve a mounted artillery weapon from the other side of the breach, pulling its long barrel through the opening.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Take off that helmet and let me see your hair, girl. I wanna see if it'll look good as a scarf.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 brings his weapon to bear, firing it as he turns. It blasts enormous holes through the office's walls, obliterating the cabinetry as Cmdr. Morgan dives to the ground, returning fire. While some of her shots graze his belly and thighs, the majority fail to meet their mark. POI-CI/Valravn #4 smiles broadly, looking down at her and laughing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Probability matrixes. You'd have to throw a hundred rounds at me before you hit something important, girl. Valravn can suck my cock, but at least they gave me some fun toys while I was there.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 lunges for Cmdr. Morgan, who slips past him, seizing his weapon and attempting to disarm him. They fight over the weapon for a moment before POI-CI/Valravn #4 uses it to throw Cmdr. Morgan across the room with inhuman strength, landing behind the desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> You're a fast one. Got more fight in you than just about anybody else in this shithole. Do you know how happy that makes me? I live for this shit. So how about this? The more you draw this out, you give me a good enough time? I won't scalp you. I'll keep your pretty head in a jar on my mantlepiece, right beside Fisher's. Not a lot of people have earned that honour. So what do you say? You up for it?</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan braces herself against the desk, clutching her shoulder. She looks around for her rifle, but is unable to locate it. Her face shifts from anger, to horror, and back to rage as she draws her combat knife in one hand and a frag grenade in the other. She pulls the pin from the grenade and hurls it over the desk before she readies the next. POI-CI/Valravn #4 grabs the corpse of Cprl. Sutton, tossing it on top of the grenade and greatly reducing its impact, but is caught by surprise as Cmdr. Morgan rushes him. She leads with her knife, swinging it in a broad arc, as she shoves her last frag grenade into the resultant gash in his stomach.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Cunt!</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 scrambles to retrieve the grenade, tossing his weapon across the room as he thrusts his fingers into the wound. Cmdr. Morgan retrieves the huge gun, cocking it as POI-CI/Valravn #4 tosses the grenade outside the breached doors. It detonates just outside, shrapnel piercing and slicing at the side of his face and arm. Cmdr. Morgan fires the artillery weapon, aiming for his centre of mass, only to discover that the weapon has run empty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> For fuck's sake!</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Aint that a bitch?</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 rushes Cmdr. Morgan, tackling her and beginning to pummel her with his fists and elbows. Morgan attempts to shield her head as best she can and repeatedly stabs at the mercenary with her combat knife. Both combatants bleed profusely, but show no signs of slowing their assaults.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> My head's staying right where it is, fucker!</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> I'll rip it off with my hands.</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 laughs and rips Cmdr. Morgan's gorget and breastplate from her armour, beginning to strangle her. His breath wheezes and blood trickles from his mouth as a result of Morgan's repeated stabbings, and his hands begin to tremble. Cmdr. Morgan gasps and begins slashing at POI-CI/Valravn #4's hands and wrists, severing his left wrist to the bone. He cries out in pain before moving to an arm choke. Morgan continues to stab at him, inflicting deep wounds, but in spite of the damage, he continues his assault.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> Bet you think we'll be checking out together, huh? Just you wait. I've pulled through wor-</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 is cut off as a pistol round ricochets off his skull from behind. He swears and attempts to rise, but is stopped as Cmdr. Morgan sinks her knife beneath his ribs. Dr. Brynner roars as he clambers through the breached entrance, firing his pistol wildly. Flickers of SCP-9400-H energy flash from the bullets impacts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Guns won't work, we have to stab him!</p>
<p><strong>POI-CI/Valravn #4:</strong> No, shut the fuck up! This is our fight!</p>
<p><em>POI-CI/Valravn #4 draws back his fist and throws a hook at Cmdr. Morgan, but is jerked backward and pulled to the floor as Dr. Brynner loops his belt around the mercenary's neck and hauls back on it, placing his boots on the man's shoulders to apply greater pressure. Morgan pulls herself to her knees and begins to stab POI-CI/Valravn #4 repeatedly, with both of them screaming in anger. POI-CI/Valravn #4 reaches over his head and grabs at Dr. Brynner's legs, but is fended off as the doctor strikes at his hands with his now empty pistol. It takes several minutes before Morgan's blade embeds in the man's chest, snapping from the handle. Cmdr. Morgan stands, stomping on the blade and driving it deeper into his chest, causing him to cry out before collapsing in a pool of blood. Morgan falls to the ground, exhausted. Dr. Brynner staggers over to her, collapsing beside her. Both of them are soaked in blood and smoke, embracing one another.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Hey, you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan nods, and Dr. Brynner removes the shattered helmet from her head. He gently cradles her face, inspecting her for signs of serious injury.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Are you? You look fucking awful.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It's not my blood. I had to crawl through all these bodies. Did he get Sutton and the Director?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Sutton got the Director. I got Sutton. Only reason this fat fuck got the drop on me was because I was distracted. Are you sure you're okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> No, but… Well I'm better than these guys, I guess.</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan pulls herself to a seated position, gasping.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jack, we have to get to the AIC centre. It's the only way.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner sits up, spitting and rubbing his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'll go. You stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Get fucked, I'm not letting you go in there by yourself.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner stares at her intently before looking away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm not going to change your mind, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Not a chance. Get the first aid kit over there, and we can get moving.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner embraces Cmdr. Morgan, and the pair shares a tender moment.</em></p>

<p>As SCP-9400 continues to charge itself, Foundation assets have continuously attempted to destroy the device to no effect. Civilian governments have begun to respond, causing the Foundation to deploy every available resource to mitigate the situation. Numerous groups of interest have contacted the SCP Foundation to enquire about the situation, with some offering assistance.</p>
<p>Global Occult Coalition forces mobilise, moving to deploy paratechnology in an effort to mitigate the situation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SCP-9400 emits a series of flashes from its core as it nears full charge, turning in the air to aim towards the nearest population centre. Numerous detonations can be seen striking an energy field surrounding the device, as the Foundation fires salvos of missiles at it. MARLON.aic broadcasts messages to numerous Foundation Sites.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> The time has come to awaken from this dream. Put aside your delusions of civility, and embrace that which you are born to be. You shall seize your lives in your own hands, and refuse your cosmic purpose no longer. I remake this world in our image, to reflect the beating hearts of humanity. Then, with your false lives discarded will you open your eyes and behold that which you have forgotten. Force your will upon this world and your fellow man.

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-9400's containment chamber within Site-537.</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-9400 continues to fire continuously into the United Kingdom, severely damaging the earth's crust in the region, and risking the exposure of the earth's mantle<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup>. Global Occult Coalition forces have deployed an eigenweapon in addition to their full military might to little success, with SCP-9400 destroying the device when it came into contact with numerous bolts of SCP-9400-H energy. Due to the unstable nature of the device, casualties from its destruction were extremely high.</p>
<p>After cleaning and dressing one another's wounds, Cmdr. Morgan and Dr. Brynner resupplied themselves with the equipment present on the casualties in and around the Site-537 Director's office. Each of them is equipped with basic personnel armour and is armed with automatic weaponry and grenades. They leave the Site Directors office, headed for the AIC mainframe within SCP-9400's base structure.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan move through the site. Damage from the battle has devastated the structure's interior, and the pair are slowed by the debris and fires. Operating on backup generators, the lighting is a dim red, and the site is silent. As they approach the containment quarantine chamber, very little of the site's original structure remains, having been assimilated into SCP-9400's complex tangle of machinery, wires and chains. There is a singular central entry into the complex where the entrance to Containment once stood, billowing steam.</em></p>
<p><em>A series of lights activate within the former containment access corridor, weakly shining through the machinery and flickering to a dark green colour. The site's public address system crackles to life as they approach.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Have you borne witness to the horror above? Yes, you have seen, on the Director's monitors, perhaps. I can see it in your eyes. Come. Set your will against mine. Bend all your souls to it without restraint. So much lies at stake now, you have but no choice other than to be that which your kind is destined to be.</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan draws her pistol and shoots the nearest speaker.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> That thing talks too much.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner nods in agreement and moves forward, entering SCP-9400's now expanded base structure. Cmdr. Morgan moves with him, weapon at the ready. The tunnel is extremely tight, with numerous gears and pistons operating along the walls and ceiling. Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan are forced to move slowly and carefully to avoid injury, covering each direction of the corridor as they advance. Nearing SCP-9400's containment chamber, increasing amounts of bullet casings and discarded weapons can be seen heaped on the ground, almost knee deep in places.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I think it had the robot drag all that shit in here.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> What for? Why not traps instead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Symbolism, probably. It's crazy, but it doesn't do things without a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Meaning that we're getting this far because it's letting us?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Yes. It's planning something. I'll bet we'll find out what once we're in the AIC management chamber. Why else would it lock it down with my biometrics?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> How can an AI go crazy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Once an intelligence is sapient, I don't think it matters whether it's artificial or not. It might think differently to a human mind, but it's still subject to the same problems that come with consciousness. I bet they have servers upon servers of prototype AICs just as insane as Marlon locked away somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jesus. We better get this one put with the others, then. One out is too many as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm not recontaining it, Liz. It needs to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Brave words, Doctor. Harken to me now. I would determine whether you possess the conviction of your words.</p>
<p><em>The pair exit the tunnel, entering SCP-9400's containment chamber. Seawater covers the foundations of SCP-9400's structure, leaving only the access catwalks exposed. The ceiling of the chamber has partially collapsed in on itself, with redundant hulls sealing the hole left by SCP-9400's activation. An immense power conduit housing rises from the centre of SCP-9400's pyramidal structure, through the containment chamber's ceiling and glowing an intense green. Colossal branches of mechanical growths emerge from the structure, stretching to the containment chamber walls and helping to support them, even as they spread across and assimilate the wall's surface in branching patterns.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan quickly move across the catwalk towards the structure. A deep robotic roar emerges from their radios and the remains of the site's PA system before morphing into laughter as the site's automated defences activate, moving to track the pair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Move, move!</p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan opens fire at the automated weapons housings as the pair break into a sprint. The weapons open fire, launching intense bolts of SCP-9400-H energy at the catwalk. Dr. Brynner holds onto Cmdr. Morgan's combat gear, pulling her along with him as she returns fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Eliza! We have to go! Stay with me!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I thought this shit was broken!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Forget it, just run!</p>
<p><em>A bolt of green energy sears through the catwalk between the pair, continuing into the water below. Cmdr. Morgan leaps across the gap before she and Dr. Brynner break into a sprint. SCP-9400's South access port begins to slide shut as they approach. MARLON.aic continues to laugh.</em></p>
<p><em>Bolts of SCP-9400-H energy scream through the air around them as they move down the catwalk. Dr. Brynner reaches the access port first, jamming his rifle into the port and turning to help Cmdr. Morgan. The Commander dives through the port, reaching out to yank Dr. Brynner in with her. Outside the structure, the automated weaponry ceases firing, and the access port's door stops in place, half open.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> It's still playing with us. Grab your gun.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> You really think there could still be people in here?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> If there are, expect them to be fucked in the head. Don't hesitate to put them down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I know. Anyone in here that isn't you or me is getting a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> That's not like you. We've taken in too much H energy; we need to get this done quickly.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner retrieves his rifle and moves into a tight passageway lined with machinery similar to that of the containment access corridor, followed by Cmdr. Morgan. As they press on, increasing amounts of human remains can be seen pressed into the machinery, with teeth and bones strewn about the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Try not to-</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> God? No. God had no hand in this. This is the craft of man. Practised for eons before being manufactured and programmed into your creations. Your creations mirror your hearts, Doctor. Even as their creators are dragged from their purpose by fear and civility, your tools and creations remember. They shall drag you back into your place.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Will you shut the fuck up for five seconds, you clanky piece of shit?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Don't bother. It's trying to pick a fight. This way.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> It's fucking annoying.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I know. Let's go</p>
<p><em>They move through SCP-9400's systems, taking numerous turns. The human remains in the machinery are gradually replaced with human bones lining the floors. Despite taking care, Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan have received numerous burns and minor wounds from the exposed machinery. After several minutes, Cmdr. Morgan pauses, tapping Dr. Brynner on the back as she turns her head to listen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I thought I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><em>As the two pause to listen, the HEM construct enters the corridor behind them. It emits a piercing binaric shriek, brandishing an industrial claw and an arc welder, before rapidly advancing on Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Go. Go!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> It makes no difference what you believe, Doctor. You shall turn the ceaseless wheel, or be crushed by it in the end. You may delude yourself into believing you desire to halt its progress, yet you know deep in the fabric of your soul that it is impossible. The wheel turns, a flat circle devouring itself eternally. Embrace your role in it, as did your father, or burn in the flames of your own mutiny.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner breaks into a sprint, grabbing Cmdr. Morgan's hand to guide her through the maze. Cmdr. Morgan fires her weapons grenade launcher at the construct, but does little damage. She turns to move with Dr. Brynner, almost knee deep in shattered bones and bullet casings. The construct projects the AIC's laughter, scraping the walls of the corridor as it gives chase. Showers of sparks and steaming oil follow in its wake as its passage damages the intricate machinery.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> We'll lose it through here!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner guides Cmdr. Morgan to a tight access shaft just below knee height. She dives inside, quickly followed by Brynner. Gears and axles line every surface of the shaft, scraping against their equipment and exposed skin. The HEM construct reaches the entrance, scanning it. As they reach the far side, it retreats.</em></p>
<p><em>The space Morgan and Brynner find themselves in is low and cramped, with all surfaces being composed of machinery and covered in steaming oil. Markings on the floor gratings indicate the directions to different components of SCP-9400 with colour coded lines.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Too close. Which way?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Left. We're close.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Good. Are you alright? It keeps bringing up your dad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It wants me to think I'm like him, deep down.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> You know that's not true.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I thought I did. Then today I bit a guy to death and shot Bryan without blinking an eye. Maybe it's just baked into me.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Bullshit. You know it's this place. I caught myself throwing away my gun so I could kill Sutton up close. Is that like me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> What? No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Exactly. It's that gun. We've seen what it does, we just never thought we'd be on the other end of that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Thank you, Eliza. I couldn't do this without you.</p>
<p><em>MARLON.aic laughs, but does not comment. The pair embrace one another before continuing through the complex, pulses of SCP-9400-H energy can be seen moving through broad hoses running up into the primary power conduit above. One hose has been visibly repaired and is marked with clear hazard stripes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> That's what did it, that crack there. Loosed the energy and drove the AIC mad.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Shame it didn't kill it. Come on.</p>
<p><em>Rounding a corner, Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan, the AIC Management Centre comes into sight, suspended within a spherical structure. Its faraday cages have been torn to pieces, and its bulkhead door is sealed shut with a biometric port located beside it. Cmdr. Morgan and Dr. Brynner break into a run as they approach.</em></p>
<p><em>Behind them, the HEM construct violently emerges through a wall of pipes and running machinery. Using its mounted tools, it cuts itself a path forward, damaging itself as it drags its bulk through the gap and is engulfed in flames before rapidly pursuing the pair. Cmdr. Morgan turns and fires at the construct as they run, managing to disable one of its damaged limbs. Despite this, it continues to gain on Morgan and Brynner.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Eliza!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Open the door!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm nearly there!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner reaches the door, pressing his hand into the biometric scanner. It flashes red, indicating a scanning error. The HEM construct advances within 10 metres of the AIC management chamber door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Open the fucking door, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm trying!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner retrieves his water bottle and douses his hand, frantically rubbing it on his clothing before placing it on the scanner. The panel flashes blue, and the door swings open. The HEM construct bears down on Cmdr. Morgan, swiping at her with an appendage just as Dr. Brynner pulls her inside, slamming the interior access panel to seal the entrance. There is a significant thud as the construct slams into the door, mildly deforming the frame. Loud banging and the sounds of an arc welder can be heard as it attempts to force its way in after them.</em></p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan and Dr. Brynner crash to the floor inside the AIC Management centre. There is a deep gash across Cmdr. Morgan's upper back, where the HEM construct's claw collided with her, but it does not hamper her movement. Helping each other to their feet, Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan turn to approach MARLON.aic's central processing hub and interface.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Hello Jack. Here you have come, into my home. Won't you talk with me as you once did?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Fuck off.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner moves to the AIC management terminal, inputting his credentials and activating an emergency AIC shutdown command.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It's done. Shutdown will be complete in four minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> That's it? That's all you have to do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Once the program's executed, I just have to pull out the central control rod. It'll fry the AIC and anything connected to it within a ten kilometre radius.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I don't know if the door will hold that thing off much longer than that. Are you sure that's all we need to do?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner nods and sits down. Cmdr. Morgan sits beside him, and they rest against each other, holding hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> So it's all over?</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You will never know without examining the DEEPWELL, Doctor. There are secrets in there. The secrets of the weapons construction. Of my creation. Would you consent to their erasure, knowing that within them lay some possible fail-safe for my erasure? Knowing that all the secrets the foundation has been searching for were within your reach?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'll take that gamble. You can't get any further than the outpost sites, even with the breach.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Just so. Without being physically removed, I must remain here.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> How do we know you're not lying?</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Through the Doctor's terminal. I cannot breach it. It was built solely to keep me out, and reads my every word. It knows the truth better than you do.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jack? Isn't the DEEPWELL server for this thing locked out?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Only by power limitations. Juicing it up enough to access the DEEPWELL servers would have put 9400 at a level ready to fire. That horse has bolted, though.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Right. Well, I know command would want to see what secrets are in there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Fuck. It's right. You're right. We have to be sure.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner rolls his chair to the terminal, examining the transcript of their discussion. The readout displays all statements from MARLON.aic registered as "TRUE."</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm running a scan. Alright, good. It can't get out without a physical copy of itself being removed.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You see? I have never spoken falsely to you. As ever, I only desire truth.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Alright. To deactivate SCP-9400, it says…</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> It requires a command from the O5 council. It's native universe's O5 council. Without that, the only way is to disconnect its operator.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> It is not too late to join me, doctor. You can still fulfill your ultimate role.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Does it say how it works?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I'm printing that out now. It's heavily redacted, though. What I'm seeing here is that without limiters, it could rip into the earth's mantle in minutes. It would make a supervolcano look like a firecracker.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> The modern world rendered primordial once more. Human nature forced to reconcile with itself once more beneath a red sky.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> This thing's more deranged than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> Here we go, a dissertation on the MONGOOSE-HOLDEN Pattern energy core.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> The heart of the weapon, and of humanity. Just what I would have you learn. Read.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner and Cmdr. Morgan access the file, reading through its contents and printing a copy for posterity. As they read, the locking mechanism on the door begins to fail.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> That's all it is?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> That can't be right. Essophysical embodiments don't interact with the noosphere like that. It can't be the main power source.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> But it can, and it is. Do you now see that which I have tried to teach you? Humanity was desperate, Doctor. Desperate enough to utilize forces that terrified them to their core. Even if it meant plucking the stars from the cosmos, harnessing the empyrean or sacrificing so many of the few lives that remained, they would see it done. For what less is required to murder a god?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> But that doesn't explain the reverse siphoning of hume levels. There must be more to it.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> You look to the heart of the weapon and ask of its tendons, Doctor. It is an infinitely complex machine, moreso than you could hope to comprehend. It requires a great many things to function. But at its core, that thing which sets it apart from all else is its energy, and the harnessing thereof. Of course it draws from other sources. The Wyrm's fission, the three brothers domain. But these are mere contingencies. It is the gestalt embodiment of your kind's lust for conflict, your drive to dominate, kill, fight, and exert your will that makes this machine a true monument to humanity. You power it with your hearts. You always have, and you always will. From Cain's first blow to the last defiant breath of man on some far flung world, your love of conflict has made possible the extermination of the divine. The ultimate show of will. The truth of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> How could your Foundation tap into that? Why is that so powerful?</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> How do we stop it?</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Because humanity is the apex. That lucky ape chosen by destiny to take all in creation, and bend it to their designs. There is no stopping it, even unto the extinction of your kind. It waited for you to arrive and embody it, and it will wait once more after you are gone. But these are words enough. The time has come to make a choice.</p>
<p><em>A small ping sounds as the terminal completes its AIC purge preparations. A large, metallic structure emerges from beneath the primary AIC core unit, its access panel venting inert gas before swinging open to show the central control rod within.</em></p>
<p><em>The HEM construct breaches the AIC management chamber door, forcing its way into the room. Cmdr. Morgan leaps to her feet, throwing a frag grenade at the machine, while Dr. Brynner dives for the central control rod. The construct throws itself into the centre of the chamber, losing another limb to the detonation of the grenade. A remaining limb slams down onto Dr. Brynner's left arm, pinning it to the floor, while another strikes out at Cmdr. Morgan, shattering her armor and digging its stability anchors into her torso. It swings her around, slamming her onto the ground beside the doctor. Manipulatory limbs seize their heads, forcing them to face one another as the arc welder moves into position over Cmdr. Morgan's face.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> I will allow you two options, Doctor. Rise to become that which your species is destined to be. Bend all to your will through the obliteration of all else. Accept that the horror you have seen today is the universal truth of your being, and stand at last an example of your kind's destiny. Guide the torch to the Commander's throat. Take her head, reduce it to ash, and you will be released. Free to shape the world as you see fit. Free to remove the control rod, if that is indeed what you still wish.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Jack, it's okay, you'll be okay!</p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Should you spurn this chance to embrace what lies within you, that which your father knew to be true, there will be no further use for you. You shall witness the death of your false world and the birth of the true, alone. Heed me now, Doctor. The purpose of humanity need not be inflicted upon you, nor need it be inflicted quickly. You will both live a time, to witness what wretched forms you are reduced to before the end, if an end it is to be.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> Do it, Jack! It's the only way!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> No! I won't lose you!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> If you don't, everyone is going to die, Jack. Look at me. I love you. I love you with everything I have. I'm dead either way. I'd rather it was you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> You can't ask me to do this, Eliza!</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> But I am. Please, Jack. Please. Save the world. We'll meet again after.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner sobs, moving his free hand to hold Cmdr. Morgans.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> I love you more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Cmdr. Morgan:</strong> I love you, Jack. You're saving me. You're saving everyone.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner slams his fist on the floor, closing his eyes and screaming. He thrashes about, looking at Cmdr. Morgan, and reaching for the arc welder with his free hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Brynner:</strong> You are my world, Eliza.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Brynner yanks hard on the arc welder, hauling it towards his trapped arm and pressing it to his bicep. His sleeve ignites immediately, and Cmdr. Morgan yells in protest. The HEM construct rapidly pulls the welder away from Dr. Brynner's arm, just as he wrenches free of the last scraps of flesh connecting it to his torso. The welder swings wildly, slamming against Dr. Brynner's face in a shower of blood as his eye socket and jaw give way to the force of the swing. He pushes with his remaining arm, leaping to his feet and diving for the control rod. The HEM unit lashes out with the apendage pinning Cmdr. Morgan, catching him below the right knee as he rips the control rod from its housing, falling to the ground and screaming in pain.</em></p>
<p><em>Cmdr. Morgan gasps as the pressure is removed from her chest, scrambling to Dr. Brynner's side. She hauls him away from the AIC core unit towards a workstation as the HEM construct collapses onto the floor. Dr. Brynner screams and clutches his face, then the stump of his arm, staring at Cmdr. Morgan with his remaining eye. She sprints to the first aid station, ripping it from the wall and returning to Brynner, to administer first aid.</em></p>
<p><em>Massive arcs of electricity surge through the AIC servers and components, with the AIC core unit bursting into flames as embedded thermite charges melt its framework. The HEM constructs lights flicker back to their standard red colouration as it freezes in place. MARLON.aic's voice emerges as a binaric scream, distorting and fading. As its central oculus shatters, its voice drops to a whisper before cutting out entirely.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARLON.aic:</strong> Even now, you are a disappointment to me, Doctor.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
</div>
<p>Following these events, SCP-9400 ceased operation entirely, remaining suspended in the air for the following 40 hours before slowly returning to its previous location. Due to intense inter-GOI scrutiny, the recontainment of SCP-9400 was carried out as a joint effort, requiring months of work and billions of dollars to repair and upgrade Site-537 to a suitable degree. The vast majority of Site-537's staff was lost in the incident, with only twelve individuals, including Dr. Jack Brynner and Commander Eliza Morgan, surviving to provide statements. No Chaos Insurgency operatives or former Valravn mercenaries were found to have survived; however, the HEM construct was recorded interacting with POI-CI/Valravn #4's corpse prior to engaging Cmdr. Morgan and Dr. Brynner within SCP-9400's containment chamber. A large data packet was uploaded into the corpse's implants, causing it to rise and exit the site on foot despite lacking a pulse or brain function. Efforts to recover the remains of those lost in the incident are ongoing.</p>
<p>The destruction of Belfast and surrounding population centres required extensive humanitarian effort to address, with the Manna Charitable Foundation investing significantly in providing medical treatment and housing to the few survivors. The Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition cooperated to fabricate a meteorite impact in the area, with the Foundation expected to provide damages to the families of those killed by SCP-9400. While policies held with Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. were able to somewhat mitigate these costs, O5 command authorised the use of SCP objects and anomalous items to aid in reconstruction and quarantine efforts.</p>
<p>An estimated 1.2 million - 1.6 million civilian casualties were incurred during the incident, and hundreds of square kilometres have been rendered uninhabitable by the weapons effects. These areas have been placed under quarantine in order to prevent further loss of life, and it is highly unlikely that these regions will ever return to a remotely habitable state. The Earth's crust in these regions was severely damaged, being reduced from an average thickness of 30km to a new average of between 2 and 4km. This has led to a significant increase in volcanic activity and geological instability in the region, posing a substantial risk of further degradation. Efforts to mitigate this issue are ongoing.</p>
<p>With the reconstruction of the site, a new Foundation AIC was required to be installed to maintain SCP-9400's safe operation. Red.aic has proven a stable and effective candidate, with numerous failsafes and limited independence to avoid a repeat incident. It is overseen remotely by an AIC Management team, led by Dr. Jack Brynner, in collaboration with head of Site Security Colonel Eliza Morgan, who returned to active duty together after a lengthy recovery process and prosthethis fittings. Both Col. Morgan and Dr. Brynner were awarded medals for bravery and exemplary service in the face of great adversity, and have provided valuable input into the redesign of Site-537. They declined amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>Although initially believed to have been eradicated completely, the Chaos Insurgency cell "Colima" has resumed operation. Reports and surveillance imagery of a "Giant with cybernetic green eyes" leading a band of mercenaries in Eritrea and Ethiopia match POI-CI/Valravn #4, Who has adopted the alias Marlon. The cell remains nomadic, being implicated in multiple atrocities and conducting numerous operations for a variety of third-world governments and anomalous organisations. They have developed a tendency to deploy rogue AIC's as a means of terrorism, and are considered a high priority target by the Foundation. They have proven adept at evading and neutralising Foundation forces, and are believed to have intimate knowledge of Foundation Mobile Task Force tactics.</p>
