<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9998 was a studio audience sitcom titled <em>A Prince Among Men</em>, broadcast on American television network NBC between 1994 and 1999 for five seasons. The series was created by David Harper, who served as the Executive Producer and Head Writer throughout its run, and was produced by NBC Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television Studios. The series revolved around Cornelius "Nell" Prince, a teenager from a wealthy, upper-class background who, as punishment for his comedic antics, is sent by his father to live with working class relatives in the Lower East Side, New York City. SCP-9998's anomalous attributes are detailed following an overview of its plot and production.<br/>

<p><strong>Interview Subject 042:</strong> Gary Warrington<br/>
<strong>Role:</strong> Executive President of Scripted Content</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what people said about the show to begin with, that it was derivative, they'd seen it before, yada yada. We caught some heat in those early days from folks saying it was Fresh Prince but safe for your conservative white audience. The scheduling didn't help that one. Now if we're talking about the studio perspective… maybe they ain't 100% wrong.</p>
<p>But not Davey,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> he always believed in what he was making. He acknowledged the similarities, sure, but he wanted to make something different. I asked him once where the idea came from — there wasn't anything like the show in Davey's background: average wealth, nice family, suburbs. You know the drill. He just shrugged and said he'd always had these characters in his mind, ever since he was a kid.</p>
<p>I told the cast this one day, and they start telling me about how Davey told them a completely different story at the wrap party for season two. He's put away about three bottles of wine, and supposedly starts talking about how he found the outline to the series on the metro one day. The cast's smart okay, they're not going to tell the world their golden goose is potentially plagiarised, but they can trust me, they know I won't blab. It's my golden goose too!</p>
<p>I get back to the studio after finding this out and I tell Shaina.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> She starts laughing, says "like shit he did", claims that Davey got all emotional with her over a lunch once. Started talking about how the whole show is based on a play he studied in a lit' class at college: a rich lord sends his son to live among the peasants to learn how to rule. That it's where the whole "five lessons" came from.</p>
<p>So where the idea for the show actually originated? How's this for an answer: who the fuck knows.</p>
<p>Ask Davey yourself. You'll get a completely new answer.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Plot &amp; Production:</strong> In October 1992, Harper pitched the concept of the series to Gary Warrington, Executive President for NBC's scripted content. Harper and Warrington were acquainted from their time studying at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. With Warrington's support, the concept was bought by NBC Studios as a premise pilot. After a positive reception from test audiences, a full season was commissioned.</p>
<p>The pilot opens with Nell Prince arriving at the home of Joseph Broker, Joseph's wife Jackie, and their two children, Allie and Anthony, who are both younger than Nell. Joseph and Jackie are introduced as distant relatives of Nell's; the ambiguity of the exact nature of their relationship is a running gag throughout the series. Nell has recently embarrassed his father, a wealthy business magnate, by performing a prank whilst his father hosted business associates at their estate for dinner. As punishment for this, Nell's father arranges for his son to stay with the Brokers for the foreseeable future. Much of the humour in the first season derives from the juxtaposition of Nell's former and current circumstances. For example, having to share a bedroom with Anthony and contribute to household chores.</p>
<p>The series was shot primarily at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. A permanent set was constructed for the Broker family house at Stage Five, where all scenes filmed were shot in front of a live studio audience. The set was maintained for the duration of the series, until its destruction in the SCP-9998 Incident.</p>
<p>The first season was scheduled on Monday nights in the slot preceding <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>, leading both programs to be advertised together as "The Prince Hour". After ratings were significantly better than expected for the first two seasons, primarily due to positive word of mouth, the final three were broadcast in a coveted 7:30—8:00pm slot on Thursday nights, prior to <em>Friends</em>.</p>
<p>Despite healthy ratings, the fifth season of SCP-9998 was announced as the final prior to its airing. This was at the insistence of Harper, which brought him into conflict with studio executives at NBC.</p>
<p>All five seasons were predominantly episodic, but, according to production crew, episodes within individual seasons were intended to be thematically linked.<br/>

<strong>Role:</strong> SCP-9998 Writer, Executive Story Producer</p>
<p>So, whenever we'd get together to start plotting a season, you could count on David to rock up to the writers' room with two things: pizza and a lesson.</p>
<p>Like… he had this goal that the show would be greater than the sum of its parts. Y'know? Each season would be a lesson for Nell. Five lessons to learn for him to reunite with Dad.</p>
<p>Take the second season: we learn that Nell is adopted: that his Dad isn't his real Dad. Not only that, but we learn Dad can't have kids of his own, and adopted Nell to have an heir to leave the empire to. Nell helps Jennifer<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> come to terms with her pregnancy and take care of the baby, and there's a load of B-plot around the Broker parents and their kids, and Nell helping strengthen their relationship. That season's lesson was legacy. You following me? Nell learns why his Dad has such high expectations of him.</p>
<p>So season one is all about learning your place in the world, what else is out there. Nell's being exposed to things he'd never seen from his penthouse. Two is the importance of legacy, where you come from. Three was on growth through pain, you have the whole arc with Nell's bully, the episode with Joseph's surgery. Four was the importance of culture, Nell teaches the Broker kids about music, he sets up the theatre club at school, they put on that renaissance play. That last theme's the weakest in my opinion, it just cast Nell as seeing himself as superior. I tried to push back on that, but no success.</p>
<p>We start writing our current season, the all important <em>final</em> one. You should have heard the arguments Dave had with the big dogs about the fact he wanted it to stop. I think all of Cali' heard, the screams were so loud.</p>
<p>Dave rocks up to the room: pizza, but no lesson. It's a secret, he says. That we'll have to wait to the finale he — and he alone — is writing to find out.</p>

<strong>Anomalous Properties:</strong> Following the airing of the series finale, all references to the actors who played the primary cast (Nell Prince and the Broker family) have been anomalously modified. Any mention of the actors by name has been modified to be the name of the character they played on SCP-9998. Any information regarding them which is unrelated to SCP-9998, such as personal details, federal documents, and prior acting credits, has ceased to exist. It is currently believed that, prior to the SCP-9998 Incident, none of the cast were involved in anomalous activity.
<p>Throughout the production and airing of Season Five, several anomalous events occurred in relation to SCP-9998 (See Addendum 001). These events culminated in the SCP-9998 Incident (See Addendum 002).<br/>

<p><strong>Interview Subject 022:</strong> Lucille Keaton<br/>
<strong>Role:</strong> SCP-9998 Casting Director</p>
<p>A new show is my dream. Far more exciting than a new cast member joining something long running, and a new show about a family? It's just perfect. Thinking about how these people will interact, what their dynamics are. Does the daughter look more like the mom or the dad, why did the parents choose each other, what's their chemistry? The dream. I love my job.</p>
<p>For <em>Prince Among Men</em>, Nell was obviously the role we just had to get right. We wanted someone unknown, someone the audience wouldn't have seen before. David Harper told me how he was sent to live in the skids because of a prank gone wrong. This kid keeps making jokes and playing around, then one day his Dad decides he needs to grow up. And that was all I needed: boyish, charming and mischievous, but he was also a bit of a snob, right? The dynamic with the family doesn't work otherwise.</p>
<p>We got headshots in, narrowed down from there. I saw forty, maybe fifty, guys for the role? Then did callbacks for ten where Gary and David joined.</p>
<p>I knew who was getting the role before callbacks though. From the moment Nell walked in through the door, he had a star quality to him. I knew Nell would make a great Nell Prince,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and I knew Gary and David would agree.

<span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>SCP-9998 SEASON FIVE</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>The fifth and final season of SCP-9998 was comprised of 24 episodes and aired between September 1998 and May 1999. Following information received from several sources, the Foundation became aware of several incidents with potential anomalous influence occurring during the production of SCP-9998. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>During filming, cast members repeatedly begin to deviate from their scripts. These deviations are often at odds with the tone of both the scene and the overall show. The below transcript is taken from the filming of season five episode fourteen, <em>Nell Wins Big</em>, in which Joseph and Jackie discuss the news that Nell's father will come to visit with the intent of taking custody:</li>
</ul>
<div class="interview">
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong> I can't believe our Nell will be leaving us soon. He said his Dad might take him to Gesualdo to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Gesualdo? That the pizzeria that's just opened up 'round the corner?</p>
<p><em>[Audience laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong> No Joe! Would it kill ya to have a bit of culture? It's in… Italy!</p>
<p><em>[Jackie flourishes as she says the country, putting both hands over her heart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> …Little Italy?</p>
<p><em>[Audience laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong> Joe! Italy, Europe!</p>
<p><em>[Jackie playfully smacks Joseph across the head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Our Prince will travel to lands far further than Europe. And I cannot help but wonder if we have truly prepared him for what is to come, for the pitch black celestial seas he must traverse. Has his time wallowing with our squalor taught him what his father sought him learn? In truth, I wish to keep him with us. He is truly more impressive than either of my seed. Yet, those who fight destiny are just as bound to it as those that embrace it. I am scared, Jacqueline. Scared for what is to come for us. For him. For us all.</p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> Okay, cut! Joe, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Sorry, I— I wanted to try something new.</p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> Well don't. Let's take it from the top. Places.</p>
<p><strong>Jackie:</strong> Hey, give me a heads up in the future if you're planning to improv?</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>During the filming of episode 16, <em>Nell Learns the Ropes</em>, a pregnant member of the studio audience in her third trimester miscarries. There were no previously noted issues regarding the pregnancy</li>
<li>Alejandro González, chief lighting technician for all five seasons of SCP-9998, vanishes whilst working overtime alone at Stage Five. His whereabouts are still unaccounted for</li>
<li>On twelve separate instances of filming, members of the live audience are escorted off the premises after they are unable to cease laughing at SCP-9998. Once removed from NBC Studios, they are able to regain composure</li>
<li>The actor playing Nell Prince, who had previously maintained a meticulously clean-cut public image, makes controversial statements in an interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> to promote SCP-9998. In response to a mention of a recent homophobic murder, Prince questions the validity of homosexual relationships as they are unable to result in biological children. The comments are buried by Prince's agents and the interview prints without them</li>
<li>Rumours begin to circulate regarding the wellbeing of David Harper. By numerous accounts, Harper becomes quick to anger with both cast and crew, and takes almost exclusive ownership of drafting episode scripts, at one point requesting that site security bar all other writers from the studio. His physical health is subject to speculation. Eyewitnesses report his abdomen as severely distended, whilst others report sighting raw, inflamed tumours protruding from underneath Harper's clothing.</li>

<strong>Role:</strong> SCP-9998 Writer, Executive Story Producer</p>
<p>I'd been working on the show since day one; I thought Dave and I had a pretty good relationship. Thought. I won't be attending the filming of the finale. It's very much the Dave show: he's written it, he's going to direct it. I've not even seen the script, it's only gone to the cast.</p>
<p>Dave's scripts and story outlines had taken an increasingly conservative tone as the show progressed and — look — I'm not best friends with Gloria Allred, but with everything that happened with Clinton, I just thought it was important that young girls watching the show knew that there was more to being a woman than just sex. That they could be seen as more than that.</p>
<p>There's a scene Dave wrote where Jackie tells Allie the most important role she'll ever have in life is as a wife and mother. Y'know, you've probably seen it: episode three of this season. I asked him if we could loosen the language a bit, showcase that there's more than just one role model a girl can aspire to.</p>
<p>And he blew up. I don't know if it was the stress of writing the final season. Maybe the coke.</p>
<p>Probably the coke.</p>
<p>But he just screamed in my face.</p>
<p><tt><strong>Q: Do you remember what he said to you?</strong></tt></p>
<p>I'm not gonna forget. He said, if I was so concerned about female role models on the show, he could get Joseph to chop Jackie's limbs off so she could be, and I quote, an "immobile brood mother". He then told me to fuck off out his office.</p>
<p>That was… yeah. That was uncomfortable.</p>
