<p>SCP-4608 prior to final containment protocols.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Archived Preliminary Containment Procedures:</strong> The area surrounding SCP-4608 is to be quarantined using the cover story of a toxic chemical spill. Following neutralization, the plot of land should be rendered incapable of supporting flora via the application of specialized herbicide PQ4608.</p>
<p>Due to the circumstance of SCP-4608's recovery, no further containment procedures were developed.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4608 was a 60-acre apple orchard containing over 22,000 trees, located on the outskirts of Milan, Indiana. Engraved on approximately 75% of trees within SCP-4608 were thaumaturgic sigils and symbols relating to occult <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4677">Norse religions.</a></p>
<p>Records indicate SCP-4608 was sown in 1826 by John Chapman,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> who maintained it until his death in 1845. John Chapman's obituary indicated he was the sole priest of the Allen County Church of Iðunn,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> though no records of a chapel or congregation exist.</p>

</div>
<p>Due to the circumstance of their discovery, little is known about SCP-4608-1 and SCP-4608-2. All information has been gathered from the first-hand accounts of MSF Agents and the response transcripts.</p>
<p>SCP-4608-1 were organisms consisting of unidentified plant-like muscular structures and a periderm resembling those found on common hardwoods. Instances ranged in height from 5 cm to 3 m and were capable of locomotion. Instances of SCP-4608-1 were highly aggressive, displaying territorial and predatory behavior.</p>
<p>SCP-4608-2 was a large apple tree with 13 human faces imbedded in its periderm. These faces were capable of speech, though the language used is currently unidentified. SCP-4608-2 was found at the center of SCP-4608 and was hostile, using its roots as a means of manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> A local logging company had purchased the land on which SCP-4608 was located. During the first logging expedition within SCP-4608, a member of the crew died as a result of a safety equipment malfunction. Shortly after, all remaining crew members were declared dead or missing; the search party was also presumed missing. On October 14, 1947, the Foundation was alerted to the occurrences surrounding SCP-4608 by police reports accompanied by a photograph of an SCP-4608-1 instance. A week later Site-81 sent a three-man investigation team. All three agents were presumed dead after four days without contact.</p>
<p>Following the loss of communication with the investigation team, Site-81 dispatched a high-risk response team, Mobile Strike Force Bravo-7 ("Hometown Heroes"), to handle the situation.</p>

<p><em>[Camera pans to a small clearing of recently cut trees.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Alright. BETA Squad, you're heading east. GAMMA Squad, you're going west. Radio me in 30 minutes if you haven't found anything.</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Got it, Cap. Switching channels.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA-1:</strong> Roger that. Move out boys, you heard the man. Switching-</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> ALPHA Squad on me. We're scoping out the incident site— then we're movin' south.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> The equipment is set up just over there. Probably a good place to start, Cap.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Well, no point in wasting time. Let's get this shit over with.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Let's. This place gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA Squad begins approaching the logging equipment; several bodies can be seen.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-5:</strong> Christ, they didn't even clean this shit up.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> Cap, come take a look at this.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA-1 approaches ALPHA-4, who is crouched in front of mutilated human remains. The chest cavity has been ripped open and filled with apples.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> What the fuck would do—</p>
<p><em>[A loud shriek can be heard over all radios. The camera pans to the tree line.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Roll call, squad leads.</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Wasn't near us, Cap, but we heard it too.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA-1:</strong> Came from the south-west. En route now. We are definitely not alone out here.</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Agreed. It's shy, whatever it is. Caught a glimpse, though; it's…fast.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Check back in 15.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA-1 begins walking away from the logging equipment towards the tree line.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> We're not doing shit just standing around these stiffs. Let's move.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> I don't know, guys. I got a bad feeling about this one.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> That's what you said in Ontario too, Sev.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA-4 and ALPHA-5 both laugh.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-5:</strong> Cut him some slack— that was a <em>big</em> fuckin' turtle.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Listen, that was-</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Cut the chatter.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA Squad enters the tree line.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-5:</strong> Look at this tree.</p>
<p><em>[Camera pans to an apple tree. A sigil is etched into the periderm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Shit if I know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Got some over here too, Cap.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> Looks like it's all over the place.</p>
<p><em>[Another loud shriek is heard. Several seconds later, multiple shrieks are heard in the opposite direction.]</em></p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Cap, that second one came from this direction.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Regis, be prepared for anything. The bodies we found… let's just say you don't want to be on the wrong end of this one.</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Got it, Cap. We found some sort of path, going to follow it. Stay safe.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Heads on swivel, boys.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA Squad walks south for 10.5 minutes. Extraneous dialogue removed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-4:</strong> Movement, 2 o-clock— 3— 5. Fuck, it's fast.</p>
<p><em>[Camera pans to ALPHA-4. A blur of motion can be seen behind him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Form up!</p>
<p><em>[Several gunshots can be heard over the radio; the loud shriek can be heard before several lower shrieks from all directions.]</em></p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> We've got a man down, Cap. These fuckers don't die right.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Confirmed kill?</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> Negative. Bullets didn't do a god damn thing. Keep a close eye <em>[Gunshots can be heard over the radio.]</em> Keep your <em>[Gunshots]</em> fucking trees. They look like fucking plants.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Fuck. Where's Fives?</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Fives! Fives! Square, you got eyes on Fives? Square? Jesu-</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Shit. Cap, I got Fives over here.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> Fives, why the fuck didn-</p>
<p><em>[Camera faces ALPHA-7. Behind him, ALPHA-5 is seen bisected and hanging by his intestines from the trees.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-1:</strong> We need to move now.</p>
<p><em>[ALPHA Squad begins moving west at a fast pace. A loud shriek is heard followed by another shriek directly behind ALPHA Squad.]</em></p>
<p><strong>ALPHA-7:</strong> Cap, watch out!</p>

<p><strong>BETA-9:</strong> Sorry; you got it.</p>
<p><em>[BETA-1 begins rummaging through various scrolls and books on the shelves before pushing all of them to the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> God damn, there's nothing but chicken-scratch bullshit. I can't read any of this.</p>

<p><strong>BETA-9:</strong> He's up, Regis. You better come look at this wound, though.</p>
<p><em>[BETA-1 walks over and focuses his light on BETA-6's leg wound. The area around the wound is showing advanced necrosis. Several apple seeds can be seen embedded in and around the wound.]</em></p>
<p><strong>BETA-6:</strong> What do you mean— Oh god!</p>
<p><strong>BETA-1:</strong> <em>[Hands BETA-9 a small medical kit]</em> Dig those fucking things out and clean it up. We have to move.</p>
<p><strong>BETA-9:</strong> Gotcha. Sixes, this shit's gonna hurt.</p>
<p><em>[BETA-1 walks back to the other side of the chapel. Sixes' muffled grunts can be heard in the background. The call and response shrieks are occurring more frequently.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> On October 16, 1947 ALPHA-7 was recovered by the Allen County Fire Department, unconscious and suffering from exhaustion and smoke inhalation. The Site-81 Concealment Team took control of the situation and quarantined the area using the cover story of a toxic chemical hazard.<br/>
Following debriefing and a psychological evaluation, ALPHA-7 was administered amnestics and switched to low-risk recovery assignment. The members of MSF Bravo-7 were posthumously awarded the Foundation Star for their efforts during the neutralization of SCP-4608.</p>
