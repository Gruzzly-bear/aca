<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Darrell County is under the direct purview of Site-115. All settlements within ten miles of SCP-7415's outermost perimeter of effect must be evacuated by 2030, using pro-urban life propaganda, economic decay for the surrounding area, and the creation of a false crisis to raise the urgency to move.</p>
<p>The perimeter of SCP-7415 must be surrounded by Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA), spaced twenty feet from one another. Outpost-7415 is responsible for monitoring SCP-7415 and SCP-7415-LAUREN. No further action is required.</p>
<p>SCP-7415-STEPHEN is on the Foundation Watchlist. Interviews with SCP-7415-STEPHEN are to be conducted annually to assess their mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7415 is a reality-altering area centered around Darrell High School and surrounding Darrell, Texas. SCP-7415 qualifies as a Class-B episodic time loop, where subjects within SCP-7415 are disconnected from their continuity, constantly reverting to their initial physical state when a change occurs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-7415's episodic loop is centered around the period of time from June 1975 to May 1976. Residents of SCP-7415 are unaware of this phenomenon, assuming SCP-7415 is a component of baseline reality.</p>
<p>When a subject enters SCP-7415, they will experience a cognitohazardous effect that will mentally regress them to their late teens. Subjects that have gone through secondary school will integrate themselves into SCP-7415, reporting feelings of nostalgia and regret. These effects dissipate once the subject is removed from SCP-7415.</p>
<p>SCP-7415 is maintained through two Type-Green reality-benders, designated as SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. All reality-benders are seniors at Darrell High School and seem to be aware of their influence on SCP-7415.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7415 was discovered in 1998 when the U.S. Department of Education noticed records from Darrell High School indicating that no changes in the student population had occurred since the 1975-1976 school year. After multiple attempts to contact the school failed, a representative was sent to Darrell, Texas. Foundation forces intervened after the representative had been missing for two months.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7415.1:</strong> Observation Logs</p>
<p>Upon Foundation intervention, Outpost-7415 was constructed to monitor SCP-7415 on the outskirts of Darrell, Texas. Video surveillance footage of Darrell High School was rerouted to Outpost-7415 for observation. Notable excerpts have been logged below:</p>

<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> Aww, thank you! Honestly, I didn't even try today! I was too busy re-reading my catalog.</p>

<p><em>(Sounds of birds chirping.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> We always seem to find ourselves back here. It's been a great year, a great season, and a great time.</p>
<p>There's something haunting about sitting in these chairs, knowing that another year is behind us. But it's also beautiful.</p>
<p>It's beautiful that we get to try again. For those of you, that failed your classes, your friendships, and your relationships, you get another chance. For those of you who've had a fantastic year, you get to live through it all over again! Over and over, making new memories and cherishing our old ones.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7415-LAUREN pauses. Students seem visibly bored and uninterested.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> When I was younger, and I mean <em>really</em> young, I'd listen to the record player. I mean, I still do, but not nearly as much as I used to. I'd listen to the same songs repeatedly. For hours at a time, I was singing the same melody, and I never tired of it. Now, in my first senior year, I was listening to one vinyl, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63nfV47oDhU" target="_blank">"Remember the Rain."</a></p>
<p><em>(SCP-7415-LAUREN appears to be lost in thought. After about five seconds, she speaks.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> When I listened to it, I was overwhelmed. I realized how lucky I am to be in the position I'm in now. I have a loving boyfriend, amazing friends, and wonderful parents, and in a couple of months, I would be leaving all that behind. Y'all showed me kindness when I thought no one else could.</p>
<p>I'm- We are surrounded by the most wonderful people we may ever meet. They've stuck with us through all these years. There is no one that knows us better than the people in this room, no one else that would accept us.</p>
<p><em>(An unidentifiable melody begins playing over the P.A. system. There is significant auditory distortion.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I'm so glad I get to spend this time with you.</p>

<p><strong>PERSONNEL BRIEFING</strong></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 4th, 1999<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Sr. Researcher Stacy Steele<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Agent Miranda Martinez</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>«BEGIN LOG»</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> Alright, I've read through the briefings, but I wanted to hear what you had to say.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Am I the one going?</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> You are. Your CRV is pretty high, you hated school, I just want to hear the specifics. Whenever you're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Well, my mom worked in the military and was moving around. My dad and I followed her around until around the middle of my freshman year. I'd already been hit with the pain of making and losing friends in elementary and middle school, so I didn't really make friends when I arrived.</p>
<p>There wasn't really one notable event, it was just a lot of constant little things that added up. The food, the teachers, the people. It was just annoying, all of it. Add that to the fact that my mom wasn't present for most of it, and it becomes my own personal hellhole.</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> Sorry to hear that. Was there anyone in particular that was close to you? Anyone you might <em>remember?</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Yeah, there was this one girl, Selena. She was the only person I could tolerate. She was in most of my classes, the only one that tried to talk to me when I moved in. The other kids ragged on her a lot through the years, made her the "weird kid."</p>
<p>One time they started hiding her things. Anytime she was gone, they'd take her pens, her water bottle, she had this necklace she loved, last gift from her mother, and they hid it. When she couldn't find them, she just went to the bathroom and cried. That's when I knew that they were irredeemable.</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> That's awful.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> It's not even that, it's that these kids were the "popular" ones. They weren't popular, they were just flashy and we knew their names! When I found out what happened, I went and gave them flat tires. All of them. Fuckers deserved it. Worst years of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> What happened to her after you graduated? Do you keep in touch?</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> No, we got into a fight near the end of it and didn't makeup. I don't know what happened to her. I don't even remember what the fight was about. I just regret losing my only friend.</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> Okay, I think you're fit to go in. Your CRV will make up for any nostalgia you still have. Keep a sharp mind and check in with us regularly. I'll be on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Do I just go in there and do surveillance?</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> No, we have a plan.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Agent Martinez's negative experience with secondary school and high CRV (Cognitive Resistance Value) allows for a greater chance of resistance to SCP-7415's cognitohazardous effects.</p>
</div>
<p>Agent Martinez has been tasked with going into SCP-7415 and attempting to extract SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. Due to the low rate of success associated with extracting reality-benders, Martinez will also place Reality Anchors at focal points<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> of SCP-7415, diminishing its effect, and allowing for more standard containment protocols.</p>
<p>Agent Martinez has been equipped with a handheld Hume reader and a portable Scranton Reality Anchor.<br/>

<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Did what happen again?</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> You’re just here to talk right? You’ve never been here before and you want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Yes, I want to talk about your future aspirations. Where do you see yourself in five years?</p>
<p><em>(Stephen stares blankly at Martinez. He then stands and begins pacing around the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> I can only do so much. If you’ve got any ideas for what to do next, I’m open to it, but otherwise, I don’t see how this’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Have you considered leaving Darrell altogether? If you’re bored, then it’s time to get out and stop this.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen:</strong> (pauses) No, I'm a good boyfriend. I’d never leave Lauren like that. Besides, as long as we have each other….</p>

<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> (ranting) Don't you remember being a senior? How much fun you had? If you had the chance, I bet you'd want to be a teenager again. Just because I have that chance doesn't mean you can take it away from me!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7415-LAUREN quickly gets up from her chair and leans over the desk, pointing at Agent Martinez.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I don't know where you people are coming from, but you need to stay in your lane. I'll tell you what I told that other guy: Don't fuck with me. I can do things you wouldn't believe.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7415-LAUREN angrily leaves the room and slams the door. The walls shake from the impact. Several seconds pass.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> (sighs) 'Course it didn't work, you can't convince benders.</p>

<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Time for Plan B.</p>

<strong>Addendum 7415.4:</strong> Exploration Logs
<p>Outpost-7415 has identified three focal points of SCP-7415. Agent Martinez is tasked with verifying these focal points and placing reality anchors to effectively contain SCP-7415. The logs have been transcribed separately, as a result of cutting extraneous footage.</p>

<p><em>(Martinez roams the hallway, refers to her handheld Hume detector, and turns left. She continues down the corridor and makes several turns.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Command, do we know how many focal points there are?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Three have been identified. Hume levels are decreasing, so tread carefully.</p>
<p><em>(As Martinez moves through the corridor, the interior progressively falls into disrepair. Light fixtures flicker before failing. Paint peels off of the walls and broken floor tiles are strewn across the floor.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The Hume detector beeps faster as she approaches a door labeled "Roof Access." As she ascends, its beeps speed up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Command, I’m approaching a focal point. Stand by.</p>
<p><em>(Martinez continues going up the staircase. After several flights, she stops for a break. The Hume detector continues to beep aggressively.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> (breathing heavily) Command, can you see where I'm at? I've got to be stories up in the sky by now.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> (distortion) You should- (static) it's getting- (static) you.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Hello? Steele? Command, do you copy?</p>
<p><em>(She checks her headgear for any physical damage and finds no issue. She pauses and continues.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> I see a light. I think this is it.</p>

Two humanoid figures, bearing resemblance to SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN lie on their back, facing the sky. The humanoids, designated as SCP-7415-Sα and SCP-7415-Lα respectively, have no facial features, with their faces being composed of rubber-like, unbroken skin.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Over the next several minutes, they glance at each other and the sky. A full moon can be seen shining through the clouds. Soft whispers can be heard from the humanoid figures. The only phrases that could be made out are, "Remember," "I love you," and "I wish.")</em></p>
<p><em>(Martinez finishes setting up the anchor and activates it. Reality begins to stabilize and the rooftop disappears, being replaced with the previous staircase. The top of the stairs leads to another corridor instead of the roof.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Yes, I hear you loud and clear. The first anchor has been dropped off, two more left to go.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Were there any issues while comms were cut?</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> The same couple from before was there, only they were faceless and didn't notice me. Nothing dangerous at present.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Nice to know you're okay. Your video feed has since been re-established.</p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> Affirmative.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> (mid-lecture) Well, it’s part of growing up. Y’know, I remember what it was like when I was your age. I remember living my senior year like it was my last. This is the last time you’ll have the freedom to do what you want without any of the major responsibilities.</p>
<p>Look around at the people in this class with you. There’s a high chance that you’ll never see these people again after you graduate. You’ll move away, you’ll get a job somewhere else, and you’ll start a new life. And you’ll look back on these days fondly because you were young.</p>
<p><em>(Martinez prepares the reality anchor in the back of the class, unnoticed by the figures.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Teacher:</strong> Enjoy it while it lasts. Enjoy it while it lasts. Enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> That's it?! That's all they were scared about? No family issues, no present danger, they're just some kids that don't want to grow up?!</p>

<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> (scoffs) You can’t tell me what to do. Nobody can. Who do they think they are, forcing everything through this because they’re babies about it?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Martinez, are you okay? We’re sending another counter meme, just in case.</p>
<p><em>(Martinez groans in frustration and shuts the receiving end of her headphones. Command is still able to hear Martinez.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Martinez:</strong> (screaming) And I put up these anchors and what? They can just continue living their fantasy because they're too scared to get out of their own selfish, fucking heads! Is that it?! Are they just going to float around in their senior year and avoid growing up, while everyone else has to suffer because of them?</p>
<p>(scoffs) I’m dragging them out of here, and I'll give them a piece of my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Lauren:</strong> (yelling) I am not letting another nosy outsider mess with this!</p>

<strong>Addendum 7415.5:</strong> Relocation</p>
<p>SCP-7415-STEPHEN has since entered Foundation custody. He has been screened for potential issues and given Class-A amnestics. SCP-7415-STEPHEN has demonstrated a lack of reality-bending abilities and has been transferred to a non-anomalous public school to finish their senior year.</p>
<p>On June 4th, 2000, a day after SCP-7415-STEPHEN's graduation, Outpost-7415 received a message from SCP-7415:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>please come back</p>
<p>it's not the same without you</p>
<p>i'm sorry</p>

<p>Following this, SCP-7415 experienced a temporary, but significant dip in Hume levels. No action was taken.</p>
