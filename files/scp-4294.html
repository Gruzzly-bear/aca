<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation Artificial Intelligence Conscript TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic is deployed to locate and replace all digital images and video footage containing SCP-4294 with Class-F visual amnestics.</p>
<p>MTF Omicron-88 ("Witch's Tit") is to track and monitor SCP-4294 in order to minimize exposure to non-Foundation personnel. Additionally, Omicron-88's responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>administering regional air traffic controllers under the guise of local military authorities in order to maintain a 5 km no-flight zone around SCP-4294.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>coordination with local emergency and disaster relief services in order to minimize civilian casualties during and following an Inquiry Event. (Defined as SCP-4294 descending to a height of below 1km.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>investigation into the identity of POI-4294-01 "Maxine".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4294 is a roughly 3 km long tendril of flesh, visually identified as an enormous ovary with free-hanging fallopian tube. SCP-4294 is capable of flight at speeds observed up to 75 km/h, typically remaining at a height of roughly 10 km.</p>
<p>SCP-4294 is perpetually surrounded by a severe snowstorm with wind speeds in excess of 130km/h. Visibility and maneuverability impact due to extreme blizzard conditions render attempts to intercept or engage with conventional aircraft and munitions currently impractical.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Gulshat Abdulov</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Alexander Grant</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dialogue has been translated from Turkmen to English for the purpose of this log. Interview was conducted following Mrs. Abdulov's extraction to Site-75 and treatment for acute hypothermia.</p>
<p><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> Good afternoon, Mrs. Abdulov. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> I'm feeling much better today. My leg doesn't feel like pins and needles are in it anymore. And look!</p>
<p><em>[Mrs. Abdulov withdraws the sheet from her lower body to reveal her legs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> The blue tinge has gone away! Thank you all so much for helping me.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> You're very welcome, ma'am. Perhaps, if you're feeling up to it, I could ask you a few questions about the blizzard that caused this.</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> I… Yes, of course. Well, it wasn't an ordinary blizzard.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> In the middle of the summer, certainly not. But we have reason to believe there's more to it than just unseasonably cold weather. Did you see anything else out of the ordinary?</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> Hmm, I don't know. I think, maybe? It is hard to know what was real. I thought I was dying of the cold. Seeing things.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> <em>[Subject begins exhibiting signs of mild distress.]</em></p>
<p>Crazy things. After the wind knocked my truck over, and the heater… well, the heater didn't work well on a good day. The cold got so painful, so fast.</p>
<p><em>[Subject clears her throat and pauses for several seconds.]</em></p>
<p>I was still so close to the Door to Hell. I tried getting out and trying to run to it. I thought it would be better to jump in to the fire than die in that hellish cold. But the ice on the door was already too thick. I wasn't strong enough.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I was trying to open the door. Handful of minutes, probably. Felt like hours. The whole time, I'm maybe… 20 meters from the crater. Even with the snow, I can still see it pretty clearly, you know, the fires.</p>
<p><em>[Subject trails off and falls silent, appearing contemplative.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> Mrs. Abdulov?</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> Sorry, I'm just not sure how to describe it… From the flames rose up a great bulb of flesh, trailing a long tendril. I didn't know what it was at first, and it just kept going, more and more of it. It must have reached up past the clouds. Hm.</p>
<p><em>[Subject pauses briefly before continuing.]</em></p>
<p>When it was all the way out of the pit, just… floating above the fire, that's when I realized what it is: a colossal ovary at top, and the long tendril the flesh linking it to the uterus. But, there is no uterus. Where the tendril ends, it looks… ragged. Like it had been hacked, or maybe ripped.</p>
<p><em>[Subject abruptly begins laughing.]</em></p>
<p>This is not yet even the strangest part. At this point, I am not even trying to open my door anymore, and I am just watching this happen through the truck's windshield. The tendril comes towards me, the ragged end, stretching over towards me like it was being pulled.</p>
<p>The tendril, it is maybe… shoulder-width on the inside. And the inside comes to face me, like it is looking right into my truck, and I can just see in the darkness inside of it, a wicked old woman's face. A witch. She asks me, "Where is my daughter? Where is Maxine?"</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> Are you familiar with anyone by that name?</p>
<p><strong>Gulshat Abdulov:</strong> Ha, no chance. I tell her— well, no, I don't tell her. Inside of the truck is cold, it hurt to breathe by then, but I shake my head 'no'. It seems this is enough for her, the tendril turns away, and lifts up, higher and higher into the sky. As she leaves, I hear her calling "Come to me, my furtive daughter. I am not cross with you."</p>
<p>After that, I don't know how long before I black out, but when I woke up, I was here.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Grant:</strong> Thank you very much, Mrs. Abdulov. You've been very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Subject administered Class-A amnestic and released from Foundation custody.</p>

<p>Anomaly subsequently concluded inquiry event. Despite conducting no further Inquiry Events, SCP-4294 will occasionally demanifest and remanifest over periods ranging up to 2 hours. As the anomaly's absence does not diminish the accompanying blizzard, tracking of SCP-4294 during these periods can continue without further modification to containment procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Eyewitness Report Transcript:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Aleksander Oliynyk</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ο-88 Bathsheba, Ο-88 Sabrina</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Mr. Oliynyk was found pinned completely below the abdomen under an overturned stone structure, displaying symptoms of severe frostbite and acute shock. Recording was taken on-site by task force Omega-88. Dialogue has been translated from Ukrainian to English for the purpose of this log.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aleksander Oliynyk:</strong> <em>[Coughing violently.]</em></p>
<p>Who's there? More Black Lodge gangsters?</p>
<p><strong>Ο-88 Bathsheba:</strong> No, we're with the military. Can you tell us what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>Aleksander Oliynyk:</strong> Witchcraft. The blizzard came so suddenly, the snow first, then the icy wind. Then from the sky came down a thick rope, twitching and fleshy. It thrashed around and screeched with a woman's voice.</p>
<p><em>[Subject's breathing becomes more rapid, and renews attempts to dislodge the pinning structure.]</em></p>
<p>Please, can't you get this off me? It… it doesn't really hurt, but I can't feel my legs.</p>
<p><strong>Ο-88 Sabrina:</strong> More soldiers and equipment are on the way. Please, while it is fresh on your mind, tell us everything you can.</p>
<p><strong>Aleksander Oliynyk:</strong> Tell them to hurry. Can't catch my breath. I… right, the woman's voice. I wasn't sure what she was saying at first, the wind was howling very loud— I thought that's what it was for a while.</p>
<p>Then I saw two of the Black Lodge mobsters were standing in the middle of the street. They were looking up at the flesh, enraptured by it. But they seemed worried, and finally I understood what the woman's voice was saying.</p>
<p><em>[Subject begins hyperventilating.]</em></p>
<p>'I know you're hiding her from me, I see her aura on you. Tell me where my daughter is! Give me back my Maxine!'</p>
<p>They said they don't know her, and oh, how mad she got. 'Liars!' She called them. 'Bastards', and 'bitches' sons', and worse. I never heard such vulgar cursing.</p>
<p>'Low-bellied deceitful villains!', 'The grave is too merciful for such slime!', I saw her words wring their bodies into little squiggles. I think they are dead. Over there, just near to the fertile isles where the culmination of all things comes to radiate back and forth forever and exalt ourselves…</p>
<p><em>[Subject's breathing becomes erratic and speech loses coherence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Due to extensive bodily crushing, no non-lethal method of extraction could be arranged. Subject humanely euthanized.</p>

I met a most remarkable man today. A supremely powerful magician, one I believe could rival even the High Karcists of old.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Before my very eyes I watched as he knelt by the shore of a frozen lake, and with a touch of his hand set the lake's surface to melt in an instant.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I was well hidden, and remained still as he left, and soon returned with a meager band of companions to fish. When I finally revealed my presence to them, he rounded on me with a circumspect glare. Despite his might, he seemed fearful and timid, but I dared not be seen by him as a threat.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I told him my brethren and I could shelter him. He was unwilling, wouldn't say much. Didn't need to. Even from several meters away, I could feel his presence, his aura pressing against me, like heavy air.<br/>
<br/>
He was running from someone, but he wouldn't tell me who. All he would tell me was his name. Vladimir. He was adamant about that.<br/>
