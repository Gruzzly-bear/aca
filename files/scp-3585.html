            <h1>SCP-3585</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3585</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each instance of SCP-3585 is stored in a separate standard item containment locker. Each locker is to be equipped with a basic motion tracking camera. If movement above two meters is detected within a thirty day period a Ventura Event will be initiated by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>All suggested testing of SCP-3585 must be approved by two Level 3 personnel. Any banned materials included in suggested testing materials will result in immediate denial. The list of banned materials is found in document 3585-291.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3585 is a set of nine, thirty-four centimeter tall, plush toys depicting slightly exaggerated representations of various animals. Animals represented by SCP-3585 consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-3585-A a fennec fox</li>
<li>SCP-3585-B an American bullfrog</li>
<li>SCP-3585-C a striped skunk</li>
<li>SCP-3585-D a white tailed deer</li>
<li>SCP-3585-E a tiger</li>
<li>SCP-3585-F a long eared Hedgehog</li>
<li>SCP-3585-G a common potoo</li>
<li>SCP-3585-H a red legged sun squirrel</li>
<li>SCP-3585-I a red legged sun squirrel</li>
</ul>
<p>Each SCP-3585 has an attached tag reading on one side as follows:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">DR.WONDERTAINMENT<sup>®</sup> MURDER MYSTERY MATES<sup>©</sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On the reverse side the tag reads as follows:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:80%;">SURFACE WASHABLE</span><br/>
<span style="font-size:80%;">ALL NEW MATERIALS</span><br/>
<span style="font-size:80%;">POLYESTER FIBERS &amp; PLASTIC PELLETS</span><br/>
<span style="font-size:80%;">MADE IN INDONESIA</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When located in the same room all instances of SCP-3585 become both fully sapient and capable of independent motion. Once in this state SCP-3585-D will approach human individuals in the room, and vocalize an offer to begin a Ventura event. The process through which SCP-3585-D makes this vocalization is currently unknown. If all human subjects refuse, all instances of SCP-3585 will return to an inactive state. If a human subject accepts, SCP-3585-D instances will ask that all humans leave the room.</p>
<p>Upon the room being evacuated by all entities except for SCP-3585 instances, the SCP-3585 instances will use all materials available in the room to construct a representation of a murder crime scene. The process by which the SCP-3585 instances manipulate the materials is currently unknown. A seemingly random SCP-3585 instance shall be used as the murder victim in question. This instance has never been documented to be SCP-3585-D. In 5% of all Ventura Events, these crime scenes have matched a documented murder case. Once the scene has been created<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> the human individuals who agreed to participate in the Ventura Event will be invited back into the room.</p>
<p>Once the room contains all individuals who agreed to participate in the Ventura Event SCP-3585-D will explain the rules of the Ventura Event.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> The individuals will then be given ten hours to decide which SCP-3585 instance is playing the part of the murderer.</p>
<p>If the proper SCP-3585 instance is guessed by the end of the ten hours SCP-3585-D will vocalize congratulations on a job well done, and give them a plastic novelty sheriff's badge. If the proper SCP-3585 instance was not chosen as the murderer all instances will deactivate without vocalization. At the end of the Ventura Event all damaged SCP-3585 instances will revert to the state they were in before activation.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a sample of past testing on Ventura Events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6/29/10</p>
<p><strong>Room:</strong> Standard testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Participants:</strong> D-31937 (Male, 27)</p>
<p><strong>Materials Provided:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Brief Overview of Resulting Ventura Event:</strong> While D-31937 was waiting outside of the testing chamber, SCP-3585 instances stood in a circle for five minutes. At the end of the five minutes SCP-3585-C fell to the ground, and the rest of the SCP-3585 instances excluding SCP-3585-D began to move around the fallen SCP-3585-C simulating panic. SCP-3585-D moved to the door to the testing chamber, and knocked against the door three times while vocalizing the words 'We're done.'</p>
<p>Upon entering the chamber D-31937 was given an explanation of the rules. He was told that he had ten hours to find out which SCP-3585 instance had killed SCP-3585-C. He was informed that everyone in the room would cooperate as long as the information being asked for didn't give them away as being a possible suspect, but all of them would have clear signs of when they were trying to deceive D-31937.</p>
<p>D-31937 started by questioning SCP-3585-D. He was told that SCP-3585-C had been walking home the night prior with SCP-3585-A, and that SCP-3585-D had no information beyond that. Upon questioning SCP-3585-A, D-31937 was given the information that SCP-3585-C had been attacked by a dark and green being while they were walking home, and passing by the river. During this conversation SCP-3585-A had its ears placed over the plastic representing its eyes, and was letting out occasional sobbing sounds. This behavior ceased at the end of questioning.</p>
<p>After examining SCP-3585-C for approximately four minutes, D-31937 noticed that SCP-3585-C was as he described it 'unusually wet'. At the thirty minute mark, D-31937 declared that he believed the murderer to be SCP-3585-B. After this declaration all SCP-3585 instances fell to the ground with no vocalization.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Test was to see what would happen if the SCP-3585 instances were not given any materials to work with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 8/24/10</p>
<p><strong>Room:</strong> Standard testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Participants:</strong> D-93482 (Female, 36)</p>
<p><strong>Materials Provided:</strong> Twenty-two wooden planks, a box of forty nails, and two hammers.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Overview of Resulting Ventura Event:</strong> SCP-3585 instances stand in a circle for five minutes. At the end of the five minutes SCP-3585-A, SCP-3585-B, and SCP-3585-G began construction of a small wooden structure similar in design to a style house. The other instances of SCP-3585 remained away from the building area, and began to vocalize sounds of heavy construction equipment.</p>
<p>The building was completed lacking a front wall, and the excess materials were put to the side of the structure. Inside of the structure SCP-3585-G had been nailed to an interior wall in a way resembling crucifixion.</p>
<p>At this point SCP-3585-D once again moved to the door, and repeated its previous behavioral patterns signifying that the Ventura Event was ready for participants. The rules were the same as the previous tests. D-93482 entered into the room, and began to examine the built structure. D-92482 seemed discouraged upon noticing the state that SCP-3585-G was currently in, and asked for the game to stop.</p>
<p>SCP-3585-G pulled itself out of the wall, and upon hitting the ground ended its activation along side all other SCP-3585 instances. The damage SCP-3585-G received due to the crucifixion was missing when it was examined after the test.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Test was to demonstrate the building capabilities of SCP-3585 instances. D-93482 was disciplined for ending the testing early without approval. First example of a Ventura Event ending before a guess was made as to which SCP-3585 instance the murderer was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/29/10</p>
<p><strong>Room:</strong> Standard testing chamber</p>
<p><strong>Participants:</strong> D-97921 (Male, 54, Previously employed as a detective.)</p>
<p><strong>Materials Provided:</strong> Paper, a clipboard, twenty wooden planks, box of nails, two golden plated watches, one ceremonial knife, a bottle of spring water, and three day old fresh bread.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Overview of Resulting Ventura Event:</strong> Upon entering the room to begin the Ventura Event D-97921 was approached by SCP-3585-D. Instead of the normal vocalization SCP-3585-D gave D-97921 the plastic novelty sheriff badge given to individuals who correctly guessed during an Ventura Event. SCP-3585-D then congratulated D-97921 on a job well done, and fell to the ground in a pattern identical to the response given upon correct guess during an Ventura Event.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Additional Notes:</strong> All tests done with personnel who previously had a background in law enforcement have ended in this manner, suggesting that nothing more can be gained from testing individuals with this type of background in conjunction with SCP-3585.</p>
