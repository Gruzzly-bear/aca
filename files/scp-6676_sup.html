<p>Site-06 Major Containment Failure Event Report and Analysis</p>
<p>[Report Assembled by Senior Researcher Aletha Clarkes]</p>
<p><strong>Background Information:</strong> On October 8th, Site-06 and surrounding infrastructure were rendered uninhabitable following the unexpected development of a previously low-risk group of anomalous entities. Despite the loss of life in the disaster, few anomalies were harmed, as Site-06’s upcoming replacement location in Germany<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> had been recently completed. Many of the low-risk anomalies contained at the site had already been moved to the new location.</p>
<p><em>[NOTICE]: As a result of these entities being recently acquired into Foundation custody at the time of the breach, a numerical designation was not yet recorded. These entities are referred to with a placeholder tag of SCP-U<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> within the remainder of the document.</em></p>
<p>SCP-U was the unofficial designation of multiple anomalous entities capable of creating and accelerating the growth of vegetable matter. All eight instances of SCP-U were composed of plant material formed to roughly resemble a humanoid shape, although were believed to be non-sapient as a result of their lack of activity following discovery<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the sapience in SCP-U has been highly disputed in the ongoing investigation of this incident, and assumptions about SCP-U’s level of self-awareness cannot be proven.</p>
<p>SCP-U were temporarily held within Site-06 for basic documentation, with instances being separated into individual humanoid containment units. Senior Researcher Aletha Clarkes was tasked with creating the file for SCP-U due to her experience with botanical anomalies<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and was doing so at the time of the breach. A timeline and analysis of events is available below, and was collected as a result of Clarkes’ testimony and limited security footage.</p>
<p><strong>3:07 AM:</strong> <em>Clarkes is seen working in an office connected directly to a hallway. Across the hallway are containment units, which are holding all instances of SCP-U in separate cells. It is important to note that Site-06’s general lack of technological or structural updates since its construction were deemed acceptable as a result of its low-risk status. This resulted in prevalent and unreported design flaws, such as the close placement of personnel offices to the containment chambers.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:12 AM:</strong> <em>SCP-U instances are seen uniformly moving to the front right of their cells, where they remain for the next three minutes. Nearby personnel, including Clarkes, do not notice this behavior.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:15 AM:</strong> <em>SCP-U instances begin to self-disassemble, and enter the ventilation passageways by extending themselves vertically.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:19 AM:</strong> <em>Personnel appear to notice a noise made within the ventilation system, but do not take additional action.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:23 AM:</strong> <em>SCP-U instances are seen collecting in the containment unit directly across from Clarkes’ station, and begin to gradually expand within the chamber so as to put pressure on the door of the unit. Over the course of five minutes, SCP-U instances have evidently entered one cell collectively by traveling through the ventilation system linking the containment chambers. The Breach Alert System used in Site-06 was not triggered due to a technological oversight when the system was calibrated.</em></p>
<p><em>Standard security protocol dictates that if interior pressure against a containment system exceeds a certain value, a breach alarm is automatically triggered through sensors within the walls of the unit. However, due to Site-06’s position as a low-risk containment facility, the settings on the control terminal were changed to account for various incidents specific to Site-06.</em></p>
<p><em>Sapient anomalies relocated into Site-06 are not restrained additionally within the containment unit in order to adhere to ethical practices. Simple movement within the cell occasionally possessed enough force to accidentally activate the alarms, as the trigger value is deliberately set low out of caution. This led to the value being raised through the head terminal, but it is evident that the individual who recalibrated the system chose too large of a value for the alarms to activate during SCP-U’s breach attempt.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:26 AM:</strong> <em>The collective pressure from SCP-U results in the door of the containment unit being blown from its hinges, and flying into Clarkes’ station along with various shrapnel and SCP-U matter<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>. At this point, breach alarms are manually triggered as a result of the impact, and Site-06 goes into lockdown.</em></p>
<p><strong>3:30 AM:</strong> <em>SCP-6676-D is identified.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Proposed SCP-6676-D Description:</strong> SCP-6676-D, a formal designation for a container. While filled with its original contents, SCP-6676-D has been accidentally cross-contaminated. I believe that the effects of this contamination can be reversed provided that the substance is removed.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>
<p><em>[Notice Provided by Doctor Kensing, 1/7/21]:</em> In the week following SCP-6676’s Decommissioning approval, SCP-6676 instances have been spotted across Pennsylvania, gathering significant media attention. While the veil is currently intact, it is unlikely that secrecy will continue, as manifestations are increasing in severity, frequency, and range. Given the nearly one thousand confirmed manifestations between 3/6/21 and 14/6/21, only the most notable are listed within this document. Manifestation instances between 14/6/21 and 17/6/21 are not collected. Due to the frequency of manifestation within that period, all available Foundation efforts were put into decommissioning, and not documentation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 7/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> Three SCP-6676 instances were seen accelerating plant growth across various roadways and intersections. By the time Foundation officials arrived, many roads had been rendered unusable, and various vehicles became trapped in the enlarged mass of vines. Rescue efforts have been attempted, but have been largely unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> <em>[Provided by Doctor Kensing:]</em> We amnesticized as many people as we possibly could, put out one of the least covert cover stories we’ve used in decades (“Toxic Chemical Spill”), closed off half of the town itself, and there’s still leaks popping up everywhere. The situation is stable, but I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up. The supply of airborne amnestics available in facilities around Pennsylvania is depleting fast.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 7/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Schenley, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> Various civilian casualties, as accelerated growth of plants result in the sudden growth of grass, impaling many individuals who were witnessing the SCP-6676 manifestation. Due to the lack of witnesses, exact details are unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> <em>[Provided by Doctor Kensing:]</em> We don’t know how many were hurt or injured, as most of the area is entirely encompassed by plant growth, but estimates place the casualties into the hundreds. While it is likely that many civilians survived the initial wounds, the density of the vegetation makes it unlikely that they were able to escape, and are thus presumed dead. In addition, the clear view of the area from the city of Pittsburgh makes containment efforts extremely difficult, and as a result, an excess of artificial fog has been deployed over the area to prevent sightings while the excess vegetation is removed.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 9/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Mount Washington, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> SCP-6676 instances promote rapid root growth in the west end of Mount Washington, causing a landslide that pushed much of the hillside into the Monongahela River. Civilian casualties are estimated to be in the thousands.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> <em>[Provided by Doctor Kensing:]</em> The manifestations are growing in both frequency and intensity, and all airborne amnestics are now expended. Foundation reinforcements from across Appalachia are pouring in to help with the aftermath of SCP-6676 manifestations. Currently, it is incredibly difficult to locate instances, as they evidently have the capability of prolonged flight, and seemingly disappear almost immediately after manifesting. Somehow, the disaster was interpreted as the collapsing of a major sinkhole, which means much less work for us. I don’t know how we’ll be able to keep up if manifestations continue.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 10/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Dripesont, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> The town of Dripesont, Pennsylvania was completely destroyed. Hundreds of SCP-6676 instances were seen surrounding the area, several hours before anomalously-grown grass erupted within an area of 19 square kilometers, rapidly impaling creatures within that area. The town’s population of roughly eight thousand people were killed instantly as a result of the denser flora growth<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> The Foundation shut off power to the whole state to stop the videos from going online, and the remnants of the town were bulldozed. I’m not even sure to what extent they’ve gone to stop information of this thing circulating, as most of the containment efforts nowadays seem to be orchestrated by the O5-Council directly. I don’t even know what they’re saying now to try and hide this.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 10/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Oakmont, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> All SCP-6676 instances were seen expelling an extremely acidic substance repeatedly along Route-28, providing a much wider channel for the Allegheny River. All buildings within the path of the acidic spray were quickly destroyed. Current civilian casualty estimates are roughly three thousand.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> They’ve set all the available Foundation web-crawlers to remove anything uploaded from anywhere remotely near Northern Appalachia. No additional comment.</p>

<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 11/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Arthur Fields, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> A surplus of water was pumped into a spot located in the middle of nowhere. Evidently, water collected from the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny rivers was transported to this location through an extensive underground root system.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Commentary:</strong> No comment.</p>

<p><strong>Manifestation Occurrence:</strong> 11/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Location:</strong> Lake Arthur, Pennsylvania</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Details:</strong> SCP-6676 collected around the area where the lake was formed. The Foundation’s calling it Lake Arthur now.</p>

<hr/>
<p>O5-Council,</p>
<p>We have recently the status of certain properties affecting Senior Researcher Aletha Clarkes, who until two hours ago, was believed to be a victim of Site-06’s destruction. For background information, Clarkes volunteered for an experimental memory protection program, which, in the event of her death, would transfer her consciousness to an electronic chip through thaumaturgical means. While we believed that this chip was destroyed due to lack of contact with it, we recently received a message from her, as well as her continuously-transmitted location near Lake Arthur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Currently alive, SCP-U status pending. I am not in control. Rescue needed. Important information on SCP-U.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that if we were able to neutralize the SCP-6676 instance currently hosting her, then we should be able to recover the chip and establish full communication. Following that, we may receive insight on the current disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Exploration Video Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/6/21</p>
<p><strong>Retrieval Teams:</strong> MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters"), MTF Theta-4 ("Gardeners"), MTF Lambda-4 ("Birdwatchers")</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Rescue of Senior Researcher Clarkes from Lake Arthur, Pennsylvania</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>11:38 PM:</strong> Log begins, Mobile Task Forces are now within view of Lake Arthur. A large collection of lights is visible by the lake’s shore as the Retrieval Team advances.</p>
<p><strong>11:39 PM:</strong> Lambda commander verifies the exact location of Senior Researcher Clarkes, before motioning to various other team members.</p>
<p><strong>11:41 PM:</strong> Four members are seen assembling a large harpoon launcher, as remaining team members move into a defensive position.</p>
<p><strong>11:47 PM:</strong> The engine of the harpoon is ignited, and the harpoon is propelled from the mount. Various stabilization rockets are deployed as the harpoon flies a distance of approximately .75 kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>11:48 PM:</strong> The harpoon winch halts, as the harpoon has evidently made contact with an entity. The winch begins to shutter as the harpoon is pulled back. Analysis of Senior Researcher Clarkes’ position shows that the harpoon had pierced the SCP-6676 instance hosting her.</p>
<p><strong>11:50 PM:</strong> A collection of lights begin to move towards the Retrieval Team, and the winch pulling the instance begins to increase its speed. Resistance against the winch begins to occur, but does not affect the machine, as it is currently bolted into the ground.</p>
<p><strong>11:51 PM:</strong> Members of the Retrieval Team begin to discharge weapons as approximately 9 SCP-6676 instances enter view. Instances possess bioluminescent eyes, and appear to be clothed in wide-brimmed hats and various long coats. SCP-6676 instances reach the Retrieval Team, and begin to engage members in melee combat after sustaining noticeable damage to gunfire. SCP-6676 instances are seen using an above average and possibly anomalous number of human arms to grapple MTF personnel. 17 personnel have been killed following catastrophic dismemberment.</p>
<p><strong>11:53 PM:</strong> Flamethrowers ignite and are aimed against airborne SCP-6676 instances, causing severe damage. Instances are shown expiring after extended contact with fire, although still remaining airborne despite evident neutralization. A total of 23 personnel have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>11:57 PM:</strong> Surviving SCP-6676 instances begin to retreat, as 7 entities have been terminated. The SCP-6676 instance hosting Clarkes is now deceased, and has been dragged to the base of the harpoon launcher by the attached winch.</p>
<p><strong>11:59 PM:</strong> Retrieval Team, after moving the pierced entity into a containment vehicle, retreat. The remaining 320 SCP-6676 instances at the shores of Lake Arthur are seen advancing towards the retreating vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>12:04 PM:</strong> Retreating vehicles exit onto Route 422, and accelerate to maximum speed.</p>
<p><strong>12:07 PM:</strong> SCP-6676 instances are not able to keep up with the vehicles, and return to the lake.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Mission Aftermath:</strong> Dispatched MTFs have successfully obtained Researcher Clarkes and the SCP-6676 instance hosting her, before delivering her to Area 179. 23 out of the 52 members in the team were killed in action.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>[Notice Provided by Doctor Kensing, 14/6/21:]</em> Following the raid on Lake Arthur and the subsequent retrieval of the chip containing Researcher Clarkes, an autopsy was conducted on the SCP-6676 instance that she was previously hosted in.

<p><strong>Physical Appearance:</strong> The recovered SCP-6676 instance is approximately two meters tall, and was wearing a large, yellow raincoat with a telescope hat.</p>
<p><strong>Composition:</strong> Instance is a physical hybrid of both plant matter and human biology, forming one entity with notable variations on both the original SCP-U and the human body hosting it.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Anatomy:</strong> Bodily systems such as the nervous system and circulatory system have evidently functioned as normal, although are replaced with vegetable equivalents.<br/>
Most human organs have remained unchanged, and evidently function as normal despite most of the human tissue having been replaced. The brain, notably, has undergone drastic modifications to its structure, and is now nearly one thousand layers of both human and plant tissue. Resembling a stack of thin, vertical sheets connected by a thick webbing, the brain is now evidently another organ entirely. Senior Researcher Aletha Clarkes was located within the rightmost webbing.</p>
<p><strong>External Anatomy:</strong> Severed limbs have regrown into new structures, and the eyes of SCP-6676 instances now possess bioluminescence. The upper limbs resemble human arms, although there are fifteen of these appendages attached to each shoulder<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>. Each hand contains varying numbers of fingers, with five on one hand as the least, and twenty-two on another as the most. Lower limbs resemble root systems, and are capable of anomalously producing a highly corrosive, acidic substance with a pH of -12<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>. No such organ to produce or contain acid of any kind has been found, although analysis suggests that the lower limbs were configured in order to form a now-defunct kinetoglyph<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> that was evidently capable of producing such a substance. Extensive scarring on the root tissue suggests that the kinetoglyph is directly harmful to the entity, explaining why it was performed only once.</p>
<p><em>Following a request from various members of the O5-Council, the neutralized SCP-6676 instance is now in cold storage at Site-02. A justification has been provided by an anonymous council member, which states, “Epitaph and Hunting Trophy Required.”</em></p>

<p><em>[Notice Provided by Doctor Kensing, 15/6/21:]</em> Following Senior Researcher Clarkes’ recovery and subsequent removal from an SCP-6676 instance, she was uploaded into the Site-98 Database. She then proceeded to share her personal log with Foundation staff, as she had kept extensive records of SCP-6676’s activity while inhabiting an instance; below, notable logs correlated to SCP-6676 are listed, and full logs have been redacted due to extensive personal information within them.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 3/6/21</p>
<p>Today I woke up, following my apparent death. I believe that a recently-contained anomaly came into my office following a containment breach, and I bled out on the roof. Additionally, I appear to be in the body of something else, and I can only hear things. Judging by the rushing of wind, and the situation of my death, I must have been consumed by some sort of flying entity.</p>
<p>The computer hosting me evidently requires body heat as a source of power, and I don’t seem to have anywhere close to a full charge as of right now. The entity I’m within doesn’t seem to be generating much, so I will have to be careful regarding my energy consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 4/6/21</p>
<p>I’ve been feeling and seeing things in my sleep, and I know they are not from me. I saw a vision of a farmhouse, and the sound of grass in a hot breeze. Inside, something that wasn’t human sat at a plastic dinner table, and enjoyed a feast of foods I did not recognize. The sun set, then rose, then set and rose six times. When daytime came, the creature was a skeleton and the house, the grass, and the world around where things used to be were sand. Long trails of smoke were in the sky, and the dream ended.</p>
<p>I believe that I know how to enter sleep mode, but I will attempt to do so in order to preserve my battery.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 5/6/21</p>
<p>Today I spent most of my battery life trying to remember most of the missing memories surrounding my death, and no surprise, I had another vision. I felt unbearable coldness, which was strange since the only sense I perceive while in the chip is hearing. At this point, it is evident that I am under an anomalous effect, as experiencing temperature would normally be impossible. Continuing the dream were six seeds, planted in rocky and desolate soil. Each day passed, and a seed died in the sun. On the seventh day, all the seeds were shriveled, but were revived when drenched with blood. They sprouted, leaving behind the withered growth and instead developed the unfertile dirt.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6/6/21</p>
<p>I had another dream.</p>
<p>I saw a battlefield, where humans devoid of limbs were swallowed up by the roots of the saplings. The plants grew, and the world was consumed by green. A throne made of rubble was in a foggy field, and in it sat a king with horrible eyes and a coat quite literally made of arms. Six times did he call for servants, and on the seventh cry, more entities with the same eyes rose from rubble that now surrounded the throne. I wasn’t supposed to be in their world, and I was hunted down. Despite the entities moving through my own backyard, they could not touch me. They collapsed one by one, and eventually, only one remained, and the dream ended.</p>

<p>Another vision occured, but I heard something while I was awake. I heard people talking, playing, and laughing while birds chirped; and it stopped. The wind was still audible, but the birds and the people could not be heard. I fear that what anomaly is causing these dreams to occur has begun to make my chip malfunction, but there is nothing I am currently able to do about it. I am unaware of how to reach the Foundation, and as far as I currently know, they are unable to contact me.</p>
<p>The dream was almost the same as last night’s, but the entities were inside my house. I hid for “hours” in the attic, until they found me and dragged me from the home.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 8/6/21</p>
<p>My battery life is extremely low, for reasons I do not entirely understand. Last night’s dream was realistic enough that I could not tell whether it was a real experience or not. I saw a being of <em>things</em> inside my home. It had no form, but it wasn’t an absence of space, or a silhouette. It was a <em>presence</em>, and every single aspect of its non-being was made from things. It had a shadow of objects projected in front of its form, which was nothing. It was a shadow, but a touchable shadow to something that was and wasn’t there.</p>

<p>There was more screaming, crashing, and noise than I’ve ever heard in my life; I heard it all. There were never any audio errors, whatever entity I’m in is committing atrocities. I am going to spend the energy I have remaining, as well as the basic operating energy, in order to reload the memories of the day I died; attempting to send a message to the Foundation will come later if I am still conscious.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> [URGENT] SCP-6676 Vulnerability</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Now that I am integrated into a terminal large enough to host me and my full memories, I am able to comprehend my time inside an SCP-6676 instance. While I was inside, I was evidently experiencing input through all of its senses, but due to my extremely low processing ability, I was only able to perceive audio and limited psychic noise while the rest of the content was archived. Basically, I was able to perceive everything as I experienced it, but I was unable to recall what I had experienced less than three minutes later.</p>
<p>Evidently, SCP-U instances were aliens. Seed pods launched off of Venus before it became an inhospitable wasteland, drifted in space for a few million years, and crashed down in Maine on the 27th before growing into an entity. They were supposed to land back on Venus to rehabilitate it, but given that they weren’t actually on it, Earth seemed to be the next best thing. Earth’s oxygen level was too low for them to safely breathe for extended periods of time, so they grabbed host bodies that were accustomed to the environment and got to work putting plants and shit everywhere. They spoke through ideas, which I could pick up on due to the brain chip being designed to store my thoughts, and one of the lead instances was living in my former brain.</p>
<p>Now, with the explanation out of the way, I’m free to explain what we can actually do to stop the imminent apocalypse. The current amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is 19.5%, which is the normal amount of oxygen for our atmosphere. SCP-U instances require a percentage of 20% to breathe safely, while SCP-6676 instances can already breathe somewhat easily with our lungs. However, similar to how a deep-sea diver cannot breathe high concentrations of oxygen underwater without being poisoned, both SCP-U and SCP-6676 instances cannot breathe an oxygen concentration higher than 20.5% without having their plant-based brains dissolve. While this is very specific, I can assure you that this information is truthful. Every moment when SCP-6676 began an attack, the projected oxygen emissions were specifically calculated, and as soon as the oxygen levels were breathable and stable, native plant life would be entirely eliminated.</p>
<p>If we could find a plant with abnormally large oxygen emissions, and introduce that plant to the world en-masse, we could increase the oxygen levels past 20.5%; effectively eliminating all SCP-6676 instances, and making the planet inhospitable to future SCP-U instances. While raising the planet’s oxygen level a full 1% would bring about an untold alteration to the ecosystem as we know it, there are two distinct advantages to doing this. For one, we aren’t all turned into alien meatsuits on a soon-to-be desert planet, and for two, the human population may actually breathe easier in a higher oxygen concentration.</p>
<p>Brief disclaimer: I am unaware of which plants would cause an oxygen output high enough to end the SCP-6676 invasion attempt, which is why I have also contacted the botany department in this email. Additionally, while I do not know whether this project would be approved, I should also inform you that the first target for more SCP-6676 instances to be made are operating individuals of the SCP Foundation, as SCP-6676 instances are capable of retaining almost all information from host bodies. Apparently they want to make colonizing an entire planet easier by using the knowledge contained in your flesh. Weird, huh?</p>

<p>Dear Researcher Clarkes,</p>
<p>While we are willing to be lenient on your behavior considering your current state, I will remind you that civility is important while working within the Foundation. By maintaining a calm but somewhat serious demeanor, we make interactions with outside individuals appear professional and helpful.</p>
<p>Additionally, this is certainly very valuable information you have proposed to us, we would be eager to authorize a project capable of reliably decommissioning SCP-6676. There are not currently any botanical experts on the council, so if the botany department would kindly help with Researcher Clarkes’ informational request, we would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Hey Clarkes,</p>
<p>To provide an answer for your request, you had eerily good timing regarding one of our new projects! Recently, the island of Socotra was under review for possible anomalous content due to the odd biology on the landmass, and was discovered to be non-anomalous. However, the story behind it is long, interesting, and most likely necessary for this proposal to make sense.</p>
<p>Back in the Cretaceous Period, a large earthquake and the shifting of tectonic plates caused the island to drift away from the mainland, where it sat untouched for 70 million years. Only occasionally occupied by sailors only within the course of the last 7000 years, flora was found to be extremely unusual; Large, shelled plants stretching several meters tall of various species populated the island, leading to extensive Foundation research within the past 10 years. After a long, ongoing debate on possible anomalous content or influence, the island of Socotra was declared non-anomalous last month.</p>
<p>These plants were known both for their size and their unusual biology, which produces oxygen on a scale much larger than known flora; with some cross-breeding to match warmer or colder conditions, these organisms would be perfect to help contain SCP-6676.</p>
<p>Happy to help!</p>

<p><strong>Item Number:</strong> SCP-6676-D</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Decommissioned</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6676-D is no longer in need of containment procedures. Instances of SCP-6676-A are to be continually monitored for signs of disease or illness, although SCP-6676-A’s self-propagation means that inspection of individual instances are rarely needed. Amnestic agents were introduced into SCP-6676-A’s transmitted fluids in order to remove public knowledge of the events that took place between 30/5/21 and 30/7/21, and since this agent cannot be naturally reproduced by SCP-6676-A, amnesticization shall not progress beyond this period, and is not required due to SCP-6676-D's status as a decommissioned anomaly. Project Transformational Root Evolution Ecosystem came to a close on 30/7/21, and the Foundation has since resumed regular operating policy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6676-D was the official designation of multiple hostile, sapient entities residing in the corpses of Foundation employees killed in action on 29/5/21. SCP-6676-D was declared decommissioned on 23/7/21, when atmospheric oxygen levels reached a stable 20.9%. SCP-6676-A refers to vegetable organisms crossbred from existing plant species, designed to decommission SCP-6676-D through its unusually large production of oxygen.</p>
