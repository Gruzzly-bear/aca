            <h1>SCP-5296</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5296</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5296 is secured in its testing chamber in Site-11. Its testing chamber is fitted with 4 Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs). SCP-5296 is to be monitored by at least 3 members of staff who perceive its existence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5296 appears to be a semi-physical entity whose existence is permeable and subject to factors that are as of yet undetermined. The precise nature of SCP-5296 is unknown. Even amongst those who perceive it to exist, there is little agreement on any of SCP-5296's features, presenting it as a sizeable threat to consensus reality.</p>
<p>These inconsistencies are largely universal, applying even to a single individual's continuous perception of SCP-5296. Common points of disagreement in decreasing order of controversy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-88390-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-88390-1')">1</a></sup> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether or not SCP-5296 exists</li>
<li>Whether or not SCP-5296 is humanoid</li>
<li>Whether or not SCP-5296 can communicate</li>
<li>Whether or not SCP-5296 is memetic or reality-warping</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to its ambiguous nature, SCP-5296 has caused much conflict within the Foundation over its properties. It is currently unknown if this is an intended effect or not.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5296 was seized by MTF-Phoenix-1 ("Mind Over Matter") on 24/06/2027. It was discovered during a Foundation raid to recover SCP-████ from [REDACTED] after a containment breach. It was found in a hidden room which was marked on an assailant's map of the complex. On entering the room, MTF-Phoenix-1 found a note describing SCP-5296. The note was subsequently deemed irrecoverable after a skirmish with remaining assailants. MTF-Phoenix-1 did not recall the contents of the note in sufficient detail to assist in initial documentation. SCP-5296 and SCP-████ were retrieved and brought to Site-11 without further incident.</p>
<p>Of note, members of MTF-Phoenix-1 claimed not to have noticed SCP-5296 until after having read the note about it.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-5296-A</strong><br/>
Although SCP-5296 has, as of yet, proved easy to contain, it has caused significant disruption within the Foundation, detailed below:</p>

<td style="text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black">26/06/2027</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">On Junior Researcher Smith's assignment to SCP-5296, he made several complaints about it being “an empty room”. He also made several appeals to Site Command to delete the files regarding SCP-5296 and to cease "wasting our time on non-entities." Due to his misconduct, he was later referred to the disciplinary committee.</td>

<td style="text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black">04/07/2027</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">Senior Researcher Aster experienced minimal difficulties in his preliminary research. However, video records of his initial tests were lost upon a routine scan of the Foundation database, wherein I.T staff deleted them, commenting “Assumed unnecessary equipment test: D-Class was standing in an empty room.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">26/07/2027</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">Research continued from here; however, it was slightly impeded by pressure to complete investigations quickly. As a result of this and a general effort by the Foundation to cut down on use of resources, all projects relating to SCP-5296 were halted until an appeal by Aster was approved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">02/08/2027</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">A formal inquiry into SCP-5296 was launched, leading to the near-deletion of the SCP-5296 file by Site Command in a 9-1 vote on the matter. After further investigation, no consensus was reached on SCP-5296 and its file remained pending deletion. They settled that research should proceed as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">10/08/2027</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">In accordance with the disruption it had caused, SCP-5296 was raised as an issue to the O5-Council, who also experienced difficulties in coming to any agreement regarding SCP-5296.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Following the O5-Council meeting on 10/08/2027, research into SCP-5296 is now considered a top priority. SCP-5296 has been provisionally classed as Keter.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-5296-B</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further review of our files regarding SCP-5296 suggests its nature may be vastly different to our initial assessments. SCP-5296 may very well be a <em>figment</em> of our imaginations.</p>
<p>- Senior Researcher Aster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following review of the above proposal, further testing of SCP-5296 has been approved to determine the likelihood of this theory.</p>
<p><strong>Test Log 5296-01</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 09/09/2027.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Procedure:</strong><br/>
This test consisted of two executions with minor alterations:</p>
<p><em>Standard Procedure:</em><br/>
A D-Class will enter SCP-5296's testing chamber and follow the instructions of Senior Researcher Aster, who will be remotely observing the test.</p>
<p>The first execution was standard, but the D-Class was given a briefing prior to the test and was given a file describing SCP-5296<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-88390-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-88390-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The second execution was identical to the first, excluding the lack of a briefing.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
D-1412, who had received the briefing, perceived SCP-5296 and was generally consistent with previous observations regarding SCP-5296 and the lack of consensus around its properties.</p>
<p>D-1583, who went in blind, was unable to perceive SCP-5296, complaining that there was nothing in the room to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Observations:</strong><br/>
It would appear that the proposed theory may be correct, although the data set is insufficient to draw any conclusions. Further testing involving on-site staff is pending approval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Test Log 5296-02</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 11/09/2027.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Procedure:</strong><br/>
This was effectively a large-scale version of the previous test. Site staff was divided into two groups, one that was briefed beforehand whilst the other was not. They then each attempted to perceive SCP-5296.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
Everyone in the group that went in with no prior knowledge failed to perceive SCP-5296, whilst everyone in the other group was able to perceive SCP-5296. The results after testing over 200 on-site personnel were consistent with the proposed theory, however also raise another possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Observations:</strong><br/>
These results are conclusive. They leave only two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>SCP-5296 is indeed a figment of the observer's imagination.</li>
<li>SCP-5296 is somehow aware of our belief in it and its permeable existence responds in kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>SCP-5296 will hereafter be reclassified as Safe, since the discord it initially caused has run its course and its properties are now beginning to be understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 5296-C</strong><br/>
As recent test results have raised concerns that SCP-5296 may be reliant on human belief in order to exist, it has been raised as an issue to the Ethics Committee. This is due to be discussed on 25/09/2027 during a meeting of the Ethics Committee.</p>
