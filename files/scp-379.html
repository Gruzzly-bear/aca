            <h1>SCP-379</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-379</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-379 is to be kept in vault-████ at Sector ████-█ when not in use. When being transported it should be carried in a locked and padded container, such as a padded briefcase, as the bottle is fragile. As our supply is limited, all testing and experimentation must be authorized by Dr. ███████ beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-379 is a translucent, pale, silver liquid contained in a small crystal bottle. The bottle is topped with an atomizer cap which delivers approximately one-half (.5) ml of the clear substance inside the bottle.</p>
<p>The bottle itself has no noted properties of any particular interest. However, the liquid inside (while scentless and ineffective to normal human beings) has the strange effect of inducing a state not unlike human infatuation upon electronic and mechanical devices. When applied to a person or some object, any machines or electronics in the vicinity (aside from those wearing SCP-379) will begin running in an overheated state, unable to process as many commands and consuming more energy.</p>
<p>For cybernetic systems or computers deemed 'sentient', the target seems to exhibit more humanistic qualities of typical 'infatuation' including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A preference to be around or in contact with the wearer of SCP-379.</li>
<li>More willingness to cooperate with anyone in the room while the wearer of SCP-379 is present.</li>
<li>Slower response times in machines.</li>
<li>A slightly higher chance of minor glitches and malfunctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been suggested to expose aggressive SCPs such as SCP-███ to SCP-379 to see if the pheromone can reduce their aggressiveness, perhaps allowing us to ask more questions about their function. It has also been suggested to try SCP-379 on SCPs that are not mechanical and do not exist in our 3D, real-world state (as is the case of <a href="scp-732.html">SCP-732</a>) to see if the pheromone affects them; deemed unlikely.</p>
<p>There is no known reason as to how the sporting of SCP-379 affects most machines; SCP-379 does not release any sort of scent or detectable pheromone into the air. It has been suggested that SCP-379 has an electromagnetic frequency of some sort, but tests have proven this theory inconclusive. Further tests are to be limited until chemical composition is established to determine if SCP-379 can be artificially replicated.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 379-A:</strong> Experiments with SCP-379 and <a href="scp-915.html">SCP-915</a> show that purely mechanical devices of sufficient complexity could be affected by SCP-379. SCP-915's intake of air increased threefold, but this was not accompanied by a detectable increase in computation speed. Requests have been made to test if the internal shifts of SCP-915 increase in response to SCP-379. Due to lack of quantities of SCP-379, continued experiments with SCP-915 are denied.</p>
