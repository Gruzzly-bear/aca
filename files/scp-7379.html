<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Permits for the excavation of land upwards of 0.75 kilometers beneath the greater metropolitan area of Scranton, Pennsylvania are to be denied without direct word otherwise from the O5 Council, with a reasonable explanation being devised or appropriated as per <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/list-of-standard-cover-stories">standard Foundation disinformation protocol.</a> Individuals or organizations attempting to unlawfully penetrate ground in the area are to be detained and thoroughly questioned, followed by amnesticization in the case of above-Veil actors.</p>
<p>Recording devices planted within SCP-7379 are to be monitored at all times. Given any indication of abnormal activity from the area of SCP-7379, all major Foundation sites are to be put on temporary lockdown until signs cease — typically, this occurs upon the neutralization of the target in the event of an SCP-7379 activation. Upon cessation of the event, storage room A-76 is to be unlocked and checked for signs of communication from the facility’s operators.</p>
<p>Use and maintenance of Site-7379 by its operators is not to be contested by Foundation command at the Site or executive level under any circumstances. In all other respects, the Foundation is to allow the facility to operate without interference. Attempts to open additional inquiry into, experiment upon, or otherwise engage with the inner workings of SCP-7379’s Central Reactor Chamber beyond simple observation is prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7379 is the <em>SCRANTON</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Reality Anchor, a massive subterranean nominally Foundation-operated reality stabilization device located beneath Scranton, Pennsylvania. Structurally, it resembles a greatly enlarged fusion plant with thirteen (13) reactors and no smokestacks or other visible means of releasing emissions. Presumably as a resultant externality of its operating function, localized reality within an approximately fifty-kilometer radius of SCP-7379 is constantly stabilized at a Hume concentration of ~10,000ξ, roughly 100 times greater than standard levels. As such, the anomalous alteration of reality in any way is extremely difficult in and around the area of SCP-7379 and the entire city is effectively immune to any form of ontokinetic incursion or remote alteration.</p>
<p>Upon activation, SCP-7379 is capable of drastically raising the localized Hume coefficient of almost any remote location on Earth. The exact mechanisms by which SCP-7379 accomplishes this task is unknown, as its internal apparatus are poorly understood by the Foundation at present<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. After activation events, SCP-7379 displays an inability to reactivate for a period of 8-12 years. The presumed reason for this pause is to enable the recharge of the apparatus used by SCP-7379 to perform the stabilization of local reality, which are, as previously mentioned, not precisely known at this time.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="500px_photo_%2869274077%29.jpeg" class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/500px_photo_%2869274077%29.jpeg"/>

</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7379 typically initiates the process of activation immediately prior to the manifestation or containment breach of one or more high-potency reality-bending entities. Within minutes of the manifestation or breach in question, SCP-7379 will have fully readied itself for activation and will deploy its primary anomalous property to raise the Hume quotient of the anomaly’s local area, neutralizing its ontokinetic capacity with overwhelming suppressive force. The targets of SCP-7379 activations are not chosen by Foundation high command nor known in advance of activation, however often coincide with those entities considered high-priority threats by the Foundation at the time of the event. The nature of SCP-7379 activation events and their ostensible prioritization would seem to indicate that the facility or its operators are in possession of some form of predictive algorithm or precognitive anomaly and can foretell the rise of hostile ontokinetic entities with a considerable degree of accuracy; further research into this is ongoing.</p>
<p>Around the area of SCP-7379 lies Subterranean Site-7379, a Foundation containment facility built contemporaneously to SCP-7379 itself. Site-7379 serves two purposes: maintenance, observation, and control of SCP-7379, and weaponized use of SCP-7379’s passive anomalous property to contain catastrophically high-threat reality-altering anomalies by suppressing their ontokinetic capability. Site-7379 is composed of hundreds of disparate wings and chambers interconnected by giant, labyrinthine<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> tunnels and caverns equipped with an internal subway system for easy transport. In all, the area of underground which Site-7379 occupies is approximately 40 kilometers in length and 26 kilometers in depth.</p>

<p>As of 1972, approximately thirteen thousand (13,000) Scranton Reality Anchors, Anderson Anchors<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, and Lang-Scranton Stabilizers<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> have manifested around and beneath SCP-7379 in a state of inexplicable and irreparable malfunction. Additionally, since the 1972 incident<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>, the Central Reactor Chamber of SCP-7379 has held an indeterminately immense number of contained and semi-contained anomalous objects in seemingly haphazard configuration. Consult Addendum 7379.1 for more information.</p>
<p>As of 22 August 1991, the O5 Council has issued an executive order stating that these objects are not to be manipulated, rearranged, or removed under any circumstances as to prevent accidental interference with the function of SCP-7379 by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Construction of SCP-7379 and Site-7379 was first ordered by Dr. Robert Scranton of the Department of Ontokinetics in October of 1963, following a report from his department that urged the necessity that the Foundation construct a device for neutralization of large-scale reality-altering threats. Scranton, Pennsylvania was chosen as the preferred location to construct SCP-7379 due to its orientation on a naturally-occuring point of leyline overlap corresponding to high average Hume rates. In the ensuing decade, preparation and construction began, with a large area being cleared out approximately 2 kilometers beneath the city. A scaffolding for the structure was constructed soon after, with external walls, tunnels across the in-construction Site-7379, and the boundaries of rooms for the site being excavated. The structure’s outer shell was completed as of 1969, with internal installations — including Site-7379 control rooms and offices, a subway system for exit, entrance, and internal traversal, and the then-empty Central Reactor Chamber of SCP-7379 — finishing construction in 1971.</p>

</div>
<p>During an intermittent period of schematic development in the Spring of 1972, the main facility would not be accessed for several months. Upon reentry, it was discovered that that the interior of the facility had been entirely redeveloped by unknown means, with an entire internal geography and array of anomalous mechanisms having manifested without the recorded approval or knowledge of any Foundation-sanctioned authority.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The manifested interior and associated machinery, though largely impractical or counter-intuitive for human use, is indeed believed to have been placed with deliberation, as many foreign objects, such as those inserted within the Central Reactor Chamber during the incident, have provided ontological anchoring functionality and enable the current use of SCP-7379. It is, as such, believed that construction of SCP-7379 and its associated site was completed — unaccordingly and in contradiction to extant plans for the facility, though still with intention — by an unsanctioned party during the break from construction, and that this party was aware of the facility's intended purpose and attempted to aid construction to this end on its own terms.</p>
<p>Following the incident in 1972, several uniform placards displaying the text “Department of Abnormalities”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> and an unidentified glyph somewhat resembling the standard Foundation insignia manifested at the entrance and exit gates of Site-7379's tunnel system.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p>The following is an incomprehensive list of anomalous objects observed to be in containment in SCP-7379’s Central Reactor Chamber following the manifestation incident in Spring of 1972. Objects are typically found stored in variably-euclidean and sometimes misshapen containment chambers connected to one another via conveyor belts, pipelines, pulleys, plexiglass tubes, slides, chutes, robotic arms, miniature train tracks, and other increasingly odd and seemingly inefficient means of transport strewn across the chamber. Upon each chamber hangs a metal placard bearing a colloquial or poetic identifier of unknown meaning, as well as an insignia somewhat resembling that of the Foundation.</p>

<p><em>On 21 August 1991, SCP-7379 began to display initial signs of activation. The following is an incomplete timeline of events having occurred during said activation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></em></p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>2:04 | An alarm begins to ring throughout facility. Red lights flash from various locations.</p>
<p>2:06 | All entrances and exits simultaneously shut and lock. Alarm and warning lights cease activity.</p>
<p>2:07 | A series of chants in an unknown language can be heard emanating from the Central Reactor. All ribbons constituting object "Daffodil" demanifest from Chamber 1267. A bright light can be seen emanating from both the chamber and core reactor temporarily. Whispers can be heard throughout various halls in Segment WHITE.</p>
<p>2:10 | A large mechanical arm extends from the far wall of Chamber 0721, picking up Object "Fractals Above", and releases it into a previously unseen chute. The arm then retracts back into the wall.</p>
<p>2:11 | Smoke fills all portions of the facility.</p>
<p>2:13 | Object "The Arbiter" emits a bright light from an opening in its torso, before breaking through the near wall. It continues to wander through the various hallways of the facility.</p>
<p>2:15 | An unknown species of leeches appear throughout all tunnels.</p>
<p>2:16 | Smoke dissipates.</p>
<p>2:18 | Object "Sword of Damocles" begins to rapidly spin, slowly levitating into the air as it rotates. Once roughly two meters above the ground, it darts directly into the door of Chamber 7106, bursting through the steel. Following exit, it begins to navigate the chambers.</p>
<p>2:19 | Cracks begin to form in several chambers throughout Segment PINK.</p>
<p>2:21 | The polaroid camera-component of Object "Hope" releases the photograph it had been holding in stasis. The image can now clearly be discerned as depicting a bright white hand from below.</p>
<p>2:23 | Entities comprising Object "Lost Voices" leave their chamber, crawling aimlessly throughout Segment PINK.</p>
<p>2:24 | The domestic dogs constituting object "Relief" wake up, beginning to walk around the halls of Segment GREEN.</p>
<p>2:27 | All lights within the facility cease function temporarily. Footsteps can be heard from within the reactor.</p>
<p>2:28 | A slab of concrete in Chamber 9928<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> falls to reveal a previously unseen portion of the room, containing a vinyl record player, and the opening of a tunnel extending into the wall.</p>
<p>2:30 | A loud explosion is heard from within an empty storage room.</p>
<p>2:32 | Echoes of unknown origin spread throughout the halls of Segment RED.</p>
<p>2:35 | Object "The Arbiter" smashes the entrance into Chamber 0489, grabbing object "In Memoriam". Steam is released from various openings in its chest. A section of its head can be heard depressurizing, before lowering into its jaw, leaving a gaping hole. The automaton continues to feed the device into this gap before it closes seconds later. A bright light is once again emitted as it begins to trudge through the halls of the facility.</p>
<p>2:36 | The canines comprising Object "Relief" walk into Chamber 1050, with one taking the recently released photograph in their jaw and carrying it out of the area.</p>
<p>2:38 | A deep hum can be heard from beneath the facility.</p>
<p>2:40 | Object "Ideas Sleep Furiously" spontaneously shatters. A pool of smoke form at its feet, spreading throughout the chamber and into the hallway.</p>
<p>2:41 | Shadows belonging to an unrecognized type of entity appear throughout Segment YELLOW.</p>
<p>2:42 | The ceiling of Segment GREEN begins to crumble.</p>
<p>2:44 | Object "The Arbiter" bursts into Chamber 0001, consuming the mechanisms comprising Object "In Progress." It continues to use the sharp digits of its right appendage to inscribe the word "VILE" in large lettering across the far wall, before leaving to once again roam the facility.</p>
<p>2:45 | Object "Sword of Damocles" glows a bright red hue as it accelerates.</p>
<p>2:46 | Object "Reverse Engineering" begins to unfurl. The scroll continues to expand exponentially, with glyphs and images displayed in drastically different ways from standard modes of written language. The sheet eventually displays a black charcoal background with many white dots spread across it. A bright white light is emitted from both the scroll and the Central Reactor.</p>
<p>2:48 | The floor of Segment WHITE begins to tremor.</p>
<p>2:49 | The canines comprising Object "Relief" return to Chamber 5401, with the carrier releasing the photograph from its mouth. They proceed to rummage through the pile of steel and glass, eventually reaching a variety of electronic devices in the center, which are then pushed directly onto the photograph. Each component transposes through the image as it makes contact, rematerializing directly beneath Object "A Fate That Befalls You" in Chamber 4529. A bright white light is emitted from both the hand and the Central Reactor.</p>
<p>2:50 | Entities composing Object "Lost Voices" stumble into the pool of gas released by Object "Ideas Sleep Furiously," causing all figures to suddenly stare up at the ceiling. They proceed to run through the halls of the facility with seeming intent.</p>
<p>2:51 | Object "Fractals Above" falls through the chute present in Chamber 9928, landing directly on the record player. A song composed of acoustic guitars, faint rhythmic patterns, hushed whispers, and light bells begins to play.</p>
<p>2:52 | The cadaver constituting Object "Serenity" begins to rapidly ascend through the layers of soil and rock above, before slowly disintegrating. In Chamber 8124, The light constituting Object "Kether" grows significantly brighter temporarily. The call of a trumpeter swan can be heard throughout the facility. A bright flash of light is emitted from the Central Reactor, as it begins to slowly spin.</p>

</div>
<p>2:56 | Object "The Arbiter" and Object "Sword of Damocles" both reach Segment GREEN simultaneously. The automaton opens its jaw as the satellite rapidly approaches, though it detonates seconds before consumption. Dozens of various machines are shot vast distances out from the chest of Object "The Arbiter" as it explodes.</p>
<p>2:57 | The rebar formerly present within Object "In Memoriam" begins to glow a golden hue as it flies out from Object "The Arbiter," piercing cleanly through several walls before falling into the ravine within Chamber 2185. A flash of golden light is emitted from the pit, filling the entirety of the chamber. The silhouette of a human figure can be seen rising from the center, hung by rope wrapping around its neck. A similar hue is emitted from the Central Reactor, as its rotation begins to accelerate.</p>
<p>3:00 | Several vaguely humanoid statues begin to rise through the pipes present in Chamber 3909, filling Object "The Producer." A bright blue light is continuously released from the machine as its contents are incinerated. The Central Reactor further accelerates, heating up rapidly as it rotates.</p>
<p>3:01 | The mechanisms comprising Object "In Development" begin to emit a bright purple hue. A small mechanical arm reaches out from the pile, slowly moving throughout the halls of the facility.</p>
<p>3:37 | The mechanical arm produced by Object "In Development" reaches Chamber 5490, and proceeds to grasp onto Object "Staff of Hermes." It clenches the object tightly for several seconds, before finally taking the end of the pole and shoving the sphere into the floor with immense force, shattering it. A blinding purple light fills the entirety of the facility.</p>
<p>3:40 | All recording devices simultaneously go offline.</p>

<p>At 3:41 on 21 August 1991, SCP-7379 completed activation. Concordantly, an extradimensional ontohazard believed to have manifested in baseline reality immediately prior<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> was instantly neutralized. Had the entity remained at stability with baseline reality for even seconds more without Foundation attention, containment specialists theorize, a catastrophic breach of normalcy would have occurred.</p>
