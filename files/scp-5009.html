<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Addendum 5009-1:</strong> Metcalf-Bakke reverse imaging is a recently developed process accepted by conventional neuroscience.</span></p>

<p>I/O-BOREALIS output was limited to a single variable due to the fact that rats primarily observe their surroundings with tactile sensation from the whiskers. Future subject choice will be influenced by degree of visual and recollective acuity.</p>

<p>Following the success of this trial, the Metcalf-Bakke process was upgraded with the addition of the familiarity coefficient ξ, a value that measures the degree of familiarity to a particular stimulus based on previous learning. The familiarity coefficient is 0 for completely unfamiliar stimuli and increases by 1 for each successfully consolidated memory.</p>

<p>Following the results of the February 6 test, additional Metcalf-Bakke trials were ordered on SCP-5009.</p>
<p>On 2019-02-07, D-922358, D-704734, and D-104155 were exposed to the interior of SCP-5009 and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.</p>
<p>On 2019-02-08, similar trials were conducted with willing non-D-class personnel to identify if this phenomenon was limited to D-class. Junior Researcher Dr. Sania Suyardeva, Senior Researcher Dr. Joseph Russo, and Mobile Task Force Captain Alfred Lopez de la Fuentes volunteered, were exposed to the interior of SCP-5009, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.</p>
<p>On 2019-02-09, the Ethics Committee authorized, in a 7-2-4 vote, the use of non-willing subjects in Metcalf-Bakke trials regarding SCP-5009 unaffiliated with the Foundation to identify if this phenomenon was limited to Foundation personnel. Seung-min Oh, Zoey Powell, Haile Senai, and Shawn Hawkins were selected for testing, exposed to the interior of SCP-5009, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.</p>
<p>On 2019-02-10, Overwatch Command authorized, in a 6-3-4 vote, the circumvention of standard Foundation protocol and exposure of an Overseer to SCP-5009. O5-11 volunteered, was exposed to the interior of SCP-5009, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue">SCP-5009-Δ is inherently uncontainable.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5009 is an industrial complex formerly designated Foundation Site-00, located in Marin County, California, United States of America. SCP-5009 exhibits a <span style="color: blue">Vedas</span><sup><span style="color: red">1</span></sup>-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5009. This eventually renders observation of the interior of SCP-5009 impossible.</p>
<p>SCP-5009 was the first Foundation building to be commissioned by the Administrator. However, it never entered full operation. Records show that it was completed on 1898-12-01, at which point its anomalous properties appeared to have manifested.</p>
<p>SCP-5009's date of completion is noted as roughly coinciding with the approximate time period of the Administrator's disappearance.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue">5009-Ishvara events are moments of causality that occur inside of SCP-5009. Due to the antimemetic nature of SCP-5009, little information on 5009-Ishvara events is known. What is known, however, indicates that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: blue">5009-Ishvara events may affect any individual at any time.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: blue">5009-Ishvara events consist of the subject's (hereafter designated SCP-5009-1) spontaneous disappearance and subsequent reappearance inside SCP-5009.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: blue">5009-Ishvara events result in the inevitable employment of the SCP-5009-1 instance at the Foundation 1-2 years following its occurrence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: blue">It has been confirmed that 100% of Foundation employees of the past, present, and future have experienced or will experience a 5009-Ishvara event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">The synthesis of the latent mnestic drug M-48195, codenamed "Turkic Red", has allowed limited exploration of the interior of SCP-5009 and the subsequent discovery of SCP-5009-A. SCP-5009-A is a crack approximately 5.6m in length and 1.2m in width, running along the floor of the central room of SCP-5009. A light emanating from an unknown source can be seen glowing at the bottom of the crack, and intermittent metallic screeching can be heard from inside. Nothing that has entered SCP-5009-A has ever been recovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">Since its discovery, the size of SCP-5009-A, the brightness of the light source coming from within SCP-5009-A, and the loudness and frequency of the metallic screeching have all increased at a non-linear rate. No methods of slowing or reversing these processes are known.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">SCP-5009-Δ designates the existence of the SCP Foundation. Due to the role of SCP-5009 in its inception and continued existence, the SCP Foundation must be classified as an anomaly.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: red">1</span>. see also Carson F, Sanchez R 2018, 'Devising a Preliminary Antimemetic Classification System', <em>Foundation Science Publishers</em>, vol. 42. "A seemingly paradoxical hybrid of memes and antimemes, Vedas-class antimemes conceal themselves from conscious recollection and observation but exert a significant effect on the informational substrate of the universe. Similar to a conventional meme, a Vedas-class antimeme is capable of influencing its host's behavior to an extreme degree."</p>
