            <h1>SCP-8621</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8621</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8621 organisms are to be contained in a Biosafety Level 4 wet lab at Site-77. All live specimens are to be kept in separate, climate-controlled aquatic enclosures with a saline solution and kept at 60–65°F inside hermetic chambers. Chambers are to be fitted with two airlocks and continuous negative pressure monitoring. Interaction with SCP-8621 or SCP-8621-infected hosts requires full hazmat suits with independent air supply and heat-resistant layered gloves. Direct physical contact is prohibited except during approved, recorded testing with at least two Level 4 personnel present.</p>
<p>Any animal or human showing signs of SCP-8621 infection must be immediately isolated. Non-essential personnel in the exposure zone are to be amnesticized and prohibited from discussing SCP-8621. Infected subjects are to be euthanized only with O5 Council authorization; otherwise they are to be studied under quarantine for as long as safely possible. Disposal of biological waste from SCP-8621 containment must be by incineration at 2200°F which is followed by chemical decontamination.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Eta-9 is assigned to field recovery and surgical removal trials. Public statements and media are to report a localized outbreak of an unknown parasitic infection to maintain cover.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8621 refers to a small, sessile parasitic organism, typically 3–7 cm in length when detached, with a soft, segmented, gelatinous body. Exposed tissue reacts to SCP-8621 by producing a rapid mucosal attachment, once attached, SCP-8621 secretes a complex mixture of proteins and neuroactive compounds that facilitate integration with host somatic tissue.</p>
<p>The most significant property of SCP-8621 is its ability to induce a progressive morphological transformation in hosts. After attachment and a latent period (24–96 hours in small mammals, variable and typically longer in larger hosts), the host begins to exhibit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradual thickening and paleness of dermal tissue, later described as a "fleshy integument" that lacks normal hair or scale patterning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Disproportionate elongation of limbs: joints lengthen unevenly, producing unusually long arms, legs, and fingers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dento-alveolar restructuring: teeth increase in size and sharpness and, in advanced stages, acquire serrated or recurved morphology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Alterations in motor control and proprioception: infected hosts favor predatory, stalking behaviors and show increased nocturnal activity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Increased repair/regen tendencies in affected tissues, though redirected toward producing structures suited to predatory function rather than to restore original form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transformation is not instantaneous nor identical between hosts. Progression rates correlate with host size, immune status, and proximity of SCP-8621 to central nervous structures. Histological samples show that SCP-8621 secretes proteins that bind to host extracellular matrix and a small group of retroviral-like elements that upregulate developmental gene pathways associated with limb growth. However, SCP-8621 also produces neurotropic peptides that remodel neural circuits toward heightened aggression and altered pain perception.</p>
<p>SCP-8621 is capable of detaching and reattaching to new hosts. In field recoveries, multiple hosts in close proximity often show synchronous infection waves: in at least two incidents, SCP-8621 detached from an advanced-stage host and reinfected others, suggesting a lifecycle phase where the organism seeks new hosts after a threshold of host transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> SCP-8621 was first contained after reports of multiple homestead disappearances and livestock mutilations in ██████ County, Oregon, on 20██-██-██. Local law enforcement encountered a single human subject exhibiting the described morphological changes and aggressive behavior. MTF Eta-9 intercepted and contained the area. Several small aquatic specimens were recovered from a shallow woodland pond near the primary site.</p>
<p><strong>Test Log (Summary):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Test 8621-03: Rodent subject M3 exposed to a detached specimen. Latency 36 hours. At 72 hours: limb elongation and altered gait. At 10 days: M3 demonstrated organized stalking behavior; terminal stage reached on day 21; euthanized and sampled. No external hemorrhage or gross internal rupture observed. Tissue analysis showed large-scale upregulation of FGF and BMP signaling pathways.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Test 8621-11: Sheep subject O1 exposed in a pasture-simulated enclosure. Latency 5 days; progressive limb elongation noted. Host retained cooperative behavior for longer but developed hunting behavior toward smaller animals introduced subsequently. O1 was quarantined for 42 days; SCP-8621 detached spontaneously and was recovered. Subject then proceeded to an advanced stage and was euthanized.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Test 8621-18: Human volunteer D-9341 (Class D) exposed under consented protocol. Initial psychiatric changes noted after 48 hours (anxiety, hypervigilance). By day 12, D-9341 reported tactile sensitivity differences and increasing difficulty manipulating objects due to finger length change. By day 28, oral structures had altered; subject attempted to bite containment personnel during transfer and was terminated under protocol. Advanced neural assays demonstrated altered amygdala connectivity and increased secretion of neuromodulators associated with predation in vertebrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavioral Notes:<br/>
Infected hosts maintain basic cognition in early stages but show progressive reductions in social behavior and empathy. They develop an altered respiratory pattern (shallow, rapid) and an increased tolerance for pain stimuli in the affected regions. Some hosts retain vestigial memory and occasionally display humanlike glances or gestures; psychological assessment suggests dissociation concurrent with morphological change.</p>
<p><strong>Field Incident (████/██/20██):</strong> During a rural containment breach, an infected adult human (Subject H-7) escaped an initial perimeter. H-7 displayed advanced limb elongation and used the environment to ambush two MTF members. No excessive bleeding or dismemberment occurred; the attackers were incapacitated by targeted blunt trauma. H-7 was subdued using high-voltage stun measures and contained. Autopsy revealed SCP-8621 had formed a semi-calcified anchoring structure in the host's lumbar musculature and had partially ossified at attachment points. Following this incident, protocol was amended: stun charges and high-voltage immobilization are now preferred non-lethal subdual tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Research Notes &amp; Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments reduce the rate of transformation if administered within 48 hours of attachment but do not reverse morphological changes once they begin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Surgical excision of SCP-8621 within the first 72 hours yields the highest chance of full recovery: however, surgical teams report high risk of reinfection via microscopic larvae missed during excision. Enhanced imaging is required during removal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Given the organism’s ability to detach and reinfect, eradication in the wild is improbable without wide-area surveillance and rapid response. Continued development of an effective amnestic and public-health cover plan is necessary.</li>
</ul>
