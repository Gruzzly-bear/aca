            <h1>SCP-4423</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Development of containment procedures for SCP-4423 events is ongoing. Meanwhile, all such events are to be attributed to a unique form of sleep paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4423 is a Tartarean-Class demonic entity that manifests during sleep paralysis. Although its appearance varies across manifestations, its voice remains the same (with speech patterns matching that of a middle-aged male).</p>
<p>During an SCP-4423 event, SCP-4423 will enter the victim's room and speak to them as if they were a young child. This conversation will inevitably turn to the topic of the victim's father. When the victim exits sleep paralysis, SCP-4423 will leave the room and demanifest.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of reported incidents (with only fifteen confirmed cases since 1997), the frequency of SCP-4423 events is currently unknown. While the extent of SCP-4423's interactions with the victims varies greatly, many seek psychiatric help following an incident.</p>
<p><strong>Interview Log:</strong> In order to obtain an interview, Researcher Jack Patricks volunteered to be subjected to an experimental drug capable of inducing sleep paralysis. By using a prototype neural interface capable of translating thoughts into synthetic speech and a camera system mounted in his room, an interview was conducted after 77 consecutive days of testing.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4423</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Camera set within Researcher Patrick's room shows the Researcher, a bed, as well as several posters on the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>[6 hours removed for brevity.]</strong></p>
<p><em>The sound of a door opening is heard, followed by footsteps. SCP-4423 appears in the frame and sits at the end of Researcher Patricks' bed and crosses its hands in its lap. After observing Researcher Patricks for a period of 3 minutes, SCP-4423 touches his ankle and shakes it until Patricks opens his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Hey kiddo. Sorry to wake you up, but I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Hello.</tt></p>
<p><em>SCP-4423 jumps slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Oh wow! You frightened me. Another one of your crazy toys, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>I. Am. … Foundation.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Yes. Foundation. That's what I want to talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>You. Know.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I know a lot of things. There's a good deal of wisdom in this old horned head of mine. [ <em>Tugs on one of its horns</em> ] Relationships? They gotta have a strong foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Oh. Kay.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> And I wanna get to know you, buddy. A little us time, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Why.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Well… uh… [ <em>Coughs</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Questions.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Saved me there. Alright, I'll answer some of your questions while I try to think up how to say it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>How. You. Move.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> You know that. My old jalopy. I musta driven you to school three dozen times by now.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Where. You. From.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Here. Went to the same high school as you, remember? Showed you my old yearbooks.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>No. Really.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Yeah really. Okay. I think I've got it now. Your dad and I? Well, we've been seeing each other for a little while. I know, I know, we've been friends for, well, ever.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>William.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Yes, Bill. And when I say "seeing each other", I mean dating.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Oh.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I, uh, figured you mighta caught on but I wanted to talk about this with you, sport.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Oh. Kay.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Look, I love your father. He completes me in ways I didn't even know I needed. [ <em>Pause</em> ] After puberty is over, it'll make more sense.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Sexual. Relations.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Hey, who told you about that? Didn't think Bill gave you the talk yet. But, yes. Sexually too.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Oh. Kay.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I don't want to just jump into your life like a stranger. I'm not a housewrecker. I wanna be part of your life, in a mutually positive relationship. So we need a good foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>How.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I know your parents went through a pretty nasty divorce a little while ago. And that you haven't seen your mom in a while. I don't want to replace her. I never could.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Explain.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I want to ask your permission.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>For. What.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Jack… I want to marry your dad. If you're okay with it, I'd be honored to be your stepdad.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Step. Dad.</tt></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Yes, your stepdad. Just say yes and I'll propose tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4423 covers its mouth with its hands and giggles</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> I can just see him, all dressed up in a tight little tux. You can be the ring bearer, little buddy. So, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Patricks:</strong> <tt>Yes.</tt></p>
<p><em>SCP-4423 grabs Researcher Patricks, pulls him into a hug, and kisses his forehead. SCP-4423 laughs, tucks Patricks back into bed, and then exits the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4423:</strong> Ah! You said yes!</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Following extensive interviews, Foundation researchers concluded that while he had passed through Las Vegas on <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4661" target="_blank">15/1/1992</a>, Researcher Patricks' father has not engaged in sexual intercourse with any Tartarean-Class demonic entities<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Ten months after the interview, a photograph depicting SCP-4423, William Patricks, and Researcher Jack Patricks in formal attire inside of a church was discovered underneath Researcher Patricks' bed. The picture showed Researcher Patricks as he appeared when he was twelve and Patricks recognized the church as the one he attended as a child in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Upsilon-11 was dispatched to the church and found a wedding announcement in the records for one William Patricks and an unnamed second person, dated 14/8/1999. No members of the clergy recall conducting or witnessing the wedding and Researcher Patricks has no memory of this event taking place.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On 30/8/2019, Researcher Patricks received a postcard (postmarked 14/8/2019 in Oranjestad, Aruba) from his father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Jack!</p>
<p>Sorry that I didn't give you any notice, but your stepdad and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in the Islands. Can't believe it's been twenty years already. Maybe you can join us next year, if you can get away from that job.<br/>
Love, Dad</p>
<p>P.S. If you get a chance, can you check on Misty? That cat sure misses you and I don't want Mrs. Arnsdale overfeeding her again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compiled surveillance logs from the city of Oranjestad show William Patricks and SCP-4423 checking into a hotel and participating in other activities standard for vacationing couples. The current whereabouts of William Patricks remains unknown.</p>
