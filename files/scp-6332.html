<p><em>SCP-6332 prior to containment.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6332 is to be kept in a heavily reinforced two-layer amphibian enclosure which is able to withstand explosions equivalent to at least <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1</span> 3 kilotons<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> of TNT. Each layer of the enclosure is to be outfitted with a steel-encased concrete door with a remote locking system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protocol D:</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Biweekly</span> Once a week, a D-Class personnel is to enter SCP-6332's containment and wait for SCP-6332 to make a request. The Foundation and D-Class personnel are to cooperatively fulfill the request if possible. Otherwise, the D-Class personnel is to tell SCP-6332 the request cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In the event SCP-6332 reaches the outer layer, Foundation personnel are to request that it goes back to the inside layer. If it refuses, Foundation personnel are to release naphthalene gas in the outside layer until SCP-6332 returns.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6332 is a salamander biologically resembling the <em>Ambystoma maculatum</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. However, SCP-6332 is physically more resistant to injury than its non-anomalous counterparts and is estimated to be able to withstand blasts equivalent to up to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1.2</span> 3 kilotons of TNT.</p>
<p>Through unknown means, SCP-6332 is capable of coherently speaking and understanding all known languages. SCP-6332 utilizes these vocalizations in order to make requests, henceforth referred to as 6332-A events. Failure to adhere to these requests results in a variety of potential consequences involving an anomalous explosive force henceforth referred to as 6332-B events. The means by which SCP-6332 is able to manifest these events is unknown. However, the nature of SCP-6332 suggests that 6332-B events are a byproduct of its emotional state in response to unfulfilled requests.</p>
<p>Giving orders or demands to SCP-6332 will result in an immediate 6332-B event that is, in most cases, fatal.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27/03/2021</p>
<p>SCP-6332 was retrieved from Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada, by Provisional Task Force Tau-33 ("Talking Tides"). The Foundation was alerted to the anomaly due to reports of a “talking salamander” and scorched trees. Transcription of the body camera of the Tau-33 leader ("Tsunami") is provided below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Discovery Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task Force Assigned:</strong> Provisional Task Force Tau-33 "Talking Tides"</p>
<p><strong>Task Force:</strong> "Tsunami", "Hurricane", "Maelstrom", "Waterspout"</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Remember, all we know is the thing talks. Stay focused; we don't know what it can do. Don’t forget about the reports of “scorched trees”, either.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Eyes up, team. In-and-out in less than thirty, just like always.</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane, Maelstrom, Waterspout:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>[Tau-33 head towards the last reported location of SCP-6332.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> I have eyes on the target.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> What's the situation like?</p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Target seems docile, but the ground is scorched, similar to previous reports.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Alright. Hurricane, Maelstrom, keep your distance and eyes on the target. Waterspout, we're movin' in.</p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Understood. Stay cautious, though. Looks like this thing's got somethin' nasty up its sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> Salamanders don't have sleeves, Water.</p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Try to stay focused for more than a couple seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane:</strong> We're about to engage with the target, now's not the time for back n' forth.</p>
<p><em>[Tsunami and Waterspout approach SCP-6332. SCP-6332 looks in their direction, but otherwise does not react.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> <em>(To SCP-6332)</em> Hey, why don't you come with us?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6332 does not respond. It turns to face Tsunami.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Tsunami carefully reaches for SCP-6332. SCP-6332 takes several steps backwards.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-6332's skin starts to emit a small amount of orange light.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Get back! Something's not right!</p>
<p><em>[Tsunami jumps backwards. An explosive goes off from SCP-6332's location. Tsunami is launched several meters backwards. Flames cover the camera lens.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> <em>(Whispers)</em> Shit.</p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> Status?</p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Got a few burns. Nasty little creature.</p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> Looked like it hurt. Any orders?</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane:</strong> Awaiting further instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> <em>(To Control)</em> SCP-6332 seems to be capable of spontaneous combustion and explosive force. It seems unharmed despite being the hypocenter.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Understood. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> We're gonna have to get it to come with us quietly. If we try to beat it with force…</p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> Moving in. Maelstrom, Hurricane, let me know if you see anything strange.</p>
<p><em>[Waterspout keeps their distance from SCP-6332.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> <em>(To SCP-6332)</em> This is your chance to come with us quietly.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6332 does not respond]</em></p>
<p><strong>Waterspout:</strong> This is an order. Don't force our hand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> No thanks!</p>
<p><em>[Camera footage shows Waterspout emit an orange glow. Multiple distinct cracking sounds can be heard, followed by a low rumble. Waterspout collapses to the ground, and black smoke rises from their corpse.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>Hurricane:</strong> Holy hell…</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Fuck! <em>(To Control)</em> Waterspout's down…</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Understood. Can you complete the mission?</p>
<p><em>[Several seconds of silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> I have an idea, but I'm not sure if it'll work.</p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> Are you insane?! We just saw Water's insides reduced to fucking mush!</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Maels-</p>
<p><strong>Maelstrom:</strong> I say we come back with backup, a plan, equipment—something better than a hunch at least!</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> This isn't just a talking salamander; who knows what kind of damage it can cause. I think I've figured it out and I'm willing to risk it. Time is not on our side, here.</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> <em>(To Control)</em> I'm engaging with SCP-6332.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Understood. Don't do anything stupid.</p>
<p><em>[Tsunami keeps their distance from SCP-6332. SCP-6332 starts eating a worm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> <em>(To SCP-6332)</em> Hey.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6332 raises its head and looks at Tsunami]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Will you come with us, please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Yes! Can Eda come, too?</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Eda?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Yes, Eda!</p>
<p><em>[Tsunami pauses for a moment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Yes, Eda can come. Will you tell us where they are, please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> They said they'd come back soon!</p>
<p><strong>Tsunami:</strong> Alright. We can come back and get them later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Okay!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-6332 willingly followed Tsunami, and Tau-33 successfully delivered SCP-6332 to Site-33.</p>
<p>It was noted that SCP-6332 may respond positively to requests given to it, in ways that may otherwise seem unnatural.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tsunami opted to report that they felt the latter half of the transcript was incorrect. When asked to elaborate, they were unable to give a direct answer.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> Hey, SCP-6332. Is it alright if I ask a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> Great. So, can you tell me how you're able to talk, please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Yes! Eda asked me to!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> Eda? Can you tell us who Eda is, please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> No thanks! She said don't tell anyone!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> Can you tell us where to find her?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> No thanks! She said she'd come back soon! Has Eda come back yet? I'm bored!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> We'll investigate. Do you happen to know Eda’s last name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> Can you tell me, please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> No thanks! She said don't tell anyone!</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Sal quickly writes something down.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sal:</strong> I think that'll be all for now. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p><em>[D-913 slowly approaches SCP-6332. The enclosure is covered in thick soot.]</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-6332:</strong> <em>(Angry tone)</em> YES!</p>
<p><strong>D-913:</strong> Jesus, okay, it really can talk. <em>(To Dr. Sal)</em> I don’t think this guy’s friendly…</p>

<p>Following the events of 6332-B-1, personnel are prohibited from interacting directly with SCP-6332. Despite using all information available to us, SCP-6332 clearly has other anomalous properties that remain unknown, and at this time it is too dangerous to find out what those are.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation regarding Eda</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong><br/>
- Was involved in the origin of SCP-6332’s anomalous traits.<br/>
- Has a desire to withhold information about themselves from others.<br/>
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Is deceased.</span><br/>
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Is not anomalous.</span><br/>
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Their name is Eda.</span><br/>
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">has yet to meet with SCP-6332 again.</span></p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Researchers tasked with the investigation of Eda unanimously agreed that the information in this document was incorrect. It is therefore hypothesized that information regarding Eda is self-contained (i.e. antimemetic), and that records regarding Eda are anomalously altered. Despite an alleged “alteration”, update logs of these investigation results show no extraordinary changes.</p>
<p>Information deemed “incorrect” by the researchers tasked with this investigation has been crossed out.</p>
