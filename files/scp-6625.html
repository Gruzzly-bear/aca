<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each instance of SCP-6625 is to be stored in a standard large object containment chamber, regardless of its actual size. Detailed records must be kept of each instance's changes of form.</p>
<p>Inter-Site transfer of SCP-6625 instances for research purposes is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">forbidden</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">permitted</span> discouraged.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6625 is a blanket designation for objects possessing the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their physical form can spontaneously change; these changes occur roughly every 12 to 24 hours, and appear to ignore conservation of mass and related laws;</li>
<li>Their 'function' (defined in broad terms) remains the same across such transformations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total number of SCP-6625 instances in existence is unknown, but the Foundation currently retains custody of six.</p>

<strong>Function:</strong> Medium of communication
<p><strong>Examples of forms:</strong> Papers and notepads (various), dry-erase whiteboard, phonograph record, semaphore flags</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> In February of 1989, the Foundation received numerous reports regarding a potential new Group of Interest named Holt Office Supplies Ltd (GoI-6625), an anomalous stationery retailer operating from multiple locations in southwest England. Foundation agents successfully purchased a number of items from these branches, and their assorted anomalous properties were later confirmed. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A batch of pens whose ink spontaneously changed colour approximately once per minute;</li>
<li>A batch of pencils which could write effectively despite containing elemental lead instead of graphite;</li>
<li>A block of sticky notes which, if any numeric date was written on them in YYYY-MM-DD format, would immediately lose their adhesive properties once said date had passed;</li>
<li>An item which periodically alternated between being a stack of blank paper, a whiteboard, an empty CD, and various other media of communication (later designated SCP-6625-1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly after these discoveries, Site-128 was established for the purposes of monitoring GoI-6625 (alongside other low-level GoI activity in the area), as well as conducting research on the anomalous items procured from it. The Site's efforts in these areas are ongoing.</p>

<p>Site-128 is now fully operational, and we've made a lot of progress on studying the items we've got. Unfortunately, trying to shut this GoI down has been less successful; they seem to open a new branch every month or so, but whenever we send a team to raid one, they've completely shuttered the place by the time we get there.</p>
<p>Occasionally they're kind enough to leave us a note. This one, for instance, was taped to the front door of the shop we tried last week:</p>
<div class="blockquote table2">
<p>To our loyal customer(s),</p>

<strong>Function:</strong> Navigational tool
<p><strong>Examples of forms:</strong> Magnetic compass, world atlas, GPS, inflatable globe</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> In April 1992, a team of field agents was sent to search an abandoned public library in Warsaw, following reports of paranormal phenomena. One agent reported observing a folded map of the local area spontaneously transform into a large brass sextant; this item was recovered, and taken to Site-120 for storage and further research.</p>
<p>Shortly after its arrival, the item's similarity to the object retrieved from Holt Office Supplies was noted; the SCP-6625 designation was subsequently established to cover both anomalies, as well as any others with similar properties that might be discovered in the future.</p>

<p>We're still trying to determine how exactly this thing operates. So far as we can tell, it only ever transforms itself into things that provide some kind of navigational information. It's not always <em>useful</em> information, admittedly — for instance, it recently turned into a map of Istanbul, with a red dot on the Hagia Sophia labelled "YOU ARE NOT HERE" — and the fact that we have no control over its form means its utility is somewhat limited.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> In February 2006, a large package was delivered to Site-54 in Leipzig; this package was found to contain a stone sculpture resembling a gargoyle.</p>
<p>Research conducted on the item found similarities to SCP-6625-1, -2, -3 and -4; it would periodically change its form without any apparent input or trigger, with intervals typically between 12 and 24 hours.

<p>I have received protests from multiple staff over the addition of this item to the SCP-6625 file. I disagree, for the record — I think the phenomenological similarities are too great for the idea of a relationship between this instance and the others to be discarded — but they do raise an important point. The fact that 6625-5 so clearly defies our expectation of a 'constant function' means one of two things: either our expectation is wrong, or our idea of what constitutes a 'constant function' is insufficiently nuanced.</p>
