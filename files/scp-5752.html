<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures (as of 5 October 2025):</strong> Due to its distance from any dangerous anomalies, SCP-5752 is to remain at Site-17 in Basement Level 3 until further notice. SCP-5752 is to be kept in a padded humanoid containment chamber with cameras constantly monitoring her, as well as 2 guards stationed outside of her cell at all hours. Guards monitoring SCP-5752 are to have gone through mnestic training or have a natural resistance to L0-L3 antimemetic phenomenon. When handling SCP-5752, guards are to be preemptively stripped of weaponry and sharp objects.</p>
<p>If SCP-5752 breaches her cell, Basement Levels 1-5 are to be locked down and searched until SCP-5752 or her remains have been recovered. Termination of SCP-5752 is to be considered a last resort and is not to be attempted unless clearance is given by L4 personnel or higher. In the event that either no traces of SCP-5752 have been found, or her corpse has been recovered, all Foundation properties are to be alerted that SCP-5752 is uncontained. If SCP-5752 is uncontained, various personnel in sites worldwide are to be administered Class-W mnestics and placed into surveillance teams to manually scrub through Foundation security feeds in order to search for and identify SCP-5752. If personnel L3 or under are discovered interacting with SCP-5752, they are to be amnesticized under standard information breach protocol.</p>
<p>If SCP-5752's remains are recovered, they are to be submitted to the ███████████ Department for extensive analysis.</p>
<p>Because of the likelihood of SCP-5752 causing mass containment breaches (along with the high likelihood of causing cascading breach events), the study, transcription, and containment efforts of SCP-5752 is to be overviewed by O5-4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5752 is an as-of-yet unidentified female human in her mid-20s that is able to manifest in or nearby various locations. These locations must meet a certain criteria in order to be eligible for a potential manifestation event, with the criteria being but not limited to;</p>
<ul>
<li>having a history of anomalous occurrences.</li>
<li>being the potential location where an anomalous occurrence will swiftly occur.</li>
<li>containing, storing, and/or within the vicinity of anomalous items, lifeforms, locations, or events.</li>
<li>containing, storing, and/or within the vicinity of dangerous, malicious, and/or deadly anomalies.</li>
<li>having a deep history regarding the Foundation and its involvement in the anomalous world.</li>
</ul>
<p>When SCP-5752 manifests in one of these locations (which are most commonly Foundation sites), she will usually be dressed in clothes similar to those worn by Foundation staff, although she will not bear any official documentation such as ID badges, employee records, or other various staff paraphernalia.</p>
<p>SCP-5752 has a series of secondary anomalies regarding her perception by both humans and public record. SCP-5752's identifying traits are unable to be plugged into Foundation security programs, meaning that despite SCP-5752's many manifestations, identification via avenues such as facial recognition software, DNA testing, retinal scans, and fingerprint analysis are all rendered useless. SCP-5752's manifestations also fail to trigger Foundation security protocol regarding unauthorized persons, as well as failing to trigger local Kant counters. SCP-5752 also lacks identity, with the scant information gained about her failing to match up with public records of any kind.</p>
<p>SCP-5752 exhudes a passive antimemetic effect that causes humans to almost wholly disregard her, though this effect can be shattered through socially condemnable or publicly disruptive acts, such as being caught stealing or viewed panicking in a calm setting. This passive effect can also be avoided through Class-W mnestics and/or keeping a constant focus on SCP-5752. Despite these weak points, SCP-5752 has been able to surreptitiously navigate through facilities, mostly being identified in the aftermath of key incidents.</p>
<p>SCP-5752 has varied knowledge of the Foundation as well as vague information regarding various anomalies in containment, login information to the SCiPNET database, and a vague understanding of Foundation operations and functions as a whole. How SCP-5752 is privy to this information is currently <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unknown</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">under investigation</span> under study for potential Foundation usage.</p>
<p>Whenever SCP-5752 manifests, she will immediately attempt to find a specific anomaly and will use it to either severely influence, maim, or kill herself. If SCP-5752 interacts with a non-lethal anomaly, she will demanifest after an unspecified amount of time interacting with it<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. If SCP-5752 is killed by an anomaly, her corpse and/or remains will not demanifest, instead losing their antimemetic properties and decaying at an average rate (unless the remains are consumed and/or assimilated by the anomaly in question).</p>
<p>Through behavioral studies, it appears that SCP-5752 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">has a sense of continuous detachment from reality</span> <span style="color: red"><strong>(See Addendums 5752.2 and 5752.3)</strong></span>.</p>

SCP-5752 then made an effort navigating to the locker that held the only contained copy of SCP-1128's description. After attempting to input an a passcode and failing twice, SCP-5752 paused before attempting a final time. Her system override was successful and she attained the description. After quickly reading through it, SCP-5752 placed it back in the locker, closing the door. SCP-5752 can then be seen running through the facility until she discovered a bathroom unit.

As there is no footage or proof of SCP-5752 manifesting in or nearby the local site, Foundation researchers have hypothesized that SCP-5752 created a stable anafabula after accessing SCP-2747's documentation, thus annihilating herself from this reality.

<p><strong>Addendum 5752.2:</strong> Interview</p>
<p>On 2 September 2025, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/adult:scp-835/noredirect/true" target="_blank" target="_blank">SCP-835</a> was seen entering an aggravated state, expelling massive amounts of waste into the surrounding waters. As Provisional Site-835 was undergoing breach protocol, SCP-5752 manifested amongst the chaos and was spotted attempting to hijack a submersible, with her intent likely being to make contact with SCP-835. As the subject was in the process of disengaging the submersible, she was apprehended by several members of MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") before being evacuated from Site-835 with the rest of the site staff. After quarantine and various medical tests, Dr. Maya Saunders was sent to interview SCP-5752, under the monitoring of O5-4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Hello, SCP-5752.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> Y-you have to let me out. You have to get me back to it. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Well, that's it, really. We're here to ask you some questions regarding your interf-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> No, no, NO! You don't understand. I need to go back there, I have to let it grab me, I need to let it rip me to shreds, I <em>need</em> for it to get it over with so I can fucking get back to the surfa-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Well, I know you're in a rush to leave but at the very least I'd like to ask about why you've be-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> No, you really don't get it, I need to get it done <em>right now,</em> if I don't then the more scared I'll be. I need to do it <em>now,</em> like pulling off a band-aid, I have to get it done with so the pain isn't as ba-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> We already know what you do when you get your hands on our artifacts, SCP-5752.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Saunders pulls out a file. She opens it on the table between them and pulls out a series of photographs, laying them all out in front of both her and SCP-5752. They are all photographs of SCP-5752 over the years in various Sites, cordoned-off zones, and containment chambers, with some of the photographs dating back to the late 50s.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Saunders removes her glasses and pinches the bridge of her nose. She sighs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> You know, its taken me years to collect all of this data regarding your appearances. It was genuinely difficult, having such a small team manually scanning through everything just to catch a glimpse of your face in the footage. It didn't help that some of us had to be constantly dosing up on mnestics to try to pin you down in our records.</p>
<p>(<em>Dr. Saunders leans back in her chair, crossing her arms.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> I never actually thought I'd see the day where you'd be sitting in front of me like this. After <em>decades</em> of entering our facilities and taking advantage of breaches and passwords and loopholes in the system… I'm still surprised that you look exactly the same. Haven't aged a day.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5752 is silent for a moment, staring at the photos before her. SCP-5752 then mumbles something under her breath.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> I'm sorry, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> Time… It actually passes for all of you here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Well, yes. Of course it would. How else does time flow?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5752 stares down at the photographs once more.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> I don't know. Dreams aren't supposed to work like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Dreams… Do you believe that you are dreaming, SCP-5752?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> Yes. I am dreaming. None of this is real.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> So you fully believe that you are dreaming up all of this?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-5752:</strong> N-no, I <em>know</em> that I am.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> How are you so sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> If I were dreaming, I would have a sense of control. If this was my dream and my dream alone then I would be able to twist and churn and make it up as I go along. I could give myself superpowers, I could fly, or at the very least I could wake myself up whenever I would like. But this is not my dream. I have no control over any of it. It's very hard to get tangled up in your <em>own dreams,</em> but you can easily get drawn into <em>others'.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> If this were my dream, and my dream alone, then I would be able to just… dream of something else. I wouldn't have to go through the cycle of just starting in a new place before throwing myself into the meat grinder.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> We'd also like to ask you about that - <em>why</em> do you keep hurting yourself like this? Why do you keep throwing yourself at these horrible things?</p>
<p>(<em>There is another long pause.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Is it because you're upset? Is it something we can help with? SCP-5752, if something is wrong you can tell us, we can get you any help you need - we have the resources. You just have to tell us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> I do it because its the only way for me to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> From the dream?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> Yes, exactly, from this whole… this entire <em>thing.</em> It's the usual logic - you're being chased and you wake up before the thing grabs you, you're thrown off a mountain and awaken before you hit the ground. It's exactly the same, and I… it's the only way that they let me go. I have to experience it, as much as I can, and when I do, they let me go.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> You keep alluding to a "they", and I wanted to come back to that topic. You hinted that this is someone else's dream and not your own. Do you <em>know</em> who else's dream this is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5752:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Saunders:</strong> Can you tell me?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5752 does not respond to further prompting.</em>)</p>

<p>After a psychological evaluation, SCP-5752 was placed under intensive care as well as suicide watch due to her volatile behavioral shifts and multiple attempts at self-termination.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5752.3:</strong> Recovered Article</p>
<p>On 29 February 2028, SCP-5752 was found reading a newspaper in her cell. It was quickly confiscated by guards and was transferred to Site-17's research group. When reviewing security footage, SCP-5752 was viewed with her back to the wall, reaching her hand behind her and pulling out the newspaper. When questioned, SCP-5752 denied that this action was voluntary.</p>
<p>The newspaper was labelled "The Kennebec Journal," a January 2022 edition. It showed no abnormalities except for an article on page 17 in a column adjacent to the "Obituary" section. The article depicts a smiling photo of SCP-5752 and reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>YOUNG WOMAN COMATOSE, FAMILY PLEADS FOR ANSWERS</strong></span></tt><br/>
<tt><span style="font-size:smaller;"><strong>by Garrison Blake</strong></span></tt></p>
<p><tt>Neighbors in the town of Dawson, Maine, are still baffled at the circumstances regarding the hospitalization of Ms. Evelyn Creely, with the young woman's family still at a loss for words.</tt></p>
<p><tt>On November 22, 2021, Evelyn was found laying in her bedroom when her mother attempted to wake her up for work. Mrs. Diana Creely was concerned as her daughter was late for her shift at the local nursing home, and she was surprised at how Evelyn apparently slept through the entire morning and early afternoon. After Evelyn didn't respond to her mother's attempts to wake her, emergency services were called to the Creelys' home in order to transport their daughter to St. John's Hospital on the outer edges of Dawson.</tt></p>
<p><tt>When interviewing Mr. Jason Creely, he said that there was still no exact explanation as to why his daughter was unable to awaken.</tt></p>
<p><tt>"The doctors couldn't find a reason for any of it, they're all baffled," he stated. "All they could tell us is that her brain is still working just fine. For all we saw, she's just fast asleep. The nurses kept saying that there aren't any visible abnormalities that could've just sent her under like this."</tt></p>
<p><tt>Evelyn was known to be a quiet yet informative and well-read young woman, with her friends describing her as "driven by stories." Her favorite genres were mystery, horror, and science fiction, with her mother describing how she would spend hours on writing forums, attempting to spin her own tales.</tt></p>
<p><tt>A fundraiser and vigil will be held this upcoming Saturday on the corner of Sackett and Rhyne in order to raise awareness and money to help the Creelys cover their medical bills.</tt></p>

<p>SCP-5752's containment protocol is to be debated in regards to the Swann Protocol during the upcoming Ethics Committee meeting on 15 March 2028.</p>
