<p>SCP-3820 prior to containment.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3820</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3820 is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit. It is to be provided with an adult diet designated for large breed canines twice daily as well as a constant supply of water. The containment unit is also to be decontaminated daily. A Foundation personnel specializing in canine veterinary is to complete a health inspection on SCP-3820 annually.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3820 is a member of <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> that is coated entirely in a material similar in texture and appearance to calcite, but is malleable enough to allow for normal movement. Other than the aforementioned anomalous properties, SCP-3820 vaguely resembles and behaves like a 5-year-old, female Golden Retriever.</p>
<p>Security footage of Site-19’s lobby showed the sudden appearance of a bright, blue-colored flash lasting for approximately one second before subsiding, with SCP-3820 manifesting at the center of the flash. Researchers have yet to determine the exact mechanism of SCP-3820's manifestation, or why it appeared at Site-19.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Log-3820-1:</strong> On 08/08/2017, one month after SCP-3820's manifestation, Site-19 administration staff Harvey Black received a phone call from an unknown Person of Interest concerning SCP-3820. A follow-up investigation has failed to identify or trace the caller, appearing as if the call never transpired.</p>
<p>Below is a transcript of the conversation between the unknown caller and Black:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Black:</strong> Been a long day, so keep it short.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Oh, sorry, sorry! I'll just get straight to business then. Is this, uh… is this Site-19?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> …The hell are you- what’s your ID number?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Sorry, don’t have one. Unlike you, I don’t actually work for the Foundation! I’m just calling you about my dog, Marbs?</p>
<p><em>Black activates a silent emergency alert, designating the call to be a potential Level-3 security breach.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> Okay, hold up, hold up. Before we talk about… ‘Marbs’, how did you get onto this network?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> I got your number from the phone book! It's right between Site-██ and Site-██.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Black receives a directive from Site-19 Security to continue the conversation with the unknown caller and attempt to acquire as much information as possible.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> Right, right. So, who are you, really?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Just Marbs’ parent, of course! And speaking of Marbs, I think she’s registered as number thirty-eight… two-zero in your system?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> Yeah yeah, I think I found her. Our file on ‘Marbs’ is kinda scant, so tell me more about her.</p>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong> Oh, she’s just the sweetest thing ever! A bit stiff, but what sentient canine statue isn't? But I’m sure she’s warmed up to you all already!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> Yeah, totally. Right so, what’s a… ‘sentient canine statue’?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> I’m… not really sure? Statue dogs are just so cool and elegant and- okay, maybe Marbs’s not any of that, but that's what makes her so special! And that's also why I chose Site-19. I heard you guys are really good with sentient statues!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> …Okay. Alright, uh… how did ‘Marbs’ get here?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Wow, you’re really blasting me with the Q and As today, huh? Uh… it’s something to do with [REDACTED], maybe? Oh, I’m so sorry, I-<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> I haven’t got a clue what you’re on about either. I’m just the… well, guess I got demoted to 'receptionist'.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Yeah, I get you, I so get you- oh! Oh, I’m so sorry. You said to keep it short and now look at what I’ve done!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> What? Oh, nah, nah, nah, I got time now-<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> No, that won’t be fair of me. Alright, I just wanna let you guys know that I’m picking up Marbs soon. So, you all better say goodbye to her!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Caller:</strong> Oh, sorry, I should also thank you all at Site-19 for taking such good care of Marbs! And don’t worry, I’ve sorted out payment. Hey, it was fun chatting with you today!<br/>
<br/>
<em>The caller disconnects.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Black:</strong> …Reckon someone needs to go check on SCP-3820.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One minute after the phone call, SCP-3820 underwent a spontaneous disappearance event. Security footage showed the appearance of a bright, blue flash, similar to the manifestation event, lasting approximately one second before subsiding and revealing the disappearance of the subject. Replacing SCP-3820 is exactly one kilogram of [DATA EXPUNGED]. As of the compilation of this incident log, the Foundation’s potential use of [DATA EXPUNGED] is still being debated among the O5 Council.</p>
