<p><span class="bigtext">SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</span> Containment of SCP-6793 has not been deemed feasible. Inherent logistical and practical limitations involved hamper Foundation testing and research efforts.</p>
<p>Proposed containment strategies for SCP-6793 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating permanent overcast weather conditions, either through dynamic rendering of weather patterns over impacted regions or for the entirety of Earth itself</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building an artificial sky around the planet and assuming control of all flight operations on Earth</li>

<li>Building a Dyson sphere around the Sun and harvesting majority of Mercury for use in creating a containment area/separating panel large enough to obscure the view of SCP-6793 from Earth</li>

<li>Utilizing various possible strategies to increase light pollution in the solar system such that observing SCP-6793 is impossible</li>

<p><span class="bigtext">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-6793 is the designation for a one-dimensional tangent that runs at an oblique angle throughout the observable (and presumed entire) universe. This tangent, hypothesized to be an atypical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_string">cosmic string</a>, exists on an angle that briefly intercepts interplanetary space, on the far side of the asteroid belt. SCP-6793 is only visible due to its perceived brightness, although measurements taken imply the anomaly emits no photons, radiation, or energy/particles of any known type and thus lacks luminance altogether.</p>
<p>SCP-6793 is not tangible and cannot be "deactivated"; intersecting portions of the anomaly does not discretely extinguish it. This is presumed homogenous for the entirety of SCP-6793's length but has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>If a living creature's brain intersects with SCP-6793, varying sensory phenomena occurs. This is shown to be dependent on which part of the brain is receiving "stimuli", though experimentation has concluded that optimal results occur when SCP-6793 is intersecting a human subject's temporal and right parietal lobe simultaneously. The anomaly contains information that is conveyed via an unknown medium, despite no outward emission of detectable forces. Experimentation has revealed SCP-6793 is capable of causing atrophy and lesions in certain brain structures due to prolonged exposure and/or application to other parts of the brain, however, no maximum exposure duration or risk factors have been identified.</p>
<p>Occasionally, SCP-6793 will flicker and dim for a variable amount of time. The anomaly will then cease for roughly eight hours and thirty minutes, resuming shortly thereafter.</p>

On 06/02/2037, a preliminary base of operations was established in orbit of Ceres, where SCP-6793's existence came to light. The anomaly's nature was not known until the events of interaction with a small, unmanned probe containing a biomechanical artificially intelligent conscript, Ponyo.aic.
