<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span><br/>
SCP-6658 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Under the supervision of a Level 2 Researcher and a member of Foundation Security, SCP-6658 is permitted to roam and utilize Foundation common areas that are open to Level 1 personnel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-6658 is currently housed at Site-84.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Description:</strong></span><br/>
SCP-6658 is a human male, estimated to be between 210 and 230 years of age. Despite this, the physical appearance and motor functions of SCP-6658 are comparable to that of a 60 year old male. SCP-6658 has the ability to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German.</p>
<p>No other anomalous properties have been observed or detected from SCP-6658.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Addendum 6658-A: Discovery</strong></span><br/>
On 03/25/1992, the Foundation discovered SCP-6658 residing in Madrid, Spain. Local records and documents showed that SCP-6658 had been a recognized living citizen for over 150 years. Foundation administrators deemed this a sufficient disruption of normalcy to have SCP-6658 detained and housed in Site-46<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Subsequently, said records and documents were altered to erase the evidence of the anomaly's prolonged life span and prevent further discrepancies.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Addendum 6658-B: Interviews</strong></span><br/>
The following are interviews that have been conducted with SCP-6658 during its containment. Repetitive and uneventful logs have been omitted for brevity. A full list can be acquired upon request.</p>

<p><strong>Interview #1</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-6658
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Harold Kula</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/28/1992</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following was conducted after initial containment of SCP-6658 at Site-46. SCP-6658 was deemed safe for interview after screening and examination for anomalous abilities. However, as per safety protocol, SCP-6658 and Dr. Kula were separated by a bulletproof glass barrier.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Kula enters the room. SCP-6658 is visibly confused.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Hello, SCP-6658, I am Dr. Kula. I am here to interview you today. Please state your name and age for the record.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> (Pauses) Umm, don't really know why I'm here. Didn't do anything illegal, <em>have I</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Don't worry, SCP-6658, you did not do anything wrong. You are safe here, we assure you. Just state your name and age so we can proceed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Who is this "<em>we</em>," if I might ask?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> (Pauses) Not important. Just know we are part of the government. Now, please state your name and age.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Alright… Name's Jaime Santiago. Age is 216 years old, I suppose? Starting to lose count of these. Pardon another question, but what's up with the <em>SCP-6658</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> That is just protocol; I could address you as Jaime or Santiago if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Jaime would be just fine, dear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> How long were you staying at your current place of residence? Did you travel to other locations recently?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Stayed at that house for the latter part of a hundred years or so. Though, I haven't gone outside that town for about the last 8 or 10 years or so.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> I see, okay. Alright, Jaime, as you stated, you are 216 years of age; any reason why that is? Like an object or event that extended your life span?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hmm, well, I don't think I remember such a <em>thing</em>. This is how it has always been, as far as I can remember, mind you. And I have a decent memory, I suppose, but that fact is debatable. I can still vividly remember them trips in England back in 1840s, roamed around the streets of London. Very fond of the Victorian attire at the time, and the architecture was ma—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> (Interrupting) Okay, Jaime, I have to stop you there. I think we need to get back on track.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh… of course, pardon me, perhaps another time will be more appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Okay. (Pauses) So are you sure you don't have a clue about the cause of your anomalously extended life-span?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hmm, well, err… Not a clue, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Alright, do you know of any other anomalous properties you possess? Like things you can do out of the ordinary?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Nothing else that I know of. (Pauses) Except perhaps my hunger for adventure and exploration. Went to all the six continents back in my time. From Asia to the Americas, went to all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> I see. Alright, well, that concludes our interview for today Jaime.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh… Is that so? Well, till the next time we meet, Kula, enjoyed our talk here.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-6658
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Harold Kula</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/05/1992</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following was conducted to ascertain and confirm additional information from SCP-6658.</p>

<p><em>SCP-6658 appears to be cheerful as Dr. Kula enters.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hello, Kula! Been a while since we've spoke.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Hello, SCP-665—, I-I mean Jaime. Nice to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> I expect more questions for me again, dear?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Yes, we will continue with more questions. It important we know more.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Alright! I'll answer them as best I can, my dear.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Kula takes a seat and produces an envelope from his lab coat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Okay, so here it says you have been living in Madrid for over 150 years. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Close enough, I suppose. I <em>think</em> I was born there, but went on travelling around places and stuff, later on in life. Visiting and staying in other places months to years at a time. But I always felt at home there, so I come back from time to time share my stories and adventures to the people. I remember that one time I rode a boat in… hmm, err… I think South America, was it, and I wa—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> (Interrupting) Sorry again, Jaime, but we need to continue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Ah, alright. (Pauses) What is the next question then my dear?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Do you know any living relatives? Perhaps friends and acquaintances?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hmm, well, not really… Only relatives I know were my parents. They probably died over 120 years ago. Then my wife passed away a-about (pauses) 80 years ago. (Pauses) Don't really think about it that much. Though I am acquaintances with some of the locals back at my place.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Sorry to hear that, Jaime. We can move on if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh, it's alright, my dear; what has happened is already set in stone. No changing the past.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Okay… alright, moving on, any other residences you have, other than the one in Spain?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> I know I had a couple in the USA, UK, and Canada. I also had one in the Philippines and another in Thailand I believe. (Pauses) Yeah, I think that's all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Are these residences still under your ownership?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Not anymore, I think? Been a few decades since I came to any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Okay, do you have any other information you wish to disclose, such as those that may relate to your anomalous ability?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Nothing more, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Alright then, that concludes our interview for today.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Nice chat again, my dear. Looking forward to our next one!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> Unfortunately, this may be our last one. I have also been instructed to inform you that you will be assigned to a different location and researcher.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh… is that so? Well, I enjoyed our little time we have here. Hoping we meet once more dear, somewhere, sometime.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kula:</strong> I hope so too, Jaime.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Kula vacates his seat and moves to the door but is stopped by SCP-6658.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh, and Kula, take some time off your work, whatever it is, and, you know, take a break and see the world once in a while. Looking a little bit stressed, from what I see in your face. A change of place might help with that.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Coroner enters the room and SCP-6658 greets him with a cheerful expression.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hello, doctor! Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Hello, Mr. Jaime Santiago. I am Dr. Gan Coroner, the researcher that is assigned to you. My job is to keep you well and check up on you from time to time. So to begin, might I ask if you are comfortable with your current living arrangements here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh, yes, it is more than enough. A little bit on the sparse side, but it is enough. Also, dear, what name might I call you? Gan, Coroner, or something else? I'll do my best to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Pauses) Dr. Coroner or Gan would be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Alright, Gan! Say, have you met the previous fine gentleman that I talked to a few days ago? Err… Kula, was his name?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yes, we spoke to discuss your transfer a while back. But we must proceed with the interview and briefing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Okay, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Alright, I believe you have already been briefed on the daily routine, protocols, and general guidelines by the security team in your quarters?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Yes, I believe so. A bit on the stricter side than I am used to, but I'll follow them nonetheless, my dear. Say, will there be times where I can go out again? Like, experience the outside? Travel again and the like?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Sorry, Jaime, that will likely not happen, (pauses) at least not anytime soon. You need to be here for your safety. But we will make your stay here hospitable.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh. (Pauses) A-Alright then, looking forward to it nonetheless, Gan.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> To reiterate the briefing of the security team, you can just contact or talk to me if you have questions or need something in particular. Also, please do not deviate from the scheduled times or vacate your room unless you have explicit approval and supervision from me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Don't worry, Gan, I'll see to it that I won't be cause for trouble. Don't wanna stress you out more in this job of yours. I'll be sure to ask for permission always.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Good, good to hear. So how are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Feeling a bit confused, but, hmm… well for the most part. Feels somewhat nice to have a change of pace, even though this is very different. First time to experience things like this or even go to a place like <em>this</em>, whatever this place is. Looking forward to talking with the people folk here, got a couple of stories to tell. Seems like nice people from what I can see.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Okay, seems like you are comfortable here. So that concludes our interview for now, but we will have more bi-yearly interviews like this one. But outside of that, you can talk to me and other approved people during our free hours.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Okay, Gan, Looking forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Alright, that is all for now.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Of course! Outside of our usual talks, I quite look forward to these things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Alrighty then! Let's begin with a good ole, "How are you feeling today?"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Doing great, Gan! Feeling comfortable as usual here. People are still friendly as always.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yeah, as I have heard. It appears you are quite talkative in the cafeteria, like usual.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Yeah, it feels like people like talking to me, and I am happy about that. Quite enjoy those times.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Wonderful. Can you tell me some of the things you told them recently?</p>

<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Yes, my dear, it's one of <em>many</em>. Though I do hope that one day I can take you to such places. I can just imagine the look of your face in awe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Pauses) Well, we can dream, Jaime. But until then, we are here. So, anything else to say or state before we end this session?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Nothing else, Gan. Quite enjoyed our time here. (Pauses) But hey, how's that seminar or event you're going to attend in a few days? Noticed you'll probably be gone at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Not here, Jaime, we can talk about that in another place and time.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Wonderful! Let's start now, shall we, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Alrighty, so how are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh, the usual stuff. (Pauses) Feeling great! Met some of the new faces today, seems to be a friendly bunch. Appears like you just hired some new staff.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Oh, yeah, (yawns) looks like you are getting along with them nicely.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> I sure am! Really eager to talk with me, eager to talk to them as well!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Good, good, appears you are in good shape.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Yes, just like usual. But Gan, it appears you're not so good? Getting enough sleep? Working the late hours on that presentation you told me about? You'll be presenting that, err… a week from now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yeah, that and starting to handle more and more stuff. Been working here for a couple of decades, as you can guess, always more work to be done and more work to <em>do</em>. Though I always did look forward to the little time we can talk with one another; a good break from the monotonous routine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> That just warms my heart, dear. I really like it when someone enjoys my company.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> The streets really do look different from back then, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Indeed, though I haven't gone back in a while, since <em>you know</em>. Sometimes I do miss going out, into the big wide world out there. Been a while since I have seen the majestic night sky. But even though I miss it, I still do enjoy your company.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Pauses) Sorry about that, Jaime, well… that is just how it is. We can talk about that more if you want.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Ah, no need, my dear. I still enjoy being here and talking with you people!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Alright, but are you sure about it? Remember you can always talk to me if needed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> No worries, I am always in high spirits!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Okay, (pauses) well, that concludes our session for today.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Looking forward to next time as always.</p>

A containment breach of SCP-6658 occurred on 12/26/2019. The breach was orchestrated with the assistance of Dr. Gan Coroner. The following is a transcript of events that occurred, documented through the use of the site-wide surveillance system.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>BEGIN LOG</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>19:56</strong> - SCP-6658 is brought into interview room 3 under the orders of Dr. Coroner.</p>
<p><strong>19:58</strong> - Dr. Coroner gains unauthorized access to the nearby armory and acquires a firearm.</p>
<p><strong>22:02</strong> - Dr. Coroner enters interview room 3 and converses with SCP-6658. The conversation is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> That time of year again? A bit la-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Interrupting) Alright, Jaime, I need you to listen very, very carefully, but please don't panic. I need to get you out of here now! Everyone else is out to kill you. Luckily for us, I have devised a plan for you to escape.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Kill me!? B-But why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> I don't know why either, but they sent instructions to all of us and something else with it — but explanations for later, we need to move. Game plan is I pretend to escort you to the termination room but instead of that we go to the exit. What I need you to do is keep quiet and put your head down and play along as we go. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Alright, keep quiet, lay low, got it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Let's move before someone checks the security cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>22:04:</strong> - SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner vacate the room and move to the South Wing of the Site.</p>
<p><strong>22:16:</strong> - SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner are halted by security personnel at hallway S2A. Security personnel question Dr. Coroner and SCP-6658, presumably concerning where they are heading to.</p>
<p><strong>22:21:</strong> - SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner are allowed by security to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>22:30:</strong> - Surveillance staff review the footage from interview room 3 and promptly alert Site security.</p>
<p><strong>22:32:</strong> - A Site-wide alert and lockdown is issued. A mandate is disseminated to terminate SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner on sight.</p>
<p><strong>22:40:</strong> - SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner are seen running away from security as personnel open fire at hallway S3B. Dr. Coroner returns fire at personnel.</p>
<p><strong>22:45:</strong> - Dr. Coroner is able to bypass a security door and gain access to the vehicle bay. Security personnel soon follow; however, the security door was blocked and sabotaged.</p>
<p><strong>22:46:</strong> - Technical personnel attempt to stop Dr. Coroner and SCP-6658 but fail. The individuals hijack a Foundation Humvee and drive outside the Site.</p>
<p><strong>22:55:</strong> - Security personnel are able to bypass the security door and pursue the stolen Foundation Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>23:26:</strong> - Surveillance equipment on the Humvee is remotely activated. Sensors indicate the vehicle to be located at 45km southeast from Site-84. Onboard microphones are able to overhear a conversation between SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner. The conversation is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Well, shit. We got no juice left.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> What're we going to do now, Gan?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> We need to proceed on foot. The original plan did not play out. Fuck. Didn't think that they would check the recording that early. We could have gone by undetected if it weren't for those fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Hey, hey, this is no time to panic, my dear. It wasn't your fault, alright? (Pauses) Guess this is just how it played out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yeah, (pauses) I guess. But now we need to run and ditch the jeep. Closest city from here is about 50 kilometers that way, if I'm right. They probably have all sorts of sensors and trackers on this thing. Hell, they are probably coming to this exact location right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> How long until they get here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> About 20 to 30 minutes tops. So we need to get far enough now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner are overheard leaving the vehicle</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> T-This way, Jaime! We need to hurry! (Sound grows more faint as time progresses)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Wait! (Gasp) I can't run that quick. My—my legs don't work like they use to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Gasp) Alright, I'm back. But Jaime, we need to keep up the pace to outrun them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Gan, I'm telling you I can't run that fast. We can't get that far with my current pace.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> But Jaime! We will die if we stay here. Come on, I know we can do it! I will carry you if I have to, just to keep the both of us alive. Now come on, we ca—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> (Interrupting) Gan! Listen to me! I am telling you that there is no hope of saving me. I'm old, I've lived for long enough, probably longer than everyone else. But you, my dear, (pauses) you still got some of your years to spend. N-Now go on and leave me be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> B-but Jaime, I mu—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> No buts about it, you won't change my mind. I will stay put here and you will go. That is it. (Pauses) But before you go, can you grant this old man's last wish?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> B-but wh- (Pauses) (Sighs) Sure, Jaime, anything in the world!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Don't worry, it'll only take 5 minutes; should give you enough time to escape. Well, seeing as this probably one of my last nights here in this world, would you care to join me to gaze at the stars one last time?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Crying) Of course, Jaime. I will be here with you for as long as you want.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Wonderful. Now come on now, let's sit together on that rock.</p>
<p><em>1 minute of silence fills the scene.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Say, Gan, you ever got in touch again with that Kula fella a while back? You know, the one that interviewed me those decades a while back?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yeah, Dr. Kula, we haven't got in contact with one another for a good couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> I see. I guess that's just how it is. (Pauses) Y'know, he was a good lad; a bunch of you people are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> Yeah, maybe they were. Well, I guess they're probably <em>different</em> now, probably because of that file or something else. Hell, I don't even know or recognize what that file was.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Oh, is that so? (Pause) Quite sad to hear about that. Still think about them from time to time.</p>
<p><em>2 minutes of silence fills the scene.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> I really do guess dreams come true. I finally got to the night sky again, the stars are out and the moon is bright, and with all the people to be with, it's <em>you</em>. You know, I never really considered how I'll die. Always thought that it'd have to be some sort of accident or something (chuckles). But hey, right now, you're here with me, and I am grateful for that, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Crying) Y-You know, when I said I-I looked forward to our talks, I really meant that. You were always that type of person to cheer people up. Even when the paperwork and projects piled up, you were like a breath of fresh air to me. I will dearly, <em>dearly</em>, miss those times and your wonderful stories. And I (pauses) I-I am sincerely sorry for keeping you locked up in there when you could have been out here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> No need to apologize, Gan, you and your friends made my stay there very enjoyable. I always looked at the bright side. It warms my heart that my stories and conversations can comfort you. But Gan, I'm afraid our time is cut short. You need to go now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Coroner:</strong> (Pauses) Alright, Jaime. J-Just know I will never forget you and what you did and meant for me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6658:</strong> Thanks for being with me, my dear. Now, it's time for goodbye.</p>
<p><em>Footsteps are heard moving away from the vehicle.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>23:49:</strong> Security personnel are heard on the scene. A gunshot is audible, presumably the termination of SCP-6658.</p>
<p><strong>24:05:</strong> Security personnel return to Site-84 with the corpse of SCP-6658.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>END LOG</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Foundation scouts continued to survey the area where SCP-6658 was terminated to locate Dr. Coroner. As of writing, Dr. Coroner's whereabouts are unknown to the Foundation. Furthermore, it is currently being speculated if Dr. Coroner may possess some (as of now, currently unknown) type of memetic hazard resistance.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span><br/>
No containment procedures are required for SCP-6658 as it is effectively neutralized. However, a copy of the previous iteration of this document is available upon request.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Description:</strong></span><br/>
SCP-6658 was a human male, estimated to be between 210 and 230 years of age. Despite this, the physical appearance and motor functions of SCP-6658 were comparable to that of a 60 year old male. Furthermore, SCP-6658 had the ability to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. No other anomalous properties were observed or detected from SCP-6658.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong>Addendum 6658-A: Neutralization</strong></span><br/>
A containment breach of SCP-6658 occurred on 12/26/2019. The breach was orchestrated with the assistance of Dr. Gan Coroner. In response, security personnel were dispatched to neutralize SCP-6658 and Dr. Coroner. Only SCP-6658 has successfully been neutralized. The whereabouts of Dr. Coroner are not known as of writing.</p>
