            <h1>SCP-3382</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3382</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Mobile Task Force Delta-66 ("Poster Boys") are to monitor highways in the state of Arkansas for SCP-3382-A appearances. Instances are to be relocated to containment at Site-64. Testing has revealed SCP-3382-A instance are non-anomalous in nature, and personnel are authorised to disassemble and repurpose material in the interest of storage. Foundation webcrawler DjinnSpotter is to monitor social media and forums for mention of the name or number featured on SCP-3382-A instances, and flagged posts are to be deleted with class-A amnestics administered to all involved individuals. Information warning against make-a-wish scams is to be disseminated throughout Arkansas in order to discourage civilian interaction with uncontained SCP-3382-A instances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3382 refers to the anomalous appearance of billboards across the North American state of Arkansas, designated SCP-3382-A, featuring advertisements for a phone hotline titled "Ill wishes".</p>
<p>SCP-3382-A instances feature the name of the charity as well as a phone number<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and the slogan "Dreams fulfilled for the terminally ill". Frequency of SCP-3382-A appearances correspond with the proximity to the center of the state, with manifestations occurring at least once every 14 days within a 10km radius. Local city council members do not recall authorising the construction of suspect billboards and cannot recall how long they have been present.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 10 who dial the number on SCP-3382-A are greeted by a female voice<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, designated SCP-3382-B, and asked for their wish. Subjects who have already made a wish, or subjects over the age of 10, will instead be alerted that the number is disconnected. Once a wish has been made SCP-3382-B will wish subjects a nice day and the call will end, with the specifics of the wish actualising within seven days<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3382/A.1: Test Log</strong><br/>
Wishes made and observed under Foundation testing are documented below. All subjects were administered class-A amnestics upon conclusion of testing.</p>

<td style="border: 1px solid silver">7 year old male, diagnosed with Osteogenesis imperfecta.</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid silver">"I really want the Golden State Warriors to win this year"</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid silver">All media, including season records, team standings, video footage, and human memories of games during the 2017 NBA season, reflect a victory by the Golden State Warriors.</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid silver">
<p>Subject confused when introduced to season records, claiming Miami Heat had won. Further questioning revealed almost all game results throughout the season did not match subject's memory.</p>
<p><em>"A 7 year old kid just caused a minor CK-level event because his team didn't win. All it would take is an innocent wish for someone's grandfather to still be alive and the entire world as we know it could change.
