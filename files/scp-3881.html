<p>SCP-3881</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3881</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3881 is to be kept within a standard containment locker. No further containment procedures are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3881 is a classic gold band style wedding ring with a few cosmetic alterations. When worn by a human being, SCP-3881 will immediately transport the wearer to an unknown location. Upon removal, the ring and the wearer will be returned to their previous position.</p>
<p>The location is a clearing in a forest containing a single thatched-roof house. The house is fully furnished, well maintained and shows signs of prior use. Clothing within the house presumably belonged to an adult male, shoe-size 10, with approximately five years of disuse.</p>
<p>SCP-3881 was discovered within a pawn shop, being pawned by a Miss Pamela Smith.</p>

<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Miss Pamela Smith
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher ████</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> For the record, name and occupation.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> Pamela Smith, unemployed.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> Excellent, thank you. Would you mind answering a few questions about a ring you received?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> I'd… rather not, if that's OK. It's not a topic I like to discuss.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> Miss Smith, this ring is essential to our investigation.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> Investigation? Howard's legally dead, what reason could you <em>possibly</em> have for an investigation?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Miss Smith furrows her brow and stares at Researcher ████. Her tone has risen slightly.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> Miss Smith, I think we may be on the wrong page. Did you ever wear the ring?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> What kind of a question is that? Of course I didn't. I couldn't even look at the thing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Miss Smith relaxes in her chair.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> I'm sorry. It's just… too much, you know? I miss him. I know it's stupid and emotional to get attached to a ring.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> That's not true at all. We're all human. Is that why you pawned the ring?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> I just… always knew that it was in the house. It nagged at me. I couldn't move on while it was around, like he was waiting for me. Does that make any sense? It doesn't help that he sent me that sappy letter, either.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> A letter?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Smith:</strong> I'll go get it if it'll help you in… whatever you're doing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
████<strong>:</strong> That would be appreciated, thank you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>

<p><strong>Addendum B:</strong> A transcription of the letter given to The Foundation by Pamela Smith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Pam,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I'm writing this to you because I failed. I'm on the run. I can't go into detail, but I needed to give this to you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I'm also writing this because you've been incredible. I've had so much fun falling in love with you. I remember our first date, out on the hill where we got lost in each other's eyes. I remember the long walks where we would worry about what colour plates to buy. I remember the petty fights where we got mad about where to put the furniture, or what we would call our kids. I wouldn't trade these things for anything else in the whole world.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I've worked hard for the ring within this envelope. Please, wear it. That way, we'll be together no matter how far apart we are.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Will you marry a dead man?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
With love,<br/>
<a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/givingup">Howard.</a></p>
