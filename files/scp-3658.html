            <h1>SCP-3658</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3658</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-3658 cannot be contained as it exists in a non-physical dimension. No physical projections of SCP-3658 have been discovered.</span></p>
<p>SCP-3658-1 is to be contained inside a glass capsule that has a radius of 1 cm, and a height of 6 cm. The walls of the glass capsule are 5 mm thick to lessen the chances of Quantum Tunneling.</p>
<p>Attached to the outside of the glass capsule is an apparatus that produces an axial magnetic field, and a quadrupole electric field. This apparatus forms a Penning trap to prevent SCP-3658-1 from making contact with the walls of the capsule and keep it suspended in the middle.</p>
<p>Another apparatus is placed 12 cm away from the middle of the glass capsule. This apparatus measures SCP-3658-1’s magnetic field direction and electric charge which effectively collapses SCP-3658-1’s wave function.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-3658 is believed to be an extradimensional entity that can freely move through time. It is currently up to debate whether SCP-3658 is an entity who originated in the temporal dimension, or is an entity who was put in the temporal dimension by an external force/being.</span></p>
<p>SCP-3658 is an extradimensional entity that exists in the temporal dimension. SCP-3658 manifests itself onto the physical dimension as a subatomic particle with roughly the size of a proton. This physical manifestation is called SCP-3658-1.</p>
<p>SCP-3658-1 share some intrinsic properties with quantum particles, and might disappear when not under observation (Quantum Tunneling). After disappearing, SCP-3658-1 would instantaneously reappear somewhere in a 4 AU (598,400,000 km) radius from where it disappeared. This would suggest that SCP-3658-1 is capable of faster-than-light travel.</p>
<p>SCP-3658-1 also has the ability to generate radio signals with specific frequencies, amplitudes, and interval patterns. SCP-3658-1 uses this ability to send radio transmissions in an attempt of communicating.</p>
<p>Communication with SCP-3658 began with the Wow! Signal that was picked up by the ███ ███ █████ Telescope on August 15, 1977. Further communication with SCP-3658 requires the sender to follow specific directions given by SCP-3658 him/herself.</p>
<p>SCP-3658 seems to be highly intelligent as it encodes its transmissions in Binary, Morse code, etc.<br/>
SCP-3658 also changes its transmission location after every message to minimize the chances of someone else picking it up. Specific coordinates on where the next transmission will be sent from is indicated at the end of the previous message along with the type of message encryption.</p>
<p>The first coherent message sent by SCP-3658 was received by the ███ ███ █████ Telescope two (2) minutes after it received the Wow! Signal. SCP-3658 communicated by sending an 8-minute long radio outburst patterned in Morse code with the signals of intensity 9 corresponding to a "dot", intensity E corresponding to a "dash", and intensity 5 corresponding to a "space". When translated back to English, the message spells out “Alcor Mizar”, which pertains to two stars located in the constellation Ursa Major. This transmission is known as "Transmission #0" and is the first of 89 known transmissions sent by SCP-3658.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> After Dr. █████ █████’s discovery of both the Wow! and Alcor Mizar signals, he immediately informed the ████ Institute, which has been a long-time partner of the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p>Dr. █████ █████'s colleague, Elijah ██████, was asked to be a full-time member of the SCP Foundation in order to conduct further research on SCP-3658.</p>
<p>Elijah ██████ was given access to the ████████ Telescope owned by the SCP Foundation, which acts both as a radio transmitter, and a radio receiver. Unlike the ███ ███ █████ Telescope which only received radio signals in 12-second intervals, the ████████ Telescope can receive radio signals in 1-second intervals. The ████████ Telescope was pointed towards the direction of the Alcor-Mizar star system starting on August 19, 1977.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>The ████████ Telescope has observed total radio silence in the vicinity of the Alcor-Mizar star system two (2) days prior to the received radio transmission. This was extremely unusual since there should be some kind of background noise anywhere in the universe. This suggests that this was done by SCP-3658 to minimize errors in receiving the radio transmission.</p>
<p>The message below is a translated version of the radio transmission received from the Alcor-Mizar star system. The original radio transmission was encoded in binary wherein a one (1) second long radio signal with an intensity of 5 corresponds to a "1", while a one (1) second long radio signal with an intensity of 2 corresponds to a "0".</p>
<p>The following message was decoded one line at a time once it was received but decoding stopped after the fourth (4th) line.</p>

<p>Communication with radio signals between the Foundation and SCP-3658 continued even after SCP-3658-1's capture.

<p>On February 27, 1991, six years after SCP-3658-1's capture, Dr. Van Yu attempted to communicate with SCP-3658 to ask about its origin. SCP-3658 noncompliance would result in its termination using the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p>Dr. Van Yu and SCP-3658 communicated with each other using radio signals in the 1420 MHz frequency (Hydrogen Line) to prevent any radio interference. SCP-3658's responses were in real-time.</p>
<p>The transcript below is only an excerpt. The entire conversation between Dr. Van Yu and SCP-3658 remains undisclosed. Only Dr. Van Yu himself has the transcript of the entire conversation</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> Can you tell me exactly what you are.<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> I am the collective consciousness of seven incredibly bright individuals that is now trapped in the temporal dimension.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> What do you mean.<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> I was the result of a time travel accident on the year [REDACTED]. The accident caused our minds to separate from our physical bodies.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> So you existed in our physical dimension before? Which planet did you come from?<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> Earth.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> You are human?<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> Was human, until the accident.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> Can you tell me what happened in the accident.<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> The spaceship ████████ had one destination, the future. There were 7 crew members on board named: [REDACTED]. Three minutes into the mission, the ████ █████████ malfunctioned causing a miniature black hole to form in the middle of the spaceship. The black hole caused our entire spaceship to collapse and compress into a subatomic particle as small as a proton. This subatomic particle is in front of you right now. As for our minds, we still don't know what happened but our minds somehow merged during the accident. This collective conscience no longer exists in your physical dimension, but now resides in the temporal dimension. Time for us is now "physical". What we see is an infinite hallway with rooms representing each single moment in the universe. We use our physical counterpart to help relay our knowledge onto you, so that humanity can survive.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> Why do you want humanity to survive that much?<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> Because humanity failing to create a time machine means that I would cease to exist.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> But aren't you proof that humanity would still create a time machine regardless of any outside intervention?<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> In our timeline, they helped us survive so that we would succeed in making the time machine.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> Who are "they"?<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> Human time travelers from another timeline.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Van Yu:</strong> A predestination paradox.<br/>
<strong>SCP-3658:</strong> Exactly.</p>
