<p><strong>Description:</strong> ACO-7798 is a meteor belt. ACO-7798 is believed to have formerly been a planet class object, which disintegrated into its current state through natural means<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-738491-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-738491-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Traversal to/through ACO-7798 is not advised due to high meteor belt density, abundance of alternative routes, and low importance. Extraction of natural resources have been set as a low priority due to the value of present resources and isolation from existing Galactic infrastructure.</p>
<p>Artificial resources should be studied, not salvaged. Archeological study of ACO-7798 is deemed low priority, due to its low importance in Galactic history and low chance for new technological insight.</p>
<p>Artifact composition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural ruins (Dwellings, workplaces, gathering places, etc.)- 98.2%</li>
<li>Other relics (Tools, furniture, etc.) - 1.6%</li>
<li>Information cache relics (Written records, storage servers, story-telling monuments, etc.) - 0.2%</li>
</ul>
<p>Microscopic, cellular life is present. Proof of macroscopic and intelligent life has also been found. Presumed extinct.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Information:</strong> ACO-7798 relics consists mainly of structural ruins made up of an artificial stone like material. Day-to-day use relics are mostly made up of processed metals and plastics. Informational caches on ACO-7798 are unusually rare. Initial investigation has shown that all surviving information caches were constructed by a single organization.</p>
<p>ACO-7798 was host to a wide variety of species and biospheres. The dominant intelligent species, classified Species ACO-7798-1, was present on all land environments. They called themselves Homo Sapiens, or Humans. They called their planet Earth. The disintegration of the planet into an asteroid belt is believed to driven the biosphere into its current form. Of note, biological remains of Humans are unusually rare.</p>
<p><strong>ACO-7798 Unorganized Information:</strong> The following are files have been identified by AI as pertaining to ACO-7798, but have been flagged (by AI) for intelligent organization due to potential for deeper insight into ACO-7798 if organized by Intelligent beings.</p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation Webcrawlers are to monitor the internet for mentions of potential instances of SCP-7798-1. If a potential instance is found, a team will be dispatched to confirm it's validity. If valid, then it will be confiscated and replaced with a non-anomalous object modified to resemble the replaced instance. SCP-7798-1 instances are to be identified by Hume levels slightly below baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7798 is an info-anomaly that affects the branding of certain commercial products, hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. Snippets of information will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, the text identifying UpMart as the distributor of Studywise notebooks will disappear, and no traces of ink will remain. To date, only small, typically ignored texts will disappear.</p>
<p>SCP-7798 was identified when the personnel of Storage Site-459 noticed a similarity in a few of their <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items">Anomalous Items</a>. These items, now known as SCP-7798-1 objects, exhibited Hume levels slightly below Site-459's baseline. This, combined with the similarity of their anomaly, warranted the classification of SCP-7798 on 2024/4/16.</p>

If a potential instance is found, a team will be dispatched to confirm its validity. If valid, then it will be confiscated and replaced with a non-anomalous object modified to resemble the replaced instance. SCP-7798-1 instances are to be identified by Hume levels slightly below baseline. <span style="color: cyan">If replacement of object is not feasible within a $30 price range, amnestics are to be applied to persons who have knowledge of the SCP-7798-1 instance's change.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7798 is an info-anomaly that affects <span style="color: cyan">all physically and digitally stored information (for example, on books or storage servers.)</span>, hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. <span style="color: cyan">Noticeable amounts</span> of information will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, <span style="color: cyan">whole pages of information in books will be lost, resulting in a blank page</span>, and no traces of ink will remain.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-7798.1:</strong> SCP-7798 was identified when the personnel of Storage Site-459 noticed a similarity in a few of their <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items">Anomalous Items</a>. These items, now known as SCP-7798-1 objects, exhibited Hume levels slightly below Site-459's baseline. This, combined with the similarity of their anomaly, warranted the classification of SCP-7798 on 2024/4/16.</p>
<p><span style="color: cyan">Currently, the primary way of mitigating SCP-7798 from affecting Foundation Documents is storing them within DEEPWELL facilities. However, the cost of doing this with every Foundation document would be incredibly large. Research and development is ongoing in order to reduce costs of maintaining and expanding DEEPWELL facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: cyan">At the time of discovery, SCP-7798 only affected mostly-ignored texts. However, the amount of information being lost with each discovered instance has grown linearly. As of 2038/7/9, the Foundation estimates a full IT-class "███ ██ ███████████" Scenario by the 2600s if current technology stagnates.</span></p>

<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The discovery of SCP-7798-2 shall be suppressed in all public circles. Research is to be directed towards neutralizing the effects of SCP-7798-2.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7798-2 is a celestial object approximately 1.6x larger than the sun, located 328 light years away from Earth. Noospheric imaging indicates that the information lost from SCP-7798-1 instances go towards SCP-7798-2 at a faster-than-noospheric-light speed.</p>
<p>Information lost as a result of SCP-7798 is always related to humanity in some fashion, whether it describes a man-made object or describes people/personified objects in a narrative. SCP-7798 also never affects information pertaining to natural phenomena. Due to these facts, SCP-7798 is theorized to be hostile to specifically human information and/or life.</p>
<p>SCP-7798-2 seems to travel faster than light. SCP-7798-2 will enter the solar system in 2140s.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure constant and varied interaction with other people</li>
<li>Commit as many things as possible to mnemonic devices.</li>
<li>Join local recitation groups</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to help in combating SCP-7798 and SCP-7798-2, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not spread unfounded conspiracy theories about SCP-7798 and SCP-7798-2</li>
<li>Do not join any organizations declared enemies of the Foundation</li>
<li>If you live in Foundation jurisdiction, do not commit any acts of sabotage</li>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7798 is an info-anomaly that affects all <span style="color: cyan">information, be it physical digital or memorized. All items affected will</span> hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. Noticeable amounts of <span style="color: cyan">data</span> will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, <span style="color: cyan">books are rendered blank,</span> and no traces of ink will remain.</p>
<p><span style="color: cyan">Human memory is affected by SCP-7798, which can be tracked by recording brain activity. Severity ranges from slight forgetfulness to full brain death. The conditions gets worse with time. There are no recorded instances of recovery.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-7798.1:</strong> Currently, the primary way of mitigating SCP-7798 from affecting <span style="color: cyan">digital information</span> is storing them within DEEPWELL facilities. However, the cost of doing this with every <span style="color: cyan">document known to humanity is</span> incredibly large.</p>
<p>At the time of discovery, SCP-7798 only affected mostly-ignored texts. However, the amount of information being lost with each discovered instance has grown <span style="color: cyan">exponentially</span>. As of 2063/2/2, the Foundation estimates a full IT-class <span style="color: cyan">"End of Information"</span> Scenario by the <span style="color: cyan">2078/4/5, and full ED-K Mass Lethe Scenario encompassing all of human conciousness</span> if <span style="color: cyan">no countermeasure is found.</span></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ACO-77B8-PF was a celestial planetary megafauna that has since perished. It measures 3.8 astronomical units and exhibits a gravitational pull value of 5.8. Superficially, it resembles a black hole.</p>
<p>When it was alive, ACO-77B8-PF was a major hazard. The creature traveled beyond light speed, making its appearance rapid and disruptive if not tracked. In addition, it derived its nutrition through siphoning intelligent information. Evacuation efforts, as well as leaving enough junk information to satisfy it, was very costly.</p>
<p>On Cycle 4118, Orbit 678, Division 76<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-738491-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-738491-6')">6</a></sup> ACO-77B8-PF was found dead after a period of stagnancy raised suspicion. Cause of death was found to be complete cessation of KGT Process, rendering ACO-77B8-PF to reveal its true form as a rocky planet. A glyph was etched onto the surface of ACO-77B8-PF when it was found dead.</p>
