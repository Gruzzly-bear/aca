<p>Foundation personnel are to monitor meteorological forecasts and immediately report any occurrence of unusual cloud formation during the month of January.</p>
<p>When an instance of SCP-3921-φ is reported, the designated Mobile Task Force will respond to the region that is to be impacted. Drones with infrared capabilities are to scan the area and aerially disperse sleep-inducing compounds due to the need for swift evacuation of the surrounding area. Foundation personnel will then procure the residents and place them in a secure location. After the conclusion of the event, residents will be given amnestics and a cover story of a carbon monoxide leak will be used as a pretense.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, foundation personnel will dissipate bromomethane to terminate all insects, rodents, and fungi in the area. Sulfometuron methyl will be used to terminate trees and vegetation in the area. The termination of all life-forms in the area instead of standard relocation (as used in Turquoise-Level Events) is due to the rapid onset of the event and the particular danger of this event's mutagenic properties. At the conclusion of the Verdant-Level Event, all vegetation shall be replanted and appropriate animals and insects relocated to repopulate the area.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3921 is a set of eight incomplete stone carved murals located in the main altar room of the Tower of Winds monument located in Athens, Greece. The tower has one main, octagonal room that is approximately fifteen meters in diameter.</p>
<p>Every wall of the room has an elaborate mural depicting the Greek gods of wind, each of whom were assigned a cardinal direction to govern over. The group of eight deities as a whole are commonly known as the "Anemoi." Each mural’s center consists of a block that is jutted out of the rest of the mural’s image, marking the image as incomplete.</p>
<p>Each block contains a pictographic image of a weather related event that is associated with its respective god. All the blocks contain an aperture within which a specific key needs to be placed in order for it to be pushed into the mural, thus completing the image. The keys will from now be known as SCP-3921-1.</p>

<strong>Notes regarding Key:</strong> Currently missing. Key had first appeared when POI-7543 entered the Tower of Winds disguised as a tourist. POI-7543 then successfully broke the containment barrier surrounding the Apeliotes mural. Foundation personnel successfully terminated POI-7543, however, the moment the blood of POI-7453 contacted the key, an exact copy of POI-7453 started to emerge from the head of the key. This copy then successfully activated the Apeliotes mural, which initiated the Verdant-Level Event. During the subsequent earthquake, the copy of POI-7453 escaped with the key. According to the after-report, the key appeared “fleshy” and was “pulsating” as POI-7543 held it.</p>

<p>Kant sensor array imaging has revealed that the internal structure of both the mural and pushing stone is controlled by a single large Antikythera mechanism. Noticeably, the mechanism is many times more complex than any other known mechanism of the same kind, containing hundreds of interlocking bronze gears and copper cogs.</p>

<p>When a block is pushed in completely the now fully finished mural will intensely glow for approximately 30 seconds while an minor earthquake of magnitude 2.5 will occur. A block is only able to be pushed into the mural if it is unlocked with a corresponding key. As of 20██, three of the nine murals have been completed.</p>
<p>After the earthquake, an anomalous weather or atmospheric event will manifest. These phenomenon will occur in a designated time period that is fixed for each separate occurrence.</p>
<p>Foundation anthropologists and symbologists are assigned to study the images depicted on the murals and blocks, as they seem to imply what their particular anomalous weather event will occur when their murals are completed. The atmospheric events as a whole have been anointed the name Eos-type events.</p>

<h2 id="toc0"><span><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Turquoise-Level Event</strong></span></span></h2>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">A Turquoise-Level Event is a recurrent snow storm that occurs semi-annually during the weeks of the winter and summer solstice. The anomalous snowstorm is best indicated by the gathering of cumulonimbus clouds moving abnormally quickly towards a centralized location, usually a populated or residential area.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The snowstorm will usually emerge during midday and the onset of snow will usually take two days after the first signs of the event’s occurrence. From this point onwards the snowstorm will be referred to as SCP-3921-α.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">SCP-3921-α will usually last for approximately 90 to ████ minutes during which time the precipitating snow will be gray or black in color and the snow-bearing clouds will change from a normal white coloration to a maroon hue with the onset of the storm. The clouds will from now be known as SCP-3921-ω.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The moment that a large mammal or human comes into skin contact with any of the snow generated by SCP-3921-ω they will be classified as SCP-3921-λ. SCP-3921-λ instances will then scan their surrounding area and attempt to cover themselves completely with any snow generated by SCP-3921-ω.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">If the SCP-3921-λ instance is successful in completely covering its body and face it will raise its hands in a cupped formation and gradually start to break apart into minuscule segments, while floating upwards towards SCP-3921-ω and will, eventually, be assimilated into SCP-3921-ω.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">At the end of SCP-3921-α, all gray and dark-colored snow will alter back to its original white tint and become non-anomalous. As well, all SCP-3921-ω instances will also change back to a white coloration and become non-anomalous.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Testing of SCP-3921-α has revealed that the duration of SCP-3921-α is directly proportional to the mass of SCP-3921-λ instances assimilated into SCP-3921-ω instances, thus showing that SCP-3921-λ acts as a "fuel" for SCP-3921-α.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The base duration with zero SCP-3921-λ instances subsumed has been determined to be 90 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Mobile Task Force Xi-11 ("Frost-Freaks") are assigned to capture any SCP-3921-λ instances that remain after SCP-3921-α, especially wildlife, in the case that some instances do not become incorporated into SCP-3921-ω. Occasionally, witnesses of SCP-3921-α will recall that SCP-3921-ω will be escorted by a humanoid wearing a maroon colored cloak.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">An Amber-Level Event is a high-speed derecho which will from now be referred to as SCP-3921-ξ. A derecho is a widespread, straight-line wind storm with a length of 400 to 700 kilometers. Wind speeds of derechos reach nearly 210 km/h and are known for their particular ability to be able to topple large swathes of forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">SCP-3921-ξ occurs annually on the 11th of February. Areas affected by SCP-3921-ξ will seem to develop a red tint as the Amber event rains down non-anomalous red dust to areas it impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Humans who view the windstorm caused by SCP-3921-ξ develop an intense urge to celebrate the ancient Greek holiday of <em>Anthesteria</em>, which occurs on the same day as instances of SCP-3921-ξ. Humans who are impacted will celebrate in the outdoors and common activites shown by those effected are to drink copious amounts of alcohol and dance traditional Greek dances such as the sirtaki and kalamatianos.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">SCP-3921-ξ exists for approximately 24 hours and during that time all humans who are influenced will force those unaffected to stare at SCP-3921-ξ as it passes by. SCP-3921-ξ also possesses an anti-memetic property, causing affected individuals to have no memory of their actions during the event and will continue as they were before the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Along with this, all structural and environmental damage caused by the wind speeds will be reversed by the end of the event. Foundation drone imaging have discovered that at the head of the derecho is a humanoid sitting on a cloud playing a lyre. Due to extreme wind speeds, the drone was not able to approach further.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">A Verdant-Level event is a gaseous vortex that occurs during the month of January. The vortex will now be further referred to as SCP-3921-φ. The occurrence of the SCP-3921-φ is confirmed by the formation of unnatural cloud coverage over a populated area, most commonly in the shape hollow semi-dome. SCP-3921-φ has been known, however, to encompass entire areas in a complete wind dome.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Wind speeds during the vortex will usually range 150-200 km/h. However, this only occurs on the outer dome of the windstorm allowing the interior of the storm to be unaffected by the wind. This, effectively, makes entrance to the area impossible due to the wind speed and at the same time contains all entities inside SCP-3921-φ till its conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">The vortex will begin formation from 12 am to 6 am and its anomalous effects will materialize during the peak of the windstorm which normally occurs during noon. The cyclone will, therefore, last approximately six hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">During this time, the interior of SCP-3921-φ will start to emanate an anomalous viridescent vapor which has the effect of exponentially increasing cellular growth in organic entities and altering DNA structure in such a way that adaptations involving combat ability and mobility are proliferated. The vapor will now be referred to as SCP-3921-β.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Non-mobile organic organisms in the kingdoms of Plantae or Protista will become both mobile and consciously responsive of their environment as their elementary DNA is altered by SCP-3921-β. Along with this, organisms in these two kingdoms will be affected by SCP-3921-β by direct contact unlike organisms in the kingdom Animalia who are only impacted if SCP-3921-β is inhaled. The mutated organisms will from now be known as SCP-3921-ζ.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">SCP-3921-ζ instances are known to consolidate into one entity, sometimes reaching to approximately 50 to 100 meters in height. This is, especially, common if SCP-3921-φ impacts areas with considerable forests or vegetation wherein huge conglomerates of SCP-3921-ζ instances will be amalgamated into one prodigious entity. When humans or any other species in the kingdom Animalia inhale SCP-3921-β they will immediately fall unconscious. SCP-3921-ζ instances from this kingdom will remain dormant until the end of SCP-3921-φ.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">After six hours, SCP-3921-φ will dissipate and SCP-3921-ζ instances are free to leave the area. Some SCP-3921-ζ have been known to be able to emit SCP-3921-β, thus, spreading the anomalous effects of SCP-3921-φ.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff">MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") are assigned to the Northern Hemisphere and MTF Theta-4 ("Gardeners") are assigned to the Southern Hemisphere to terminate SCP-3921-ζ instances in the case that the containment procedures fail at terminating life-forms that are affected by SCP-3921-φ. Both MTF teams are required due to the rapid onset of SCP-3921-φ and its capability to occur in nearly any location.</span></p>

<p>In classical literature such as Hesiod's “<em>Theogony</em>,” the "Anemoi" were commanded by Aeolus who is described as, "the keeper of winds." Despite Aeolus's importance in regards to the "Anemoi," there are no murals depicting him in the tower. However, located on the capstone of the tower is a block with the words "αέρας αλλαγής"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> which is the epithet attached to legends of Aeolus.</p>
<p>The block is protruding from the apogee of the tower and has no corresponding mural, rather only an image, similar to all other blocks. Additionally, these words are encompassed by a wind rose. The spokes of the wind rose become illuminated permanently when the corresponding murals located in the tower are activated since each mural is ascribed certain cardinal points.</p>
<p>The block located on the apex of the tower, corresponding to Aeolus, has no analogous keyhole and analysis of the interconnecting lock mechanisms of the tower has shown that it can only be activated when all other murals have been activated.</p>
