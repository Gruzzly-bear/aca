<p>SCP-8848-A coiled circularly.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8848</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The original piece of SCP-8848 is to be kept within a standard storage unit for low-risk anomalous items with an electromagnetic-proof shield.</p>
<p>Replicating SCP-8848 must obtain approval from the research team in advance. All replicas and resultant products must be explicitly documented.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8848 is a pair of induction coils (interchangeably designated -A and -B) that are identical in shape, weight, and all other physical properties, and both of them are achiral.</p>
<p>SCP-8848-A and -B can both function normally and exhibit qualities like common electromagnets and induction coils, which can electrify other charged bodies by inducing electromotive force in their circuits within their fields of magnetic influence.</p>
<p>However, when the distance between SCP-8848-A and -B draws farther, their mutual induction effect always perpetuates, and seems to be everlasting regardless of the distance. The intertwinement also cannot be disrupted by common means of electromagnetic screening, such as metal containers and webs. The induction effect between -A and -B is instantaneous, which means, unlike common coil pairs in transformers, the current (and voltage) in -A and -B unconditionally run in sync, which makes them transcend the principle of locality<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Logs:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> SCP-8848-A was transported to Site-CN-34, 126██ km in direct distance across the Earth from SCP-8848-B. It was then put into a reinforced containment unit with a telepathic shielding alloy lining inside a Faraday cage. A versatile weak current generator was applied to SCP-8848-A; a multimeter was connected to SCP-8848-B.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Either on direct currents (DC) or alternating currents (AC), the readings on the multimeter remained in immediate sync with the current generator's configuration. It is assumed that SCP-8848 works regardless of the shielding methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> During an outer space expedition, it was requested that SCP-8848-B be taken to at least outside the Karman line<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, while SCP-8848-A remained on Earth, in order to test their ability to surpass an extreme distance and withstand the electromagnetic distortion from the ionosphere and space radiations.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The spaceship went beyond the Moon after 7 days. A radio modulator once used to generate electric currents from audio input was connected to SCP-8848-B, and the expedition team used it to speak to the ground control center.</p>
<p>The conversation is transcribed below, with all impertinent information removed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Squadron:</strong> Here it is. Here it is. You can just leave the wave filter alone. We don't need it for now. <em>(volume up)</em> Command, can you hear us?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Yes, we can hear you. The voice is clear.</p>
<p><strong>Squadron:</strong> What about the signal fidelity? As compared to the normal channel?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> One moment. <em>(pauses)</em> It was… pretty fine. Uh, the voice is somehow clearer coming from the coil.</p>
<p><strong>Squadron:</strong> Can you confirm the time-lapse? We are speaking from two different channels, right?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> One second. It's one second faster than from the coil.</p>
<p><strong>Squadron:</strong> Oh my gosh. <em>(clattering sound)</em> Do you know what this means, Harrison? <em>(Harrison was speaking.)</em> It is likely exceeding the speed of light. You don't know what this means, Arvin.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> We've got that. Likely this will persist even later on your way. Congrats!</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> A copy of SCP-8848 was generated by <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-038" target="_blank" target="_blank">SCP-038</a>. The four coil instances were then cross-tested in all 6 possible combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The two new coils did not respond either to the original -A or -B, but instead reacted between themselves and inherited the anomalous property. This phenomenon was noticed. Afterward, all replications of SCP-8848 are to be tagged respectively in pairs to avoid confusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> One duplication of SCP-8848 was disassembled, then remolded as a thinner strand of copper.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:100%;"><img alt="QI_Coil_1.png" class="image" src="https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/maxwellism/QI_Coil_1.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>One of the new coils woven by the remolded threads.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The twisted wires appeared to keep the property intact. It was then hypothesized that the anomalous characteristics of SCP-8848 probably originated from its raw material.</p>
<p>However, all available analyses have shown that the material is chemically indistinguishable from common copper.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> A project aiming at utilizing SCP-8848 was initiated based on previous experiments, which offered concrete evidence for facilitating the material itself. Pairs of integrated digital chips were manufactured using the material, with expectations of developing a distance-proof high-resolution electronic communication technology.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Two massive integrated circuits could synchronize their status if only corded respectively by intertwined SCP-8848 instances, while the continuity of wires is preserved.</p>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Proposal for the Project Telekinetics</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Project <em>Telekinetics</em> (abbr. TEKI) is developed based on SCP-8848, a pair of electromagnetic coils that are identical in shape and functionality. They have the interchangeability to duplicate electronic signals within a single-narrative three-dimensional universe, e.g., our baseline reality, while bearing no downsides of time-lapse or distancing attenuation.</p>
<p>Project Telekinetics is to introduce a new technology to build an efficient brain-to-body interface. Preliminary steps will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An authorized Foundation personnel will serve as Side A.</li>
<li>An artificially produced, congenitally brainless (yet the body and autonomic nervous system still function normally) humanoid or a human-like robot that is capable of interpreting and performing actions based on human neural signals will serve as Side B.</li>
<li>A neuro-electronic chip will be implanted attached to the spinal cord of Side A to read the neural impulse originating from the subject's free will. Another chip will be installed to receive the signal from Side A to direct the action to Side B, controlling it to perform the action.</li>
<li>The connection will then automatically be established by SCP-8848, and enables Side A to control the body motion and simultaneously get sensational feedback from it.</li>
<li>After the connection is established, Side A will be put into a deep hibernation (vegetative) state, temporarily disconnecting from their own body's motion and senses. Therefore, an exterior life-supporting system may be necessary for this practice.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>The potentials of Project Telekinesis include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rejuvenate:</strong> Revitalize body disabilities and alleviate sufferings from diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Expedition:</strong> Ensure the utmost safety of personnel exploring anomalies, Groups of Interests, and other uncategorized places/spacetime/objects.</li>
<li><strong>Research:</strong> Potentiate deep-going research into the modus operandi of human physiology and the relationship between mind and body.</li>
<li><strong>Weaponize:</strong> Train Side B subjects as armed forces to be deployed in military and violent actions to protect Foundation employees from being injured in physical combat. Per concerns about the value of Side B entities and worries about the disclosure of relevant technologies, this potential scenario is currently not considered for application until its efficiency and security can be well guaranteed.</li>
