<p>Jackson Maywall, a deceased individual with similarities to SCP-2567.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2567</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2567 is to remain within the confines of its graveyard territory. The outskirts of SCP-2567's territory must be guarded by no fewer than four security personnel. In the event that SCP-2567 exits its territory, personnel are required to fire upon SCP-2567 to severely damage it and draw it back to its graveyard.</p>
<p>SCP-2567 is to be herded away from visiting civilians by assigned field agents<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. In the event that any civilian observes SCP-2567, they are to be administered class-A amnestics and removed from the cemetery perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2567 is a humanoid figure standing 2.57 meters in height, and weighing 85 kilograms. Its body is comprised of finely-knitted pale and dark grey straw. SCP-2567 wears a black tuxedo and petty coat and a wide-brimmed bowler's hat comprised of the same material. SCP-2567's face has several large bulbous eyes on its head. These eyes are not fixed in place, and SCP-2567 is able to shift them across its surface to point in a desired direction. SCP-2567's eyes emit a lavender-scented liquid that drastically accelerates floral growth when spread over a burial site.</p>
<p>SCP-2567 resides within a cemetery 1.3 kilometers from the Site-12 Mt. Sugarloaf facility in Sunderland, Massachusetts, measuring 120 meters by 200 meters. It displays no unprompted aggression to living organisms and will display passive behavior unless its territory<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> is vandalized or violated in any way. This includes committing acts of grave robbery, littering, damaging headstones, and graffiti.</p>
<p>When SCP-2567's territory is damaged or vandalized, it will attempt to repair any damaged components of the cemetery using the grey liquid it produces as an adhesive to reconstruct damaged headstones.</p>
<p>All attempts to relocate SCP-2567 to a controlled facility have failed. When removed from its territory SCP-2567 will fall apart and dissolve, and a new instance of SCP-2567 will appear at its graveyard.</p>
<p>SCP-2567 displays extreme resilience to damage and will not attack living individuals that attempt to damage it. If SCP-2567 sustains significant damage it will return to its graveyard and enter the central mausoleum where it will encase itself in a stone coffin. After 24 hours, SCP-2567 will exit its coffin in a state of full repair. SCP-2567's mausoleum displays no anomalous properties on its own. The entrance has a plaque which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackson M. Maywall<br/>
October 19th, 1936 - [UNINTELLIGIBLE]<br/>
A kind-hearted public servant and friend to all who knew him. May his soul find eternal peace in the land of his love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the approval of level-2 administrative personnel an investigation into the whereabouts of the corpse of Maywall has been put underway. The agent assigned to investigating the possible link to SCP-2567 recorded the following conversation with a local grave keeper.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Harold F. Tanner, grave keeper</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Franklin E. Ville</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Agent Ville questioned several inhabitants around the town of Sunderland, Massachusetts, before concluding his investigation with an interview with one of the night-shift grave keepers of the town.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> So, I've asked around, and you seem to have been the closest person to the late Mr. Maywall. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Aye, yeah. You could say closest, but to be fair he was everyone's friend. Real kind man, he was.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> Right. So I've come to gather that he was an admired figure in the community, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Absolutely! He and his wife worked in the library, down by the corner store. They kept the place colorful. The kids loved 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> Can you tell me about them? Jackson and his wife, I mean. I haven't heard much about the wife from anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Mmhm. Yeah… Sure, I can tell you whatever you need. Care if I ask a question of my own?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> Not at all. Ask away.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Why're you asking around about the Maywalls? Extended family get into some trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> Not at all. Jackson knew my mom when she was a little girl, she told me a lot of stories, just thought I'd come ask about, then pay my respects.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Mm… Good a reason as ever. Anyways… Georgia Maywall was a nice enough woman. Real religious, but Jackson never was. They had a lot of differences, but you couldn't ask for a closer couple.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> That sounds nice. Not many people get that any more.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Mmhm. It was real nice, up until a few years back. She'd gotten liver cancer, but Jackson stayed with her all the way through. Wouldn't leave her side for more than a few hours, right up 'til the end.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> And after she'd passed away?</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Well, he didn't last much longer after she passed, maybe three years? He died in bed, though. Died happy, with some of his oldest friends by his side.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> What about before he died? What was he doing then?</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Well, afterwards… He dropped his job at the library, and took one up where Georgia was buried, as the day time tender. Kept things tidy in the cemetery. It's a bit of a grim job, but he always smiled. I guess, in a way, he really was with her until the very end.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> I guess we should all hope to be that lucky. My grandfather died overseas a long time back. So, did anyone see Maywall much during his time in the cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Oh boy, yeah, plenty! We all visited him, couple of times a week at least but he spent every day in the cemetery. Every Thursday, he'd bring a bouquet of lavenders to her headstone, and spend the evening reading to her. I'm sure he'd have given anything to pass on, right there next to her. I can't imagine how it must've been for him, losin' the closest person he's ever had.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ville:</strong> I certainly couldn't imagine it. I should probably be hitting the road soon, but I want to thank you for taking the time to talk with me.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Tanner:</strong> Ain't a problem… Any friend of the Maywalls is welcome to take my time as they please.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> As per investigations regarding the Maywall family, SCP-2567 displays thematic similarities to Jackson Maywall before his passing such as the lavenders Jackson would leave at Georgia's grave, and the lavender-colored fluid that leaks from SCP-2567's eyes, as well as its constant presence in the area surrounding both Jackson and Georgia's grave and mausoleum.</p>
