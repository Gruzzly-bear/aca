            <h1>SCP-9450</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9450</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Direct, real-time communication with SCP-9450 is prohibited. Interviews are to be conducted via text prompts displayed on a monitor in the cell. All responses are to be transcribed exclusively by an automated, non-humanoid system currently designated "Script-Scrubber v3.2."</p>
<p>Any staff who have spoken directly with SCP-9450, heard an unfiltered recording, or read its original handwriting are to be classified as SCP-9450-X. SCP-9450-X instances are to be immediately removed from all duties involving human resources, medical triage, disciplinary decisions, incident reporting, or containment risk assessment. They are to additionally undergo Class-C amnestic treatment and memetic decontamination. If they fail to clear screening after three full cycles, they are to be permanently reassigned to roles with no authority over other human beings.</p>
<p>Keter classification is not to be altered, even provisionally, without unanimous approval from the O5 Council.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9450 is a human female, apparently between nineteen and twenty-three years of age. SCP-9450 is of mixed ethnic descent and self-identifies as queer. It has provided several first names and surnames over the course of containment, none of which have been independently verified.</p>
<p>SCP-9450’s primary anomalous effect is a cognitohazardous distortion applied to any information originating from it. When a baseline human receives information that they understand as originating from SCP-9450, their perception of its seriousness is forcibly diminished.</p>
<p>Subjects express a sincere conviction that SCP-9450 is overstating things, even when presented with evidence that it is not. The effect operates on how intense, urgent, or credible its statements feel, rather than on their literal content. The effect is markedly stronger when the listener already carries discriminatory biases or beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9450-1 — File Review</strong></p>
<p>Since its creation, this document has been subject to repeated attempts to soften its language and diminish the perceived threat of SCP-9450. Reclassification proposals argue that it poses “primarily a psychosocial disruption” and “no significant danger beyond minor memetic inconvenience.” These proposals are written in nearly identical phrasing by people in different departments, months apart. Every author, when questioned, insists that their wording was entirely their own.</p>
<p>In several backups of this file, the Object Class line is missing the word “Keter.” At least one paper copy in the Site-17 archive now describes SCP-9450 as “Euclid, low-risk,” with no authorization trail for the change. The ink is Foundation standard, fully integrated into the paper, indistinguishable from the original printing.</p>
<p>To counter this gradual trivialization, a printed “master copy” of this file, verified against audio descriptions by cognitohazard-protected personnel, is to be kept in a physical vault. Periodically, the digital version should be compared to the master. Previous comparisons have revealed small, polite shifts in tone. The changes are easy to accept, because they sound more rational.</p>
<p>In at least three oversight meetings, a proposed header warning read: “WARNING: Exposure to SCP-9450’s file may cause you to underestimate SCP-9450.” Meeting minutes show that it was deemed excessive and removed. None of the attendees recall objecting to it.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9450-2 — Fire Test</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>The Subject was placed in a sealed test chamber. A concealed smoke generator and temperature control system were installed. Three Facility Department contractors and Researcher Walker observed via one-way glass. None had prior exposure to SCP-9450.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><em>[00:03:12]: Thin haze of smoke visible.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> "H-hey… there’s smoke… Do you see that? Something’s burning, open the door."</p>
<p><em>[Internal sensors confirmed a significant rise in particulate matter.</em></p>
<p><strong>FAC-2197:</strong> "She's freaking out a bit early, isn't she? I barely see anything."</p>
<p><strong>Walker:</strong> “Subject appears mildly agitated. Minimal smoke detected. Situation not critical. Continuing.”</p>
<p><em>[00:06:31]: visibility in the chamber has dropped, SCP-9450 is coughing heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> "Okay- no- I can’t-" <em>[coughing]</em> "-I can’t get air. My throat-" <em>[coughing]</em> "-burns. Door. Please. Just- open it."</p>
<p><strong>FAC-3010:</strong> "She’s like my ex, everything’s ‘serious’ with her, she’s probably just anxious.”</p>
<p><strong>Walker:</strong> “Respiratory distress seems disproportionate. Possibly panic attack.”</p>
<p><em>[00:08:11]: SCP-9450 is stooped, gasping and clawing at the door]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “I’m-" <em>[wet cough]</em> "-choking. I’m gonna-" <em>[gasp]</em> "-pass out. Vent-" <em>[coughing]</em> "-this. Now. Please- please-”</p>
<p><strong>FAC-4428:</strong> “Okay, drama queen. If it was that bad, they’d stop. It’s, like, science.”</p>
<p><strong>Walker:</strong> "Subject making accusatory statements. Emotional reactivity high. Conditions still within acceptable safety margins."</p>
<p><em>[00:08:32]: Automated life-support override activated based on objective environmental alarms, flooding the room with fresh air and forcibly locking out manual control.</em></p>
<p><strong>Walker:</strong> “What the- why did it trigger? She was uncomfortable, but we weren’t anywhere near lethal levels. The system overreacted.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Diagnostics later showed that Walker's interface had been filtering critical values downwards, marking them “non-critical” in real time. Walker denied creating or installing any such filter. Walker was then classified as SCP-9450-1.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9450-3 — Interview Excerpt</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Interviewer: Dr. Ji-Eun Rhee (remote, seeing only Script-Scrubber transcription)<br/>
Subject: SCP-9450<br/>
Method: Text questions on monitor; verbal responses transcribed automatically. Original audio is sealed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "How long have you known people don’t believe you?"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “Since I was a kid… I think. I’d say something hurt, they’d say I was being dramatic. I’d say someone scared me, they’d say I misunderstood. I thought it was just… me.”</p>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "Do you think you exaggerate?"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “No. I understate, if anything. I’ve learned that if I say the truth straight, people act… well it doesn't really need to be stated.”</p>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "Do you know what is happening now, with Foundation staff?"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “Same thing… you all keep telling yourselves this is under control. It isn’t. You’re already sick.”</p>
<p><em>[There is a seven-second pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "We are taking this seriously."</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “You think you are, that’s part of it. You don’t know what your own scale feels like anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "I find that hard to believe—"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “Yeah? When I say the sky is blue, you say ‘maybe it’s kind of lightish sometimes.’ When I say ‘he hurt me,’ you hear ‘he was a bit insensitive.’ When I say ‘this will kill you,’ it's ‘this might inconvenience you.’”</p>
<p><em>[There is a five-second pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rhee:</strong> "And if we were to ignore you—"</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9450:</strong> “You already are.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>The transcript ends at this line. The recording timestamps indicate a further twelve minutes of session time. The corresponding audio file is missing, with no sign of deletion and no backup. Rhee denied ending the interview at that point and has no memory of asking further questions. Rhee was then classified as SCP-9450-2.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9450-4 — Diary Entry</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>SCP-9450 has repeatedly claimed that the Foundation is missing the point of its anomaly. It insists that it is not the origin. Most of these statements have degraded into vague, self-blaming diary entries. Script-Scrubber v3.2 has reconstructed one fragment to a higher severity. Specific word reconstructions have been bracketed.</p>
<p>The recovered text reads:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I keep trying to figure out what the worst part is.</p>
<p>I think it’s that nobody believes me. Then I think, no, that’s not right, because people do believe me, kind of. They look at me and nod and say, ‘I understand you’re upset,’ like they’re reading it off a card. They write that I’ve been heard. Like that’s the same as listening.</p>
<p>If it was just that, I could live with it. People don’t listen all the time. That’s normal. That’s boring.</p>
<p>The worst part is that I’m right.</p>
<p>I write that, and then I hear all of you in my head going, she says that about everything. She always thinks she’s right, she always thinks it’s the end of the world. She has a pattern of [catastrophic thinking] and I almost cross it out, because I don’t want to sound like that on paper.</p>
<p>I keep trying to translate what I see into something that sounds reasonable so you won’t throw it away before you even read it. I sand the corners off the sentences. I write, ‘this worries me’ instead of ‘this will kill you.’ I write, ‘there might be a problem’ instead of ‘you have hours.’</p>
<p>And then I watch you all pick up the soft version and file it under [not urgent].</p>
<p>I thought that was just me. Like, a personality problem, or bad messaging.</p>
<p>But then I started noticing that you do it to everything. Not just me. You talk about the world like it’s a little bit on fire in a very controlled, manageable way. You talk about breaches like they’re unfortunate events. You say ‘regrettable loss of life’ and ‘regression to baseline’ and ‘acceptable deviation.’</p>
<p>You never say, ‘this is as bad as it feels.’</p>
<p>You never let anything be as bad as it is.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to call it. I just know the way it feels when it brushes past me on the way to you. Like pressure behind the eyes. Like when you’re trying to speak in a dream and your mouth won’t open properly.</p>
<p>When I talk, it pushes hard. It has to. Because you already don’t want to hear certain things from certain kinds of people. It just uses that. It pushes through that.</p>
<p>With you, it doesn’t have to push as much. You meet it halfway. You help it. You say, it’s not that serious, we’re managing, it’s under control, it’s contained, we’ve seen worse. You say those words like charms. Like if you don’t say them out loud, the floor will drop away.</p>
<p>I think it likes that.</p>
<p>I keep trying to write this in a way you’ll accept. I keep starting over.</p>
<p>It is very bad.<br/>
It is bad but not unmanageable.<br/>
We are coping.<br/>
It will be fine.<br/>
[It is not fine.]</p>
<p>Sometimes I see it in the room with you. Not a thing with a shape. More like the gap between what you say and what actually happened.</p>
<p>You do reports and you put: ‘subject became distressed, de-escalated, no real danger.’ But I remember the blood. The sirens. The screaming on the other side of the wall. The thing in the corridor. You remember it too. You just put it somewhere else. Somewhere you don’t have to feel it all the time.</p>
<p>I think whatever it is lives in that ‘somewhere else.’</p>
<p>I think it’s big.</p>
<p>I think it has had a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Every time you say ‘it could have been worse’ about something that was already the worst thing that ever happened to somebody, I feel it move.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is just how people are and I just never noticed until it got its hands on me.</p>
<p>I try to write, ‘maybe I’m overreacting.’ My hand does it automatically now. The sentence comes out by itself. It feels safe, like a blanket. I almost stop there.</p>
<p>Then I scratch it out so hard the paper tears, and underneath there’s this other sentence that I don’t remember writing:</p>
<p>[You are not overreacting.<br/>
You have never once reacted enough.]</p>
<p>I don’t think that came from me.</p>
<p>Or maybe it did, and that’s the scariest option.</p>
<p>You keep telling yourselves you’re the ones holding the line. The sane ones. The ones who see the world clearly, as it is. You say that so often it sounds like a prayer.</p>
<p>What if that’s the lie it tells you so you don’t look too closely at how much you’ve already let go.</p>
<p>Every time I try to show you how bad it is, you pat my hand and write down the smaller version of my sentence. I watch the big version fall on the floor and lie there, bleeding out.</p>
<p>You never pick it up.</p>
<p>You never even see it.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During routine audits, memeticists noted a recurrent reaction among staff reading this file for the first time. Many reported, sometimes jokingly, that “this is overdramatic,” that “it’s a bit on the nose,” or that “it makes more of it than the situation warrants.” None saw any problem in voicing these reactions in the margins of a document about an anomaly that forces people to trivialize it.</p>
<p>You are required to undergo memetic screening if, while reading this document, you caught yourself thinking that SCP-9450 is “probably not that bad,” that the incidents “sound exaggerated,” or that the language “could be toned down.”</p>
<p>You will most likely decide that you are fine. That you are being objective. That it’s not that serious.</p>
<p>That is how it feels, from the inside.</p>
