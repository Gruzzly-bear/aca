<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> MTF Zeta-7 "Marriage Counselling" has been posted on the perimeter of Site 337. Zeta-7 reserves the right to turn away or imprison any tresspassers on sight. The 'danger region' of SCP-6422 is to be updated regularly.</p>
<p>Access to the chamber containing SCP-6422 by more than one individual at a time is prohibited. The Primary Research Facility (PRF) is built directly on top of the cave containing SCP-6422. Personnel at the PRF are to be kept to a minimum at all times. All non-active personnel must remain in their quarters until they begin working or evacuate the premises immediately. Personnel on-site are expected to perform multiple tasks outside of their stated duties, including but not limited to janitorial duties and supply delivery in an effort to minimize personnel on-site.</p>
<p>A psychologist must be present on-site at all times. All work shifts at Site 337 will begin with a mandatory psychological evaluation. In the event that the psychologist on-site deems any individual unfit to begin their shift they are to return to their chambers immediately. All work in which more than one individual must be present must be conducted in the presence of a psychologist. The psychologist is not allowed to speak to any personnel for the duration of the shift except in the event of signs of uncontrolled heightened aggression between present staff, in which case they are authorized to use any tactics up to and including a provided tranquilizer gun to isolate affected parties.</p>
<p>Investigation into the ruins surrounding SCP-6422 is prohibited at this time.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-6422-1 which are found alive are to be detained immediately for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6422 is a cylindrical obelisk measuring approximately ten meters in height, tapering in diameter from the bottom to the top. SCP-6422 is comprised primarily of polished granite from the surrounding mountain range. Within the structure of the granite are several intrusions containing the wood of various tree species endemic to the region. The cells within the wood material are living, despite no obvious source of sustenance. Micro-structural analysis of the cells suggests that at some point during the creation of the obelisk, the cells rapidly flooded in through the base of the obelisk, acting as a viscous liquid.</p>
<p>SCP-6422 is contained within a circular cave approximately ███ meters above sea level in a remote region of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. The inside of the cave is temperate at all times of year, even though there is a horizontal entrance and a natural skylight in the roof of the cave. Within this cave exist several flora and fungi species with anomalous properties<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is possible for an individual to become 'attuned' to SCP-6422, at which point they begin manifesting the anomalous capacity to alter the shape, function, and structure of living plant matter around them. They are henceforth designated as SCP-6422-1. It is currently unknown how exactly this attunement process is accomplished, though several theories have been proposed. Selected instances of this power becoming manifest are documented in Addendum 2. All instances of SCP-6422-1 have been terminated or are currently unaccounted for.</p>
<p>SCP-6422's secondary anomalous effects manifest when there are two or more people in close proximity within a region labeled the 'danger region' which currently spans a circular region of approximately 5 kilometers centered on SCP-6422. When two individuals within the 'danger region' engage in any conversation, verbal or nonverbal, the probability that the conversation will drift towards a topic in which the two will disagree appears to increase substantially. Upon reaching a disagreement, the two conversants will become fixated on the disagreement, escalating in conversational aggression, until finally both conversants engage in physical violence until one or both parties have collapsed or expired.</p>
<p>The 'danger region' is currently expanding at a rate of approximately █ meters per day. The rate at which the 'danger region' expands appears to increase considerably if conflict is occurring within the 'danger region', and has been observed traveling in excess of ████ meters per day. Research into the conditions which control the expansion of the 'danger region' are considered a top-level priority.</p>
<p>Within the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 exists the abandoned remains of an anomalous civilization which made extensive use of SCP-6422 for various purposes. The remains suggest the civilization used the powers of SCP-6422 for structural, agricultural, and religious ends which were heavily incorporated into daily activities.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-01</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A remotely piloted drone with various sampling equipment was sent into the chamber containing SCP-6422</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No ill effect was observed on the unmanned drone. Material properties of SCP-6422 were established. A condensed list of observed collected species can be found in Addendum 2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-02</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A single D-Class was instructed to enter the cave and remain there for one week. At several points during this period, the D-Class is instructed to consume several anomalous plant species which were independently determined to be safe for consumption.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No behavioral ill-effects were observed for the entire duration. All consumed plant species had expected effects based on previous laboratory analysis.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-03</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Two D-class were instructed to walk towards the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 and begin conversation.</td>
<td>At roughly ████ meters from SCP-6422, the two D-Class rapidly changed subjects to a discussion on sports. The discussion rapidly deteriorated over the course of one minute into ad hominem, before abruptly erupting into physical conflict, at which point the two D-Class were tranquilized.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-04</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Identical to Test-6422-03, performed within fifteen minutes of Test-6422-03.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Results identical to Test-6422-03, except it is noted that the 'danger region' had expanded by roughly █ meters, more than the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 expands on a typical day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Incident-6422-02</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A small construction crew was brought into the chamber containing SCP-6422. The goal of the crew was to remove SCP-6422 from its current position into a more manageable position at a dedicated site. The crew was instructed not to speak and is to be guided through earpieces connected from a safe distance.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The crew were initially unsuccessful in moving SCP-6422, appearing to encounter a root system which rapidly regenerated upon physical damage. A proposal was made by a remote operative over earpiece to alter the removal plan, to which one member of the crew appeared to nod. Immediately after this, a second member of the crew non-verbally signaled disapproval, at which point the two crew members engaged in a small nonverbal disagreement which evolved into a melee involving two-thirds of the crew. After the combat had finished, all surviving crew members were instructed to remain in place as a task force was sent to collect the construction crew. Total casualties: 4.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-05</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An unmanned drone equipped with a saw blade made of an anomalously hardened and strengthened steel alloy was tasked with the uprooting of SCP-6422.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The drone was unsuccessful in removing SCP-6422 from its position; the saw blade became ineffectively dull after less than eight minutes of continuous use.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Test-6422-06</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">After collecting propagatable samples from all plant species in the cave, several C4 charges were planted at the base of SCP-6422, with consideration given to minimize damage to SCP-6422.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">After the detonation of the charges, SCP-6422 was successfully wrested from the ground. The anomalous properties of SCP-6422 did not abate. Over the course of the subsequent week, a new instance of SCP-6422 grew in the place of the previous one. The separated SCP-6422 possessed no detectable anomalous properties.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Every remaining building in the area surrounding SCP-6422 appears to be constructed of a graft of several tree species, all living. All walkable surfaces appear to be comprised of buffed, lacquered silver birch, while all walls are constructed of Siberian larch. All window frames appear to be made of Siberian Pine which has been altered significantly; the sap produced by the trees is clear and rapidly cures upon contact with air into a glassy substance which comprises the windows. The byproduct of this curing is a volatile liquid which is odorless but appears to possess insecticidal properties. The structures generated in this manner range from simpler houses to complex and multi-storied housing. Site 3b possesses a now defunct watermill. The details of the construction of these buildings are largely unknown.</td>

internal offices have been contacted and no corporate officials have any knowledge of an<br/>
"obelisk" as described by contacted ground personnel. An investigation has been opened up<br/>
but due to the severity of ground fighting in the region further information is sparse. All<br/>
necessary agencies will be updated upon evolution of the situation.</p>

<p>A joint operation between Russian Federation Black Ops and a small amnestics team successfully halted the ongoing conflict. Several members of ██████ were interviewed, but ultimately no new information was revealed. All combatant parties were successfully amnesticized and all evidence of ██████'s claim to the area was removed from federal and corporate documentation. After a brief monologue with the Russian Federation, control of the site was transferred to the Foundation.</p>
<p>It was discovered during the de-escalation period that the region surrounding SCP-6422 was occupied by an undocumented civilization of instances of SCP-6422-1. What minimal linguistic and genetic analysis that was performed during this period suggests an admixture of Turkic-speaking steppe peoples, ethnic Mongols, and an undescribed culture and genotype, likely originating in Siberia. Foundation linguists suggest that the undescribed culture may be ████████ in nature, meaning the earliest date of divergence is roughly 12██ CE. The language spoken by the locals was sufficiently similar to modern Mongolian for a pidgin to be constructed for communication.</p>

<p><em>Recorded Interview Conducted at 16:33 on 04/01/20██. Translated from Mongolian.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> My name is [SCP-6422-1-1].</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Would you like anything to eat or drink?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> No, thank you. I was told by other people here that you would be able to tell me where your people came from.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Ah, of course. My family has been tasked with the preservation of the (Daekhiil) for {27 generations}. Shall I begin?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Please.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6422-1-1 clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> {Long before} the time of (Daekhiil), the █████ walked the Earth. The █████ was cruel and had many heads. █████ was one time so large that she wrapped her tail around the ocean far to the east where she did battle with the ocean, and the mountains far to the west where she did battle with the {men of earth and metal}. █████ kept men in chains and performed acts of blood upon the ground with the blood of those men. However those heads of the █████ were made weak by her fighting. By {5 generations} before the (Daekhiil) the █████ had grown so weak from her wars that it had shrunken into a pit to the north and east of here. And then all at once the ocean to the east swallowed █████ whole. The blood of █████ mixed with the earth and the salt and water of the ocean and the (Daekhiil) was made {32 generations} ago from the {holy broth}.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> This is how it happened?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6422-1-1 chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> If history were not made easy to tell then it would not be told. Perhaps some of the history is embellished. But the answer to your question is certainly mostly yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> And you are the (Daekhiil)?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Yes. Well, not quite. There is more to the story. The people who comprise the (Daekhiil) were born from dirt and not from others so a {great promise} had to be created by them for it could not be inherited. So our forebearers said amongst themselves that they hold the following {great promise} in their hearts and share that {great promise} with their children. There is no mud greater than any other mud. No person may cast blood upon the earth as █████ did. The seeds of the earth may guide us and we may guide those seeds of the earth. There is no power of the (Daekhiil) that is a power of one person. To make the (Daekhiil) eternal the obelisk was made (Daekhiil) so that one piece exists in physical stone for all time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> So the obelisk is also the (Daekhiil)?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> The obelisk is the (Daekhiil) and the {great promise} is the (Daekhiil) and the people of this town are the (Daekhiil). Anyone who does not possess all three is not (Daekhiil).</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> What were to happen if these promises were broken?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> All those who break the {grand promise} of the (Daekhiil) may not commune with the obelisk of the (Daekhiil) until they have atoned. Periods of hardship usually follow such a transgression.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> And how does one atone?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Atonement can only be done by sharing the (Daekhiil) as a gift to those who have never received the (Daekhiil). Some transgressions require sharing with only one other person. Some require many.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Alright, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Likewise. Please visit any time.</p>
<p><em>End interview.</em></p>

<p>After primary reconnaissance on the nature of the anomaly done by Dr. ███ with the permission of the SCP-6422-1 instances, MTF Theta-4 "Gardeners" were moved on-site. Construction of the PRF began immediately following reconnaissance. Minimal resistance from locals was encountered.</p>
<p>The majority of recorded information during the period of 04/03/20██ and 04/06/20██ was collected by Dr. Johnathan ███. The anomalous effects of SCP-6422 prevented sufficient record keeping, though an attempt at a reconstruction of a timeline of events will be made external to all documents provided.</p>
<p>At 18:55 on 04/02/20██, Dr. ███ notes that progress on the containment of the anomaly had been slower since the acquisition of the anomaly from the SCP-6422-1 instances, citing disagreements between the commander of MTF Theta-4 and the at the time Site Director, Dr. Wilson. Dr. ███ attempts to characterize the anomaly through<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> interview.</p>

<p><em>Recording captured at 18:55 on 04/02/20██.</em></p>
<p><em>Note: Parts of this video have been translated from Mongolian. Names have been replaced with bracketed instance numbers.</em></p>
<p><em>Camera is sitting on a long table. Several SCP-6422-1 instances native to Site 337 are present. Instances of SCP-6422-1 appear to be in religious clothing of some sort. Dr. ███ is out of frame.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Thank you for speaking with me on such short notice I understand that you are a decision-making body.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-6422-1 instances present stare across the table, presumably at Dr. ███, before SCP-6422-1-2 speaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> We will begin the town hall now. [SCP-6422-1-1], [SCP-6422-1-3], you may begin with the sedge ritual.</p>
<p><em>Camera moves to capture SCP-6422-1-1 walk from the table, over to a small cabinet, retrieving two small objects. The objects are revealed to be flowers of modified Carex sp. as described in Addendum 02. Another SCP-6422-1 instance, presumably SCP-6422-1-3, moves to an adjacent cabinet and retrieves a drinking glass sized, tightly woven basket filled with soil. The second SCP-6422-1 instance places the basket on the table. SCP-6422-1-1 approaches the table and turns briefly to SCP-6422-1-2. SCP-6422-1-2 clears their throat and begins.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> We have guided the seeds of the earth. May those seeds guide us.</p>
<p><em>All present nod. SCP-6422-1-2 chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> Now we are a decision-making body. Though I am afraid that a decision has already been made for us.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6422-1-2 turns to a room adjacent to the meeting room.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> [SCP-6422-1-4], bring the last meeting's {omen}.</p>
<p><em>A distant shuffling is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> Yes [SCP-6422-1-2] {sir}.</p>
<p><em>A young male SCP-6422-1 instance comes from the side compartment. They are carrying an earthenware tray. On the tray is a basket like the others except it appears to have crumbled. On top of soil from the broken basket is a dead, wilted Carex. Sp. seedling as described in Addendum 02. A few audible gasps can be heard as the platter is set on the table, and the SCP-6422-1 instance brings the newly planted basket on a return trip with him to the room. SCP-6422-1-2 slouches into their chair and sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> The decision is that tragedy will come to the (Daekhiil) soon.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6422-1-1 turns to a spot behind the camera, presumably Dr. ███.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> The grain planted at each previous meeting is {an omen} for the days following the next meeting. In times of pestilence or failed crops the plant has wilted and died. In times before earthquakes the pot has broken. Both have never occurred simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-5:</strong> Then certainly there will be earthquakes and other hardships in the future.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-3:</strong> But certainly that they are combined means that the calamity will be more than just one earthquake and one famine. That is what I am concerned about.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> The roots are still living! They are large!</p>
<p><em>The table seems astonished at this realization. The camera pans towards the dirt underneath the dying plant. The roots are observed rapidly growing approximately 1 centimeter. There are gasps across the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> That the worst will come to pass.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-6422-1 instances in the meeting appear to become grave.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> There is only one interpretation of this sign. █████ has returned to take her blood back and cast it here. The (Daekhiil) has decided to take the earth into it in preparation, and it has decided that it will not cooperate until the hardship has passed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-3:</strong> And it will store energy in the roots as many plants do? Will it not share any with us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-5:</strong> That is something we cannot know for certain, but considering that the {omen} has not shared its {omen seedling} then it is not likely.</p>
<p><em>There are several nods of agreement. SCP-6422-1-2 turns once more behind the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> Those who command you, this 'S.C.P.', do they know of the danger of this {omen}?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Well I'm not sure, they've been arguing over procedure all day. I'll try to share it with them as soon as I can, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-6422-1 instances behind the camera appear to share pensive glances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> The organization I work for, it's called 'SCP' because it stands for something. It means secure, contain, protect. I'm certain that the people here are qualified to protect us all from whatever evil comes our way.</p>
<p><em>The instances of SCP-6422-1 share nods of commitment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-1:</strong> Then we will begin our preparations immediately. You may stay and help us or you may return to your colleagues to warn them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> I will communicate with them remotely. I came to the valley to figure out what's going on here and the least I can do is help keep this place on the map. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-2:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p>At some point before 04:34 on 04/03/20██, a GOC detachment appears to have entered the valley containing SCP-6422 from the north, travelled directly southeast towards the PRF, and set up in a mountain pass directly north of the PRF. The exact time of arrival of the GOC detachment is unknown as Foundation Personnel failed to report the GOC intrusion before armed combat broke out. A recording of the beginning of the skirmish is included below:</p>

<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Alright so I spent the night in the valley helping out the people here with preparations. They're all quite nice and it's fascinating but it's beside the point right now. Listen.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ positions the camera towards the mountain containing SCP-6422. Visible light on the mountain suggests activity. The distant sound of gunshots can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> So I got a radio communication on my walkie-talkie about, uhh, three minutes ago now and all it said was 'GOC operatives inbound' and I'm honestly kind of thinking it was a good idea to come down here. I've explained the situation to the people in charge in the valley and they've been heading around making sure everyone's alright still.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ rotates the camera to bring his face into frame once more. He appears to be looking behind the camera at the activity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> I've radioed up to the PRF about a plan to maybe evacuate the valley if things get too hairy and they said they'll look into it soon, but I haven't gotten anything back yet.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ wipes his face before looking into the camera once again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> These people here and the town they built isn't set up for war or a siege or anything. They don't have guns, they've got spears. No tactics. This is a group that might not have had any real internal or external conflict for close to ███ years. It's honestly kind of nerve-wracking.</p>

<p>Military assistance was requested by MTF Theta-4 Commander Hathaway at 05:02 that morning, and by an O5 Council vote of 7 for, 2 against, 4 abstained, it was decided to send one company of AMTF Nu-7 "Hammer Down" to rebuff the GOC detachment. AMTF Nu-7 arrives at 07:55 according to transponders on Nu-7 vehicles. The timeline of events is unknown until 09:12 the same morning, at which point Dr. ███ reported that the gunfire has reduced in frequency considerably.</p>

A brief internal communication intercepted shortly after their arrival suggest a liaison to the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts, though this connection is tenuous and not sufficiently established with available evidence:</p>

<p><strong>Magpie:</strong> Mr. Abraham J., this is Magpie. I am at the site of the target. No visual.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham J.:</strong> Excellent. I'm confident that this will be a disruptive technology in the global anomalous economy. A real mover.</p>
<p><strong>Magpie:</strong> Of course, sir. Right here, you gave me general guidelines on retrieval of the object which involve aerial support which has <em>not</em> currently arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham J.:</strong> Ah yes, well the aerial retrieval has not become cost effective with the intrusion of so many parties. The operation will have to occur more covertly than that. I trust that the mercenaries I have supplied are sufficient. Try to get them back in one piece. I understand you've got bots to cover for that.</p>
<p><strong>Magpie:</strong> Suggesting a procedural change on the order of magnitude that you have costs extra money, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham J.:</strong> I have you at a fixed rate. Ask MC&amp;D for a raise or take something for yourself if you want more. You're an operative they trust so <em>I</em> trust that <em>you</em> will come up with something. It's your job.</p>
<p><em>There is a pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Magpie:</strong> Understood. I will update you on situation specifics at a future date. Out.</p>

<p><em>Video camera appears to be inside of a small, dark place, such as a coat pocket. It is revealed to be the pocket on Dr. ███'s lab coat. He stares directly at the camera lens for a brief period, before nodding.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> OK OK it's still good. The crack didn't hurt anything. Alright, uhh, alright I might as well give a situation update. There's these crazy Russian guys crawling all over the place. They're just shooting anybody they see. It isn't good. It's actually very bad.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ appears to look out of some sort of cover.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> I don't know what the hell the Foundation is doing. I've radioed on my personal walkie-talkie several times and they just seem to be ignoring me. There's men, women and kids dying out here, it's a madhouse! It's a <em>slaughterhouse!</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ sets down the camera and is heard breathing heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> Johnathan. Sir! Please, we must do as you said.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ picks up the camera once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Alright, yeah. So we made it across this wasteland-</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ pans the camera to reveal that every building in the area has been partially or completely destroyed by gunfire and explosive munitions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> -because we're pretty sure that in that one building right there, there's an abandoned radio. Some robots and some other mercenaries came through and dragged three Russians out and shot them and one was dragging some radio wires out along with him. Without [SCP-6422-1-4] I'd have never noticed but that means there might still be working radio equipment in that building, maybe even something to defend ourselves with.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ turns the camera to himself once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> I have no idea how the fighting has gotten this fierce. The earth has been shaking all night from bombs. There's been so many fires, it's way hotter in this valley than it was yesterday. Normally there's something in the Foundation's brain that tells it to stop bombing when there's nothing more to gain but they've just been raining it all this time! This has to be something with (Daekhiil) but I'm absolutely clueless.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> Surely you must recognize at this point that your Foundation had no plans to protect us! (Daekhiil) has just brought their own worst colors to the surface.</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ turns from the camera to a point off screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> The Foundation I know would never do this!</p>
<p><em>There is a loud explosion nearby. Dr. ███ flinches, turning to look in a different direction, before sighing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Look we have to get to that radio. If anybody's going to save us we can't get to them without it. Let's go.</p>

<p>At 17:13 on 04/04/20██, Dr. ███ successfully makes contact with outside personnel using radio equipment stolen from Chechen Dawn operatives. The only message sent is "This is Dr. ███ of [DATA EXPUNGED] of the SCP Foundation. There's enemies everywhere. We're dying. Send more backup."</p>
<p>At 17:29 on 04/04/20██, by 11-2 O5 decision, the remaining two companies of AMTF Nu-7 were sent to SCP-6422's location. At 19:55 the same day, Nu-7 entered the valley from the north and headed southeast. It was determined that the optimal course of action would be to push the GOC detachment out of the pass and down the valley into Chechen Dawn, at which point the GOC and the Chechen Dawn would be trapped between Foundation armaments and the PSHUD/mercenary battalion controlled by MC&amp;D and the unknown benefactor.</p>

<p>By 03:12 on 04/05/20██, all GOC operatives had been captured and Chechen Dawn had fled the valley southward. A negotiated peace was reached between the GOC and the Foundation which guaranteed the return of all GOC resources in exchange for evacuation from Site 337. The PSHUD/mercenary force did not advance eastward into the valley, ceding this territory to the Foundation. The stalemate stood as it was for approximately six hours. At 09:21 a transmission was sent by AMTF General Cardamom to outside Foundation operatives:</p>

<p><em>Transmission received at 09:21 on 04/04/20██.</em></p>
<p><strong>General Cardamom:</strong> Attention to all current Foundation operatives. Betrayal has been crawling through this valley this entire day. Earlier this morning when the GOC and the Chechen Dawn were pushed into a corner, they decided to kill each other like crabs in a bucket rather than stand and fight with honor. Now, on this brisk morning, I hear that there are traitors among our own ranks. People who would shoot their comrades in the back to steal the glory or the favor of the Foundation or worse, the SCP itself. I will not be tolerant of these snakes! I will make sure that every one of them has been captured or ground to dust, on my own name! I will issue no further warning. This crawling betrayal means war.</p>

<p>At this moment, a detachment of Nu-7 stationed directly north of the PRF forcibly took the building from on-site control. The detachment of Nu-7 residing in the valley began mobilizing for combat against the rogue detachment. It appears that the following communication was had between 'Magpie' and 'Abraham J.' was had at least partially in response to this movement.</p>

<p>After the termination of this communication, Dr. ███ captures a photograph of the PSHUD units moving on the special operations mercenaries. The picture is annotated "They just started shooting at their own men. It loooks like there are more robots coming (sic)".</p>
<p>Following the liquidation of the mercenary force of Abraham J. the PSHUD units began sweeping eastward into the valley. It is likely that at this point the valley contingency of Nu-7 collapsed and the MC&amp;D forces took the valley, pushing Nu-7 up into the eastern ridge. This larger portion of Nu-7 simultaneously appears to have taken the PRF back from the rogue faction between 12:00 and 13:00 according to eyewitness accounts and subsequent investigations. At this point, the PSHUD units appear to have stopped chasing Nu-7 up the mountain. Further video from Dr. ███ suggests that at some pint prior, the Serpent's Hand became involved.</p>

<p><em>The video opens in a small alcove on the mountain as the camera is pointed directly at a middle-aged man (henceforth Serpent's Hand) in robes. The man is shielding two young instances of SCP-6422-1 with his body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent's Hand:</strong> Ay ay hold on, pal what the hell are you recording for?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Because I nearly dropped on top of you, what do you mean? Also what are <em>you</em> doing here? There's nothing for you here they all blew it to shit!</p>

<p><strong>Serpent's Hand:</strong> No, <em>you</em> all blew it to shit. Buddy walking into an anomaly like this, with all the callous disregard for human life? That's a war crime if I ever saw one, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> I didn't have anything to do with this. My boss deciding to turn a village into the surface of the moon goes above and beyond me.</p>
<p><em>The Serpent's Hand member shakes his head violently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent's Hand:</strong> I don't think you understand what's going on here pal. It doesn't matter if it's you writing stupid shit down in a journal about the thaumic matrix vorticity of the third moment of whosit or your boss deciding that the indigenous people here don't deserve rights. The anomaly is a connected thing and the people are a connected thing. You are a connected thing <em>too</em> friend and the second you all came out here trying to attack this mess? God forget it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> What? That's nons-</p>
<p><em>Dr. ███ pauses for a long time. The Serpent's Hand member seems puzzled at Dr. ███'s actions behind the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Oh. Oh God. Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> Who is this and what are they saying?</p>

<p><em>The Serpent's Hand member smiles. Dr. ███ turns to SCP-6422-1-4 and begins speaking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> When I was told the rules and the people here and the obelisk, they were all one thing, you know, the (Daekhiil), I was too busy thinking about other things to realize what that really meant.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> We all came here and we broke the (Daekhiil) by claiming it as ours. You know, there's no power that belongs to one person business? Well now the (Daekhiil) is using us to fulfill it's own prophecy. It is making <em>us</em> shatter the world and kill the village and drive the (Daekhiil) underground.</p>
<p><em>There is a pause. Gunshots can be heard in the distance, with the occasional munitions explosion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> [SCP-6422-1-4] you have to get out of here. It's gonna grind us all to dust and I don't want it to take you too. Serpent guy, do you have a way out of here?</p>
<p><strong>Serpent's Hand:</strong> Anytime. I'll take you too, but only if you join us. Can't have Foundation members that know how to get <em>in</em>, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> Don't bother. I have to figure out a way out of this mess.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6422-1-4:</strong> Johnathan please-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> No you listen to me. It's no use coming with me they won't listen to you. They might listen to me and if they do we might be able to bring this place back. I've gotta fix this somehow. Go with this guy. He's not going to harm a hair on your body and it's better than being in this.</p>
<p><em>There is a brief pause, before SCP-6422-1-4 joins the other young SCP-6422-1 instances next to the Serpent's Hand member.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent's Hand:</strong> Second you leave line of sight I'll be taking these three to the library. I was about to give up on searching anyways. I think we're done here. Stay safe, pal.</p>

<p>No further evidence of the Serpent's Hand exists at Site 337 and their role in the incident is currently under investigation. At approximately 20:30 on 04/05/20██ the PSHUD units begin a final offensive up the eastern ridge in an attempt to take the PRF. It is unknown at this time whose initiative it was, but at 00:20 on 04/06/20██, a strong EMP event was detected in the area of Site 337. One final transmission is collected from Magpie immediately following this event.</p>

Magpie is currently unaccounted for and all attempts to trace their location after the events of Incident-6422-01 have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>No Foundation communications devices appear to have survived the EMP event. However, one final recording provided by Dr. ███ suggests that infighting once again broke out within Nu-7 before 06:23 on 04/06/20██:</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> Johnathan? Where have you been?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Wilson:</strong> We are the SCP Foundation. There are no 'buts' about SCP. It's what we do, and maybe if you'd been here doing real research instead of gallivanting off with some illiterates we'd have figured out how to turn this thing on our enemies by now!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███:</strong> We <em>are</em> the SCP Foundation! And We failed in our mission to secure and protect that village down the mountain! If Hammer Down hadn't been too busy having an internal dick measuring contest we could have saved hundreds of people!</p>

After a pause, Dr. ███ begins sobbing off screen for several minutes. The cave begins to brighten as the sun rises. Dr. ███ stops sobbing, and shuffling is heard as he moves to pick up the camera.

<p>At this point it was determined that the situation had escalated beyond control. By unanimous O5 decision Protocol 011213-Sandman was initiated, releasing a powerful lingering airborne hypnotic over Site 337. MTF Beta-7 "Maz Hatters" was deployed to perform cleanup and personnel recovery within the affected region. By this point the mechanisms of SCP-6422 were sufficiently well understood that a plan of action was capable of being put into place to minimize contact between MTF members during cleanup.</p>
<p>An estimated ████ casualties were reported, of which ████ were Foundation personnel. A total of ███ individuals involved in the event are currently unaccounted for, of which ██ are considered to be high priority targets. The incident cost an estimated $5.3 billion USD. After protracted negotiations with the GOC, Site 337 became Foundation property on 04/15/20██.</p>

<p>At 19:22 on 05/21/20██, Dr. Johnathan ███ was reported missing from the PRF during his shift. Evidence left behind suggested that Dr. ███ had gone into the valley in a violation of protocol. MTF-Zeta-7 "Marriage Counseling" was dispatched to track Dr. ███. At 23:46, Dr. ███ was successfully tracked to one of the buildings in the region originally inhabited by SCP-6422-1 instances, holding a small, woven basket, the contents of which are currently unknown. After being confronted, Dr. ███ left with minimal resistance. Dr. ███ was transferred from Site 337 into custody at Site ██ the following day.
