            <h1>SCP-2184</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2184</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Provisional Site-146 is constructed around the habitat of SCP-2184 for the sole purpose of its containment. Site-146 is surrounded by a 3 m tall steel fence equipped with security cameras to prevent unauthorized entry. The Site is disguised as a weapon test site used by the Russian Army. The only road leading to it is in the private use of a Foundation front organization. 3 Observation Posts are built around the border of Site-146.</p>
<p>The staff of Site-146 must be supplied with clothing and weaponry created using materials and technology available in 4000 BC. If SCP-2184 attempts to breach containment by leaving Site-146, it must be forced back with these tools.</p>
<p>The airspace above Site-146 is closed for non-Foundation aircrafts. Foundation aircrafts must maintain an altitude of at least 6 km above the Site. Personnel requiring the assistance of any artificial device (e.g. glasses, prostheses or a pacemaker) must not enter Site-146.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2184 is a steppe mammoth (<em>Mammuthus trogontherii</em>). Its height is approximately 12 m, making it three times taller than the largest known non-anomalous steppe mammoth specimen. SCP-2184 shows no sign of metabolism, growth or aging.</p>
<p>SCP-2184 affects all objects created with post-Stone Age technology. Such objects malfunction in the proximity of SCP-2184, and modern materials crumble away. Latest technologies are affected from the longest range. The only items capable of functioning in the close proximity of SCP-2184 are the ones that were made from natural materials using Stone Age technology. Table-2184-A lists the results of the experiments conducted to understand the effect of SCP-2184. Note that the distances in the table are approximate since precise measurement is problematic in the vicinity of SCP-2184.</p>

<p>SCP-2184 was discovered by Agent ████████ in ████ when he conducted a routine investigation to determine whether the mythology of the Siberian ████████-██████ tribe was based on the observation of anomalous objects or phenomena. Agent ████████ was given directions to the location where SCP-2184 was last seen, but the members of the tribe refused to accompany him. Agent ████████ confirmed the existence and anomalous nature of SCP-2184. When he approached the object, he lost all of his equipment including his own clothing, leaving him only with the leather cloak given to him by the tribesmen.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Theta-2 ("Cavemen") was created to track the movements of the object. In the first 5 years of its observation, SCP-2184 stayed in a 25 km x 30 km territory. Provisional Site-146 was built around this territory, in uninhabited taiga. The fence around the site is at least 10 km away from the nearest point where SCP-2184 was sighted. MTF Theta-2 was disbanded after the construction of Site-146 ended. During the Soviet era, access to Site-146 was granted to the Foundation under a secret pact made with high-ranking officers of the GRU Division "P".</p>

<p><strong>Sample Recovery and Experiment Log-2184-1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date: ██/██/████</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personnel:</strong> Agents ███████, ██████, and █████████ and D-53263.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Four spears and a bone knife were given to the Agents. All four personnel are given special clothing, resistant to the effect of SCP-2184.</p>
<p><strong>15:00</strong> The Agents and D-53263 left Observation Post-146-A to search for SCP-2184. To ensure his cooperation, D-53263 was told about armed guards stationed around the Site.<br/>
<strong>21:23</strong> Agent ███████'s watch stopped. Shortly after that D-53263 informed Agent █████████ about feeling intense pain on the chest. Agent █████████ noticed that the tattoo with D-53263's numerical designation disappeared, leaving minor wounds on his skin.<br/>
<strong>23:30 (approx.)</strong> SCP-2184 was sighted. All four personnel hid from SCP-2184, waiting for it to sleep.<br/>
<strong>1:00 (approx.)</strong> D-53263 was given the bone knife and instructed to collect a hair sample from the presumably dormant SCP-2184. D-53263 managed to collect the sample without waking SCP-2184, and gave it to Agent ██████. Following this, the additional spear was given to D-53263, and he was ordered to collect a blood sample from SCP-2184 with it. After a brief argument with the Agents, D-53263 agreed and approached the object with the spear. He stabbed SCP-2184's hind leg then started running. D-53263 stumbled in the dark, and started screaming incoherently until he was crushed by the awakened SCP-2184.<br/>
<strong>2:00 (approx.)</strong> The remains of the spear with the blood sample were collected by the Agents.<br/>
<strong>6:26</strong> The Agents arrived at Observation Post-146-A.<br/>
<strong>7:10</strong> Researchers noted that both samples inherited the technology-canceling effect of SCP-2184. The maximum range of the effect was 10 cm in both cases. Similarly to SCP-2184, the samples did not appear on the photographs taken of them. Further analysis of the samples was prevented by their anomalous effect.<br/>
<strong>14:45</strong> The samples lost their anomalous properties.</p>
<p>The samples were sent to Biological Research Area-12 for further analysis. They were determined to be indistinguishable from non-anomalous <em>M. trogontherii</em> samples.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Report on Containment Breach-2184-1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On ██/██/████ SCP-2184 left Site-146 due to unknown reasons. Field Agents attempted to stop its advance by starting a forest fire in front of it, planning on forcing it to turn back. However, the fire stopped when SCP-2184 approached it, allowing SCP-2184 to continue its movement. Later investigations concluded that the fire died out in SCP-2184's proximity because it was lit with modern technology: a match.</em></p>
<p><em>Following this, Field Agents ambushed SCP-2184. They wore clothing and were equipped with spears manufactured with primitive technology. SCP-2184 suffered only minor injuries and continued moving.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-2184's path passed through the village of █████████ (population: ████), located 55 km to the south of Site-146. The Foundation managed to evacuate 95% of the inhabitants before SCP-2184 arrived. All buildings and utilities were destroyed in the village during the incident. Amnestics were administered to the survivors, and a cover story about an earthquake was issued.</em></p>
<p><em>13 hours after it left the village, SCP-2184 unexpectedly stopped, stood still for 5 minutes then returned to Site-146 following its original path. The portion of Site-146's fence that was destroyed during the incident was replaced during the next week.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum-2184-1:</strong> Following Containment Breach-2184-1, weaponry and clothing for 100 personnel was prepared using primitive technology to ensure resistance to SCP-2184's effect. The items are stored at the Observation Posts built around Site-146. The termination of SCP-2184 with these tools is permitted in case it poses a major threat to the civilian population during a possible future containment breach.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2184-2:</strong> On ██/██/████ an attempt was made to permanently restrict SCP-2184's movement without causing major injuries to it in order to prevent future containment breaches and to permit easier experimentation with it. Using explosives, a 10 m deep pit was prepared inside Site-146, designed to allow for the safe capture of SCP-2184. Agents equipped with spears and torches (lit using flint and iron pyrite) drove SCP-2184 to the pit. When SCP-2184 reached the pit, the pit malfunctioned and allowed SCP-2184 walk through it without falling. During this incident SCP-2184 appeared to continue its movement above the hole by walking in the air.</p>
<p><em>The same result is expected even if we avoid explosives and use only shovels. Since digging a pit of such size is practically impossible without proper tools (especially in such terrain), no further attempts are to be made using this method.<br/>
