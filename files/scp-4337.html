<p>SCP-4337</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4337</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Thaumiel</span> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4337 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-59. Testing through Procedure 10-Inti may be carried out through an application to the site director, Dr. Lisle Naismith. Blank applications may be found at the Site-59 safe wing receptionist's desk. Test subjects may only be pulled from available D-class personnel that have been scheduled for termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4337 is a fixed-blade combat knife, 38 cm in length. A sand-engraved decal of three crescent moons is present on either side of the blade.</p>
<p>Through Procedure 10-Inti, SCP-4337 can cause an e-mailed form letter to appear in the inbox of the surviving participant after two hours. Due to the triple-crescent motif being analogous to other objects in Foundation custody (including <a href="/scp-3319">SCP-3319</a> and <a href="/scp-3922">SCP-3922</a>), the message is believed to be extradimensional in origin.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> On 12/21/2018, the location of the original instance of SCP-4337 was relayed to the Foundation in an e-mail from <a href="/scp-2578">SCP-2578</a>-D, on the grounds that the object's original owners were "senile cultists" that had been "using the device to make libelous claims."</p>
<p>SCP-4337 was recovered by Foundation Agents in a house in ██████████, Missouri. All three residents had been shot from orbit by SCP-2578-D ten hours prior to discovery; their bodies had not yet been found by local authorities. Seven adult corpses were discovered in the basement; cause of death had been sharp force trauma to the heart.</p>
<p>Documents recovered alongside SCP-4337 led to the formation of Procedure 10-Inti:</p>
<ol>
<li>One D-class subject ("Participant") is to be given a question by a second party ("Celebrant")</li>
<li>Immediately after, the celebrant is to stab the participant in the heart.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting message will attempt to answer the question.</p>
