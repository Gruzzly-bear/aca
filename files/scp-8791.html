<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its method of occurence and the relatively small sample size of affected parties, no containment measures for SCP-8791 are possible or necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8791 is a phenomenon that occurs after the death of an individual who holds belief in the existence of Ancient Egyptian deities. SCP-8791 will occur regardless of the individual's race, ethnicity, age, primary religion, and/or strength of their belief in said deities.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8791 was discovered via the Foundation's use of the Afterlife Recording Device (A.R.D.), an experimental device used by the Department of Tactical Theology to find potential afterlives within the Mnemosyne Expanse<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The individual that made the Foundation aware of SCP-8791 was <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6671">Agent Saeed Fakhoury</a>, who volunteered to be implanted with an A.R.D. and terminated in order to record the results.</p>

<p><em>(Agent Fakhoury turns to the source of the voice, revealing that they are on an ornate barque travelling down a river.

<p><strong>???:</strong> It has been a long while since anyone has ridden down the <em>Dū’at</em>'s Nile with me. You should consider yourself lucky, Saeed.</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> … Afu-Ra?</p>
<p><em>(The entity chuckles.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Good, it seems that your <em>Akh</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> has made it here perfectly intact.</p>

<p><em>(Afu-Ra gives Agent Fakhoury a smirk.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Have you forgotten the details of your life already, Saeed? <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6671">Sopdet</a> marked you, Kraken, and ███████ each as a Pharoah when you partook in her celebration. I think that is due cause enough for you to earn a seat on my barque.</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> I… This doesn't make any sense! I don't have any funerary texts, I wasn't mummified, I don't even have a <em>scarab</em>—!</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> <em>Calm yourself</em>, Saeed Abasi Fakhoury. <em>(chuckles)</em> The process has been, as you mortals say, streamlined a bit. Rest assured, you will be guaranteed safe passage through the <em>Dū’at</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> I… Okay…</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Good. Now, I must tend to the river. Please, feel free to enjoy the sights before we reach the first Gate.</p>

<p><strong>???:</strong> Afu-Ra. <em>(She bows.)</em> It seems you have a passenger. I can scarcely remember the last time it was so.</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> <em>(Laughs)</em> Indeed, Sia. You can thank Sopdet for that.</p>
<p><strong>Sia:</strong> Ah, of course… <em>(Clears her throat, then turns to the snake)</em> Desert-Protector, please be a dear and let our passengers through.</p>
<p><em>(The snake hisses once more, but acquiesces, unfurling themselves from the pillar and curling up by Sia's side. It glares at Agent Fakhoury.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> I… I don't think Desert-Protector likes me that much.</p>
<p><em>(Sia laughs uproariously.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sia:</strong> They were not chosen for their friendliness. But worry not; despite their blustering, they will bring no harm to you.</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> That's… reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Indeed. We must be going now, Sia. We've got a long journey ahead of us still.</p>

<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> Huh, there's no one here…</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Do not be so hasty, Saeed. Each Gate is a goddess in their own right, so the <em>Dū’at</em> is never truly unprotected. Now…</p>

<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> … I promise.</p>

<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> … Do I even <em>need</em> to sleep, here?</p>

<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> No… No, I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> … Were you, by chance, allergic to cats in life?</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> … Yeah, actually. Why do… you… ask?</p>
<p><em>(The barque comes to the eleventh gate. Resting on top of it is an enormous Egyptian Mau, who looks down at Afu-Ra and Agent Fakhoury, its tail swishing lazily from left to right and then back again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> Meeyuty…</p>
<p><strong>Meeyuty:</strong> <em>(Purrs, causing the area to rumble)</em> Afu-Ra. It's felt like aeons since you had a passenger on the Mesektet. What's the occassion?</p>
<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> I— <em>(Sneezes)</em> I'm a Pharaoh, technically.</p>
<p><strong>Meeyuty:</strong> My my, a Pharaoh after all these centuries. … Have the standards really fallen so low?</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> <em>(Warningly)</em> Meeyuty…</p>
<p><strong>Meeyuty:</strong> I jest, nothing more. Though, I suggest you do something about that cold, dear. It's unbecoming, especially in the presence of—</p>
<p><strong>Afu-Ra:</strong> <em>(Clears their throat)</em> May you please allow us passage?</p>
<p><strong>Meeyuty:</strong> <em>(Meows)</em> So impatient. Very well, you may pass…</p>
<p><em>(Meeyuty taps a paw against the gate, before leaping down off of it and trotting to an unknown location. The barque enters uneventfully afterward.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Agent Fakhoury finds himself in a vast room, wherein 21 animal-headed deities each line against the left- and rightmost sides. In the front of the room sits a pure golden scale, with a single ostrich feather placed on one end. Standing beside it is a tall deity with the head of a jackal, and next to them lays a creature resembling a <strong>Crocodylus niloticus</strong><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup>.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Fakhoury:</strong> Oh, right, of course.</p>
