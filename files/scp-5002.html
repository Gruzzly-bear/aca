<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The remains of SCP-5002 are to be held in a secure body tray in the Site-06 morgue. A further autopsy may be requested on the authority of the Department of Analytics.</p>

<p>SCP-5002 was a "Type Green" reality-bending humanoid known as Emma Hastings. According to United Kingdom government records, SCP-5002 was born in 1978, and resided in Tewkesbury, England. SCP-5002 was self-employed as an author of detective fiction, and had published 10 novels through Joffe Books.</p>
<p>When SCP-5002 re-read a published copy of one of its own works, the events described in that text would occur in reality. Actual events would transpire in parallel with the narrative, with some altered details (for example, names, dates and locations) but a similar overall sequence of events. SCP-5002 claimed to be unaware of the anomaly before commencement of Foundation containment and testing.</p>
<p>Foundation specialists detected the correspondence between UK police reports and works by SCP-5002 in January 2017, before public awareness of the anomaly. SCP-5002 was taken into Foundation custody in February 2017, and was contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Wing G of Site-06.</p>
<p>On 14 December 2019, at approximately 7:00am, SCP-5002 was discovered in bed, deceased. The containment cell was locked, and no evidence of forced entry was found. Electronic records from the Wing G Security Station confirm that that door was not unlocked at any stage over the preceding 12 hours, and the cell's security cameras recorded only SCP-5002 in the cell during that period. Site-wide security reports showed that the Scranton Reality Anchors installed in Wing G remained operational during this period.</p>
<p>Agent Ellen O'Connor, of the Department of Analytics, was instructed to conduct an investigation into the neutralisation of SCP-5002.</p>

<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Ladies and Gentlemen, please. Agent O'Connor, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Thank you, Site Director, everyone. I appreciate you taking time out of your day.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Shut it, you!</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Yeah, why is he here? He didn't come to yesterday's update.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Michael, let Agent O'Connor speak. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> No need to apologise, Dr. Yau. I understand his concern. Actually, there is someone even more unlikely that I would have included today, if it were possible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> You don't mean -</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Indeed I do, Dr. Yau. Yesterday's update was for the benefit of those Site-06 personnel with a connection to the containment of Emma Hastings. But today will be somewhat different. Today, with one exception, this room contains all of the people who were present in Wing G on the night that Ms. Hastings was killed.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> You mean the night that SCP-5002 was neutralised.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> No. She was an anomalous human being, but she was nevertheless a human being. She deserves justice. And so today I will prove that one of you was her killer!</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> That can't be right. I thought –</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Director, if I may, let me start at the beginning. With the incident that led to SCP-5002's containment.</p>

<p><strong>LSE MURDER: POLICE "BAFFLED"</strong></p>
<p>London Metropolitan Police have admitted having no leads in the murder of PhD student Kate Holloway, and have appealed to the public for any information which may assist the investigation. Holloway, 23, was found beaten to death in her office at the London School of Economics last Monday. The office was locked from the inside, and no murder weapon has been recovered.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Hogan-Howe asked members of the public with any knowledge relevant to the case to come forward, and created a dedicated phone number for anonymous tips. A source at the Met has described the killing as "baffling", and confessed that detectives are struggling to make progress. Private Investigator Cameron Blackwell, known for solving the Kensington Diamonds mystery, has been brought in to assist enquiries.</p>
<p>Grieving parents Peter and Evelyn Holloway spoke at the press conference of their love for their daughter, describing her as …</p>

<strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Security Officer Joseph Lowry</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Thank you, Officer Lowry.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Please, call me Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Officer Lowry, you are the regular overnight security official for Wing G, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> You really can call me Joe, you know. I'm trying to help, here.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Could you please answer the question, officer?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Fine. Yes, I am usually on night duty. You want my employee number, or what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> No, thank you. And you discovered the body of SCP-5002 this morning, did you not?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Could you please describe how that occurred?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Sure, lady. So I clock off at 7:30am, but my last job is to get D-4986 from his cell and take him to the kitchenette for breakfast. At 7am I left the Security Station, walked past the containment cells to 4986's cell, then walked him back up towards the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> D-4986 is held in Wing G itself. Is that usual?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Not really, I guess. Most of the D-Class are in central accommodations, but he's assigned to Wing G testing, so we have him in a spare containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I see. Was that Dr. Yau's decision?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> About the testing, yes, but all the room allocations come from Central.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Meaning the Site Director?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> I suppose so. 4986 just lucked out with the low-risk humanoids, like the rest of us. I was walking back past the cells, rattling the doors, and I -</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Sorry to interrupt, officer. Could you please explain what you mean by "rattling the doors"?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Oh, right. I just kinda give 'em a quick shake, check they're properly locked. It's a little habit of mine, every time I walk past. Just making sure. Anyway, I got to SCP-5002's cell, and I noticed something odd.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I understood that the door was locked?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Yeah, locked tight. No, the odd part was not hearing anything. Usually 5002 would yell some shit at me when I'd come past. When she didn't, I got suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Is it possible that she didn't hear you?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> No. I always give that b – I give 5002's door an extra hard shake, you know? Nice and noisy.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I take it you didn't get along with SCP-5002?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Oh, I see what you're trying to do. No, I didn't like her. No-one here did. You ask Michael, ask 4986. SCP-5002 was a stuck-up … she was a real piece of work. Thought she was better than anyone else here. She's so smart, why is she in containment?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Okay. So you didn't hear a response when you shook the door on your walk past?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Not in either direction. I secured the D-Class, then opened the viewing plate to SCP-5002's cell. I could see her lying in bed, but there was blood all over the blanket. Well, I didn't know it was blood yet, but it looked bad.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What did you do next?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> I ran to Karen's room – that's Dr. Yau – and asked for her key-card. Then I went back to the containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Why did Dr. Yau give you her key-card? Isn't that a violation of security protocol?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Not in an emergency, which this was. Anyway, I don't know what it's like where you work, but in this Wing, we're a team. We trust each other. Dr. Yau knows she can depend on me, and she was right behind me, in any case. Now can I tell you what I found, or do you want to ask more pointless questions?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> When I opened the containment cell, SCP-5002 didn't move. And before you ask, it's not a breach of containment procedures, because SCP-5002's anomaly only works when she's writing, which she clearly wasn't. And her cell has an SRA, too. I walked slowly to the bed, weapon drawn, but I could see there was a lot of blood, and she wasn't breathing. I checked her pulse: nothing. So I rolled her over, and that's when Karen came in. She saw SCP-5002's chest, and started screaming.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you think her alarm was authentic?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Of course! This is a rough job, and I've heard a lot of screams. Karen was shocked. She is always professional, but she has a kind heart.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What happened next?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> I took Karen outside and calmed her down, and then I waited at the containment chamber while she went to the Security Station to call the Site Director and the Medical Officer.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Chief Medical Officer Nadine Grossenbacher</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Describe the scene when you arrived, please.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> I arrived at around 7:45. Joseph Lowry was waiting at the door of the containment chamber. Their D-Class was secured in the hallway, for some reason – he is an unpleasant man, I think, much worse than the previous one. D-2825, that poor girl. Lowry showed me the body of SCP-5002, lying on the bed. He took the D-Class away and came back later, while I examined the corpse. I noted a large amount of dried blood on the blankets, particularly on the area around SCP-5002's torso.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> In your opinion, what was the likely cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> I am yet to conduct a full autopsy, but my opinion at this time is that the victim died from severe trauma to the heart and lungs, caused by multiple stab wounds. I would estimate SCP-5002 was stabbed at least ten times in the chest, neck and shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Probably by a right-handed individual, slightly taller than her?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Very perceptive of you. Yes, that would be my hypothesis, based on the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Not that it helps much in narrowing the list of suspects. Could you let me know the type of weapon that was likely used?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Certainly. It appears that the victim was stabbed with a sharp, pointed blade – not terribly long.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Something like your scalpel, then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Aha, perhaps, detective. I would think a common kitchen knife is just as likely.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Indeed. Did you observe anything else unusual in your examination of the body?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> No. I could see no obvious defensive wounds. I surmise that the assailant either knew the victim or surprised and overpowered her. I performed a check with a sexual assault evidence kit for completeness, but there were no conclusive results. I had just finished this check when Dr. Yau arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It had been some time then, since she called you to Wing G?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Yes, she was away reporting to the Site Director. I can imagine that would not have been comfortable, especially given the Director's views on SCP-5002.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Could you elaborate, please?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Of course, although this is merely – what is the phrase? – hearsay. I understand that the Site Director had a particular interest in SCP-5002, and that Dr. Yau was under quite some pressure to produce results.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> We're all under pressure, doctor. Do you really think this was unusual?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> How shall I say this? Agent, there are some confidences which I cannot betray. But I recognise the importance of your work. All I can say is to encourage you in strong terms to speak to the Site Director about this matter, and her involvement with this Wing. Certainly Dr. Yau appeared rather upset when I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Interesting. Finally, doctor, could you please let me know your estimate for the time of death?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Again, this will be more accurate once the autopsy is complete, but for present purposes I would estimate that SCP-5002 was killed between 1:00am and 3:00am last night.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And where were you between those times?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Very good. I was sleeping, detective, in my room in the Medical Wing. And I'm afraid you will have to take my word for it –there are still some areas of this building which are free from those staring cameras, thank god!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Something to hide, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Of course not. I have no secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> This is the Foundation, doctor. Everyone has secrets.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Security Officer Joseph Lowry</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Tell me about the Wing G Security Station, please.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> No problem. It sits on the corner, so I have a clear view of both hallways – down past the containment chambers towards the main doors, and in the other direction towards the staff quarters and the kitchenette. I have video screens for each of the containment chambers, and the system keeps a record of any key-card access – both to the cells and the main doors to Wing G.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You mentioned that your shift ends at 7:30am. What time did you start last night?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> 11:30pm, same as always.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That's a long shift. You were at the Station the whole time?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Yes. Well, except for my smoke break.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Don't give me that look. This is low-risk containment, and Dr. Yau approved it. Everyone knows, I go at 2am every night, I have a smoke, I come back, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And how long would you say you were away last night?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Ten, maybe fifteen minutes? Same as any night. And once I lock the main doors behind me, no-one can get into Wing G without my buzzer going off, so I'd know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> So no-one from outside could have accessed Wing G while you were gone? It could only have been someone already inside?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> No. Unless, well, Level 5 clearance perhaps. I don't know whether I get notified of that – it's never come up.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Speaking of clearance, tell me about the key-cards. You have access to the main doors, but not the containment chambers, right?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Except for the D-Class cell, yeah, that's right. Karen is the only one with key-card access to the skips.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And did she access them last night?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> No, the door records are clear for the whole night. I checked before you arrived – we have to send records up to Central each day. Between the start of my shift and when I fetched D-4986 in the morning, none of the cells were unlocked, and I was the only one to open the main doors, at 2am, like I said. To be honest, I didn't see anyone last night – I think Karen and Michael had gone to their rooms before I started.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> How about the cameras?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Nothing out of the ordinary. SCP-5002 was asleep when I got in – the day guard said she'd gone to bed around 11pm. SCP-████ and SCP-████ were quiet in their cells, D-4986 wasn't doing much. The whole thing makes no sense. SCP-5002's cell was locked, the Wing was locked, I didn't see anyone, the camera didn't see anyone. How the hell was she killed?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That's why I'm here, officer.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Really. You Sherlock Holmes or something?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Actually, Foundation investigations are rather more difficult. Sherlock Holmes, unlike me, could afford to eliminate the impossible.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>door opening, sounds of raised voices</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I'm sorry, Agent. I thought you should know, we found one of the staff trying to leave Wing G without your permission.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> You know, now that I think of it, maybe Karen made a copy of her key-card. So someone else could have had access to SCP-5002.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Really? Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Michael Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Mike Simpson.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Junior Researcher Michael Simpson</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> This is ridiculous! You can't just lock me up here like some kind of D-Class!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'm sorry, Michael – can I call you Michael? Unfortunately I can't let anyone leave Wing G until I've finished my interviews. You understand, right?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> But when will you be finished? I have an urgent appointment scheduled for this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Could you let me know who it's with? Perhaps I can help reschedule it.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> No! Sorry, I'm afraid it's a private matter – a classified matter! I can't discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Okay, that's fine. I understand. Well, shall we speak now – try to get things over with more quickly?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Uh-huh, yes, that would be good. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> No problem, Michael. Let's start with last night. Where were you between midnight and this morning?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I was in my quarters, working late on my thesis. It's due in a few months' time.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Can't be easy, working on that at the same time as research. And how about this morning, when SCP-5002 was discovered?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I was in the kitchenette, finishing breakfast. I heard Joe shaking SCP-5002's door, both times.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> From the kitchenette? He must really be quite loud, then.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Yes, you'd hear it anywhere. It's a bit annoying actually. Although it's weird …</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What is, Michael?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Nothing. Just, uh, thinking about how sound travels. After the door banging, I heard running in the corridor, then Karen screamed.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Interesting. And you were in the kitchenette this whole time. You know that we found one of the kitchen knives in the dishwasher there. Did you use it?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> What? No! I mean, it was there when I got there. I never touched it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Okay, no problem. Unfortunately it had been through a full cycle, so it was nice and clean. And after you heard Dr. Yau scream?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I went down to the containment chamber. Joe was holding Karen by the shoulders, trying to keep her calm. D-4986 said something – I didn't hear what. Joe wouldn't let me into the containment chamber, but what I saw – ugh. Even it doesn't deserve that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It? You mean SCP-5002? Funny, everyone else here uses her name, or at least gives her a personal pronoun.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I know they do. But that's not what they are, is it? They're not people. They're not our friends. They're anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That seems a little harsh.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> It's protocol. That thing is SCP-5002 – no different from SCP-1571, or SCP-1207, or any of the other anomalies in containment. Just because it moves and talks, doesn't mean it should be treated differently.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I take it you didn't have a close relationship with SCP-5002?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I conducted intensive testing with the entity over an extended period. That's all.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Hmm. You're right about an extended period. Testing had been going for some time. Was Dr. Yau under pressure to produce some results?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Maybe. I saw a few memos from the Director which seemed a bit over the top. Requesting updates, samples, I don't know what. Karen doesn't really get stressed, though. She's a great boss – probably the best supervisor I've had. She gets me properly involved in the research, lets me work independently -</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Is that why she gave you a copy of her key-card?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Oh. Yes, I guess so. But I've almost never used it. It's just…</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Just in case?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Um, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> All right. Why don't you tell me a little more about your testing with SCP-5002.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 14 May 2017</p>

Officer Joseph Lowry – Security Officer, Wing G<br/>
D-2825 – D-Class Personnel, Wing G</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002 Test Text:</strong> <tt>The D-Class then walked over to the machine and pressed the buttons, in the following order: Red, Green, Red, Green, Green, Green, Red, Red, Green, Red, Red, Green, and then she stopped.</tt></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;<em>video commences</em>&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Dr. Yau and J-R Simpson stand in the Wing G Secure Lab. Next to them, SCP-5002 sits at a lab bench.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Test number SCP-5002-7-R, 14 May 2017. Time is … 11:45pm.</p>
<p><strong>D-2825:</strong> &lt;<em>off-camera</em>&gt; Why are – why are we doing this at night-time? Ow!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> So you get the pleasure of my company, missy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Gently, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Sorry doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Please do call me Karen. And it's okay. D-2825 has done this before; she knows the procedure. Although we've decided night testing is probably best to minimise any risk of interference from other ontological anomalies on the site.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> &lt;<em>to Dr. Yau</em>&gt; Secure Lab SRAs are offline. &lt;<em>to camera</em>&gt; This test will focus on two factors – firstly, the presence of the entity in the same physical space as the test subject, and also the possibility of the entity employing a multi-use text.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> You can use her name, Michael.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>J-R Simpson adjusts the camera so that both SCP-5002 and D-2825 are in shot. Officer Lowry stands next to the D-Class. There is a table placed 1m in front of D-2825, close to camera. On top of the table is a black box with two electronic buttons, red and green.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Joe, please release D-2825 from her restraints.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> She was behaving weirdly in her cell earlier. Are you sure that's wise?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> It's fine, Joe – please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> You're the boss, doctor – Karen.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Officer Lowry removes the handcuffs and steps away from D-2825, who remains still. J-R Simpson places a small bound booklet on the bench in front of SCP-5002, avoiding physical or eye contact with SCP-5002.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> The entity will now read the prepared test text.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Really, Michael. &lt;<em>to SCP-5002</em>&gt; Would you, please?</p>
<p>&lt;<em>SCP-5002 opens the booklet and reads the test text. D-2825 walks to the electronic box, and presses the buttons in the sequence described in the text.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> That is fascinating. I can't believe what you made me write from a punctuation perspective, but it's extraordinary to see that in action.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Test participants shall remain silent at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Forgive my colleague. &lt;<em>to D-2825</em>&gt; How do you feel, dear?</p>
<p><strong>D-2825:</strong> I – I feel okay, I guess. What is she reading?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> The story of your life, it seems. Has she been here for all my previous readings?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> The entity will now re-read the same text.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>SCP-5002 stares at J-R Simpson, then looks down and reads from the booklet. D-2825 remains still, watching SCP-5002.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> No effect. That is in accordance with our hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> You think it only happens once per book?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Test participants shall remain silent at all times!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Tell me, researcher, are <em>you</em> a test participant?</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Officer Lowry laughs. Dr. Yau smiles. J-R Simpson snatches the booklet from the lab bench.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> The entity will now read a separate copy of the same text.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>J-R Simpson places a second booklet onto the lab bench. SCP-5002 picks it up and begins to read. D-2825 remains standing near the table, and does not touch the buttons.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No effect from separate copies.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> We have to assume it is reading as instructed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I think that is a safe assumption, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Then we will proceed with this evening's final test.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>J-R Simpson takes the second booklet from the bench, and marks it using a standard Foundation redaction pen. J-R Simpson then holds the booklet open to the camera. The redacted test text reads as set out below.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Redacted test text:</strong> <tt>███ D-Class ████ walked ████ to ███ machine ███ pressed ███ buttons, ██ the █████████ order: ████ Green, ████ Green, ██████ Green, ████ Red, ██████ Red, ████ Green, ███ then ███ stopped.</tt></p>
<p>&lt;<em>J-R Simpson checks the redactions with Dr. Yau, then places the redacted text in front of SCP-5002.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> The entity will now read the redacted test text.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> God, what a mess. Yes, yes, participants silent, I get it.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>SCP-5002 reads from the redacted booklet. D-2825 presses the buttons on the black box in the following order: Green, Green, Green, Red, Red, Green. This matches the redacted text of the booklet. D-2825's movements appear jerky and unco-ordinated.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Reading of amended text successfully reproduced the anomalous effect.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Wonderful. That opens up a new avenue to consider. &lt;<em>to D-2825</em>&gt; How are you feeling?</p>
<p>&lt;<em>D-2825 appears to be weeping.</em>&gt;<br/>
<strong>D-2825:</strong> I didn't want to touch the buttons, but I did. Why did I touch them? What did she do?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> The test is now complete. Officer, you may restrain the D-Class.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Officer Lowry moves forward to handcuff D-2825. She attempts to resist, but is successfully restrained.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>D-2825:</strong> No! The test isn't over - I don't want to go! Don't send me back there!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> I told you she was trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Can you take her back to her cell? Carefully, please.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Of course, I've got her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Thank you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> You're most welcome.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Officer Lowry leaves the room with D-2825, who struggles weakly.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Poor thing. I might call Dr. Grossenbacher. Michael, can you escort Ms. Hastings back to her chamber?</p>
<p>&lt;<em>J-R Simpson appears briefly shocked. He then gestures for SCP-5002 to follow him from the lab, and walks to the camera to turn it off.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> I wonder what would have happened if she had been restrained when I started reading?</p>
<p>&lt;<em>video ends</em>&gt;</p>

<strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Senior Researcher Karen Yau</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Thank you for your time, Dr. Yau. Can I start by asking for your thoughts about SCP-5002?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> As an anomaly, or as a test subject?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Whichever you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Well, the anomaly is a bit finicky. It took us some time to work out how to elicit the effect – what precisely led to the written work being instantiated. Any new written works are produced in containment, subject to the reality anchor, and are only sent for <em>publication</em> once they have been thoroughly reviewed by us, and cross-checked by RAISA, to make sure they have no unintended consequences. It's very time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I saw there was a manuscript recovered from the containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Yes, SCP-5002 had written a novel. We suggested it, thought it might allow for more detailed analysis. While it would take time to prepare, a more substantial work could shed some light on the level of specificity in which the anomaly manifests in reality. I can't believe what we've lost, in terms of the research time.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What was the novel about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Not something from her usual oeuvre, of course, for safety's sake. We needed something we could test, so it was about the daily life and psychology of a D-Class subject. Nothing violent or dramatic. It was slower, more meditative than her other books. Almost pastoral.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And she didn't have any unauthorised written work? Nothing resembling the events of her death?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No. We really were quite careful about that. This was completely shocking.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> So it didn't resemble any of her past work either?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Not in any detail. In any case, the effect only works once for each written work that SCP-5002 reads after publication. Re-reading the same thing won't repeat the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> How was SCP-5002 as a test subject?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> She was co-operative with experimentation. Even collaborative. She appeared relatively well-adjusted to containment, no history of aggression or escape attempts. Intelligent, honest, self-assured.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It almost sounds as if you liked her, Dr. Yau.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>coughing</em>&gt; I dare say if the circumstances had been different, I might have, Agent O'Connor.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you give her special privileges?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> The Jack Daniels in her cell. Was that your authorisation?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No, absolutely not. I try to treat my subjects fairly, Agent O'Connor, but I'm not stupid. Emma never had access to alcohol or drugs of any kind. We search her cell regularly, and I'm sure no-one in my team would have given them to her.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Not everyone in your team got along with her, did they?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> You mean Joe? Oh he acts tough, likes to wind the skips up now and then, but he's a big softy really. He wouldn't do – well, anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And Michael Simpson? He seemed very cold towards SCP-5002.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Yes, I guess he was. It's funny, he never spoke with her outside testing, never called her Emma. I would have said he was just the straight-laced type, but he wasn't always like that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> No?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> When he first joined me, he was more relaxed. Something changed a few weeks after he started, after Emma arrived. Like he withdrew.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Do you know why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I'm afraid not. I was worried for him, but there was nothing in his regular psych tests, other than a bit of stress.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Could I have a copy of those tests, please?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Sorry – I review them, but then they're held centrally. You could ask the Site Director, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That reminds me. Michael's stress: could it have been from pressure to get results on SCP-5002?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; I don't know about that. We work hard, but we try not to apply too much pressure here.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Not from the Site Director?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No, not that I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Are you sure? The Medical Officer mentioned something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Dr. Grossenbacher might be thinking of another wing: she's always on the move, in and out.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Is she in Wing G regularly?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Just now and then, any bangs or scrapes the skips might get. It's much less often since she was promoted to CMO for the whole site.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That was quite a recent promotion, yes? And rapid. What is your opinion on her work?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I think she has been excellent. She is responsive, helpful. Her psych evals are fair, and she accepts my input. And she genuinely cares about people, which I respect. We had a D-Class last year, D-2825, who suffered a breakdown. Horrible, really. Screaming, unable to sleep. Eventually she had to be replaced, but Dr. Grossenbacher did great work with her. She was here quite a lot back then.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> But Dr. Grossenbacher doesn't have access to Wing G?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No. She buzzes in at the main doors like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Right. You and Officer Lowry are the only ones with access to the security system.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> That's correct. Joe has read access only for the cameras and door records, and I have the only key-card for the containment cells.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Except for the one you gave Michael?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Oh, yes. Sorry. But he never uses it – I don't think I've ever seen it on the records.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And he couldn't have lost it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No, I'm sure he's more careful than that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Hmm. Okay. Could you please talk me through your movements last night and this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Yes. I was back in my quarters before Joe came on shift. I probably went to sleep around midnight, maybe a little after.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And you didn't come out of your room after that time? No-one came in, you didn't hear anything?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> No, no. I woke up at 6:30, and was just cleaning my teeth when Joe knocked hard on the door. He asked for my key-card, said there was an emergency with SCP-5002. I gave him the card, spat out my toothpaste and followed him down the corridor. I, when I -</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Take your time, Dr. Yau.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> It was horrible. I screamed, I think. When I saw her, all the blood. You must think I'm pathetic, but it's a pretty quiet life on Wing G. We don't usually – I haven't – nothing like that. Joe must have walked me out. I remember his hands on my shoulders, he was saying something. My head was spinning. I saw Michael run up. And then I heard him!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Who?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> D-4986. Agent O'Connor, I don't like to point fingers, but I know I'm right about this. I will never forget the look on his face, and what he said. "Looks like that bitch got what was coming to her."</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That's hardly evidence, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Oh I know that. But tell me, do you know why he ended up as a D-Class?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 14 December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> D-4986</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Seven convictions for murder. One for aggravated assault and wounding. Three other murders suspected but not charged. All stabbed multiple times in the chest and belly.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Yeah, 'at's right. I done 'em all. And believe you me, I'd do it again. Every fucking one of 'em deserved what they got.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you kill SCP-5002?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> But you wanted her dead.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Fuck yes. I'm glad she's dead. I would have killed her if I could.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> You're asking me why? Jesus, why the fuck d'ya think? That bitch spent the last year torturing me. I hate her.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What do you mean, torturing you?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> You seen the tests? Have you? She's a monster. I don't let no-one push me around, but her – if she read it in one of her books, she could make me do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What things?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Anything! Running on a treadmill until I collapsed. I said all sorts of bollocks I would never say. She made me fall asleep in the middle of the afternoon. And every time, it felt like I was choosing it. I thought I was in control, but it was always her. That vindictive shit and Yau – <em>call me Karen</em> – they were in it together.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> She was helping Yau, suggesting new tests. Humiliating things. She would make me cry and beg forgiveness. Or start to strip off in the lab. She made me grab a wire I thought was electrified. One test, she read aloud, just so I would know she was forcing me to move. I think she got off on it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And you hated her for it.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Yes, but you don't get it! I didn't just hate her, I was fucking terrified of her! I wasn't me any more. One time I lost it, refused to leave my cell, fought the guard, chucked up my breakfast. Afterwards I find out it was all her – all of it, something she wrote. That proper messed me up. How could I trust anything? I couldn't trust myself. I mean, no wonder the D-2825 went batshit. How would you be if every action, every decision, every thought could have been put there by someone else? So of course I'm glad she's dead. Finally I know for sure that this is me!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> But you didn't kill her?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> In my cell. Where the fuck else would I be? They got cameras, don't they?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Before today, when were you last in the kitchenette?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> &lt;<em>pause</em>&gt; I don't know. Dinner last night.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you take a knife from the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> No. There's the guard watching me, and they do them checks on my cell.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> What is your opinion of Joseph Lowry?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> He's not as mean as some of them, but he's an arsehole. Although never when Yau's around, the suck up. Why are you asking me this shit?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Someone was stabbed to death, and you're the only knife murderer around here.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> So you say. What if that bitch made me do those murders too? And anyway, I was locked in my cell, 5002 was locked in hers, and no-one has a key. Shouldn't you be talking to the fucker who can walk through walls?</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-████</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-████ is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, fitted with a Scranton Reality Anchor which is to be active at all times. In case of SRA malfunction or ineffectiveness, SCP-████ is to be immediately sedated and kept under sedation until effective containment can be reconstituted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-████ is a 34-year-old humanoid entity capable of passing through solid matter at will. SCP-████ was known as Robert Gates, and was resident in Carlisle, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>SCP-████'s anomalous properties are limited to its body and clothing, and do not extend to other objects. Testing has not revealed any limits to the material through which SCP-████ can pass without effect. For full details please review Test Logs A-K below.</p>
<p>Prior to Foundation containment, SCP-████ was implicated in the rapes and sexual assaults of more than thirty women. The victims were typically assaulted in their homes, with no evidence of entry or egress by SCP-████. Several victims were attacked on multiple occasions over a period of weeks or months.</p>
<p>SCP-████ displays evidence of pronounced Antisocial Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder …<br/></p>

<strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 15 December 2019</strong>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-████</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> I know why you're here.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Do you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> You want to know whether I killed her. Emma. Whether I slid that knife between her ribs and watched her life pour out.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Are you trying to impress me with how much you know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Are you trying to conceal your fear by acting tough? People talk, detective. Especially when they are around what they think of as animals, or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And you want to be recognised as human.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Oh I'm quite comfortable being called an animal. Especially by prey.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Even a predator is harmless if it is caged.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> And you think I'm caged, do you? You think I can't walk out of here whenever I want, do whatever I want?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Your testing log suggests otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Your precious reality anchors, I presume. I can tell you what they're worth, detective.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Then why not leave right now? Impress me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> You tell yourself that I can't, but there's a part of you that isn't sure. You actually want me to show you. Even if I walked straight through that wall, at least you have certainty. You would have something to hold on to. But I can't be held, detective. I don't want you impressed. I want you doubting.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That sounds like an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Then why is your voice wavering? Everyone thinks they can conceal it, but predators sense fear. You can't hide from me, detective. No one can.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you kill Emma Hastings?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Right to the point, no smart comments? Fine. I can satisfy your curiosity. No, I did not kill her. Frenzied stabbing is not really my style. It's so erratic. So uncontrolled.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did you attack her? Try to rape her?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> No. Her anomaly was quite limited, but there was no need to risk interaction with it. There are plenty of weaker targets here for me. Plenty that no-one will miss.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You were scared of her, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> No, detective, but I have read her test logs. Dr. Yau really shouldn't leave files lying around in her quarters at night. Emma might have tried to threaten me with her abilities, such as they were. I wasn't scared of her, but she wouldn't have been afraid of me.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And it's fear that you get off on, of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> Of course! You can't possibly know what it's like. Knowing that those women are always thinking of me. Looking for me. Never feeling safe, not behind walls, not at any time. I break them, and I can watch them crumble. Because of me. I am part of them, always.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You're a sick bastard.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SCP-████:</strong> That sounded quite emotional, detective. Are you imagining how they felt? Do you want to know how it feels? If I want to be inside a woman, I don't need to open her up with a knife. I can just reach right into her, anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That's enough. You're no use to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-████:</strong> I'll think of you, when I next walk through the site. Tell me, detective, where do you sleep?</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Interview Transcripts – SCP-5002 Neutralisation Investigation – 15 December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Site Director Evelyn May</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Sorry to disturb you, Director.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> No, it's fine, Agent. I appreciate the importance. It's just – have you ever had too much to manage, be completely worn out, and then more and more disasters pile up? I mean, yesterday someone opened a Way just outside the Site grounds. A massive security risk. I can tell you no-one went in or out, but it's still a huge amount of paperwork. Anyway, that's not your problem. How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Well, it's a slightly sensitive matter. I'm wondering whether you could authorise me to review the SRA records for Wing G. I want to see whether there have been any malfunctions or unusual activity.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> How did – oh. Of course she did. She got what she wanted. I guess you may as well know. RAISA will have my arse for this, either way.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> This is purely for my investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> &lt;<em>sighing</em>&gt; Yes, there have been some issues with the anchors in Wing G. Some malfunctions, even some outright failures. I admit, I have been limiting dissemination of that information - editing the security reports. I didn't think there would be any problems, but now - god. Do you think it's connected – that Gates had something to do with SCP-5002's murder?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'm not sure. SCP-████ could go through walls, but he couldn't have brought a knife with him.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Perhaps it was already in the cell? SCP-5002 may have stolen it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Hmm, perhaps. But I'd like to review the records, in any case.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> I'll see what I can do. I can tell you that there was never an issue with SCP-5002's anchor – the inside of her cell was anomaly free.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> The inside of her cell. What about the walls?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> No, I don't think the anchors extend beyond the chamber interior. But the SRA issues only affected other cells - SCP-████, SCP-████, some of the unoccupied chambers, perhaps. SCP-5002 was definitely contained. The records should confirm that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Thanks. Can I also request the latest psychiatric evaluations from Wing G?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> I can get you the summaries, at least. May I ask why you need them?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Dr. Yau mentioned that her junior researcher might be under some stress.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> That sounds like Karen. Always the soft heart.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I had the impression that the source of that stress might be you. Did you put pressure on Dr. Yau and her team for results from SCP-5002? Requests for updates, memos, that sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Maybe, but I don't think it was anything beyond the ordinary. It's not like Karen's results have been immediate, but I have no issue with that at all.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Despite your connection with SCP-5002? I read you were part of the team that identified Emma Hastings as the source of anomalous effects, and you supervised her original recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> I've been involved in the analysis and recovery of many anomalies over my career, agent. I hope you're not accusing me of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'd just like to rule you out. Your clearance means you have access to the containment chambers and the security records across all Wings.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> But only once the camera footage and door records are sent up from the Wings. If I <em>had</em> been there, Karen and the security officer would have seen me on film, and seen my key-card access.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Even at Level 5? I hadn't realised that. Thank you for your help, Director. Finally, just for completeness, could you please tell me where you were after midnight on the fourteenth?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> I was travelling back from a meeting in London. I arrived back at the Site at around 3am.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Can your driver confirm that?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> I wasn't using my driver, agent. This was a private meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Ah. I'm sorry, may I ask who the meeting was with?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> It was nothing to do with the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> &lt;<em>pause</em>&gt; I would like to confirm with any attendees, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> &lt;<em>sighing</em>&gt; Fine. I'm surprised Nadine didn't tell you this as well. If you must know, I was meeting with my divorce lawyer. The mediation is coming up in the new year, and he wanted to plan. I'll give you his details.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'm sorry to pry, Director.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> No, it's okay. I know it's your job. It's just – I'm tired, you know? Peter and I, we haven't – we weren't able to … We lost our daughter, Agent O'Connor. He has tried, we both did, but – well, the mediation is in January. So I was in London, and then back to the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And then to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Eventually, yes. Until the alarm at six, and the next day's catastrophes to deal with. Would you believe I already had three other emergencies on my desk by the time Dr. Yau called.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> That's a lot in just an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> No, it was a bit longer than that. Karen didn't call until after half seven. Maybe a little after.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Really? The body was discovered just after 7am. I thought Dr. Yau had called you immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> No, I'm quite sure it was later. You said she might have been stressed; if she was, perhaps she put off calling me?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Hmm. I might need to check with her.</p>

<p><strong>Interview No.:</strong> SCP-5002-56</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 May 2019</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Karen Yau</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> How do you feel the novel is coming along?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Not bad. It's hard to tell until it's finished, but I am relatively satisfied so far. Of course, it's only for an audience of two.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Is that important to you, how your readers react?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Yes and no. I started writing because I needed to, but I would be lying if I said I didn't savour the reaction of a captivated reader. Sometimes it's like I'm writing two things simultaneously – one for the audience and a more personal meaning for myself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Are you saying you understood the effect of what you were writing? That you were creating events for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> You ask that question a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I find it increasingly important. And you keep avoiding it. Were you deliberately controlling the characters in your novels?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Who controls whom? If a musician plays a piece, we don't say that the composer "controlled" the notes that we hear. My characters are just lines of music, and the readers bring them to life.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> You're saying that the reader manipulates the characters? But surely the author manipulates the reader.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> That depends on the author. I always liked to keep my audience guessing, but also to play fair with them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Then <em>did</em> you know what your writing was doing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Does any author know what effect their work will have, once they emancipate it? Did Shakespeare know? Did Virginia Woolf? Anne Frank? Once a writer puts down their pen, all responsibility rests with the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> But in this case, you are the reader as well. &lt;<em>sighing</em>&gt; I guess you aren't going to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Only because you so love asking!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Fine. If you're going to be like that, we can talk about something else. How have you found writing a novel in an unaccustomed genre?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> It's certainly a blessed relief to compose something more thematically challenging than "red-button, green-button".</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Had you tried other genres before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> I found that the reading public has certain expectations, and it's difficult to contradict them. If they buy an Emma Hastings novel, they expect crime and investigation, not romance or high fantasy. If I didn't put a murder in, they would complain about its absence, and if I included it as a twist, they would complain that it didn't fit the genre. There was no winning.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> So no aliens committing the crime, then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Not if I knew what was good for me. With detective fiction, the simplest solution is usually the best. Money, love, revenge. These are the motives for murder, at least in stories. Anything else creates more questions than it answers.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> So you were never tempted to write anything completely different?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> I once outlined an idea for a conspiracy thriller, but my publisher was having none of it. Dramatic irony being what it is, the conspiracy thriller I ended up living in was far beyond my imagining.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I hope you understand why we have to keep you here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Absolutely. Would I prefer freedom, yes, but I can apprehend the importance of what you do here. And there are benefits to this life. I have learned a number of surprising things about myself. My work is appreciated, even demanded! I don't have to worry about village gossip – or that of the literary press. Not everyone is necessarily sociable, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Oh, Michael and Joe are rude, but they'll come around. I know them. Just give them time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> I don't care, honestly. One source of intelligent conversation is enough for anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Was that a compliment? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Don't get used to them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Well, shall I let you get back to your work?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5002:</strong> Thank you. It's a tricky section. I can write the test subject protagonist, I believe, but he needs a scene with the kindly scientist. I'm just not sure she's very convincing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>laughing</em>&gt; Enjoy. Let me know if you need any input.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5002 Investigation Update Presentation - continued</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 16 December 2019</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-06, Wing G Common Room</p>
<p><strong>&lt;<em>recording continues</em>&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> … which brings us back to today. And to me, sitting in a room full of liars.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> For instance, Officer Lowry was lying about his smoke break.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> What the hell do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I think you were gone for longer than you said, Officer. And you were drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> I was not!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It's boring in the middle of the night. You wanted to get a buzz on, and you had your Jack Daniels to do it. Normally you'd smuggle the bottle out at the end of your shift, but when you discovered SCP-5002, you realised they would search the entire Wing. You panicked, and you hid the bottle in the containment chamber, while Dr. Grossenbacher was examining the body.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> The bottle is not on the cell's camera feed from overnight, but it does show up later in the morning, just after you were there. You can try to lie to me, but it will not work. In fact, the only person here who didn't lie to me is a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'm saying that, out of everyone here, only D-4986 told me the truth. You are a killer, but you said that you didn't kill SCP-5002, and I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Ha! You'd be the first.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Then you suspect SCP-████ was the murderer?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It's funny you should mention him. The thing is, when everyone is lying, their lies contradict each other, and those contradictions can paint a picture. Even your studied weariness, Director, was a front, at least in part. Although I'm sure it is quite tiring to be the subject of blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Blackmail? For what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Better to ask "by who?". Someone who worked in wings across the site, who could see evidence of SRA failures being covered up. Someone who had evidence that SCP-████ had been breaching containment – who assumed they should bring a sexual assault kit to a murder scene. Someone who could trace D-2825's mental breakdown back to continual attacks by SCP-████. Someone like Dr. Grossenbacher.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> This is ludicrous.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Come on now. The director basically told me that you knew about the SRA failures. I assume this is the reason behind your sudden promotion to Chief Medical Officer?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Yes. God, yes. She told me she would inform RAISA that I had been doctoring the security records, putting staff at risk. She insisted on being made head of Medical for the site.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> Scheisskerl.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You were lucky, Director. Just imagine what she would have asked you for if she knew what you were really up to.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> The reality anchors weren't malfunctioning, were they, Director? Malfunctions should be randomly distributed, but as you said, SCP-5002's chamber was never compromised. And yet SCP-████ had clearly escaped regularly – he admitted it, and his series of attacks on D-2825 confirms it. I think you were deliberately shutting down his SRA, letting him escape. There were just enough other "errors" to deflect suspicion, but never risking SCP-5002's containment. And you controlled room allocations: you must have placed SCP-████ in Wing G, even though he's hardly a low-risk humanoid. You wanted him to attack SCP-5002. You wanted him to rape her, to terrorise her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Emma! You monster!</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> That is an extremely serious allegation, Agent. I hope you can support it with more than speculation.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You always showed an interest in SCP-5002, but you were relaxed about Dr. Yau's slow progress. You just wanted to know that SCP-5002 was suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Level 5 access. I never would have -</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> But why?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I didn't know that until I spoke to the Director's divorce lawyer. He confirmed that she was in London the night of the killing. He also confirmed that she had changed back to her maiden name. Evelyn May was previously Eve Holloway – mother of Kate Holloway, murdered in 2017 as a result of SCP-5002's anomaly. I don't know what strings you had to pull to try to get your revenge, Director, but I don't think her death will bring you any peace.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> You don't know anything! My baby was murdered! That animal could die a thousand times and it would never be enough.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> How can you say that about her?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> How can you say <em>her</em>, Michael?</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> After all, it wasn't the Director who brought a knife into SCP-5002's containment, did she?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> I – I didn't -</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You kept up that stony façade for a while, Michael, but now the cracks are showing. All that stress you were under, it wasn't from your thesis. You were fine until you got assigned to anomalous humanoid testing, and then something changed. Dr. Yau treated them like people, and you realised that they were. I think it crossed a line for you. I think you joined the Serpent's Hand.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> &lt;<em>weeping</em>&gt; God … oh …</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I wasn't entirely sure, but it fits. He was so startled when I mentioned the knife, and he remembered seeing it in the dishwasher – for him, that was unexpected. He just happened to have an urgent personal appointment immediately after the murder, on the same day a Way mysteriously appears next to the site. That was his escape route. He was meant to break SCP-5002 out, maybe some other skips, and then disappear the next morning in the confusion.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Then why did he kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I think you waited up that night, Michael. Everyone knew that Officer Lowry would take his smoke break at 2am, and you knew he would rattle the door to SCP-5002's cell as he left. That was your signal. You took the knife from the kitchen, and used your copy of the key-card to open the chamber. You knew it would show up on the security report, but you assumed you'd be long gone by then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> But it didn’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I'm getting to that. You offered SCP-5002 the knife for protection, didn't you, Michael? And then you told her to escape before Officer Lowry came back. But she wouldn't leave, would she?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> No. No, she refused.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And I think she told you why.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Yes. I'm sorry, Karen. I kept asking her to go, and then she said – she said that she wanted to stay. Because she was sleeping with Dr. Yau.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>crosstalk, raised voices</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Quiet! Quiet, everyone. There is more to be said. Michael, once SCP-5002 told you, you left the containment chamber. You were flustered, you rushed straight back to your room. And you left the knife behind.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Yes, that's right.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Did SCP-5002 tell you that she had slept with Dr. Yau that same evening? That's correct, isn't it Dr. Yau?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Karen!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> You don't understand. Emma and I were in love. She was a wonderful woman.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Your research made slow progress, just to keep Emma near you. How long had you been seeing her? Three months, four? Long enough to work out how to edit the camera system in advance, so it looked like she was alone in her cell every night. Strange – I wouldn't have looked at the footage so closely if I hadn't been trying to work out where the Jack Daniels bottle had come from.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Damn.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And you had access to the security system, so you could clear any key-card access before the records were submitted to Central. I presume that's why it took you so long to call the Director on the morning of the murder. You saw that Michael had opened SCP-5002's cell, perhaps you were trying to decide whether to risk exposing your secret in order to implicate him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> I saw he had unlocked the cell, but I knew he couldn't have killed Emma. I wanted to talk to him, but there was no time.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I think you must almost have run into each other, that night. You were in the containment chamber with Emma before Officer Lowry started his shift. You heard him rattle the door as he left at 2am, just like Michael did; that was your signal to leave. You must have returned to your room just as Michael left his. Perhaps you passed him while he was in the kitchen getting the knife.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> And then what, she went back later and stabbed the bitch in her sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I don't think so. Thwarted love is a good motive for murder. But SCP-5002 wasn't stabbed in her sleep. There was blood all over her bedclothes, not just near the wound.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grossenbacher:</strong> That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> It's more likely that she was stabbed standing up, then wrapped in the sheets and dragged back to the bed. And there's something you've all forgotten. Something that Dr. Yau missed when she wiped the security records.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Do you ever get to the point?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> When I left, I didn't lock the cell door.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Correct. Like leaving the knife behind, you forgot in your rush. Until you realised in our interview, and you knew something was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> For god's sake, what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Michael's signal to move, Dr Yau's signal to leave, was Officer Lowry rattling the containment door on his way out to smoke. But Officer Lowry shook the door every time he passed it. In both directions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> &lt;<em>gasping</em>&gt; Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> He came back from his break, shook the door, and found it was open. And you went inside, didn't you, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Answer her.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You were a little drunk. You started arguing with SCP-5002.</p>
<p><strong>J-R Simpson:</strong> Officer Lowry?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> And she told you. About her and Dr. Yau.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Joe?</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> She flaunted it at you. And you couldn't take it. You grabbed the knife, and -</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> You're just like her, you know? You think you're so fucking smart! You think you're so much better than me, just because you went to college and I'm some night janitor. She could have loved me! Not that anomalous whore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yau:</strong> Joe, what did you - &lt;<em>sobbing</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> I know you liked him, Dr. Yau, but you were too kind. You glossed over the issues on his psychiatric report. Maybe you knew about his drinking. But every good thing you did for him just fed his infatuation with you.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Lowry:</strong> Shut up. Just shut up, you bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You hadn't planned ahead, but everything you did after you killed her was clever, even daring. Emma must have told you about the doctored cameras, so you knew you hadn't been filmed. You left the cell, put the knife in the dishwasher, went back to the Security Station and waited calmly for morning. You made sure to "discover" the body with D-4986 as a witness, and took Dr. Yau's key to hide the fact that the door was unlocked. You gambled that Dr. Yau would wipe the door records to conceal her affair, or perhaps you were still trying to protect her. You carefully rolled the corpse over, to explain any traces of blood on your clothing. And then you guarded the scene, just to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> Can we get security in, please.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> Leaving the Jack Daniels was a mistake, of course. But you didn’t want to draw suspicion, so you were desperate.</p>
<p><strong>D-4986:</strong> Fucking Lowry!</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You almost got lucky. So many other things were going on, your actions might have been obscured. But in fact the solution in this case was one of the simplest explanations, and one of the oldest motives.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>door opening</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> We had a request from this room?</p>
<p><strong>Director May:</strong> This man is to be detained for questioning in connection with murder.</p>
<p><strong>Agent O'Connor:</strong> You can take him away, officer.</p>

<strong>SCP-5002 Investigation – Final Report - Afterword</strong>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Agent Ellen O'Connor</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 24 December 2019</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On further reflection upon this investigation, I wish to qualify my earlier conclusions. While I continue to believe that Officer Joseph Lowry is responsible for the killing of SCP-5002, I would recommend a degree of leniency from Foundation authorities when it comes to his sentence. In short, I am not certain that Officer Lowry is guilty of murder.</p>
<p>The facts of this case are extremely complex, and while many of the parties responsible have admitted to their actions, there is the question of the involvement of SCP-5002. The key issue which remains outstanding is whether SCP-5002's own anomaly led to her killing.</p>
<p>Starting with the basics: it appears that the Scranton Reality Anchors in SCP-5002's cell were operative, and were effective in preventing anomalous activity within the containment chamber. Equally, there are no written materials by SCP-5002 which correspond to the events of 14 December.</p>
<p>I am, however, struck by the presence of those blank pages in SCP-5002's containment, cut into patterns of empty space. It is possible that, on further investigation with SCP-5002's novel, this will be revealed to be a grille cipher, revealing particular words and phrases in the text to form a secondary work. Could that work have been separately read by SCP-5002, causing different effects? The testing logs suggest that this may be possible. I recommend that this is investigated as a priority.</p>
<p>In the meantime, ontological anomalies are notoriously difficult to detect. Perhaps the best method can be employed by future readers of this report. Has my work been structured as you would expect – first, a summary of my conclusions, and then the evidence to justify those conclusions? Has it instead taken a narrative tone?</p>
<p>If true, my hypothesis may absolve Officer Lowry of some responsibility, as the death of Emma Hastings would effectively be a suicide. It would also raise more questions than it answers. What was SCP-5002's motive for self-harm? If she made Lowry kill her, did she make Dr. Yau love her? Did she make Director May hate her? How far back does the chain reach?</p>
<p>I was born when SCP-5002 was not yet four years old, well before she ever started writing. Joseph Lowry is ten years older than SCP-5002. I believe that my life is my own. I believe that I choose my actions, that I think my thoughts, that they are not given to me. I believe that I am real. Reader, I very much hope that you feel the same way.</p>
<p>About me, and about yourself.</p>
