<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All personnel stationed at Site-56 are to be made aware that Dr. Amelia-Mae Webber is a frog. Dr. Webber should be permitted to continue working as a researcher, given that its health remains stable.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6441, known as Dr. Webber, is a sapient, unidentified member of the order <em>Anura</em> possessing a memetic effect that causes those who view it to believe that it is human. Prior to the discovery of its anomalous effects, SCP-6441 was seemingly unaware of its non-human characteristics.</p>
<p>Upon discovery of its anomalous effects, subjects will become aware of many non-human characteristics of SCP-6441; however, its body will still appear human.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6441-01:</strong> Discovery</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following log is a transcript of a multi-department meeting at Site-56. Dr. Juno Payne is known to have an unusually high level of memetic resistance.</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG, 12:16 04/20/2022]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Is everyone here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Juno's late again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Who's Juno?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Y'know, tall, four eyes, kind of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I don't think I do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Eh, we can get started without her. So-</p>
<p>[Dr. Payne enters hurriedly.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Sorry, got caught up in…</p>
<p>[A pause as Juno moves to take a seat.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> The fuck?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> What is it this time?</p>
<p>[Dr. Payne points towards SCP-6441.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Why's there a frog?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> A frog. Why is there a frog sitting next to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Ah, ha-ha, because Webber.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> No, dumbass. There's a frog right there!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Hey, guys?</p>
<p>[SCP-6441 stares at its hands.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I don't… think she's joking.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I mean, she's not joking. These aren't… human hands. I don't…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Aaand it's talking. Great.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Guys? I can't remember anything before 2018…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Correct me if I'm wrong, but frogs take two years to reach adulthood, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> That's… what I'm saying…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Oh, that's why the table was so slimy!</p>
<p>[Dr. Payne squints.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> You didn't know the frog was there?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> No, I mean-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> Oh god, I'm a frog.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Juno Payne</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. John Meyers</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG, 08:39 04/21/2022]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> I mean, I didn't really have much of a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> I suppose. Anyway, what happened during the meeting yesterday?</p>
<p>[Dr. Payne shrugs.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Not much, really. Walked in late, saw a frog in the chair next to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Hm. Had you met Dr. Webber before, or was this your first time?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> First time.</p>
<p>[A pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Webber's the frog, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Payne:</strong> Yeah, first time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> That'll be all, then.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG, 09:30 04/21/2022]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> I'm guessing this is about yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Yes. You know Dr. Webber somewhat well, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Uh, yeah, other than the whole… frog thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Had you noticed any unusual characteristics before yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Kind of? I saw her eating bugs once, but I didn't think anything of it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Mm-mm. Sometimes, things she touches are slimy.</p>
<p>[A pause.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Oh, and she always… sticks her hands in water? Like, she just sticks her hand in the glass. I've never seen her drinking it. Which, yeah, seems weird in hindsight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> And none of these things seemed strange?</p>
<p>[Dr. Frye shrugs.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Frye:</strong> Uh… not really. I just didn't really think about them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> I see. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Dr. Stevens.</p>
<p>[Dr. Stevens nods.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> You were responsible for hiring Dr. Webber, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Yes. Seemed like a good fit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> She's brilliant. Great with physics, which happened to be what we needed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Did you run a background check?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> Mhm. We found nothing. Literally nothing. No background.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> And you hired her anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens:</strong> I just… didn't think anything of it. Seemed normal for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Hm. Well, that's all I need from you.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Dr. Webber. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I dunno. How'd you be if you found out you were a frog?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> I'm sorry. This won't take long.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I- [sigh] great.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Before yesterday, were you aware of… your species?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> No, I just said I wasn't.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> You didn't think anything of your odd behaviors?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Odd behaviors? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Eating insects, absorbing water…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> That's normal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> That's not normal at all.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Oh… shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Moving on, what's the earliest thing you can remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Uh, being alone, I think. I had… siblings. Something happened to them. I think, uh…</p>
<p>[A pause. SCP-6441 squints.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Some kids… did something…? I dunno. It's kinda fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> What happened after that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Um… a woman said something, and… I could think.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Could you not think before that?</p>
<p>[SCP-6441 shakes its head.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I didn't really have any thoughts before that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> When did you enter human society?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> Pretty soon after. I was in grad school.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> What about your lack of a background?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I dunno. I didn't really think anything of it.</p>
<p>[A pause.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I don't get it. How didn't I notice? <em>Why</em> didn't I notice?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> Well, we think it's some sort of memetic-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> No, I mean, if I knew, I could've done more. My time… must be running out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> How would you have known?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I don't know. Whatever- whoever did this, she could've made it so I knew. I could actually do something to help if…</p>
<p>[SCP-6441 sighs.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6441:</strong> I just… don't know how to deal with this. It's a lot, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Meyers:</strong> I'm… sorry.</p>
