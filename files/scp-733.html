The pages of SCP-733-02 contain 33 black and white photographs, as well as 137 fragments of handwritten text. The authors of the text in SCP-733-02 have been analyzed as belonging to two unidentified individuals, a male (Subject A) and female (Subject B) of approximately 20-25 years of age who appear to be romantically involved with each other.
