<p>SCP-6725</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6725 is a collection of concrete rubble, formerly the northern wall of a building in Columbia, South Carolina with a mural of a tunnel painted on it. SCP-6725 received its designation after a series of events that occurred on 24/11/13, in which all individuals who viewed SCP-6725 would immediately begin attempting to crash into it. The event began at 0914 GMT and spanned until the event was stabilized by operatives at around 1129.</p>
<p>The event was captured on a CCTV camera positioned opposite SCP-6725. Additionally, multiple news outlets and citizens had captured footage of the incident. An approximate timeline of the events has been compiled and can be found below.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Time</th>
<th>Development</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0914</td>
<td>The wall spontaneously attains its anomalous attributes. Several individuals walking nearby begin to run into SCP-6725. Witnesses begin running towards SCP-6725 and stack atop others. People can also be seen exiting buildings close to SCP-6725 and running towards it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0921</td>
<td>The viewers and participants of a parade celebrating Thanksgiving have begun running from their locations to the wall. A pile has started taking form, with the number of victims at approximately sixty to seventy. Foundation agents are alerted of the developing incident and two units of MTF Gamma-40 are deployed to investigate the situation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0934</td>
<td>The pile of victims, most unconscious, reaches approximately five meters tall. A truck driving down the road accelerates and plows into the pile. More than fifty of the three-hundred victims are terminated in the collision. Several other vehicles crash into the pile, with one driving up the pile and becoming immobile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0948</td>
<td>The pile of six hundred victims now towers over the building, beginning to cover its rooftop. Two cars, both deep inside the pile, collide with one another, causing a fire to spark. Though the exact cause is unknown, it is speculated one of the cars' gas tanks was ruptured. Within minutes, the fire engulfs the majority of the pile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0955</td>
<td>An airline flight from New York to Georgia passes over Elgin, South Carolina. News outlets have now arrived at the incident scene. The fire engulfs the entirety of the building, and the local fire department has received more than 83 calls in the past ten minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1008</td>
<td>The Gamma-40 units arrive at the scene and the first unit forms a half-circle around SCP-6725, facing outwards. The second unit circles around the area in an unmarked helicopter. Individuals charging toward the wall appear ignorant of the task force, walking or driving directly past them. Contact with the task force is lost after authorization to shoot to kill is granted to the operatives. CCTV shows the task force dropping their rifles and charging into the fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1021</td>
<td>Reconnaissance teams are establishing a grid of the location for the task force to be able to operate blindfolded, deeming the anomaly a sight-based hazard. A unit from MTF-Tau-19, specialized in blind combat and operations, is called upon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1034</td>
<td>As Tau-19 arrives at the scene, digital maps of the town are updated to list major roads leading in and through it as under construction. The previously mentioned aircraft enters the territory of the city. The building connecting to SCP-6725 has been completely surrounded by victims of the anomaly and the fire has begun spreading to surrounding buildings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1041</td>
<td>The airline responsible for the flight notes the flight directs off course. It immediately begins a nosedive towards SCP-6725, crashing into the building and causing significant damage, effectively reducing the anomaly to rubble. Despite this, the anomalous effect persists as individuals within the fire can be seen picking up fragments of SCP-6725 and beating their heads with them. The plane crash is filmed by multiple individuals in the city. It is decided to construct a wall around the area using air vehicles to avoid further civilian interference with SCP-6725.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1052</td>
<td>The second Gamma-40 unit retreats the scene as two backup units arrive and drop a series of walls around SCP-6725 and the surrounding buildings. Tau-19 has been authorized to use lethal force against individuals attempting to damage the makeshift walls. Additionally, the backup units have begun extinguishing the flame with fire retardant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1117</td>
<td>Crowd control agents are deployed to assess news anchors and witnesses while digital scrubbing agents begin clearing the incident from the internet. A mass amnesticization of the city is approved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1129</td>
<td>The remainder of the victims of SCP-6725 are neutralized and crowd control agents retreat from the area as the remnants of SCP-6725 are collected by blindfolded operatives. Tau-19 operatives reportedly had to seize fragments of SCP-6725 from individuals who had not succumbed to the fire and continued to batter their heads with the rubble. In the following hour, several gas airstrikes, composed of Class-A amnestics, are dropped over the city.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Analysis of the SCP-6725 remnants shows the rubble's anomalous attributes were retained throughout the incident and remained after the fact. Direct visual contact with any fragment of SCP-6725 continues to result in the triggering of the memetic effect.</p>
<p>Approximately two months following the incident, local law enforcement apprehended a man who was discovered on his knees smashing his head into the sidewalk, having viewed a small pebble of SCP-6725. As a result, the fragment had been lodged into the wound on the man's forehead, causing him to manically attempt to smash his head against any surface.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of knowledge concerning the anomaly's capabilities, SCP-6725 retains a Euclid object classification. Intensive cleanings of SCP-6725's street of origin are being conducted regularly as fragments as small as 0.15 centimeters wide have been shown to be anomalous.</p>
