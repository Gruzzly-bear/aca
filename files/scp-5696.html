<p>Prior to entering SCP-5696-A, subjects are to be given a button camera fashioned to look like a pin supporting William H. Thompson for the 1931 Chicago Mayoral Election. The camera should be placed on the subject's left lapel after entering SCP-5696-A. During the displacement of SCP-5696-1 into SCP-5696-A, the SCP-5696 testing chamber is to be monitored for their return.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5696 is a revolver resembling a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P .38 in both function and design. The weapon bears two engravings: The first being a manufacturer engraving along the cylinder reading "S&amp;W Model EO-11 C.S."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and the second on one side of the barrel reading "Finish this job, Kill that cheating bastard."<em>[sic]</em>. When SCP-5696 is held in the right hand of a subject and the cylinder is opened using that hand, the subject (henceforth SCP-5696-1) will be displaced into SCP-5696-A.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<p>SCP-5696-A refers to an alternate dimension consisting primarily of a nightclub named "The Dying Roses," a building that was once located at ███ Division St., Chicago, which closed in 1956. Displaced subjects will find themselves dressed in formal attire appropriate for the early 1930's regardless of what they were dressed in prior to displacement. This includes a striped suit and matching dress pants, a blue tie, white undershirt, and a striped fedora. All objects on their person will have demanifested until their return, where they will find themselves dressed in their original clothing with the same belongings. Alterations to the subject's physical body made while within SCP-5696-A will remain, however. Note that SCP-5696-1 will displace with $1, $5 and $10 bills in varying amounts, totaling up to $100, in their left inner coat pocket.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> No items can be brought out of or taken into SCP-5696-A with the exception of any object held in SCP-5696-1's left hand during their removal from our dimension. Displacement only occurs with subjects who meet a certain set of physical specifications (see document 5696-M5 for full list); these include particular height and BMI limitations, but do not include race or sex requirements.</p>
<p>When viewed upon immediate entry, the area surrounding "The Dying Roses" consists of empty space. SCP-5696-A will construct an environment dependent on the needs or requirements of SCP-5696-1. This usually begins with a cityscape of apartment buildings but has also included rival clubs, hospitals, fire stations, and police stations. SCP-5696-A also creates smaller objects as needed, including but not limited to telephone poles, call boxes, and motor vehicles.</p>
<p>During their shift into SCP-5696-A, the subject will experience a series of semi-predictable events. Events that occur can have varying outcomes or be prevented entirely based on the actions taken by SCP-5696-1 while in SCP-5696-A. In some cases, actions taken have led to notable and/or unusual events occurring (see Addendum 5696-2). None of the events are particularly anomalous, but rather reflect real actions that may have been taken by the involved entities and the consequences thereof.</p>
<p>The following details the most commonly-recorded series of events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>00:00 - 1:00:</strong> SCP-5696-1 will be ushered to a seat at the bar as they "wait for the rest of their party,"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> although subjects may do as they please. Subjects have been recorded as having ordered food and drinks<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, purchasing cigars or cigarettes, interacting with waitstaff and other customers, speaking with and/or paying stage dancers, and in some cases, engaging in hand-to-hand combat.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>1:01 - 1:45:</strong> Five men (SCP-5696-2, -3, -4, -5, -6) will enter the establishment over the course of 45 minutes and mill about the area. They most commonly spend this time sitting next to each other at the bar and ordering various drinks. Each of them will eventually begin to smoke and talk among themselves.</p>
<p><strong>1:46 - 1:59:</strong> SCP-5696-2 through -6 will enter a room at the far end of the establishment that is closed off by a pair of red curtains. SCP-5696-1 will be ushered into the room by a member of the waitstaff and will be introduced to the men as "Mark Kennedy of the C.P.D.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> He's here on behalf of Nitti's gang."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> They will stare at SCP-5696-1 in silence for roughly five seconds before laughing and shaking their hand. SCP-5696-5 will offer SCP-5696-1 a cigarette if they don't already have one, and the member of waitstaff will offer them a drink. SCP-5696-5 will show them to an open seat around a table covered in green felt.</p>
<p><strong>2:00 - 6:00:</strong> SCP-5696-1 through -6 will begin to play Texas Hold 'em using direct monetary bets. From here, similarities become less common and the timeline of events begins to differ due to subject input. Play styles, game outcomes, conversation topics, and general actions influence what occurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Event:</strong> SCP-5696-1 immediately shot SCP-5696-6 for losing a hand to him and was immediately fired upon by SCP-5696-5. SCP-5696-1's corpse was transported and dumped into the Chicago River. SCP-5696-1 returned dead with five bullet wounds in the chest and entirely soaked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 52<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 4:45<br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> SCP-5696-1 requested a "taste test" from SCP-5696-6 during a conversation regarding drug sales. SCP-5696-6 obliged. During the last hour, SCP-5696-6 led SCP-5696-1 around a back room. SCP-5696-1's coat accidentally caught fire, causing him to panic. He ripped the jacket off and threw it into a puddle of spilled alcohol, setting the establishment ablaze. SCP-5696-1 returned with severe 3rd degree burns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 66<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 4:30<br/>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 94<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 1:45<br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> SCP-5696-3 declared that it was his birthday. No playing occurred and SCP-5696-3 was baked and served a chocolate cake. A portion of the day was spent celebrating his birthday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 105<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:35<br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> In an attempt to make conversation, SCP-5696-1 asked the other players what their favorite television shows were. SCP-5696-1 spent the next hour attempting to explain various products of modern technology to them before SCP-5696-3 called a hospital. SCP-5696-1 spent the remainder of the night in the back of a white Rolls-Royce bearing red crosses, where he was questioned about his sanity.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5696-5:</strong> Okay, what's wrong, kid? Something on my face?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5696-1:</strong> No, I just can't help but notice that what you lack in beauty, you seem to be making up for in card skills. Try letting us win some hands, you might have more fun.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5696-5:</strong> Hey, I'm sorry God's been wanting me to have your money! I can't help that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>SCP-5696-1 kneels down over SCP-5696-5, who is alive but bleeding profusely. He removes SCP-5696-5's coat and holds it upside-down, shaking it twice. Cards flutter and fall out of the sleeves and pockets. SCP-5696-2 leaves the room unnoticed.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>5:12</strong> <em>Two members of the waitstaff run out of the door to the back room and duck under the bar. They open fire using Remington Model-31 shotguns.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The patron gestures behind him.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>SCP-5696-1 readies himself for a moment before sprinting towards the back exit. SCP-5696-1 screams, falls and turns around.

<p><em>SCP-5696 fires in SCP-5696-1's right pants pocket, presumably shooting the ground. SCP-5696-1 removes SCP-5696 and turns it over. The engraving on SCP-5696's barrel reads "1017."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SCP-5696-1:</strong> Officer Mark Kennedy, Badge Number 1017! I'm in need of immediate assistance, I've been shot in the back of the leg at The Dying Roses. We may need backup in there. Fucking hell.</p>
<p><strong>Operator:</strong> Understood, putting out an urgent call to other officers in the area. Please wait there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The operator hangs up the phone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5:15-5:17</strong> <em>SCP-5696-1 sits on the ground against the phone post in silence, trying to keep his leg raised.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5:17</strong> <em>A white Model-B Ford arrives and two others drive past. SCP-5696-1 is loaded into the passenger seat by an unseen figure.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5:17 - 5:59</strong> <em>The figure is dressed in the same clothing as SCP-5696-1 and possesses a similar build. The figure smiles weakly, then begins driving. Note that the figure had a bullet wound in his upper-right chest which appeared to puncture the heart, but was not bleeding. SCP-5696-1 turns to look out the window, then removes the pin and holds it against the glass. The vehicle drives past a line of other iterations of The Dying Roses, most of which are identical in nature. The figure chuckles quietly. One of the locations appears to have been burnt down.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The figure stops in front of what appears to be the Rush University Medical Center. The figure enters the hospital and four members of the medical staff run out to the car with a stretcher five minutes later. SCP-5696-1 is carried out of the car and into the hospital. Medical staff removed the jacket and no relevant video was captured until SCP-5696-1's return into our reality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6:00</strong> <em>SCP-5696-1 is returned holding the pin and possessing an improperly-cauterized wound. Marker marks made along SCP-5696-1's lower leg imply that SCP-5696-A's medical staff intended to amputate the leg. SCP-5696-1 received proper medical care and made a full recovery.</em></p>

<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 128<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 0:05<br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> The engraving on SCP-5696's barrel was not present. The interior of "The Dying Roses" was significantly darkened and contained only one person. A spotlight was aimed at a patron dressed in similar clothing and possessing a similar physique to SCP-5696-1, who was sitting at the bar. The figure possessed a CPD badge which he wore openly on his suit. He smiled weakly at SCP-5696-1 and offered them a shot glass filled with scotch. SCP-5696-1 noted that the area felt abnormally cold, but was warmer in the light. The subject and the figure held a toast, then sat in silence for 10-15 seconds. The figure stood, removed his badge and firearm and placed them on the counter, then turned to leave. He stopped at the door, turned to face SCP-5696-1, thanked them, then left the establishment. The subject spent the remainder of the time in the empty building.</p>
