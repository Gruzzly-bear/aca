<p>SCP-8766</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8766</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8766 is to be kept in a standard soundproofed object containment unit, with no personnel of Clearance Levels 3 and above allowed within. Under no circumstances is SCP-8766 to be destroyed or otherwise damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8766 is a small sculpture depicting a kneeling bipedal creature with a grinning humanoid face. It exhibits a limited range of movement, rotating its neck to face anyone in its vicinity. Upon a subject entering SCP-8766's area of effect (estimated to be around 4 meters) in the presence of at least one other observer, SCP-8766 will proceed to vocalize compromising or shameful information pertaining to the subject, seemingly to mock them. Subjects describe SCP-8766's voice as breathy and hoarse. It displays fluency in several languages, and has been observed to recall information from as far back as 1885 with perfect recollection.</p>

Subject attempted to destroy SCP-8766 via blunt force. Upon breaking, the sculpture released a cloud of opaque black smoke, from which a large number of inklike hands emerged, pulling the subject into the cloud. After several minutes, the subject's screaming ceased, the smoke dissipated, and a new instance of SCP-8766 was created. The new instance's voice shares a similar cadence to the subject's.</td>
