</div>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known instances of SCP-9707 are contained within a Small-Entity Containment Cell at Site-138. The cell is furnished with recreational structures scaled to SCP-9707 instances, including ramps, half-pipes, and looped tracks.</p>
<p>SCP-9707 instances are permitted supervised access to Hallway II-0003, located adjacent to the containment cell, for a duration of 1 hour per week to reduce agitation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As of 10/01/2006, this activity must be overseen by 1 Level 3 or higher staff member.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9707 is the collective designation for 9 Mattel Hot Wheels toy cars, individually designated SCP-9707-1 through SCP-9707-9. Each instance is structurally indistinguishable from its non-anomalous commercial counterpart. They exhibit autonomous, self-propelled locomotion and self-directed driving. Measurable performance variability<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> has been observed both between instances and within the same instance across separate trials. Recorded metrics fluctuate in a manner not attributable to environmental conditions. A detailed comparative performance table is available upon request.</p>
<p>Although sentient, SCP-9707 instances have not demonstrated any attempts at communication with personnel or with each other. They display behavior consistent with competitive motivation, frequently attempting to replicate or exceed successful maneuvers performed by other nearby instances.</p>
<p>When physically handled, SCP-9707 instances will immediately spin their wheels while airborne and, upon regaining contact with a surface, rapidly accelerate away from the handler.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE - SITE-138</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 06/01/2006</p>
<hr/>
<p>It has recently come to my attention, by way of involved senior personnel I am in close professional proximity to, that informal gatherings have been taking place within the lower levels of this facility.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I would not object to this. Limited recreational activity during breaks can be beneficial to staff morale. I myself partake in the occasional game of Jass. However, it has become apparent that these gatherings have been occurring during active duty hours. This alone is concerning.</p>
<p>I have afforded this Site a considerable degree of latitude in such matters. Morale is important, and I trust my personnel to exercise basic judgment in maintaining it. That this discretion was interpreted as a green light for childish indulgence is disappointing. That some of you then chose to start wagering work hours and professional favors over the outcomes is even worse.</p>
<p>This might still have been overlooked. I am not immune to the appeal of novelty. But I cannot overlook the fact that these sessions were centered on the use of contained objects.</p>
<div class="image-hover-enlarge scp-image-block block-center" data-feature="image-feature" style="max-width:100%;"><img alt="Security camera view of 3 researchers cheering on SCP-9707 instances racing each other on straight track." class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9707/RenderWheels.png"/><br/>
<div class="scp-image-caption show">Still frame captured from Hallway II-0003 security camera.</div>
</div>
<p>To be absolutely clear: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anomalous objects are not to be utilized as implements for gambling, or recreation of any kind</span>. I do not care that the anomaly in question is Safe-class. I do not care that it is non-hostile. Subjects are not to be assigned odds. They are not to be timed, ranked, or tracked on sticky notes in break areas. That fully credentialed adults believed that the presence of clipboards and timing equipment rendered this acceptable is something that I simply do not have the energy to unpack in an administrative notice.</p>
<p>This communication is being distributed Site-wide because, as it turns out, this was not a case of isolated poor judgment. Facilities approved the procurement of modular tracks and ramps under the general Site budget. Research personnel retroactively justified the resulting events as <em>“speed and acceleration trials.”</em> Security then neglected to document several months’ worth of related activity in its weekly summaries.</p>
<p>I am further forced to note that this has been ongoing long enough to acquire internal terminology. I can only assume this was done in the hope that I would not notice, which strongly suggests that you all knew this was not appropriate.</p>
<div class="image-hover-enlarge scp-image-block block-center" data-feature="image-feature" style="max-width:100%;"><img alt='Photograph of sticky-note labelled "To do list" followed by SCP-9707 instances code names and track times disguised as prices.' class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9707/PhotoNote.png"/><br/>
<div class="scp-image-caption show">Recovered sticky note from Employee Lounge II</div>
</div>
<p>If this is what you choose to do with the latitude I extend to you, then perhaps that latitude was misplaced.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, all activities encompassing wagers are prohibited and will be enforced as policy. This includes activities conducted <em>“for research purposes,”</em> or during breaks <em>“just for chips.”</em> Personnel involved are expected to return any exchanges made as part of these activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have earned yourselves a mandatory Site-wide refresher course on the Code of Conduct. This will take place on <strong>10/01/2006</strong> at <strong>08:15</strong> sharp. Attendance is not optional. I recommend reviewing the document in advance, as you will all be present for its entirety.</p>
<p>I will not be appending this prohibition to the Site ruleset. Doing so would require formally acknowledging that it needed to be stated, which would be embarrassing for our sister Sites to see. Enforcement will proceed regardless.</p>
<p>If this occurs again, disciplinary action will follow. Subsequent incidents will be handled at the discretion of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foundation Administration</span>, whose tolerance for this sort of explanation is lower than mine.</p>
<p>See you all Friday.</p>
<p>Get a grip.<br/></p>
