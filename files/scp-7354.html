<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7354 is an approximately 10 m by 18 m basin filled with human blood, which was discovered on 01/07/2009, in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia, during a surveying expedition.</p>
<p>The basin contains a multifaceted spacial anomaly that prevents its contents from seeping into the surrounding soil and dramatically increased its internal dimensions. Ground penetrating radar scans of its interior have not yielded conclusive data.</p>
<p>The anomaly's enclosure adjoins a building complex (hereby classified as Area-354) that bears Foundation insignias. It appears to have been built at some point in the mid 1950s, though no documentation has been found of such construction taking place.</p>
<p>At irregular intervals, highly complex <a href="/sarkicism-hub">carnomantic constructs</a> (SCP-7354-A) coalesce within the anomaly. SCP-7354-A instances are invariably aggressive, physically resilient, and dangerous. Most manifestation events on record have resulted in structural damage to Area-354 and/or casualties among personnel.</p>
<p>As of 2007, the average length of time between SCP-7354-A manifestations has been decreasing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7354-A-1</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/18/2009</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Large chiropteran entity with a wingspan of 4.1 meters. In place of legs, subject had a mass of serpents protruding from its torso and extending downward. Entity could spit an extremely caustic fluid from a far distances and screamed loudly, without cessation.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Estimated to have been between 90-105 dB.</span></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Instance was shot out of the air using an M2 Browning .12 anti-aircraft rifle, then neutralized by STF Theta-12 with standard corrosive/incendiary weaponry while it attempted to regenerate.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7354-A-2</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 03/01/2009</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Described as looking like a cross between an echidna and a sun bear. Entity was largely unaffected by gunfire and possessed quills that were coated with a rapidly-progressing neurotoxin; this was only discovered several hours after neutralization, as the toxin was transdermally active and only began showing symptoms after significant exposure had occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Instance successfully broke through the north wall of SCP-7354's enclosure shortly after its manifestation, charging through an adjacent hall and injuring several staff members. Neutralized by STF Theta-12 with corrosive/incendiary weaponry.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7354-A-3</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/16/2009</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Levitating chitinous sphere with a diameter of 2.6 m, which possessed several large eyes that were irregularly spaced along its surface. When an eye was destroyed, another opened elsewhere along the entity's surface within 2-8 seconds. Instance caused rapid tumor growth in any complex living organism that it focused one of its eyes on and was largely unaffected by most forms of weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Neutralized via multiple sledgehammer strikes by STF Theta-12 member Agent Stone, who lacked enough organic components to be sufficiently harmed by tumor growth. In being neutralized, however, the entity exploded and doused Stone with a caustic fluid identical to that produced by SCP-7354-A-1, damaging their inorganic components severely.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7354-A-4</p>

Corrosive/incendiary weaponry, which typically counteracts carnomantic self-repairing, was insufficient against against SCP-7354-A-4.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-7354-A-5</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 06/19/2009</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> 3.7 m long arachnid with a two large human mouths on its back and multiple prehensile tubelike appendages coming out of its stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Instance escaped SCP-7354's enclosure shortly after manifestation. Throughout its containment breach, the anomaly displayed a higher degree of intelligence than previously seen SCP-7354-A instances, setting up ambushes and traps using nearly-transparent webbing.</p>
<p>On several occasions when dispatching prey, SCP-7354-A-5 would extend its extra appendages into its victim's ears, forcibly remove their brain, and ingest it, whereupon its human mouths would begin repeating the victim's deepest secrets in their first language. Not only did this cause some small amount of discord among STF Theta-12, but the anomaly ultimately came upon <tt>[REDACTED]</tt>, who had been visiting Area-354 for an unscheduled inspection prior to the manifestation event. Upon taking his brain, it proceeded to repeat several pieces of highly classified information, including <tt>[REDACTED]</tt>, <tt>[REDACTED]</tt>, and <tt>[DATA EXPUNGED]</tt>.</p>
<p>SCP-7354-A-5 was neutralized through usage of corrosive/incendiary weaponry, after which all those present were administered Class C amnestics.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 01/25/2010</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Cephalopodic entity of unknown size and appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-7354-A-14's manifestation event went unnoticed at first, as it remained submerged after coalescing. Over the course of several hours, the anomaly slowly extended numerous tentacles from within SCP-7354, moving them beneath the newly-fallen snow in the enclosure to avoid detection from the cameras. It proceeded to squeeze its tentacles into various tiny cracks and faults in the enclosure's walls that had formed from previous manifestation events and subsequent repairs, stretching them out into Area-354's foundation.</p>
<p>At 03:08 AM all of SCP-7354-A-14's tentacles began moving simultaneously, erupting from the ground to destroy large portions of Area-354 all at once. The tentacles retreated back into SCP-7354 after sustaining heavy damage from STF Theta-12 in the ensuing altercation, but not before dragging 9 staff members into SCP-7354 with them.</p>

<p>As far as schools of thaumaturgy go, carnomancy is rather predictable. Not unlike alchemy, it is grounded in physical principles—if you want a carnomantic construct to have structure, you need a bit of bone. Strength requires muscle fiber, intelligence requires neural tissue, and so on. SCP-7354 appears to have missed this memo—and I'm not just talking about how it's been able to make do with blood alone.</p>
<p>SCP-7354-A instances, going by our current understanding of Nälkä carnomancy, shouldn't be possible. We've seen these constructs use carnomancy in ways we thought only Karcists<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>Karcist:</strong> Honorific given to the spiritual and secular leaders of the Nälkä.

This doesn't just make them dangerous—it makes them <em>unpredictable</em>. Every manifestation event is another curveball—and you can't contain what you can't prepare for.</p>
At first, we believed that SCP-7354's carnomancy was different, altered in some way. We assumed, <a href="/scp-2480">perhaps justifiably</a>, that an additional anomalous force was at play.

<p><em>[Silence. SCP-7376-A does not move.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent McCready:</strong> Hevel?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> It happened here, you know. Ion.</p>
<p><strong>Agent McCready:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> The Grand Karcist. Ozi̮rmok. This is his blood. This is his grave.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-7376-A turns toward Agent McCready. It is silently weeping.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> This is where he died.</p>

<h4><span>Excerpts from <em>The Seventh Ordeal of Ion</em> by Klavigar Nadox<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>Klavigar:</strong> Honorific given to Grand Karcist Ion's four closest disciples.</span></span></h4>
</div>
<p>All the flowers bloomed, the day wretched Važjuma descended upon our world. It had not come in fullness, but in aspect, in avatar—for surely, if the Devourer had arrived in its entirety, the simple gravity of its terrible mass would've extinguished the sun.</p>
<p>Even now, I am not entirely certain what I saw. Važjuma was a boiling sea of teeth, frothing with acid. It was a vast and detestable stomach. It was Yaldabaoth.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Abandoning mortal form, the Ozi̮rmok's spirit filled the sky. In one hand, he<sup>1</sup> held a great flame. In another, his staff of muscle and bone. And in yet another, he carried an Archon's heart.</p>
<p>Grand Karcist Ion strode forth to meet his opponent.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ion and Važjuma fought for eleven days and eleven nights. It was a horror to behold. Each strike lit up the heavens. Each blow was heavy enough to shatter mountains. And still, the avatar was whole. Unbroken. Hungry.</p>
<p>Ion saw the coming dawn of the twelfth day and knew that he would not live to see its dusk.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ion mustered up all his strength. All his courage and cunning, every piece of himself that had not yet been devoured. He summoned up everything he was, had been, and would ever be—and set it all alight. In a thunderous explosion like none I've seen before or since, Ion split the firmament open and cast Važjuma back into the Void.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h5><span>Translator's Notes</span></h5>
</div>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Klavigar Nadox refers to Grand Karcist Ion using the <a href="/old-adytite-language">Old Adytite</a> pronoun "ŋuraj", which was interchangeably used to indicate masculine and gender-neutral subjects. The translator has chosen to solely use masculine pronouns for the sake of clarity, though gender-neutral pronouns would have been equally accurate.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The veracity of <em>The Seventh Ordeal of Ion</em> has been heavily disputed by members of GoI-004, who claim it is propaganda that attempts to overwrite a historical battle between the Mekhanite army and Lash-Rakal.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>Lash-Rakal:</strong> A colossal airborne entity that allegedly was the child of an Archon.</span> They contend that Grand Karcist Ion's death had actually taken place several months prior, at the hands of PoI-004A-001 ("High Priest Bumaro").</p>
<p>Bumaro, notably, has not publicly confirmed or denied either account.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> Why didn't you tell me?!</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> Calm down. You're not making any sense.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> The blood! Why didn't you tell me it was becoming faster?</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> We <em>did</em> tell you that!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> You told me the blood was growing more dangerous. You said <em>nothing</em> of speed.</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> Does the distinction matter?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> <em>Of course it does.</em> The art of the Nälkä is that of adaptation, evolution. It is only natural that the blood would hone its weapons over time. But speed? Ion isn't here to sustain it! After nearly 3000 years, it should be getting <em>slower</em>.</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> But it's not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> <em>I know.</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> Do you know what happens when you die?</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> …Are you asking me if I believe in the afterlife?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> I speak of the physical process.</p>
<p><strong><tt>[DATA LOST]</tt>:</strong> I mean, your body decomposes, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7376-A:</strong> This is true. The body decays… and in doing so it becomes a house for parasites and scavengers. Old life gives way to new. It is the way of things.</p>
