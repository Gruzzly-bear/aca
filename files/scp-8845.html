<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Civilian access to SCP-8845 is to be restricted. Due to the nature of SCP-8845, research staff are required to possess documented mental disorders associated with elevated suicide risk as a prerequisite for assignment, and all researchers accessing SCP-8845 must be accompanied by no less than two security personnel. All other personnel assigned to SCP-8845 are to undergo a comprehensive psychological evaluation prior to clearance.</p>
<p>Update 22/4/2019: Due to Incident-8845-A, all personnel seeking access to SCP-8845 must submit a formal request no less than 12 hours in advance. Researchers assigned to SCP-8845 are subject to routine reassignment at any given notice. In the event that personnel start to show signs of suicidal intent, or attempt to gain entry into SCP-8845 without prior clearance, they are to be immediately apprehended and moved to ██████ for heavy psychological testing.</p>
<p>Any interaction with SCP-8845-14 is strictly forbidden for all personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8845 is the collective designation for a group of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">13</span> 14 levitating human corpses located beneath the Namho Bridge near the village of █████, Korea. The individuals, all Korean civilians<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> aged between 15 and 78, are suspended in various postures consistent with free-fall descent. Despite exhibiting no vital signs, all instances retain consciousness and limited motor function, including head movement and verbal communication.</p>
<p>SCP-8845 is only perceptible to individuals experiencing suicidal ideation or comparable psychological conditions. When observed, instances of SCP-8845 will consistently attempt to dissuade affected individuals from jumping off the Namho Bridge, each claiming to have previously attempted suicide via leaping from said bridge. Individuals who jump from the Namho Bridge are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">currently theorised</span> confirmed (see Incident-8845-A) to turn into an instance of SCP-8845 while in free fall.</p>
<p>Following the events of Incident-8845-A, all SCP-8845 instances have become unresponsive during any attempts at research. Verbal communication, when initiated, is limited exclusively to inquiries or commentary pertaining to the personal lives and psychological wellbeing of assigned research personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8845-01</strong>: State of Affairs Prior to Incident-8845-A</p>
<p>The following addendum is documentation of various internal communications and requests involving former Head Researcher Wyncent Joakim<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> following his assignment to SCP-8845. Wyncent had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>Although SCP-8845 does not exhibit any hazardous properties, the latent psychological risks associated with utilizing psychologically vulnerable personnel for research (highlighted by this documentation and Incident 8845-A) have been deemed important enough to warrant inclusion in this article for precedent and internal review purposes.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Request for Project Reassignment</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dear Researcher Joakim,</p>
<p>After careful review, your request for reassignment has unfortunately been declined at this time. Your ongoing contributions and unique familiarity with SCP-8845 have been assessed as vital to the continued success of current research efforts. As you are aware, only select personnel meet the necessary criteria to interact meaningfully with the anomaly, and your expertise in this area remains unmatched.</p>
<p>We understand that the recent notice regarding the extension of your assignment—from the originally intended five-month period to a permanent posting—may have caused some frustration. Please know that this decision was not made lightly, and we sincerely appreciate your patience and professionalism as we navigate staffing limitations and the unique demands SCP-8845 presents.</p>
<p>Rest assured that your prior concerns about psychological support have been noted, and we will do our best to follow up with your requests in the coming weeks. Thank you once again for your commitment to the foundation.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p><strong>Charles Freeman</strong><br/>

<p>The following is a partial transcript of a routine interview conducted on 23/02/2019 by Researcher Zita Wong with SCP-8845-09, a 78-year-old Korean female. Transcript has been translated from Korean for accessibility and clarity.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Don’t worry about me, <em>agaya</em>. I have no family members left to care for me anymore. My <em>aegi</em>, my lovely, precious grandson, passed away in the winter from pneumonia. He was the brightest light in my life, you know? Always cheering me up with his little antics and jokes.”</p>
<p>“He reminds me of your friend Kim<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, I tell you. Same brown eyes, same black hair. Do you remember when he came here with the rest of your friends, <em>agaya</em>? Going out of his way to talk to all of us <em>yulyeong</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, trying his best to cheer us all up…people like him are hard to come by in Korea, you know?”</p>
<p>“And yet…I grow worried for him. Now, he looks too much like my sick <em>aegi</em>, but he has no illness, yes? He looks tired even in the day, his eyes are sad and sunken. You know how heartbreaking it is, <em>agaya</em>, to see your close ones grow sullen when they used to be so talkative and full of life? To see them, once able to run twenty laps around the <em>geosil</em>, struggle to climb down the stairs? …Sometimes, when you all are waving your funny instruments around, I see him. Staring at the edge of the bridge, quietly, for long periods of time. Too long. “</p>
<p>“<em>Agaya</em>…I know why you and your friends can see us. I saw the <em>yulyeong</em> too after my <em>aegi</em> passed. Please, promise me…take care of one another, of Kim, okay?”</p>
<p>“Listen to an old lady’s advice. Don't end up like us, <em>agaya.</em> Please, don’t let the bridge steal another.”</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Reassignment Request (Fourth Submission)</p>
<hr/>
<p>To Researcher Joakim:</p>
<p>This message is in reference to your most recent request for reassignment from SCP-8845, dated 12/03/2019. This marks the fourth such request submitted within the past three months.</p>
<p>As stated in prior correspondence several times, Site Command has already reviewed and finalized their decision regarding your continued assignment. Your expertise remains of strategic importance to the SCP-8845 research initiative, and you are to continue your duties as per normal.</p>
<p>Further reassignment requests regarding this matter will no longer be considered. Continued submission of such appeals may result in formal disciplinary review under Foundation Code of Conduct. Please do not force our hand.</p>
<p>Additionally, your prior requests for psychological support have been reevaluated. While we recognize the concerns you have expressed, these requests have been declined in order to maintain operational continuity and ensure qualified personnel with the necessary psychological profiles remain available for SCP-8845 research. You are advised to remain focused on your current assignment and utilize internal coping protocols as outlined in your Foundation-issued Mental Resilience Handbook.</p>
<p>Please remain committed to SCP-8845 and the Foundation. We trust this will be the final communication required on this matter.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<td colspan="2">This memorandum serves as a formal review of Head Researcher Wyncent Joakim’s recent conduct and performance under the SCP-8845 research directive. After evaluation, it has become increasingly clear that Dr. Joakim’s professional standards have declined significantly over the past few months.<br/>
<br/>
This issue is not isolated to minor mistakes. Instead, we are observing a consistent pattern of negligence, absenteeism, and general disengagement. Joakim has failed to meet basic productivity benchmarks for his role, missed no fewer than four scheduled meetings without explanation, and has ceased meaningful collaboration with other staff assigned to SCP-8845. Multiple reports cite him as unresponsive to team communications and absent from regular briefings.<br/>
<br/>
It has been noted that Joakim, alongside other personnel, has attributed his behaviour to “mental fatigue” and “emotional distress.” While the Foundation recognizes the occasional need for rest intervals due to psychological stress, especially considering the unique personnel criteria for SCP-8845, this pattern of behavior appears less like a health concern and instead a lack of commitment. At this point, we view the justifications presented as habitual excuses, and not credible barriers to performance.<br/>
<br/>
Let us be clear: <strong>this behaviour will not be tolerated.</strong> Joakim’s role is a high-clearance, high-responsibility position, and his actions — or lack thereof — place Foundation integrity at risk. This is his <strong>final warning.</strong><br/>
<br/>
Should further signs of slacking, non-cooperation, or unexplained absence be documented, disciplinary measures will be enacted. These may include immediate demotion to research status, suspension of field access privileges, or pay docking in accordance with Foundation operational policy.<br/>
<br/>
Joakim is expected to correct course <strong>immediately</strong> and resume standard operational conduct, effective tomorrow, with no exceptions. Further instances of unproductive behaviour will not be tolerated.<br/>

<p>The following transcript has been compiled from surveillance footage captured by Foundation security cameras positioned around the Namho Bridge perimeter.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 18/04/2019</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> At approximately 03:00 hours, Head Researcher Wyncent Joakim was observed approaching the Namho Bridge without prior request or authorisation. Various instances of SCP-8845 are also captured on screen. No audio was captured in the available footage.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:08:41&gt;</strong> Head Researcher Joakim approaches the Namho bridge from the left. There is no one else present near the instances of SCP-8845, who start to notice his presence.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:09:23&gt;</strong> Joakim slowly walks towards the middle of the bridge. His face is emotionless. Instances of SCP-8845 attempt to speak with him, but he does not respond.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:10:05&gt;</strong> Joakim approaches the railing and leans on it, staring blankly at the scenery for a total of 22 minutes. All attempts of communication from SCP-8845 are ignored.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:32:54:&gt;</strong> With no prior indication, Joakim smiles and suddenly begins to climb the railing and stands on top of it, looking down at the panicking SCP-8845 instances, who begin to scream, seemingly attempting to persuade him not to jump off the bridge. Tears trail down his face.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:35:12&gt;</strong> Joakim closes his eyes, wiping away his tears. He opens his mouth and vocalises a single sentence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> The SCP-8845 instances stop screaming for just a moment, all stunned.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:36:27&gt;</strong> Joakim leans forwards and topples off the side of the Namho Bridge, arms folded across his chest, turning into an instance of SCP-8845 mid-descent. His expression looks peaceful. The other instances of SCP-8845 continue screaming at him for another 67 minutes, their faces contorted in anguish.</p>
