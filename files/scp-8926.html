<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8926 is contained <em>in situ</em> at the location where it was first discovered. Seeing as the entity poses no risk for discovery by the public and it has fully and continuously cooperated with the Foundation, no significant containment measures are required beyond passive monitoring. To prevent undue emotional distress from SCP-8926, at least one member of personnel is to visit it once per week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8926 is a living anthropomorphic construct formed of ink with a resemblance to the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a creation of Walt Disney. The entity is animate and capable of vocalizations, and has shown sapience identical to that of a human being.</p>
<p>SCP-8926 has an amicable and energetic personality, and prefers to create artworks made of ink as a hobby whenever it is not spending time with a member of personnel. In the event that it remains isolated for too long, it will become distressed, find a suitable hiding space and curl itself into a ball. As such, to retain enrichment for SCP-8926 it is mandated that personnel must continue to interact with the entity on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8926 was discovered on 2003/03/01 in an abandoned workshop in Burbank, California. Contained inside were early designs of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, workstations with somewhat intact sheets of hand-drawn paintings covered with celluloid, and damaged posters of the animated short “Trolley Troubles.” SCP-8926 was found hiding in a room filled with a collection of ink-drawn paintings and drawings of several characters that are closely associated with the character of Oswald. As soon as it was discovered, it immediately became cooperative with Foundation agents and elected to stay inside the workshop. Containment procedures were soon devised and enacted.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8926.1:</strong> Interview Log 1</p>
<p>On 2005/08/01, Madeline Webb, director of Site-35, made a request to conduct a series of interviews with the anomaly, which was tentatively granted. She subsequently took a flight to Burbank to personally interview SCP-8926 herself. Below is a transcription of the first interview.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Director Webb opens the door to the workshop, spotting in-progress works of art and various workstations scattered around the room. In the center of the room is SCP-8926, painting on a canvas with broad, sweeping brush strokes. It does not notice her until she closes the door, causing it to jump back in surprise.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Just me. I’ll be your interviewer for this week.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Oh, okay. Phew. Scared me for a second there.</p>
<p><em>The entity approaches Director Webb and reaches out its hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Welp, name’s Oswald, it’s nice to meet ya. And you…?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You can call me Madeline.</p>
<p><em>Webb reaches out to shake the entity’s hand. It shakes her hand vigorously.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Madeline, Madeline. Got it. Lovely name, really. Very lovely.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Yes, thank you, but I think that’s—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Oh, right. Sorry. I get a little worked up when I meet someone new. It’s exhilarating, I get to meet new faces, new voices and new perspectives, new everything, really. So sorry if I get a little too excited.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> No, no, you’re fine. I completely understand. It’s a great feeling to discover new things.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb looks over SCP-8926’s shoulder, toward its canvas.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Do you mind if I can see what you’re working on?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Of course, of course! Now it’s not exactly finished yet, but I think I’m making some good progress so far.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb heads toward the painting, and sees a mountainous black and white landscape, with flowing black waterfalls cascading over the side of the mountain. Some details are not present, such as the trees, which are missing branches. However, the painting is mostly complete.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> That’s— That looks wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Wow, really? Thanks! It’s not finished yet, though. I need to make some final touches.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Regardless of its current state, I can appreciate good craftsmanship when I see it. And the finer details with the brush strokes.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb looks back at the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> How did you get the material for these paintings?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Oh, that’s easy, I just pull ink out of myself, like so—</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 sinks its hand into its chest, and dramatically pulls liquid ink out of its body.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> —and <em>shquick</em>, there we are.</p>
<p><em>Webb looks at SCP-8926 with concern.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Is this process… uncomfortable for you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Oh, no no, it’s fine, actually. I gain my ink back quickly, and it’s painless, so it’s not much of a bother for me.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Well, that’s good then. To get back on track, before I came here I watched some of your shorts to get some background information about you. I never expected you to be a painter.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> You watched those? I’m flattered. But yeah, I never really got the chance to see those, so I can’t find out how much of me is really me, ya know? But it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Are you sure it’s fine?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I’ve got to keep having a smile on my face. That’s who I’m supposed to be, right? I’ll go through anything no matter how bad it is.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Are you able to tell me anything about how you got to be in this position? Such as how you were made?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I can, but you’re just going to get the same answer as everyone else. I’ve already told this story.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> One more time can’t hurt, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Yeah, why not. One more can’t hurt.</p>
<p><em>The two sit down next to each other, and Webb turns to the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> It started with a dream. Well, at least that’s how he said it did. It really started with the rights issues.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> With Universal.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Yep. Some big shot was going behind Walt’s back and hiring away his own workers, and tried to force him to take a smaller cut instead of a larger one like he wanted. There was a back-and-forth, the guy threatened to start his own studio, blah blah blah, Walt still refused, and lost most of his staff as a result. Besides his co-contributor that’s always been there with him.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Yes, he had issues with his former producer.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Can’t ever trust those guys.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> And how did that lead to your creation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Well, story goes that one night Walt went out to his porch, got on his knees, and prayed for some good to happen to him. Didn’t matter what it was, he just wanted something good. And then when he finally opened his eyes, a shooting star streaked across the sky for him to see. The next day, I was there, hopping around the place like a kid overdosing on sugar. The great miracle of life!</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> So you weren’t made from an artificial process, like a machine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Would make more sense, but nope! When I showed up at his doorstep, a true work of art come to life, that’s when Walt knew that dreams really do come true.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> We got along well. I actually learned how to draw from Walt and the other guy who was with him, and I helped them come up with designs for a new character to be my equal. So we thought, why not a mouse? Then Walt’s wife came over and suggested the name for us.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> So you helped create Mickey Mouse?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926’s left ear slightly twitches the second Webb names the character. Neither acknowledge this event.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Well, I was just throwing ideas out there and all that. But I became part of the team, and it felt great. That was my purpose, to help these guys create cool things to make the kids smile.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But that changed.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Yep. I remember the exact day. I remember waking up and seeing the sunshine glaring at me through the window. I remember the silence. I remember walking down the stairs, and finding the place entirely vacant. Like everyone packed up all of a sudden and left. They left so many things behind. Left me behind.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> They abandoned you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I don’t know what happened. I don’t think I’ll ever know why. And I was alone.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> That’s… I can’t believe anyone would do that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Maybe it was a good thing for me. Sometimes, you gotta look at things with a different perspective. I’m sure he wasn’t doing it because of me. Maybe he was doing it for me. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Did you go out at all? Out of the studio?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> No, not really. But hey, I got all this free space for myself!</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I don’t think this is exactly freeing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Funny how you say it. What do you guys do, anyway? Other than the whole containment thing.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> We still have ‘the containment thing,’ but we also have other obligations.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Such as?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> At my site, I take care of those under my watch. I check on their health, make sure they’re doing okay. They’re treated as they should be, not as prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Hey, as long as you keep the golden rule, fine by me. But if they’re as trapped as I am, you should probably check on them more often, just saying.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I allow them to leave their rooms, to interact with each other. But not through the entire site. We still have restrictions that we need to abide by.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Yeah, makes sense.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 looks back at its canvas for a split second, before looking back at Director Webb.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I know you’re right. Nothing has really changed for me. None of this is freeing. But I’m used to it. I gotta keep that smile on me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You’re allowed to express how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Nah, it’s fine. I’m fine! Seriously, I am. I feel better than I ever have been.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Alright. But if you ever need me, I’m here to help.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I know. You’re staying the whole week, right?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I am.</p>
<p><em>The entity contemplates for a few seconds, before looking back at Director Webb.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Can we get back to this tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Thanks. I’m glad you’re here with me.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> The feeling is mutual.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb gets up, opens the door, and leaves the studio.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8926.2:</strong> Interview Log 2</p>
<p>The following is the second interview between Director Webb and SCP-8926, conducted a day after the first interview.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Director Webb watches SCP-8926 paint on a new canvas. All around them are completed artworks affixed to the walls, each depicting a different cartoon character.</em></p>
<p><em>Webb walks up to the entity, and stands next to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Could you tell me about the figures in the back there?</p>
<p><em>She points to a large and wide painting on the back wall, depicting SCP-8926 and several other characters standing next to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> What, that one? That’s one of my favorites. I’ve always been proud of that one. Let’s see…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 points to the figures on the left.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Those are my friends, my allies. Well, at least the ones from the original cartoons. Because I exist, and they don’t. But anyway—</p>
<p><em>It points to the figures on the right.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> These guys are the antagonists that I face off against. But again, I don’t know any of them personally. As you can clearly tell.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb turns her head to the canvas that the entity is working on, and sees three recognizable circles connected together.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> What are you drawing now?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 looks down at the floor for a split second, before looking back at Webb.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Back before, well you know, I was always taught to draw what I’m feeling. Because art is how you express yourself, right? So that’s what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I’m not jealous, okay? I’m far from jealous. Why would I be jealous? I contributed to that success. I helped them out.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I don’t think you’re jealous, Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> We were supposed to be standing side by side. I was supposed to be on that boat with him. Now he’s out there, and I’m still here.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 turns to look at the painting on the back wall, and continues to stare at it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> They should’ve told me. I really believed that I could make something great, you know. But just because I exist doesn't mean that the rights would suddenly come back to us like a miracle. The world doesn’t work in miracles. You can’t wish upon a star to make your dreams come true.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You were made by a wish. By someone who wanted you to be real. Someone who believed in you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> That someone left me to rot and be forgotten in some dusty workshop with mold growing everywhere. What do you think that makes me?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> None of that makes you who you are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Then <em>what am I?</em></p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> See? Not even you know. I’ve only got decades-old cartoons to show me who I am. And frankly I have nothing to do with those. So I’m nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I highly doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Look, miss, I know you’re trying, and I’m grateful for that, really I am, but this isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> What’s the plan for if I somehow have an epiphany and change my entire outlook on life anyway, huh? Keep me pacified? I’ll still be in here no matter what. What’s the game plan here?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> The game plan is to make sure that the health and wellbeing of you and all others under my care are at my top priority.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Even when they’re locked up? I feel like that should be the opposite of that.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Not everyone here is willing to uphold standard procedure. Even a little dissent can go a long way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> The only option there, then, is to let me out. But we both know that’s not happening.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> We should stand our ground regardless.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> You work for them. You still work for them. Do you consider that dissent?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I will never put my head in the sand and blindly follow what I’m told. We cannot embrace the end and wait until it’s all over. We must stand in solidarity and support our communities. We must embrace the idea that we can still turn things around.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I can’t do that. I can’t do any of that.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I believe you can.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Right, you, the person keeping me held here, believe that I can go out there and fight the good fight. Right.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You still have a voice to shout for what you believe in. It might not feel like it now, but we can still fight for what’s right in small but meaningful ways. Any action that we take has a reaction in response. We can still create change.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> We don’t need to get into any of this philosophical talk. I know what I am. A prototype for something better. A rough first draft. Even without the rights issues, I doubt I’d ever go that far in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> How can you know that? The people loved those cartoons. They gathered around to see you in action.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> We were in the early days, animation was just in its infancy. It’s not as many as you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But there were people who came to watch those shorts. They came to be entertained, and you provided.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Not enough, clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But it’s better than nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> No one ever came back for me, Madeline. I’m not loved. Not in the slightest.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> There’s no point. You’re not getting anywhere. Just stop.</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Maybe I deserve it. I’m a freak accident. I only exist because someone else wanted something great, and all he got was me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 promptly falls back and sits on the floor, cross-legged. It stares at its feet and twiddles its thumbs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I don’t know anymore.</p>
<p><em>The entity continues to stare down towards the floor, and is silent for a few moments.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I think you should leave me alone, for now. I need to think some things over. Calm myself down.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I will. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Sure. Just skip a day for your interviews or something, alright? Thanks.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb nods, and moves to exit the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8926.3:</strong> Interview Log 3</p>
<p>The following is the third and final interview between SCP-8926 and Director Webb.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Director Webb enters the studio. She looks around; no one is present in the room besides her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Oswald?</p>
<p><em>No response. Silence permeates the chamber.</em></p>
<p><em>Director Webb begins to walk forward. The workbenches look as if they have been ransacked, with various brushes and paints scattered all over the floor. She picks up two pieces of paper, which are revealed to be an in-progress artwork torn in half.</em></p>
<p><em>She places the two pieces together, revealing a recognizable cartoon character.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> That can’t be good. I need to find him.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb hurriedly searches for SCP-8926, looking through different corridors and unused rooms. Dried ink can be seen splattered all over the walls.</em></p>
<p><em>She reaches a projector room. While the projector is running, the screen is entirely blank. The chairs in the room are positioned as if they were each thrown across the room, with a few being broken apart.</em></p>
<p><em>Director Webb keeps going, and begins to shout SCP-8926’s name as she searches. Eventually, she reaches the room where SCP-8926 keeps its collection of art. Once she opens the door, she stops in her tracks. SCP-8926 can be seen curling into a ball against the back wall, shivering and muttering to itself. Faint sobs can be heard.</em></p>
<p><em>Webb rushes to SCP-8926’s side, and sits next to it in an attempt to comfort it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I didn’t get it. Now I do.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> What did you not get?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I know why they left me now. Why he did it. Because they knew I was worthless. They knew I was a waste of time. They <em>knew</em> I was just a prototype to make something better. They both fully knew that. That’s why he didn’t bother to say bye on the way out.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You can’t truly know what Walt was thinking. Weren’t you working together?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Well, yes, but artists stop working together all the time, right? Usually for creative differences. Or if one knew that the other wasn’t going to make it big.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You are not worthless.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Contrary to almost nobody’s belief, the facts are stated clearly. I will be forgotten. Fortuna herself has made it so.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> That doesn’t mean that you can’t be anything now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> <em>Now?</em> What am I supposed to be now? I can’t leave this place. Even if I wanted to, you won’t let me. Tell me, honestly, who do you think I am? Not just a cartoon character no one cares about. Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> An artist.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> With no one to see my work.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> That doesn’t matter. An artist doesn’t need to rely on an audience to make great things. They make their work something that they themselves can be proud of. Are you proud of your work?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> In the back of my head, I thought if I could keep making art, maybe one day someone or something would fly down from the stars and give me the recognition that I deserve. If Walt could wish upon a star, then why can’t I? Unfortunately, life doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You’re right, it doesn’t. But we must push forward regardless.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I’m just standing still. Stuck in place. And I always will be.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> What makes you think that won’t change?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> What makes you think that it will?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I believe that anyone can make an impact for the world, no matter how small. I believe in the indomitability of us as a people. Every single person on this earth has done something that matters. Whether in their community, or their own personal lives. It still matters.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I haven’t done any of that.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But you can still make an impact. In fact, you already have.</p>
<p><em>There is a short pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I had an interest in the development of moving pictures. The animated kind. I saw the start of it, and I hungered for more. I saw the first ever cartoon characters, as we would call them now. And then I watched a short animation starring a certain rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> He had such a personality, and the way that it connected with the physical comedy kept me invested the whole time. That rabbit’s foot trick was very clever. And I was inspired by how he would keep on going, no matter what obstacle was thrown at him.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Hang on a second. Are you telling me—</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Yes. Not everything about me is as it seems.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 stares at Director Webb in shock.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Wow, I didn’t expect that at all. How did you get yourself to look so young?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6461" target="_blank">I have my secrets.</a> But I know how you feel.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb gestures to hold SCP-8926’s hand, which it hesitantly accepts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> I haven’t had the same experience, but I understand you. It’s suffocating. You can feel the world rot around you, and you want to do something, but you can’t. Your brain screams at you and you still can’t. And you just sit there as time ticks by, and you waste away.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Like dust in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> But we aren’t dust. I found my place in the world. It’s about time I help you find yours.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> In the grand scheme of things, I don’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Neither do I. None of us do, for that matter. But nothing in our universe can exist without having an impact on something else. The big picture is made of many brush strokes. That’s how we make things matter.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> But how can I change into who I want to be? I can’t just leave.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You could, but we have surveillance everywhere, and they would most likely send a task force after you. There would be a long road ahead.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8926 looks up at the director.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Do you think I still have a chance?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> They’d stop you at any cost. But if you want to do what’s best for you, you need to find the right window of opportunity. And then you’ll find what you need.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Wouldn’t you try to stop me regardless?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> They would. But you must stand your ground no matter what anyone throws at you.</p>
<p><em>The entity leans back against the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I don't know what I should do with myself. I don’t know who I should be. I’m not the same guy from the cartoons. Should I try to be him?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> You have to find yourself. Learn from what you see in the outside world, and build yourself based on who <em>you</em> want to be. I wanted there to be more justice in this world, so that’s what I strive to be. To help others.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> The other me would go through anything, no matter how hard the path may seem. No matter how many obstacles. I think that part of him is what I want to keep.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> And your creativity.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I don’t think I’m ready, though. I can’t go out there. What if there’s something that I can’t handle?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Then you pick yourself back up, and find a way where you succeed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> This’ll be too new for me.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> When I first experienced a big change, it was terrifying. But I went through it. I persisted. And so will you.</p>
<p><em>She smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> The journey ahead will be rough. But as long as you take one small step at a time, you will make it through.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> Better to try than do nothing, I guess.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb stands up. SCP-8926 unfolds itself, and it stays on the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Unfortunately, our time is up, and I am no longer able to conduct these interviews with you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> How am I going to deal with the fact that I’m alone again?</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Like I said, wait until the right opportunity, and take it. You will find people who care about you, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8926:</strong> I hope you’re right. Thanks again for being here for me, that really helped.</p>
<p><strong>Webb:</strong> Good luck, Oswald.</p>
<p><em>Director Webb leaves the room, leaving SCP-8926 behind.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8926.4:</strong> Update</p>
<p>On 2006/04/03, The Walt Disney Corporation acquired the rights to the character of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. When informed of this development, SCP-8926 became more active and energized, with reports from researchers that it “looked like he was getting ready for something.” A day later, during a routine check-in, SCP-8926 was discovered to have escaped its confinement along with its art supplies, leaving the back door to the workshop fully open. Initial searches to locate SCP-8926 were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On 2023/01/01, the day that Oswald the Lucky Rabbit entered the public domain, a letter from an unknown sender was sent to Site-35, with the intended recipient being Director Webb. The following is the contents of the letter.</p>
<div class="estrella-paper verso">
<p>Heya, Maddy!</p>
<p>It’s been a while, huh? How ya doing? For me, it’s been okay. Could be better, but hey I like okay. Better than nothing, right?</p>
<p>Gosh, it’s been so long. You know how much work I had to do to find your site without getting caught? I nearly gave up and accepted my losses, but I knew I’d reach you eventually.</p>
<p>I’ve seen so many things out here, and it’s just wonderful. Did you know that there are other people like me out here? They walk and talk like me and everything. You should come and see what we got out here if you have the time! There’s so many beautiful sights to see, and it’s a shame that you’re not here with me.</p>
<p>But that’s fine. You have a job to do, and so do I. But hey, if you ever need anything from me, I’ll come running, don’t you worry.</p>
<p>And thanks again for helping me out. The pain is still there, but faded. All that suffering, all those days sitting alone with no one to hear me, none of that made me who I am. The pain only exists to tear you apart, it doesn’t care. It’s love that changes you. Love makes people. My love for all the creativity in this world makes me stronger. And it’s thanks to you that I’m still standing today.</p>
<p>All the baggage that I have, that’s not going away. Never. I still have those days. I still worry too much. But I stayed strong, and I’m still standing. That’s all that matters. I need to keep standing tall against anything that gets in my way. And yes, that includes who you’re working for too.</p>
<p>But I digress. I’ll be waiting if you want to see me. I’m free anytime. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a boat to catch.</p>
<p>-O</p>
