            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4640</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4640-1 currently resides in its home in Makawo, Maui County. Two field agents posing as Mr. and Ms. Feeks are to care for SCP-4640-1 while attempting to persuade SCP-4640-1 to provide them with SCP-4640-2. These attempts are to be gentle, non-confrontational, and intermittent (to avoid the manifestation of SCP-4640-3). Once per week, agents are to provide reports regarding SCP-4640-1 and its willingness to provide SCP-4640-2.</p>
<p>Additional agents are to monitor SCP-4640-1 discreetly to prevent SCP-4640-3 manifestations. Should SCP-4640-1 acknowledge Foundation monitoring, an SMK-Class "One Versus Everyone" Scenario<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> could ensue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tests will be conducted in designated Foundation safe-spots, where SCP-4640-1 will be taken to by the previously mentioned agents, which will be announced as family and/or school trips.</span> All tests have been halted until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4640 is the collective designation given to two entities currently linked via an anomalous item. Each of these elements has been subclassified as SCP-4640-1 through -3.</p>
<p>SCP-4640-1 is Andrew Feeks, an 11 year old male of native Hawaiian descent. SCP-4640-1 is non-anomalous; however, it is the owner of SCP-4640-2. Any attempt to forcibly remove SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1 results in the manifestation of SCP-4640-3.</p>
<p>SCP-4640-2 is a yellow circular plastic pin with a stylized purple "W". SCP-4640-1 claims that prior to owning it, neither the coloration or "W" were originally present. As of right now, SCP-4640-2 is attached on the upper-left side of a hoodie constantly wore by SCP-4640-1. When SCP-4640-2's current owner is endangered (physically, psychologically, or emotionally), it causes SCP-4640-3 to manifest.</p>
<p>SCP-4640-3 is a humanoid entity of muscular build, standing approximately 1.8m in height. SCP-4640-3 has dark purple coloration, with a golden "W" on its chest and yellow pigmentation on its hands, feet and pelvic area. It is also of note that, despite having the appearance of a human male, SCP-4640-3 does not posses any genitals or intergluteal cleft. SCP-4640-3 goes by the name of "Wonderman" and presents various anomalous abilities characteristic to classical super-hero tropes. These have been seen to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abnormal strength.</li>
<li>Abnormal speed.</li>
<li>Abnormal endurance.</li>
<li>Being impervious to damage.</li>
<li>Emitting light beams from the eyes at will.</li>
<li>Amnestic capabilities.</li>
<li>Healing individuals through direct skin contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>When SCP-4640-3 manifests, it will go through any measures to protect SCP-4640-1, damaging structures and other living beings if necessary. SCP-4640-3 will also use its amnestic capabilities on SCP-4640-1 in order to eliminate any 'traumatic' experience<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is theorized that SCP-4640-2's and -3's appearance are based off from SCP-4640-1's ideation of the concept of what a superhero is. However, both aforementioned objects share the branding color scheme of various <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-wondertainment-hub">Dr. Wondertainment</a> products. Research into whether SCP-4640-2 is a Dr. Wondertainment product or if SCP-4640-1 has previous knowledge of the company is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4640/1:</strong> Discovery</p>
<p>SCP-4640-3's first recorded sighting occurred in the █████ Elementary High School, where it spontaneously manifested after a series of students laughed at SCP-4640-1 when it accidentally dropped its beverage on itself. SCP-4640-3 obligated the other students to apologize, followed up by amnesticizing SCP-4640-1 of the event. Foundation response teams were dispatched, amnesticized all witnesses and then catalogued the occurrence as an Extranormal Event.</p>
<p>A direct link to SCP-4640-1 was not made until 6/7/18, where it was reported that a "Purple Superhero Saved Child from Deadly Car Accident"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. The accident involved a gas truck colliding on the lateral side of a car being driven by Mr. and Ms. Feeks. All individuals involved, excluding SCP-4640-1, died in the event. SCP-4640-3 then amnesticized SCP-4640-1 and took it to a videogame store that the latter frequents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-4640-1</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Hila (posing as the elementary school's psychologist).</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The interview was conducted for the purpose of gathering information about SCP-4640-2's origin. SCP-4640-1 was told it was chosen at random for a psychological evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Hi Andrew. How've you been doing lately?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> I think I'm doing fine. Why am I here, again?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Well, because I'm still new around here. So, as a way to get to know you all a little better, I'm doing evaluations at random, so don't be scared or surprised if you get called again in the future.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> So, what do you think of yourself around here? Are you the nasty trickster that puts thumbtacks in other's seats? Or are you the one that likes to make everyone laugh with crazy sayings?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> I uh… I guess I'm just the quiet one.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Oh, that's totally fine! Not everyone needs a wacky personality. Actually, did you know people who are reserved are usually more intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Well, I'm assuming so. You have such good grades afterall!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> <em>chuckles</em> Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> I assume you must be a creative person as well. I've heard you like to doodle in your notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> I do! Would you like to see some of them! Can I bring my math notebook? That one's got the most drawings.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Maybe later, Andrew. I noticed you have a rather interesting pin there, and it made me curious about your personal interests. Is it from a show?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> It's not. It's a Wonderman pin!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> And what's Wonderman exactly? Never heard that name.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> He used to be just in my drawings, but since I got the pin he actually became real! He teleports to me whenever I need him!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Is that so? And where did you get it? I mean, who wouldn't want a personal superhero. I would like one too!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> It came inside a plastic box in this weird cereal mom once bought. It was delicious, but she says she can't find more of it. My favorite part were the marshmallows. I'm pretty sure they changed in color every time you closed and open your eyes, but mom told me she only could see them blue.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Perhaps she went to a store she normally doesn't go to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1</strong> I don't know. She never told me. Hey isn't it weird she was the only one that bought the cereal? There's normally more boxes behind the ones you first see.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> It does sound pretty weird. Maybe the cereal got discontinued or something. Oh would you look at the time! It's almost recess! Let's finish this chat for now. I'll see when we can meet together again. I got really curious about this "Wonderman" you mention. You're free to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4640-1:</strong> Ok thanks! Bye Miss Yancy!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Hila:</strong> Bye Andrew!</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Investigation into all supermarkets located near SCP-4640-1's residence has revealed that no personnel or written records evidence the existence of a cereal advertising the described features. However, security footage of Ms. Feeks analysing in a confused manner a Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box and then adding it to the shopping cart was found in █████████ ██████. Whether this footage has any relevance is still being debated.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>The following is a series of failed attempts at obtaining SCP-4640-2. The list has been recently abridged. Consult Dr. Okoa for the complete testing log.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 1</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Agent Kiliwa and Gersh, posing as SCP-4640-1 parents, attempt to acquire SCP-4640-2 while it's asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 is seen with SCP-4640-2 now attached to its pajamas. When attempting to remove the object, SCP-4640-3 manifested. The entity raised its right index finger up to its mouth and 'shushed' at the agents until they left the room. Attempts at reentering the room were met with SCP-4640-3 remanifesting and repeating the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 5</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Agent Phoros poses as a substitute teacher and attempts to confiscate SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 responded by taking SCP-4640-2 from its hoodie and placing it inside its pocket, apologizing for wearing the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Follow up to previous test. Agent Phoros demands SCP-4640-1 to give her SCP-4640-2.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 reacts with fear, resulting in SCP-4640-3 manifesting. The entity then tells Agent Phoros to apologize, followed by the agent being forced verbally to sit at a corner of the class. SCP-4640-3 watched over the agent to prevent her from getting up until the schoolday was over.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 9</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> An individual named Robert Frow (allegedly SCP-4640-1's 'best friend') is paid 10$ in order for him to ask SCP-4640-1 if he can borrow SCP-4640-2.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 responded with a "no" without further comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 10</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Frow is told to use his 10$ to buy SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 explicitly told Robert to get away from him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 16</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Agent McKelson, posing as a clerk at a grocery store SCP-4640-1 often visits, attempts to convince SCP-4640-1 to give him SCP-4640-2 in exchange for any confectionery of his liking.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-1 turns down the offer, indicating SCP-4640-2 is 'more valuable than candy'. Despite no danger or offense towards SCP-4640-1 having been made, SCP-4640-3 still manifested, adding to the former's comment that "eating too much sugar is bad for [SCP-4640-1]'s health anyways". The entity then gestured a 'thumbs up' towards SCP-4640-1, which responded in the same manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 23</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> Agents Kiliwa and Gersh walk with SCP-4640-1 towards an alleyway, where a staged mugging act (with D-9022 being the thief) will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-3 manifested and punched D-9022 in the face, breaking its nose. D-9022 was rendered it unconscious. SCP-4640-3 then turns to face SCP-4640-1, exclaims the phrase "I'm the Wonderman" in a lower pitched voice followed by its demanifestation.</p>
<p>Medical examinations on D-9022 revealed minor skull fractures in its front and back side. These appear to originate from the initial punch at its face and the subsequent impact with the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 30</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> D-9023 is instructed to walk unsuspiciously towards SCP-4640-1 and then steal SCP-4640-2 as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-3 manifested while D-9023 was at a meter distance from SCP-4640-1. It then grabbed D-9023 by the collar, stared at it in an intimidating manner and then threw it on the floor with excessive force. This resulted in various burst fractures along D-9023's spine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 31</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> D-9024 is instructed to walk unsuspiciously behind SCP-4640-1 and then knock it unconscious with the given baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> SCP-4640-3 manifests the moment the baseball bat makes contact with SCP-4640-1's head. SCP-4640-3 then takes the bat and breaks it in half, followed by SCP-4640-3 throwing the broken bat pieces at D-9023 with enough force as to have broken two of its ribs. SCP-4640-3 then turns to SCP-4640-1, heals it via anomalous means and then amnesticizes it of the event.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 32</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> D-9025 is told to incapacitate SCP-4640-1 via shooting one of its legs from an area SCP-4640-1 does not have visibility of.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-4640-3 manifested when the fired bullet was 10m short of connecting with its target. The bullet ricochet off when making contact with the entity, damaging a nearby building. SCP-4640-3 then redirected its line of sight towards D-9025 and fired a laser at its location, effectively killing D-9025. After a few seconds, SCP-4640-3 turns towards one of the hidden cameras recording the test and stares at it for a total of 5 minutes before attending SCP-4640-1 and demanifesting.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>On 15/9/2018, SCP-4640-1 started experiencing a nightmare involving itself being pursued by a multitude of characters originating from various cartoon shows it watches<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>. This resulted in SCP-4640-3 manifesting at seemingly random locations, in an approximate radius of 6.5 kilometers from SCP-4640-1. The entity acted as if it were in combat with said characters, often using its anomalous capabilities to 'defend' SCP-4640-1. In said attempts to 'defend' SCP-4640-1, SCP-4640-3 displayed a large quantity of previously unknown abnormal abilities, some of which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight.</li>
<li>Spontaneous generation and control over fire.</li>
<li>Spontaneous generation and control over electricity.</li>
<li>Generation of ice particles via exhaling.</li>
<li>Manifestation of solid, translucent barriers.</li>
<li>Self-duplication.</li>
<li>Short-ranged teleportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This resulted in the destruction of multiple buildings, with a total death count of ██ and ██ injured. The rest of the surrounding populace at this point had woken up, most of which sought shelter while the remaining few attempted to record the event.</p>
<p>Despite an additional SCP-4640-3 instance preventing the commotion from interrupting SCP-4640-1's sleep, Agents Kiliwa and Gersh managed to successfully wake up SCP-4640-1, resulting in the immediate demanifestation of all SCP-4640-3 instances.</p>
<p>Airborne amnestics were released and a fake memory of an earthquake was implanted. All recorded evidence of the event was destroyed, with copies currently being stored in the Video Archives.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Such scenario would consist of SCP-4640-3 identifying the Foundation as a threat towards SCP-4640-1, and in response attempt to destroy it. This would, in return, lead to a Broken Masquerade/Breach of Normalcy scenario. Since no efficient way has been found to neutralize either object comprising SCP-4640, the entirety of the Foundation, along with any affiliated parties, would be considered to be at risk.</div>
