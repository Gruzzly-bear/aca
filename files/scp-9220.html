<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Pregnancy records of all maternity wards worldwide are to be monitored for keywords such as "immaculate", "spontaneous", and "miraculous." If keywords are discovered, at least one Foundation agent must be stationed at the associated maternity ward until it can be confirmed that no cases of SCP-9220 are present at the facility.</p>
<p>Per Ethics Committee memorandum, any identified mothers must be given the explicit option to abort the fetus. If the mother chooses to carry the SCP-9220-A instance to term, the Foundation agent is to assume the role of the mother's primary obstetrician and assign regular check-ups. Upon delivery, the SCP-9220-A instance is to be immediately removed from the facility and brought to Site-22.</p>
<p>While the mother is convalescing in recovery, Class C amnestics are to be administered, targeting all memories associated with the pregnancy. Class C must also be administered to the immediate family within 1-2 weeks.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>All instances of SCP-9220-A are to be kept at Site-22, in a specially prepared cold storage chamber. Each instance is to be strapped to a medical table and fitted with a standard hospital gown. Once a week, a researcher must remove the gown and thoroughly inspect the instance for new growths and bodily changes.</p>
<p>Any instance which has been in Foundation containment for a period greater than 21 years is to be removed from cold storage and moved to a standard humanoid containment chamber. Once activity is confirmed, the attending researchers are to follow the steps outlined in Addendum 9220.4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9220 is a condition effecting approximately 0.00001%<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> of humans bearing maternal organs. SCP-9220 manifests as spontaneous pregnancy, in many cases without any prior evidence of conception.</p>
<p>All babies produced from SCP-9220 are born dead. These corpses, hereafter referred to as instances of SCP-9220-A, display advanced stages of dehydration and desiccation. SCP-9220-A appear to have been dead from well before the time of birth, and show no signs of heartbeat, brain waves, or other metabolic functions. In spite of this, instances will continue to grow and age at a rate equivalent to a living human.</p>
<p>Upon reaching a point hereby referred to as the Terminal Age (approx. 21 years), the instance will open their eyes and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Out of the ██ thousand documented cases that have reached this stage, approximately 6% are currently used by the Foundation for testing, therapy, and other classified responsibilities, as assigned by the Department of Massage Therapy. The other 94% [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9220.1:</strong> Notable SCP-9220-A Instances</p>
<p>The following is an abridged list of SCP-9220-A instances with noteworthy or exemplary features. This documentation is compiled from medical chart notation left by attending researchers.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">　</span></p>
<div class="blbf-main">
<div class="blbf-refuah blbf-instances">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-9220-A-113, "REFUAH"<br/>
<strong>Assigned researcher(s):</strong> Xir Lin Sun</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[DOB CLASSIFIED]:</strong> -A-113 born 1.389 kg (3 pounds 1 ounce). Instance maintains a fetal pose with hands at the chest.</p>
<p><strong>7 y.o.:</strong> Researcher Sun finds an injury on the instance's arm while performing weekly inspection. Right arm was slashed with a sharp blade, most likely a kitchen knife. The cut runs from the instance's shoulder to the palm wrist. Maximum depth of 5 cm and bled profusely in spite of desiccation. After short deliberation, Sun was given permission to treat the wound as if the subject were alive. Bleeding stopped after two hours.</p>
<p><strong>7 y.o.:</strong> Bandages removed for the final time. The scar has not healed.</p>
<p><strong>7 y.o.:</strong> Researcher Sun requests permission to suture the scar with standard medical supplies. Request approved. Sun requests access to medical-grade anesthesia for the purposes of the operation. Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>15 y.o.:</strong> Sun observes an anomalous event while performing daily inspection. Black substance is seen moving through the epidermis. Due to the rate of progression, the substance is quickly identified as tattoo ink. Over the course of 4 hours, the tattoo covers the majority of the right arm. Full image cannot be discerned due to the poor state of the epidermis, but appears to resemble a tree branch or large vine that is emerging from the scar.</p>
<p>Sun requests two-week leave. Request granted. Following this, Sun is reassigned to [DATA EXPUNGED; CLEARANCE LEVEL 4 REQUIRED].</p>
<p><strong>[Data abridged for brevity.]</strong> Eleven (11) more "tattoo events" are observed while in containment. Notable tattoos include: a bird (Cactus wren) below the left breast; an open birdcage in the center of the back; a complex plant structure down the left arm mirroring the right, but with thorns and budding flowers; and a small cursive script on the ankle that reads "I HATE MOM."</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> SCP-9220-A-113 was incinerated during Incident 9220-01. Further details are classified. Personnel of Clearance Level 4 or higher may refer to Addendum 9220.4 for more information.</p>

<div class="blbf-birkat blbf-instances">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-9220-A-522, "BIRKAT"<br/>
<strong>Assigned researcher(s):</strong> Annabelle Kraken</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[DOB CLASSIFIED]:</strong> -A-522 born 1.170 kg (1 pound 6 ounces). Due to complications during birth, the subject had to be delivered via cesarean section. Instance is much smaller than average and is being monitored daily.</p>
<p><strong>1 y.o.:</strong> Instance is now confirmed to be growing, albeit at a slower rate than usual. Researcher Kraken requests to continue daily inspections. Request approved.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Researcher Kraken observes bruises on the instance's face. Bruises match those commonly seen after impact with a blunt object, such as a baseball or a fist. Due to the lack of circulation, bruising does not fade.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Kraken observes bruising on both of the instance's arms. Details same as previous.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Kraken observes bruising on instance's torso, as well as marks around the neck indicative of strangulation.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Kraken requests to inspect the instance at night, "in order to stop them from hitting him." Request approved on a temporary basis.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Kraken observes bruising around [DATA EXPUNGED]. Kraken requests access to off-site resources, with the stated intention of researching a way to prevent the anomaly's progression. Request denied, on the basis that the subject is not actually alive.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> Anomalous event is observed during nightly inspection. The instance spontaneously lights on fire, producing large amounts of smoke. Kraken remains in the room against advisement. Fire dies down after 3-5 seconds, but body continues to crust and blacken. Kraken states aloud that the subject's eyes have opened. She declares intent to carry the subject to the on-site emergency shower. Request denied. Kraken disregards orders and puts her arms around the subject. The body crumbles into large, charcoal-like pieces upon contact.</p>

<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-9220-A-10384, "TEFILLAH"<br/>
<strong>Assigned researcher(s):</strong> Harelyn Steel</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[DOB CLASSIFIED]:</strong> -A-10384 born 1.814 kg (4 pounds no ounces). The body is in a relaxed position with arms at the sides.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> No developments.</p>
<p><strong>10 y.o.:</strong> No developments.</p>
<p><strong>15 y.o.:</strong> No developments.</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> While preparing to move the instance to standard containment, Researcher Steel discovers anomalous mutilations. Chest and groin area [DATA EXPUNGED]. Steel becomes distraught and initially requests leave, only to rescind this and instead request access to standard medical supplies in order to treat the wounds. Request granted.</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> Bandages removed for the final time. As per previous instances, wounds have only been superficially resealed.</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> Researcher Steel notes an anomalous event during daily inspection. Instance is found to be wearing clothing outside of the standard medical gown. Clothing items include a pair of [REDACTED]'s boxers and a binder. Steel becomes distraught and temporarily leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> Steel requests it be noted that documentation should only refer to the instance using nonstandard (they/them) pronouns. Request approved.</p>
<p><strong>21 y.o.:</strong> Shortly after the previous request was approved, their eyes opened. Protocol initiated per Addendum 9220.4. SCP-9220-A-10384 is now employed with the Foundation through [DATA EXPUNGED PER LEVEL 4/NEED-TO-KNOW].</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9220.2:</strong> SCP-9220-A-607, "HASID"</p>
<div class="blbf-main">
<div class="blbf-hasid blbf-instances">
<p><strong>Instance:</strong> SCP-9220-A-607, "HASID"<br/>
<strong>Assigned researcher(s):</strong> Annabelle Kraken, Harelyn Steel, Xir Lin Sun</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[DOB CLASSIFIED]:</strong> In spite of signature SCP-9220 characteristics, -A-607 was delivered at a healthy weight of 2.920 kg (6 pounds 7 ounces). Further investigation has revealed the presence of a heavy growth in -A-607's abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>1 y.o.:</strong> Instance maintains steady growth, while no changes have been observed in the object in its abdomen. Body remains unusually heavy. Researcher Kraken requests approval to draw an intravenous sample from the growth. Request approved.</p>
<p>Kraken successfully draws 3 mL of living red blood cells from the abdomen. Researcher Steel requests approval to perform an ultrasound. Request approved.</p>
<p><strong>1 y.o.:</strong> Ultrasound confirms that the growth in the abdomen is an undeveloped fetus. Size is extremely small and is analogous to less than a week of development in a healthy pregnancy. A corpus luteum<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> is present in the ultrasound. The umbilical cord is highly developed and represents the majority of the instance's additional weight.</p>
<p>Control samples of blood were drawn from the abdomen and thigh. As is to be expected from instances of SCP-9220-A, there is no blood in the body. However, researchers were again able to draw a small sample of blood from the umbilical cord.</p>
<p><strong>5 y.o.:</strong> The fetus shows no development.</p>
<p><strong>10 y.o.:</strong> The fetus shows no development.</p>
<p><strong>15 y.o.</strong> Fetus may have developed, but it is impossible to tell due to the relatively small size at this stage in development (fetus is smaller than a grain of rice). Researcher Sun requests weekly ultrasound schedule. Request approved.</p>
<p><strong>15 y.o.:</strong> A heartbeat is detected in the fetus. Effective immediately, all further activity with this project requires the direct approval of the O5 Council.</p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">　</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>While many of the details of SCP-9220-A-607's pregnancy are classified under NEED-TO-KNOW designation, the following timeline has been approved for Level 4 Clearance. For the sake of clarification, -A-607 is referred to by the codename of "HASID," and the fetus is referred to by the codename of "CHESED."</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>First Trimester (1-12 weeks)</strong></p>
<p>CHESED's heartbeat weakens rapidly in the days after first detection. Primary care team (Rsrs. Sun, Kraken, and Steel) request permission to intravenously provide blood to the umbilical cord via the insertion of an artificial vein in HASID's lower back. Request approved. HASID is moved to a modified observation table which allows for the upper body to rest at an incline. Holes in the back of the table, and between the legs, allow for easy access to the back and abdomen. Shortly following surgery, CHESED's heartbeat can be detected normally again.</p>
<p>Less than a week later, the artificial vein collapses. Steel theorizes this is due to the lack of musculature supporting it. A new artificial vein is inserted directly through the belly button. A specially-designed "muscle" made of silicone and wiring is wrapped around HASID's abdomen. The "muscle" pulses regularly, simulating the natural contractions of organic tissue.</p>
<p>At 11 weeks, Sun reports active brain waves coming from CHESED. Ultrasounds show clearly-developed organs and limbs. Prenatal test confirms that CHESED is female.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Second Trimester (13-27 weeks)</strong></p>
<p>Fetus shows late signs of placental insufficiency. The corpus luteum, which should have detached by week 12, is still attached to the uterine lining and is no longer producing progesterone. The placental structure has not grown to replace the corpus luteum. Due to these insufficiencies, HASID has not produced an amniotic sac or amniotic fluid suitable for supporting CHESED's development.</p>
<p>Kraken proposes the installation of a modified pump around HASID's vaginal opening. The pump will serve to both seal the womb for CHESED's protection, as well as provide a way of introducing artificial amniotic fluid into CHESED's environment. Approved.</p>
<p>During installation, an artificial semipermeable membrane is pushed through the pump and expanded within HASID's uterus. Ultrasound confirms that CHESED is successfully engulfed by the membrane. The membrane is then pumped full of a modified Ringer's lactate solution consisting of sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, water, and [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p>During week 15 ultrasound, Steel reports that CHESED performed a roll by kicking off the side of the artificial sac.</p>
<p>During week 17 ultrasound, Kraken reports the muffled sound of CHESED giggling.</p>
<p>Prior to week 19 ultrasound, Sun requests approval to bring simple audio recordings (e.g. forest sounds, a field recording of a crowded park, classical music, etc.) into the observation chamber for the sake of CHESED's development. Request approved.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Third Trimester (28-40 weeks)</strong></p>
<p>During week 28 ultrasound, CHESED is observed sleeping soundly. This behavior is to be expected of a baby in the third trimester.</p>
<p>At the start of week 33, Sun reports that HASID's decay has progressed suddenly. Deep purple bruising is visible on both sides of HASID's body, in the approximate positions of the liver and kidneys. Increased decay has never before been observed in an instance of SCP-9220-A.</p>
<p>After inspection, Steel theorizes that HASID's apparently healthy umbilical cord is attempting to circulate waste products from CHESED out of HASID's bloodstream. HASID's lack of functioning circulatory system would cause the blood to stagnate, resulting in a form of late-stage livor mortis. Concerns are expressed by the team that if left untreated, the body may fall apart due to blood pooling.</p>
<p>Proposals are made to remove the artificial womb from the body, with the umbilical cord still attached for the remainder of the pregnancy. Kraken protests due to the continued damage the umbilical cord will cause to HASID. Sun becomes incensed at the implication that HASID's corpse is of equal value to CHESED's ongoing survival. Kraken begins to describe a theoretical model for an artificial umbilical cord, but is cut off by Steel, who cites the 0% success rate of artificial human pregnancies. Kraken cites the higher success rate of artificial animal pregnancies, and states that the Foundation is inherently more capable than any Veiled group of scientists.</p>
<p>Sun again asserts that the discussion is irrelevant due to the fact that only one of the subjects in question is actually alive. Kraken becomes agitated and references SCP-9220-A-522, stating that "You [Sun] didn't have to watch <em>your</em> baby go through that." Sun begins crying. At this point, HASID's right arm falls off the observation table and snaps off of the body above the elbow. Kraken shouts an expletive and leaves the room.</p>
<p>Following a two-day recess, the O5 Council orders the team to proceed by removing the artificial womb from HASID while leaving the umbilical cord in-tact. The team is given explicit permission to remove the artificial womb without regard to the state of HASID, and is permitted to completely sever the pelvic floor if necessary. Under protest from Kraken, the right arm is disposed of.</p>
<p>During surgery, Steel successfully performs a cesarean cut to HASID's abdomen, but is unable to remove the artificial sac due to the rigid state of the dried tissue. Steel expresses concern that the only way to remove the sac is by completely cutting open HASID's torso. Sun urges him to proceed. Kraken remains silent. Steel appears uncomfortable and excuses himself, stating he needs to "think about this."</p>
<p>Sun picks up the surgery tools and declares her intention to continue with the operation. Kraken remains silent. Sun opens the cesarean cut down to HASID's vaginal opening, eviscerating the front of the body. She is still unable to remove the artificial sac. Sun states aloud that she is going cut horizontally in order to further open up the torso.</p>
<p>The resulting conversation between Sun and Kraken has been struck from the record.</p>
<p>Sun proceeds by making two horizontal cuts on the upper and lower abdomen, starting at the cesarean cut. Sun then uses her hands to forcibly widen the opening. She is able to remove the artificial sac without further difficulty. CHESED can be seen within the membrane and is sleeping. She moves restlessly in her sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
<p>CHESED was delivered by the containment team prematurely on week 34. The decision was made to remove CHESED early due to the rapid deterioration of HASID, which presented difficulties in carrying the baby to full term. Additionally, the team expressed concerns that decaying matter from HASID's corpse could become incorporated with the blood circulating through the umbilical cord, causing harm to CHESED.</p>
<p>The research team anticipated complications during delivery, namely in the sudden decrease of oxygen CHESED would receive to the brain following the severing of the umbilical cord. To combat birth asphyxia, a therapeutic hypothermia chamber was prepared and fitted as a nursery for CHESED's early development. The nursery was prepared by members Site-22's Department of Massage Therapy. Facilities were designed to achieve a target body temperature of 33 degrees Celsius, which would slow higher brain activity and allow the brain to repair any damage caused by oxygen deprivation.</p>
<p>CHESED was born 1.956 kg (4 pounds 5 ounces) and designated SCP-9220-A-607-B. In addition to the anticipated asphyxia, further complications arose immediately after the severing of the umbilical cord. An unaccountable amount of blood poured from the umbilical cord, originating from both CHESED and HASID. In addition to severe and dangerous levels of blood loss, the sudden outpouring of blood created physical problems for the researchers attempting to move CHESED to the cryogenic nursery. Once CHESED was moved, the team was able to staunch the bleeding by applying a torniquet to the umbilical cord.</p>
<p>CHESED had suffered extreme post-partum blood loss, and displayed symptoms of Grade 3 Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Symptoms included: low heartbeat, no response to stimulation, chalky white skin tone, and difficulty moving limbs. CHESED entered seizure three times during the first 24 hours, and had to be under constant observation.</p>
<p>In spite of difficulties, CHESED was still alive after one week, and the remainder of the umbilical cord was successfully removed. The pregnancy was declared a success.</p>
<p>HASID's disposal was undertaken by Kraken. Immediately following this, Kraken requested reassignment and was moved to the SCP-████ project.</p>

<p>This document is to remain up-to-date with CHESED's known disabilities, and current methods of care.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spastic diplegia:</strong></span> Planned physical therapy includes: assisted and unassisted physical exercises, practice with both a wheelchair and forearm crutches, and equine-assisted therapy starting at the age of 5. Authorized personnel may contact Dr. L. Loudermilk with the Department of Massage Therapy for a detailed schedule.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Epilepsy:</strong></span> <em>(Diagnosed 06/14/2032)</em> CHESED displays three different kinds of seizures: absence (petit mal), atonic, and tonic-clonic (grand mal). CHESED regularly presents with absence seizures, with the most recorded at 43 in one day. Atonic and tonic-clonic are less common, but significantly more dangerous, and must be immediately reported at the first sign of onset.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Generalized depression:</strong></span> <em>(Diagnosed 01/18/2036)</em> CHESED is generally energetic, and enthusiastic about therapy assignments, but shows resistance to any long-term attachments. When playing with toys such as dolls or stuffed animals, CHESED does not attempt to name the toys or identify with them, and does not display preference for specific toys, as would be expected from other children of her age. She is likely to develop a major depressive disorder when she is older.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Equine-Assisted Therapy (PT) Session #1, 10/05/2036</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subject:</span> SCP-9220-A-607-B, "CHESED" (5 y.o., see documentation for full list of disabilities)<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapist:</span> Dr. Lucy Loudermilk<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assistant(s):</span> Jr Rsrs. L. Diamond and N. Daywood<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Horse Handler:</span> Dr. Ivory Iyengar<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Horse:</span> Dusty (14 y.o. grulla blanket Appaloosa, male)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Others:</span> Sun Xir Lin, primary caretaker for "CHESED"</p>
<p>This therapy session was conducted in the covered arena at Site-22.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Dr. Iyengar leads the horse to the mounting block. A pause as the horse is "squared" (positioned with an even stance for easy mounting).]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> (to CHESED) You ready?</p>
<p><em>[CHESED is lifted out of her wheelchair by Sun, who approaches the mounting block.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I think it would be safer if I put her in the saddle.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> That rather defeats the purpose, Miss Sun. She needs to develop the ability to fully stretch both of her legs. Please trust me and my team. (to CHESED) You feel okay, hun? You wanna try putting your leg over?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Okay. You see Mister Diamond right there? Don't be frightened if he grabs your leg. He's only making sure you don't fall.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I'm not scared!</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> <em>(chuckles)</em> Up you go.</p>
<p><em>[Sun puts down CHESED, who stands weakly with her legs in a "scissored" gait.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> She has clear difficulty supporting her upper half.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Loudermilk crouches at her side.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> I'm holding your left leg. You've got to put your right leg over, but keep your left leg planted. It's gonna be tough! Ready?</p>
<p><em>[CHESED makes an aggressive motion with her torso, attempting to swing her leg over the horse. Assistant Diamond grabs her leg before she can accidentally kick the horse. She cries out in pain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>DIAMOND:</strong> Reset?</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> No, no, no. She can push through. C'mon, hun. I got you.</p>
<p><em>[Vocalizing continuously in distress, CHESED successfully stretches her leg over the horse's back. Assistants guide her into the saddle. She is visibly shaking.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>(sobbing)</em> It <em>hurts</em>!</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> I bet!</p>
<p><em>[Still crying, CHESED pushes against the horn with both hands, attempting to lift herself out of the saddle.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> She wants off. The assistant is right, let's reset.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You want to stop?</p>
<p><em>[CHESED does not respond. She strikes the horn repeatedly with both hands. Dr. Iyengar soothes the horse with soft vocalizations.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> If you want to stop, you gotta tell me.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>Wh</em>-hen will it <em>suh-suh</em>-stop <em>hur-hurting?</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> When you can relax, hun. Somebody out there gifted you with muscles that are too stiff. But Dusty, right here… <em>(conspiratorially)</em> Have you <em>seen</em> how many legs he has?</p>
<p><em>[Despite herself, CHESED giggles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> That's right, he's got double the legs that you do! Now, what I know is, if we let him walk a little, you're gonna feel every step he takes. And your muscles can learn from his. I'm gonna have Mix Iyengar over there start walking, and I want you to close your eyes, hun. I want you to imagine every step Dusty takes. And I want you to think like it's your leg taking that step. You think you can do that?</p>
<p><em>[CHESED wipes her tears with one hand. She nods.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Loudermilk nods at Iyengar. They click their teeth at the horse, and the procession moves forward.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Approx. five minutes of walking removed for brevity.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> How you feeling up there?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Mm…</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Mm?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Better.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You look better. It okay if I touch your leg here?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Yeah, hun, that's not bad. You up for a game?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>(brightening)</em> A game?</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You see that pouch on the saddle? Right next to Mister Diamond. Now, Miss Daywood here, she has these colored rings. When she holds one up, you're gonna reach with your right hand and take it. Then put it into the pouch next to Mister Diamond. But the hard part is, you can't switch hands. You got to <em>cross</em> your body with your right hand. Okay? It might feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Okay. I want to try.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> That-a girl. Go ahead, Nina.</p>
<p><em>[Assistant Daywood takes Loudermilk's place and begins holding up rings for CHESED.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Loudermilk steps back, to where Sun is following the procession at a distance.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You know, this is the worst place to stand if the horse kicks.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> If this horse kicks with the subject still on it, your Department is going to have a lot bigger problems than <em>my</em> well-being.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> Yes, I did hear that the O5s have invested a great deal of time and money into this young woman. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> What have <em>you</em> invested?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> …I don't have to answer your questions. The project is classified.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Hmm. So it is.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Is this really supposed to help her? It just seems… ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You think horses are ridiculous?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Don't be glib. I think a horse teaching a little girl to walk is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Well, I may have dumbed it down for her somewhat. It's biophysical. The rhythm of Dusty's steps is forcing her hips to move in a natural human gait, thereby rewriting some of her neural pathways. When she dismounts, I guarantee you, she'll be standing normally.</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> You really love her, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I told you, I don't have to answer your questions.</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Hmm. So you did.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>(shouting)</em> Miss Sun! Watch! I'm gonna jump off!</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Hey— Don't—</p>
<p><em>[CHESED swings one leg over the horse and slides down his side. Assistant Diamond catches her by the midriff and gently guides her to the ground.]</em></p>
<p><em>[CHESED appears unsteady. Then she finds her balance and stands up straight, with corrected posture.]</em></p>
<p><em>[She runs towards Sun.]</em></p>
<p><em>[As she gets closer, she loses her balance in the sand. Sun catches her wrists with both hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>(breathless)</em> …Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You… are you…</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Miss Sun? Are you okay?</p>
<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> …You're so fast. You're doing a great job.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> <em>(giggling)</em> I'm gonna be the fastest ever!</p>
<p><em>[She runs back to the horse.]</em></p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> That's really good progress. If the Council approves us for, say, once or twice a week… I'd daresay you can throw out her wheelchair by the time she's a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You mean this won't last?</p>
<p><strong>LOUDERMILK:</strong> Not yet. But it's just time, Miss Sun. Just a little time. Don't you think that's worth it?</p>
<p><em>[Sun does not respond.]</em></p>
<p><em>[CHESED runs in a circle around the horse. She is laughing with delight.]</em></p>

<p><strong>The following audio recording took place during Sun's scheduled check-up of SCP-9220-A-607-B on 05/13/2037. The audio was acquired via remote monitoring of Sun's phone, which was in her pocket throughout the incident.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Muffled footsteps. Airlock disengages and reseals.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Good morning. Are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> …Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> No sleeping in. It's time for therapy.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I'm not tough enough.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> It's hard! I don't want to. Everyone is so strong, even Dusty. But not me.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Well… Perhaps you could pretend. Come on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Muffled sound of sheets moving. The heart monitor can be heard beating steadily.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I want to go outside.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Hmm. After your therapy exercises—</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> No! I want to go now.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Nonsense. How are you going to walk without doing your exercises?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I can do it!</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Is that so?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Sheets rustling. She grunts with effort.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> …Lift me first.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[An audible sigh. A brief sound of strain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> See? I can do it!</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I helped you.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Nuh-uh!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[A slight laugh. It is so soft, the microphone barely registers.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Alright. I will accompany you outside…</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> …and then you will return for therapy. Do you promise?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> …Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Take my hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Two sets of footsteps, uneven. The airlock disengages. The sound of their feet hitting the ground expands in the larger space of the hallway.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Tell me something.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Tell me something. Mom always used to tell me things.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Your mother?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> When was this?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I don't know. When I was little?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You <em>are</em> little.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[She giggles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Please? It can be anything.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I do not have anything to tell you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Long silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Do you mean what you say? You've really talked to your mother before?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Yeah. You haven't talked to your mom?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Of course I have. What I mean is— …Do you understand what you're saying? You talked to her before you were born?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> And what did she say to you?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Um… I don't remember always. She said stuff about being dead. She said I could be like her and lie down on a table and not move, not ever, but it wouldn't matter. Because things would still happen to me. She said she thought maybe she could get out of it, if she did something like that. But it didn't work. She said it doesn't work for any of them.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Any of them?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> The other, um… bodies. Like my mom.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> She knew about that?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Mom knew all sorts of things!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Mmm… My legs hurt. Carry me?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> We haven't even made it outside yet.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Mmm…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Another weary sigh. A grunt of exertion.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Off we go.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[One set of footsteps.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Can I see mom?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I promise I won't cry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I won't even do the thing where I cry a little and hide it. I know you were mad after we watched that movie and I hid my face the whole time so you couldn't tell I was crying. I won't do that anymore. I won't even be pretend-tough. I'll be real-tough! I promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I really want to see mom again.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Can you keep a secret?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You can.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subject:</span> Researcher Harelyn Steel<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interrogator:</span> Dr. Sebastian Bonds, Enhanced Interrogator</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Were you aware of the agreement between Researcher Sun and Researcher Kraken?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> No. I was out of the room when it happened. They completed the operation without me.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> You were out of the room for a long time, then.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> It was… I was… There were a lot of things I needed to… reconcile.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> You had misgivings about the operation.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> I think most people would. Xir Lin was the only one who…</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Wanted to do it?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Th-That's not what I would say. I would say that Xir Lin was confident about the necessity of the operation.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> At what point did you reenter the room?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> They were already done. They had taken the artificial muscle off of HASID and wrapped it around the womb. It was sitting in a bundle on an operating tray, next to HASID's table. The umbilical cord was still attached. It was exactly as we'd been instructed. I didn't have any reason to suspect either of them.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> And you entered the room after the operation was completed.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> In that case, what makes you so confident that this was when the two of them made their agreement?</p>
<p><em>[Pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> When… When else would it have happened?</p>
<p><em>[Pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Can I tell you something, Harelyn? This is my first time at Site-22. Funny place. Horses running around. And debrief told me I'm not allowed to touch the walls. I take it the Massage Therapy folks are always like this?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Well… yes.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> I took a peek in R&amp;D. You heard about these modalities they have? Anomalous massage techniques. Well, some of them are more like chiropractics. I watched them do testing on one, it was, ah… Modality Carpalis-XK3.</p>
<p><em>[Pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> What, uh… What was it?</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> It's a wrist massage.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> O-Oh.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> After it's administered, each time you tell a lie, one of your bones turns into glass. Just one. The effect is permanent. Every time you lie, another bone. The way I figure, if I put in a request to the O5s to get specialty training on one of these modalities, I don't think they'd even blink. I mean, they <em>really</em> want to know what happened to this corpse. <em>[Pause]</em> So what do you say, Harelyn? Should I put in the request?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> That won't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Glad to hear it. Why don't you tell me what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Look, I-I didn't— What I've told you is true. I didn't hear anything, I didn't know anything. When I came back, neither of them told me anything. But they were both… acting weird. Xir Lin told me to leave early, said she would stay the night to watch the baby. I… felt bad for not completing the operation, so I told her I would stay instead. But she wouldn't listen. We got into kind of an argument about it. I gave in when Kraken started agreeing with her, because… I mean, if <em>Kraken</em> said it was okay, then who was I to argue?</p>
<p>I left, but I didn't go. I went around back to Security Admin and acted like I was there for some cooler talk. I got a peek at the cameras, and I can see the two of them crouched over the main operating table, barely moving. Shoulder-to-shoulder. Their backs were to the camera, so I couldn't see what they were doing.</p>
<p>I came in early the next morning. They'd stitched up HASID's stomach. With all the… work… Xir Lin had done on her… it must have taken them all night.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> And you didn't report it?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Why would I? The three of us had already fought about HASID. I thought maybe Xir Lin felt bad. Or maybe the opposite, maybe she was trying to make Kraken feel better. So they got some closure on company time. So what? I'd be an asshole to report something like that.</p>
<p>More importantly, I thought it was harmless.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> You thought?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> So… the night we delivered CHESED. It was hell. There was so much blood, even all the equipment in the operating room wasn't enough to prepare us. I slipped at one point, nearly cracked my jaw on the tile. In all the chaos, I could barely keep track of anything that was going on, but…</p>
<p>Xir Lin and I took the baby to the nursery. And I guess Kraken just left. I honestly wasn't paying attention to her at that point. I mean, we couldn't leave CHESED alone for a second. If she wasn't in the middle of a seizure, then she was just lying there, half-dead. And we had to keep her cold, which just made her seem more dead. My point is, I wasn't thinking about Kraken. She never needs anyone's help, anyway.</p>
<p>It was days later when I got a chance to go over the debrief, and I saw that HASID was gone. I realized right away that I'd never been told. I had no idea what they did with the body. It had just disappeared. And Kraken herself had already been reassigned to some other skip.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> And you still didn't report it?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> It says in the debrief that Kraken was in charge of disposal. I assumed that she took care of it.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Are you aware of <a href="scp-9023.html">Kraken's history</a> with the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Where is HASID now, Harelyn?</p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEEL:</strong> Honestly, I don't.</p>
<p><strong>BONDS:</strong> Thank you, Harelyn. That will be enough.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Steel has been reprimanded and put on a two-week leave, after which he will receive reassignment to a new instance of SCP-9220-A. No further action has been deemed necessary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[The screaming again stops, but the burning is still difficult to discern due to the loud sound of CHESED sobbing in distress.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> <em>Kraken</em>—</p>
<p><strong>KRAKEN:</strong> <em>Get her out of here</em>—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[The fourth voice is heard gasping for breath. The gasps turn into wails, which waver in pitch, repeatedly threatening to tear the throat apart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Come here—</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> (sobbing) NO! I'M SORRY, MOMMY, PLEASE—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[A grunt of exertion, presumed to be the sound of Sun picking up CHESED. The latter howls in distress.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Uneven footsteps, moving away from Kraken.]</em></p>
<p><strong>KRAKEN:</strong> Oh, fuck, she's on fire. I-It's just like— It's the same as what happened to—</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Kraken is cut off as the fourth voice resumes screaming.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[The crackling of fire grows loud enough to rival it, even as the microphone moves further away.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[All previous audio is abruptly muffled as a door slams in close proximity to the microphone.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Sun can be heard breathing heavily. CHESED sniffles and draws in a shaky breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> It's time to go.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> No. Please. Just be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> (crying again) You're mad.</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> You're mad at me!</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> No, I— …I, I'm—</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> It's my fault mommy is upset. It's not <em>your</em> fault—</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> And if it was?</p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> But—</p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You don't know what you're talking about!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[A short silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You really think your mother would have wound up here, no matter what? If it weren't for me, your mother wouldn't have needed all those stitches. In all that time she spent talking to you, did she ever tell you what she wanted? Wanted to have you? Or wanted to die?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Long silence. On the other side of the door, the burning has ceased. Kraken can be heard crying.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> We're leaving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Audio cuts out as the device loses signal.]</em></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Following inquiry, SCP-9220-A-607-B was found to be safely contained in her cell at Site-22. It is unknown when or how the above incident took place. Kraken has not been seen at Site-22 since her reassignment, and further investigation into her current position is classified Clearance Level 5. Researcher Sun is under remote observation for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9220.4:</strong> Incident 9220-01</p>
<p>Concurrent with the events of Audio Transcript 9220.2, nearly all instances of SCP-9220-A in containment sat up on their observation tables and opened their eyes. All instances began vocalizing in a manner similar to what was recorded in Audio Transcript 9220.2. Within 1 to 2 minutes of this occurrence, the majority of instances spontaneously immolated, crumbling into charcoal-like pieces on contact. A small portion of instances did not self-immolate.</p>
<p>Analysis after the incident determined that all instances which displayed the above behaviors were at 21 years of age or older. Younger instances have remained immobile, with their eyes closed. The similarities between Incident 9220-01 and SCP-9220-A-522, "BIRKAT" are under investigation.</p>
<p>The following modifications have been made to SCP-9220's containment procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instances must be strapped to the observation table</li>
<li>Instances must be moved to standard containment upon reaching 21, now referred to as the Terminal Age</li>
<li>Instances already at the Terminal Age must be monitored daily</li>
</ul>
<p>Most instances will self-terminate via immolation shortly after displaying the above behaviors. If an instance is capable of communicating, it is to be offered situational employment with the Foundation, in most cases as voluntary test subjects or interview subjects. Modality tests performed by the Department of Massage Therapy have had limited success in restoring mobility to specific instances. Such cases may be offered more complex assignments, on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Any instance which declines employment, but does not self-terminate, is to be incinerated promptly.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9220.5:</strong> On 11/02/2039, SCP-9220-A-607-B, "CHESED," passed away unexpectedly. At 0200 hours the previous night, the subject began asphyxiating from a sudden collapse of the left lung. The subject was attached to a CPAP machine and had resumed healthy breathing by 0400 hours, but the left lung remained collapsed without machine assistance. An emergency surgery was planned to replace the organ, but while the surgery room was being prepared, the subject's condition suddenly worsened. CHESED was declared dead at 0700 hours. She was eight years old.</p>
<p>The following transcript is a record of CHESED's final conversation with Researcher Sun.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="blbf-main">
<div class="blbf-interviewfinal blbf-interviews">
<p><em>[Sun is inspecting the CPAP monitor at CHESED's bedside. CHESED makes weak motions to remove the breathing mask. Sun notices and puts a hand over the mask.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> No. Keep it on.</p>
<p><em>[CHESED lowers her arms. Approx. two minutes of inactivity before CHESED tries again. Sun again puts her hand over the mask.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> You need this. Don't you understand?</p>
<p><em>[Maintaining eye contact, CHESED again makes weak motions to remove the mask.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Fine. Listen to me. You will take a big breath, say what you want to say, and then I'm putting it back on. Nod if you understand.</p>
<p><em>[CHESED nods.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Okay. Ready? Take a breath.</p>
<p><em>[After CHESED visibly inhales, Sun removes the mask. She holds it up with her hand resting on CHESED's forehead.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I want to die.</p>
<p><em>[Sun looks severely at CHESED. She puts the mask back on and resumes inspecting the CPAP machine.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Minutes pass. Moving slowly, CHESED successfully pushes the mask off of her mouth without Sun noticing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I'm not supposed to be alive.</p>
<p><em>[Sun immediately puts the mask back into place. She stands up and looks down at CHESED.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Never say that again.</p>
<p><em>[After a moment, Sun turns away, but is stopped by CHESED's hand gripping her lab coat.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I shouldn't have said the things I said to you that night. This is my fault. Whenever I looked at your mother, all I could see was myself. Alright? It's my burden. Let go of me, please. I'm here because you <em>should</em> live.</p>
<p><em>[CHESED shakes her head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> What? What do you want?</p>
<p><em>[Silence. After a moment, CHESED releases Sun's lab coat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>[Several minutes pass. With less difficulty than before, CHESED again pushes up the breathing mask.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHESED:</strong> I thought about it. I know why my mom did that.</p>
<p><em>[Sun puts the mask back on. She stops with her hand cupping CHESED's face. They stare at each other. A long silence.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sun kneels by the bed, her hand still over CHESED's mask.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Take a deep breath, and I'll lift the mask. Okay? Ready?</p>
<p><em>[CHESED inhales, and Sun removes the mask. With an effort, CHESED rises to her elbow and leans forward. Sun obliges her and tilts her head so that CHESED can whisper in her ear.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sun swiftly puts the mask back on. Tears are visible in her eyes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> I want to… I <em>need</em>… <em>(Pause)</em> I don't understand. What was it all for? All of this was for you, but now… Your mother, she… I… It needs to have been for something. It <em>must</em> have been for something.</p>
<p><em>[Sun paces out of view of the camera. She returns looking visibly more distressed. She pulls a stool to the side of the bed, sits, and props CHESED up with one arm so she can hold her. She puts her head face-down on the side of the pillow. There is a long silence.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sun lifts her head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SUN:</strong> Maybe this. Maybe it's just for this.</p>
<p><em>[Sun puts her head down again.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hours pass.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Just as the sun begins to rise, CHESED's right lung gives out.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Warning lights from the CPAP reflect on the bedspread. The light advances across the floor.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Her eyes are closed.]</em></p>
