            <h1>SCP-6791</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> 6791</p>
<p><strong>Containment Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keter</span> Pending</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The current subject of SCP-6791 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. A Scranton reality anchor is to be active adjacent to SCP-6791's containment chamber, as well as Dr. Hollë Berg's specialized receiver.</p>
<p>If SCP-6791 moves to a new subject, Foundation agents are to continuously sweep nearby populated areas for abnormal Hume levels. Once the new host of SCP-6791 is located, personnel within the nearest Foundation facility are to make preparations to ensure that no incidents take place while SCP-6791 is being escorted to the premises. When preparations are complete, agents are authorized to act. Individuals who arrive as a result of SCP-6791 are to be kept until they are confirmed to no longer be under SCP-6791's influence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6791 is a non-corporeal and parasitic entity. SCP-6791 pairs itself with individuals for various lengths of time, primarily within the cranial area of the current host (known hereafter as Subject-6791).</p>
<p>SCP-6791's foremost effect is slightly lowering the Hume levels within and around Subject-6791. While reality cannot be significantly altered within these conditions, SCP-6791 is capable of making incremental alterations to the neurology of both Subject-6791 and nearby individuals Subject-6791 is aware of. This manifests as behavioral changes within all subjects involved. These changes can become evident almost immediately, but will take an increasingly longer time to wear off in proportion to how long a subject is exposed.</p>
<p>While it is not Subject-6791 who is consciously manipulating reality, the behavioral changes to other individuals often reflect the desires or beliefs of Subject-6791. However, Subject-6791 is also the most affected by SCP-6791, with extreme cases leaving evidence of trace neurological degradation. The results are primarily a loss of interest, personality, and empathy. If exposed for long enough, alterations to Subject-6791's neurology can be permanent.</p>
<p>SCP-6791 appears instinctive rather than intelligent. While SCP-6791 is assumed to be capable of understanding spoken language, it does not respond to any attempts at communication. SCP-6791, given time, will always begin searching for a new host; however, testing has revealed that SCP-6791 often leaves the current host quicker if they are in Foundation custody. It is yet unknown if this is required for SCP-6791's survival, or what resource SCP-6791 gains from its hosts. Under Foundation surveillance, SCP-6791 has had 53 known hosts.</p>
<p>Dr. Berg's recording device is able to pick up micro-fluctuations stemming from SCP-6791, which have consistently been translated into comprehensible messages. These often take the form of descriptions of daily events. However, given how difficult it can be to communicate with Subject-6791, it is unclear if this inner monologue is that of SCP-6791 or of Subject-6791.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12:</strong> 53 isn't even an interesting number.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13:</strong> The door to my cell was hanging open. I left, wandering through the halls to see if I could find anyone. I'd thought they had been unpopulated before; now I couldn't find a single person. Not at the desk. Not in the lounges. Nobody in the other cells (though they were all in different shapes and sizes, and held all kinds of shocking objects). Not even the security cameras appeared to be watching me, though I guess I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>As I walked, wallpaper appeared on the wall. It was ugly, striped a muddy green and yellow. I saw a few photos framed on the walls, of skies and starry nights. I wondered when the people here had finally decided to decorate.</p>
<p>Finally, I came to a room outside of which sat a massive pile of assorted things. Magazines. Photo albums of people I didn't know. Small train tracks. A box of matches. I would've walked around it if I hadn't heard movement from inside. Squeezing past and peeking through, I could see someone pacing back and forth on the opposite end of a table with a chair. The room was otherwise empty, though two of the walls had gaping holes that opened up to flat cement faces. I entered.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Jack Jones</p>
<p>Interviewer: <strong>SCP-6791</strong></p>
<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>And I entered, but no one was there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Hello? Can you hear me?</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>That is when it truly set in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I need you to listen. Please.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>It was only me. I am alone forever. An individual only has themselves at the end of the day. I think, therefore I am, therefore no one else is.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I don't, I just…</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>Perhaps it is for the best, to be wandering these corridors forever, finally alone with this constant state of wondering, of claustrophobia.</strong></p>
<p><em>Jack is silent, collapsing into the chair at the table.</em></p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>This is for the best. What have I to learn from others? What have I to learn from myself?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I wish I knew who you were. I wish I knew who I was.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>All one can know is what they don't know.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I treated Dennis and Mary differently than I treated Hollë. I feel like two different people in front of them. Which one am I? Are Dennis and Mary different people when they're away from me? Are they happier?</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>And what they don't know, what I don't know, must be accepted, and pretending to know is a crime everyone is guilty of…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> …You know all of a sudden I've realized that Hollë was right. I'd never spoken to Mary. I wanted to date her, but I know nothing about her. I think someone told me I should start searching for a girlfriend, so I picked her. That was it.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>… And yet…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> And Dennis might've been new to school, but he really was hilarious. He made a lot of friends quick. After the first month many people just laughed instinctively after he spoke. I laughed too, but I was always at a distance.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>A brief time ago I was confronted with the question of keeping a protagonist interesting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> The school janitor. I don't know why I remember him, but I do. I liked watching him mop. He obviously didn't enjoy it though.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>I've never read a book. I've interest in what's real, not what's fictional. And yet, this question I wondered out loud. I shouted it through the corridors, but my passion only echoed back at me. Why did this catch my attention?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Train conductors. Construction workers at the intersection down the road. They're only out at night. Joggers. That one art teacher who's always at the workshop. Random people through the windows of their cars.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>I've tried so many rooms. I've torn down walls, cleared out junk, tried connecting as many quarters in these endlessly confusing halls as possible. I spend all hours trying to create the one truly universal room. No hallways, no doorways, none of these pointless trivialities or artifacts. One floor, four walls, one ceiling. And to add to the difficulty, these barriers suddenly start appearing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Not my parents, though. All these memories coming back, and I can't remember them. "Permanent," I think is what the document said. "Behavioral changes." Maybe at that time I'd wanted to forget them. And so they forgot me. And we spent so much time in the same house, yet in completely different rooms, that we can no longer go back. Or maybe it's only me.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>But then, for the first time, I hear someone screaming from the other side. Screaming Bloody Mary about the outdoors and TV screens. And just like that, it stopped. And even though I've been alone for all of my existence, for the first time ever, I feel lonely.</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-6791 places a hand on the cement face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> That damn humming.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>That damn humming.</strong></p>
<p><em>Jack sobs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Is this my fault?</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>I think I've made a grave mistake.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I can't say I didn't want any of this. Because at some point I did.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>For all I've torn down and burned, I've found no answers, come no closer, haven't even found a clear direction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I let it in. It didn't have to go this far, but I let it.</p>
<p>SCP-6791: <strong>For all the walls that divide, there are a thousand small things that can allow two separate rooms to connect.</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-6791 approaches the pile at the door and picks up a miniature train track with one hand and the box of matches in the other.</em></p>
<p><em>Jack stands up.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-6791 considers throwing the matches down the hall as far as they can. But, knowing that they won't go far, SCP-6791 does the practical thing and swallows the entire box.</em></p>
<p><em>Jack approaches the door to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-6791 turns around.</em></p>
<p><em>Jack stops directly in front of SCP-6791, noticing again their presence.</em></p>
<p><em>The two of them are chest to chest, and for the first time they are looking each other in the eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>It would be nice for Jack to awake within his chamber, or for Berg to enter and provide an analysis of events, so that Jack could be reminded that fortunately everything in the real world makes more sense than this.</em></p>
