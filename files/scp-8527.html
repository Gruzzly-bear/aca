Image of SCP-8527 area in taiga forest</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8527<br/>
<strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
Any personnel authorized to enter SCP 8527 must wear asbestos-extraction protective equipment provided by the Foundation. Failure to comply with protective gear requirements will result in the individual being forcibly escorted out of SCP 8527 by security forces.</p>
<p>Any equipment or research material that has been used during experimentation must undergo Level-4 decontamination after research. Items that cannot be decontaminated are to be incinerated on site.</p>
<p>All personnel exposed to SCP 8527-1 dust are to be transferred to a dedicated isolation ward and subjected to humane termination protocols, which include the issuance of a vial of fast-acting poison to alleviate suffering during terminal stages. Corpses of personnel exposed to SCP 8527-1 are to be cremated without exception.</p>
<p>All research regarding SCP 8527 is to be carried out exclusively within the SCP 8527 area. The perimeter of SCP 8527 is to be patrolled at all times by armed security teams to prevent any unauthorized access. Patrols are conducted in 8-hour shifts, with a minimum of 6 security personnel per shift. Security personnel are authorized to fire warning shots upon detecting civilian intrusion; intruders are to be expelled under the cover story of trespassing into a restricted area under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Extraction of SCP 8527-1 may only be conducted with the approval of at least 2 members of the O5 Council. Any unauthorized removal of SCP 8527-1 samples will result in demotion by two ranks, and all access privileges to SCP 8527 will be permanently revoked.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP 8527 is a large open-pit asbestos mine, covering an estimated surface area of approximately 9 km². SCP 8527 is located within a taiga forest on the outskirts of ██████, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russian Federation. To prevent discovery by civilians, all satellite imagery and public cartographic records of SCP-8577 have been altered. The entire mining area has been replaced with forest terrain consistent with the surrounding biome. On official documentation, the area of SCP 8527 is listed as federal property under the jurisdiction of the Russian government.</p>
<p>Archived records indicate that SCP 8527 began asbestos mining operations on 27/07/19██. The Foundation later employed coercive measures that resulted in the mine's closure on 28/09/20██. Foundation analysis estimates that approximately 720,000–760,000 metric tons of SCP 8527-1 were distributed into global markets before containment. Recovery of SCP 8527-1 currently in circulation remains logistically unfeasible, as all exported SCP 8527-1 was consolidated and redistributed through centralized Soviet-era storage facilities prior to sale. The Foundation estimates that approximately 2.4 billion metric tons of SCP 8527-1 remain unextracted within SCP 8527.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>SCP 8527-1 is a type of white asbestos extracted from SCP 8527. In terms of crystal structure, coloration, and chemical composition under spectrographic analysis, SCP 8527-1 is indistinguishable from ordinary white asbestos. SCP 8527-1 only exhibits anomalous properties when dust generated from it enters a biological body via inhalation or open wounds.</p>
<p>When SCP 8527-1 enters the human body, instead of causing pulmonary fibrosis as with ordinary asbestos, its microfibers are absorbed by the body. Once absorbed, SCP 8527-1 microfibers infiltrate bone tissue and begin stimulating abnormal osteogenesis, causing the infected individual's bones to gradually produce irregular bony spines. These spines initially measure approximately 2–4 cm in length, causing localized pain where they pierce through muscular tissue. Over time, the spines continue to grow, and within two months from their initial appearance they may reach lengths of 15–30 cm, penetrating soft tissue and the epidermis. In some cases, spines emerging from the ribs may grow inward, puncturing internal organs and causing internal hemorrhaging and severe pain.</p>
<p>From the bones of individuals infected with SCP-8577-1, microscopic nodules ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mm in size are produced and located under the skin. These nodules pose little direct harm under normal conditions; however, if exposed to prolonged, continuous sunlight, their outer shells will gradually dry out and become brittle. Even minor movements of the body at this stage can cause the shells to rupture, releasing a mutated malignant cell capable of rapid multiplication, ranging in size from 0.5 mm to 2 cm. Rather than growing outward like normal tumors, these tumors invade adjacent muscle tissue, drawing nutrients directly from surrounding structures. Mature tumors can grow up to 30 cm in length, making detection through routine clinical examination difficult until the late stages. The absorption of nutrients from malignant tumors causes severe pain, described as feeling as if someone is eating the body directly; the larger the malignant tumor, the more severe the pain.</p>

<strong>Addendum 8527-1:</strong> Initial Outbreak Reports
<p>On 19/06/19██, the Foundation received an anomalous report in Shanxi, China, regarding an individual named Li Shao, 86 years old, living alone in a poor rural village. Local medical records documented the growth of sharp protrusions from his bones, with no identifiable cause. Upon receiving this information, the Foundation dispatched a rapid response team to the site, administering Class-B amnestics to all villagers and medical personnel who had knowledge of Mr. Li’s condition. Mr. Li was classified as an anomalous entity and provisionally designated SCP-8527.</p>
<p>Approximately one month after containment, the subject’s bone spikes extended further and punctured the thoracic cavity, causing internal hemorrhage and death.</p>
<p>The Foundation conducted an investigation into his family and discovered that Li Meng, Mr. Li’s eldest son, had also developed the condition. SCP-8527 was then provisionally categorized as a hereditary anomaly within the Li family. However, this hypothesis was quickly dismissed, as no other relatives exhibited symptoms.</p>
<p>After three months in Foundation custody, Li Meng also expired due to uncontrolled bone growth.</p>
<p>The situation escalated when numerous similar medical reports began to surface from multiple countries, including India, and various states within Eastern Bloc nations, documenting identical bone-spike growth followed by death.</p>
<p>Although cases differed in age of onset and disease progression, all fatalities shared the same pattern: abnormal osseous growths leading to death within 2–3 months.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis of lifestyle and patient history revealed a unifying factor: all infected individuals had prior exposure to white asbestos.</p>
<p>Attempts to trace the asbestos back to its source encountered obstacles, as all shipments had historically been routed through a central Soviet distribution hub. This delayed identification of the original mine by approximately ██ years, until the Foundation confirmed the anomaly originated from a large asbestos mine in Sverdlovsk Oblast, later designated SCP 8527.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8527-2: Incident Report — 21/09/20██</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recording of a conversation prior to Incident 8527-2.</strong><br/>
<strong>Participants:</strong><br/>
- Guard (G)<br/>
- Research Intern (RI)</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Short exchange between on-site security personnel and a newly assigned research intern, taking place immediately before the incident at SCP 8527 on 21/09/20██.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> You're the new research intern, right?</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> Yes. Here are my identification papers.</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> You look pretty young. Just turned eighteen?</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> That's right.</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> To be honest — this place has already been thoroughly studied long ago. Now it's mostly just where rookies like you get used to procedures. … Here, put on this asbestos protective suit.</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> Yes, thank you. Uh… may I ask, how long have you worked for the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> Maybe two or three years. The job’s fine, the pay’s decent. Just enough to send back to my family.</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> I see… but this suit feels too loose, can I request another one?</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> You're tall but way too skinny. Don’t you eat enough?</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> I eat just fine… it's just my weak constitution.</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> Hmph… eat more and it'll get better—</p>
<p>*(Sound of wind tearing violently as something rushes overhead.)*</p>
<p><strong>RI:</strong> Ah—! What’s that noise?!</p>
<p>*(High-pitched screeching grows louder, painfully piercing.)*</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> What?! How did it get out?!</p>
<p>*(Shrill whistling followed by a massive detonation.)*</p>

<p><strong>Incident Summary:</strong></p>
<p>On 21/09/20██, a fighter aircraft belonging to the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) was reported to have experienced a technical malfunction during an aerial engagement and subsequently crashed into the SCP 8527 site. The impact resulted in an explosion equivalent to 2,300 tons of TNT, completely destroying the SCP-8577 mine and releasing a massive quantity of SCP 8527-1 dust into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The dispersal radius of SCP 8527-1 dust was measured at approximately 3.5 km from the epicenter of the detonation. This dust cloud is now designated as SCP 8527, replacing the original mine site as the anomaly’s locus. Within the central zone of the newly designated SCP 8527, it is estimated that roughly 260 kg of SCP 8527-1 remains intact.</p>
<p>Foundation projections indicate that SCP 8527 will require over 50 years to fully dissipate and settle to the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Start message</strong></p>
<p>"Look, O5-2 — you know I only trusted you with this project because I believed you were the right man to lead it. Look at what you've done! You allowed specimen █ to breach containment and trigger continuous detonations, destroying a large amount of infrastructure, and it was ultimately taken down by GOC anti-air defenses. Ha… look at what you've caused — specimen █ destroyed significant assets belonging to other noteworthy factions and was shot down by the GOC; its remains are now in GOC custody.</p>
<p>Now make sure every official report blames the GOC, citing that they now possess the specimen █. Put it that way so those other powers keep their grudge against the GOC, not us. That's all you need to change — the rest I took care of: all civilians who witnessed the incident have been administered amnestics to erase any memory of it. Do that, and carry on."</p>
