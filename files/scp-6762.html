<p><span class="st"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:</span></span> <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span> is a brown "EKIA" brand cardboard box with a smiling face crudely painted on one side in yellow. Additional instances of similar makeup and appearance frequently manifest as satellites to the primary anomaly, dematerializing once their existence is no longer required by <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span>. These instances are collectively designated <span class="st"><strong>SCP-6762-1</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span> exerts a moderate compulsive effect with a variable radius. Affected personnel will attribute personhood to the object, believing it to be a human being named 'Dave' who urgently requires their aid. <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span>'s goals vary with each exercise of compulsion, but always result in the affected individual travelling across multiple sectors of Area-12 and frequently acquiring one or more <span class="st"><strong>SCP-6762-1</strong></span> instances. Once their task is complete, the affected individual will voluntarily release <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span> and all associated instances and express satisfaction with their accomplishment. They will express persistent confusion when confronted with the reality of the situation; the duration of this confusion is conclusively linked with the subject's Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV).</p>
<p>While no purpose to <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span>'s activities has been discerned, each case of compulsion has resulted in positive outcomes for the affected individuals as assessed by the Area-12 chief psychologist. A quorum of Area-12's senior staff have deemed the object a sufficiently low threat to continue the present, admittedly ineffective, containment measures for the forseeable future, and potential reclassification to <span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THAUMIEL-CLASS</span></span></strong></span> is presently under consideration. In opposition is Assistant Facility Researcher Dr. Quentin T. Toth, who submitted a decommissioning request following her own interaction with the object. This request has been denied.</p>
<p><span class="st"><strong><span style="color: #0087bd">SCP-6762</span></strong></span>'s sapience beyond compulsion events has not been conclusively proven. As the item appeared spontaneously at Area-12 in 2019, its effect (if any) on individuals not employed by the Foundation is unknown.</p>

<p>"Think of your child, then, not as dead, but as living; not as a flower that has withered, but as one that is transplanted, and touched by a Divine hand, is blooming in richer colors and sweeter shades than those of earth." is a quotation from Richard Hooker in <em>Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers,</em> 1895 in the public domain.</p>
