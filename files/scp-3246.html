<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Do not go outside at night.</p>
<p>Previous efforts by the Department of Miscommunications have set a precedent for worldwide dissemination campaigns. Such precedent is to be referenced for all materials fabricated herein.</p>
<p>Personnel have been issued military-grade 600-Fluoren flashlights in the case of a power outage or SCP-3246 outbreak. To limit this possibility, backup generators in all containment sites are regularly monitored. Floodlights must be kept on in major population areas at all times. Over the next few weeks, Foundation teams will work to evacuate all residences within 25 miles of any forest or ocean.</p>
<p>Do not linger in shadows.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3246 is an extant component of ordinary darkness. While much of the makeup of darkness is derived from an absence of light, the portion that is SCP-3246 would be more accurately described as "negative light".</p>
<p>As its brightness decreases, non-anomalous darkness asymptotically approaches 0.001890 kiloFluorens per meter squared (kF/m<sup>2</sup>), the approximate brightness of "Pitch Black". However, darkness with a high enough concentration of SCP-3246 can extend far below this, rendering the current light scale obsolete.</p>
<p>As of writing this document, approximately 36% of the darkness on Earth is SCP-3246.</p>

<p>A potential link was found between SCP-3246 and the now defunct SCP-█████, and later confirmed. A selection of its archived description can be found below.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:100%;"><img alt="darktent.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3246/darktent.png" style="width:100%;"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption" style="width:100%;">
<p>Exterior of cavern, formerly SCP-█████. Photographs of the interior cannot be attained due to the cavern's unusually high concentration of SCP-3246.</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-█████ is a basalt cavern located within an inactive volcano off the coast of ██████. It is only accessible through a network of underwater lava tubes formed ~400 years prior to its discovery by a civilian tunneling group on August 2nd, ████. The Foundation quickly took control of the site and neutralized all those involved<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The interior of SCP-█████ is entirely pitch black, even when lit. The inner cavern absorbs all light particles, rendering ordinary imaging technology unusable. While inside the chamber, the intense darkness causes a minor illusion that ones' surroundings are two-dimensional; this illusion persists into other senses, rendering it silent to those inside of it, but not those standing just outside of the entrance.</p>
<p>Preliminary tests of Terrestrial Sonography Scanning (TSS) technology were able to produce scans of a large portion of the interior, though it is unknown at this time how far the cavern extends. Along with the expected basalt formations, portions of the cave contain the fossilized remains of a massive creature, as well as etchings in the cavern wall written in ancient Sumerian. A translation can be found below.</p>

<p><em>Hester continues knocking loudly.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> ███ ████ ████ police department! Is anyone inside?</p>
<p><em>Hester waits, then grabs his radio.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> Could I get another unit on ██ ███████ Avenue, welfare check on a family of four. Mom didn't show up for work this morning. Kids ain't at school, neither. Nobody's answerin' the door.</p>
<p><em>Another unit responds, audio unintelligible in recording.</em></p>
<p><em>Hester proceeds down the hallway and puts his ear against the wall. An arrhythmic thumping noise can be heard inside.</em></p>
<p><em>Hester walks back to the front door.</em></p>
<p><em>Hester's radio comes on and another officer begins speaking.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> Wait, slow down.</p>
<p><em>As the officer relays a string of numbers, Hester takes out his cellular phone and inputs them into his phone. A faint ringtone can be heard from inside the apartment.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> ███ ████ ████ police department! Open the door or I will force entry!</p>
<p><em>After a brief pause, Hester takes out a bolt knife and wedges it into the doorframe. He slides it upwards, forcing the latch out of the way.</em></p>
<p><em>The door slowly creaks open on its own. It is pitch black inside the apartment.</em></p>
<p><em>As the door continues to open, the hallway Hester is standing in grows rapidly darker until nothing is visible on camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> What the hell…</p>
<p><em>Hester shines a flashlight into the apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>The thumping noise gets more intense, then stops entirely.</em></p>
<p><em>Hester stands motionless for twenty seconds. The sound of heavy breathing overwhelms the audio. Finally, he continues inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> ███ ████ ████ police department, is anyone home?</p>
<p><em>Hester's voice falters. Another thump comes from somewhere to the left, then silence.</em></p>
<p><em>Hester turns left and walks towards the noise.

<p><strong>P.O. Hester:</strong> ███ ████ ████ police.</p>
