</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2934</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2934 and associated components are to be held within a standard body bag modified to include three interior layers of aluminium foil. The modified body bag containing SCP-2934 is to be placed within a steel chest measuring at least 2 m x 1 m in footprint, 1 m in height and 10 cm in wall thickness.</p>
<p>All surfaces of the containment chamber are to be completely coated with a layer of steel 25 cm thick. The containment chamber is to be large enough to accommodate sleeping arrangements for ten test subjects.</p>
<p>Outside of testing, the modified bottom hoop of the SCP-2934-1 dreamcatcher is to remain unhooked from the top hoop and stored separately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2934 is the preserved remains of an unidentified woman approximately eighteen years old at the time of death. SCP-2934 has Caucasian skin tone, a clean-shaven scalp, and would have measured 160 – 163 cm in height before physical modification.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<ul>
<li>SCP-2934’s feet and hands have been crudely excised at the ankles and wrists. Wound margins are ragged with extensive bruising and limited granulation tissue, indicating that this action was performed with a blunt hacking instrument several days before death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A dreamcatcher, designated SCP-2934-1, is fixed to SCP-2934’s face with surgical staples. The dreamcatcher<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> is composed of a wooden hoop 5 cm in diameter that hangs below a second wooden hoop 16 cm in diameter. The top hoop is stapled between SCP-2934's eyebrows, and almost entirely covers the face. Both hoops are decorated with dangling black strings, white beads, and white down feathers from an unknown bird species. The centre of the top hoop is filled with a webbing design made with black thread. The centre of the bottom hoop does not feature the expected webbing design: instead, the space is occupied by a white two-piece LEGO sculpture<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> resembling a satellite dish antenna, tied to the hoop with black thread.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>56 cm of a grey USB cable emerges from a 2 cm-long, well-healed incision at the centre of SCP-2934’s forehead. The exposed part of the cable ends in a Type A connector plugged into a Raspberry Pi Model 1 A. Twelve red wires 15 cm in length run from the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to a free-standing LCD plate which, despite lacking an obvious power source, is constantly powered and displays the message “22 04 2011 LIFE 0 TRANSMIT READY”. In X-ray images, the part of the USB cable concealed in SCP-2934’s head appears to pass through the frontal bone and trace the mesocortical pathway of the brain, terminating in an unattached mini-USB plug. The assembly of LCD plate, Raspberry Pi and USB cable is collectively designated SCP-2934-2.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The inside of SCP-2934’s mouth held four objects at the time of discovery: three small, roughly torn scraps of yellow paper with the words “KOMPETENCË”, "BESIM" and “AUTORITET”<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> individually handwritten with pencil on each piece, and a folded, low-resolution image of a middle-aged man's face printed onto white A4 paper. The man pictured is presumed to be Ndrec Gega. (See below.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-2934 has been anomalously preserved by an unknown method. No chemicals commonly used for tissue preservation have been observed in sample analysis. Aside from skin pallor, SCP-2934 displays no signs of having been dead for an extended period of time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-2934 produces an anomalous effect, designated SCP-2934-A, that acts on all individuals within a radius of 0.7 kilometres. Humans entering any stage of sleep within the area of effect will invariably experience one or more vivid dreams centred around a specific male character.</p>
<p>Upon waking, affected individuals will always attribute the name “Ndrec Gega” to this character, and their description of its appearance will match the following details: approximately fifty years old; 180 – 200 cm tall; a receded hairline; grey-white hair; thick, dark eyebrows; a broad face and physique; a broad, high nose; Caucasian, with a relatively tanned, flushed skin tone; and wearing some form of suit and tie. When shown the printed image found in SCP-2934’s mouth, all affected individuals will agree that the man depicted is the Ndrec Gega character from their dreams.</p>
<p>The narrative of their dreams will always feature the Ndrec Gega character acting as a capable authority figure who establishes a close personal connection to the dreaming individual. Examples of these dreams are given below.</p>

While Agent Burton is walking through his childhood primary school, Ndrec Gega, the new headmaster, offers him a job as his personal assistant. Agent Burton works for Ndrec Gega from a desk in his third-year classroom, and feels great satisfaction in fielding his calls and organising his schedule. Ndrec Gega asks Agent Burton for advice on his haircut three times, which makes Agent Burton feel trusted.</td>

Ndrec Gega is the ship's captain, and leaves D-163758 in charge of steering on three occasions. He tells D-163758 that he is very happy with her steering when he returns. The ship hits a European robin and almost crashes, but Ndrec Gega manages to prevent this through great skill and effort. When they land in Paris, Ndrec Gega is awarded an Oscar trophy. He removes the trophy’s head and gives it to D-163758 as a gift.</td>

Ndrec Gega finds that the productivity of the factory’s machines is trebled if he sings <em>Happy Birthday</em> to them. He is interviewed live on national television about this discovery, and tells the interviewer and television audience that he could not have done it without D-767449’s help. D-767449 is elected President of the United States as a result.</td>

<p>Individuals experiencing SCP-2934-A for the first time will report genuine "gut feelings" of warmth and trust for the dream character when waking, which appear to persist indefinitely. If asked how they would feel if a real-world "Ndrec Gega" were placed in a position of authority over them, such as their workplace manager or political representative, subjects uniformly respond in a highly positive manner.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If SCP-2934-A dreams are experienced multiple times, however, affected individuals will quickly feel confused and uneasy about the character’s continual reappearance. Almost all subjects who experience the dreams more than five times will report a level of fear and annoyance. Long-term exposure occasionally results in such an extreme negative response that some subjects have refused to sleep for extended periods to avoid seeing the entity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Although no electromagnetic transmissions have been detected from SCP-2934 or any of its components, containing the anomaly using standard radio frequency shielding techniques appears to prevent the SCP-2934-A dream effect from acting on individuals in range. Additionally, removing the modified bottom hoop of the dreamcatcher containing the LEGO satellite dish sculpture appears to prevent SCP-2934-A entirely. Investigation into SCP-2934's effects by members of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#omicron-rho" target="_blank">MTF Omicron Rho</a> is pending.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> A real-world individual named Ndrec Gega matching the appearance of the SCP-2934 dream character and printed image has been found. Ndrec Gega was the Democratic Party for Albania’s candidate for the 2011-05-08 mayoral election of Dorëz, a town of 9,000 people in the Arrëz e Madhe municipality of northern Albania.</p>
<p>Locals interviewed report a period of twelve days, lasting from the night of 2011-04-25 to the night of 2011-05-06, in which almost all the population of the Dorëz urban area experienced sleep characteristic of SCP-2934-A. Ndrec Gega lost the mayoral election three days later by a historically large margin, largely due to widespread distress about his repeated appearance in most of the electorate’s dreams.</p>
<p>The real-world Ndrec Gega suffered a fatal car accident on the A1 motorway the day after the election, 2011-05-09. His car was observed to drive erratically at 180km/h before veering off the side of the road and colliding with a tree. Notably, the coroner’s report remarks that both hands and both feet were traumatically amputated in the collision.</p>
