            <h1>SCP-1991</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1991</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1991 is to be stored in a 5x5x5 meter containment chamber within Site 19's biological specimens wing. Due to the specimen's behavior, a locked door is considered to be all that is required to prevent escape. SCP-1991 is to be fed three kilograms (3 kg) of cooked and pulped beef daily. Water is to be provided via a trough which is to be kept refilled constantly. Containment cell is to be cleaned weekly by Class-D personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1991 is a two (2) meter-long quadruped mammalian creature of unknown species, enhanced by the implantation of cybernetic compounds. Both implanted compounds and creature show signs of damage consistent with extreme age, poorly-healed puncture wounds, bullets of assorted calibers embedded underneath the skin, burns comparable to those produced by industrial cutting lasers, and starvation. SCP-1991 appears to have suffered psychological damage as a result of physical abuse or trauma, displaying extreme fear of loud noises, rapid movements, and aggression or seeming aggression by personnel.</p>
<p>SCP-1991's body core is roughly humanoid, with elongated limbs of equal length. All limbs end in "hands" similar to those of a large primate, apart from the presence of elongated claws. The head resembles a mummified canine skull with elongated incisor teeth. Skin resembles decayed leather with matted fur growing from it, primarily around the ankles and back of the neck. SCP-1991 lacks a tail. When recovered, SCP-1991 displayed traits of starvation, including enlarged gut and emaciated limbs. Proper feeding while in containment has been shown to cure said traits.</p>
<p>Cybernetics consist of a mechanical "collar", implantation of unidentified structure into right forelimb, sharpened steel blades replacing teeth and claws of forelimbs as well as [DATA EXPUNGED] system alterations of unknown usage. "Collar" consists of a metal disc embedded in the front of the neck, possessing a small speaker array (nonfunctional due to bullet damage), six (6) video cameras, two (2) of which have broken lenses, and a complex network of [DATA EXPUNGED] fibers apparently serving as linkage/control to its central nervous system (nonfunctional due to ██████). Due to the nonfunctional nature of linkage between its nervous system and the camera network on the "shield", SCP-1991 appears to be blind. The "right forelimb structure" consists of a pair of miniature mechanical clamps and an extending, rotary metal rod similar to the triggering equipment of remotely-operated firearms. It is assumed that the clamps were intended to serve as the mounting system for such a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Behavioral Test Log 1991 - 1</strong><br/>
Tests of SCP-1991 behavior in regards to positive stimuli.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. ████████<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> Dr. ████████ saying "hello" in a normal and calm voice.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 having huddled in the furthest corner of the containment chamber upon Dr. ████████'s entry emerged and hesitantly licked Dr. ████████'s outstretched hand.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. ████████<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> SCP-1991 "petted" on the top of the head by Dr. ████████.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 emitted gurgling noise assumed to be a sign of pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. ████████<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> SCP-1991 given common canine chew toy shaped like a teddy bear.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 prodded toy with forepaw, causing it to squeak. SCP-1991 proceeded to emit whimpering noise and huddle against the furthest wall of the containment chamber until chew toy was removed.</p>

<p><strong>Behavioral Test Log 1991 - 2</strong><br/>
Tests of SCP-1991 behavior in regards to negative stimuli.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Agent ███<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> Agent ███ saying "hello" in a raised and aggressive voice.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 proceeded to rapidly move to the furthest edge of the chamber from Agent ███ and attempted to curl into a ball.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Agent ███<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> Agent ███ clapping hands in front of SCP-1991.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 whimpered, and attempted to cover head with forepaws.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Agent ███<br/>
<strong>Stimulus:</strong> Gunshot from starter pistol into the air outside containment chamber.<br/>
<strong>Effect upon subject:</strong> SCP-1991 urinated on floor of containment chamber and huddled twitching on the opposite side of chamber from the door until ending of the test.</p>
