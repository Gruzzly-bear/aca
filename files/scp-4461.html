            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4461</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4461 is to be contained in a non-descript box near, but preferably not directly on, a Foundation site. This location is not to be listed in any Foundation records or disclosed to any Foundation employee except this object's HMCL<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The database version of this containment file is not to includ<span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">fffffffffffffffff</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">ok so, at some point a bunch of stuff got deleted, but I didn't do it, I promise</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">i am a janitor, i don't usually work with files. so i'm really sorry if this is in the wrong format or something, but I'm going to do my best. therer a lot of options on this screen and I am afraid of clicking the wrong one and messing everything up. so please stay with me, ok</span></p>
<p>The box is to be obviously marked as Foundation Property, with prominent instructions that if found, it should not be opened, but instead be delivered to the next person on Foundation Personnel List 8288-A (See <em>Addendum 1</em>). A physical copy of this containment file is to be printed on acid-free paper and the attached files downloaded onto non-volatile removable media. A copy is to be placed with SCP-4461 in the event the HMCL is unable to find a replacement before becoming incapacitated, or meets an unexpected death.</p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">test test, can i add stuff? <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/nash-pinkle-s-guide-to-the-foundation">Nash Pinkle</a> woz here</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">oh shit how do i delete tat</span></p>
<p>In the event that the HMCL discovers any other Foundation employee (up to and including O5 personnel) is attempting to investigate SCP-4461, they are to immediately initiate the containment protocol listed in <em>Addendum 3</em>.</p>

<p>SCP-4461 before containment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4461 is a round sphere of leather, 73mm in diameter, stitched from two pieces of fitting leather scraps secured into a spherical pouch with twine. testing confirms it is filled with sand of unknown origin. Attempts to open the object for further testing do not work. <span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">it looks kinda like an acient baseball.</span></p>
<p>SCP-4461 is an infohazard. When a person in a position of leadership becomes aware of SCP-4461, they immediately become an instance of SCP-4461-A. In a matter of time ranging from several weeks to several months, the organizational structure below SCP-4461-A suffers increased inefficiency, failure, and catastrophe that grows in severity.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of efficiency</li>
<li>Policy violations</li>
<li>Sickness</li>
<li>Increased turnover rate</li>
<li>Accidents</li>
<li>Sudden death</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the organizational structure reporting to SCP-4461-A will crumble. Further hierarchies under SCP-4461-A's command will also fail; notably, SCP-4461-A will not suffer these effects themselves (unless those above them in their organizational hierarchy are also affected).</p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">other things have been tried sometimes, but didn't work. but ya know, you can't really test it without people finding out, and then everything is fucked, rite</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">iffn im being honest i dont want to do this. so it was oh like two years or so ago I was workin janitor for site 52 outside manchester (COME ON U REDS), i get told 'pack yer shit up, Nash, yer goin to france.' so I get an address and a plane ticket, my flat gets sold overnight and i'm off to fuckkken france. i dont SPEAK FRENCH</span></p>
<p>This effect can only be stopped by SCP-4461-A's death. Uses of amnestics on affected subjects do not slow or inhibit the effects of SCP-4461.</p>
<p><span style="color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;">so i find out im the new trainee under this old guy. dean. wasn't much training. an i was SHIT at the job, right? thought I was gonna get fired, kept fuckin things up. and then one day he told me about this 4461. and told me i'd been promoted to HMCL. an i asked him what it meant and he gave me this usb sitck, told me to read the file. then he wished me good luck an was gone. never saw im again.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Manifest #349</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> I have placed the object in a box, with a letter detailing its effects, and placed both inside a larger box, and buried them near <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-letters-of-the-commission-on-unusual-cargo">our headquarters</a>, beneath three coconut trees on the due west side of the island.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo Description</strong></p>
<p>[Large section removed with ink]</p>
<p>I discovered the object when I met a privateer in Clew Bay. He was a destitute fellow, who in a drunken state told me of his woes; after raiding a merchant vessel and obtaining the object, he had a round of terrible luck that resulted in the deaths of most of his crew and the sinking of his ship.<br/>
Upon obtaining the object, I suffered a similar fate; the Commission agents under my command all met sad and terrible fates, and I was relieved of duty. Experiments on the object's effects proved similar. The only relief I have is that neither the object nor its properties were as of yet disclosed to the Commissioner.<br/>
Understanding now what I do about it, I know of only one solution. I shall bury the item, turn in my resignation to the Commissioner, and take my life.<br/>

<p>Should any person, including Foundation personnel, be discovered to be investigating SCP-4461, the following instructions are to be followed in order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the attached self-deleting antimemetic virus to locate and permanently encrypt all files related to SCP-4461 which may exist on Foundation databases.</li>
<li>Contact the employee using the attached authentication credentials, and send the compliance instructions attached (See <strong>Addendum 4</strong>).</li>
<li>If they fail to comply, run the attached program titled "4461-WNDG0" and enter the personnel name.</li>
<li>If a mass breach of SCP-4461 occurs or is imminent, you are to run the attached failsafe program, which will retrieve direct contact information for a single Overseer chosen at random. You are to send this document and all its attachments to them. They will take appropriate action.</li>
