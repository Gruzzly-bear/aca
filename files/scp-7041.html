<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Apertures leading into SCP-7041 are to be monitored and blocked from public access as they become active. Civilians entering or exiting SCP-7041 apertures are to be amnesticised and returned to their respective dimensions. Other standard Veil protocols do not apply within SCP-7041 instances.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Rho-14 ("Run, Rabbit, Run") are to conduct regular expeditions into SCP-7041 instances in order to contain SCP-7041-1 and SCP-7041-2. A full schedule of future expeditions and associated containment equipment is currently kept by Chief Silva. Equipment handled by MTF-Ρ-14 specialists is contingent on the approved containment attempt and size of the active SCP-7041 aperture.</p>
<p>By default, MTF-Ρ-14 personnel are to carry a stun baton, two long-range tasers, two sedative grenades, three packets of Compound R-811<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and two bottles of water. This equipment has been approved for use against both SCP-7041-1 and any other individuals or groups (including civilian authorities within SCP-7041 instances) attempting to impede the Foundation's efforts. Active MTF-Ρ-14 personnel are to be rotated out on a monthly basis to prevent overexertion, injury, and overuse of Compound R-811. In case of severe impairment, the use of anomalous treatment methods on MTF-Ρ-14 personnel has been approved.</p>
<p>Recruitment efforts to increase MTF-Ρ-14's numbers are currently underway. Members should have experience in urban exploration/containment efforts, along with high athletic capability and parkour experience. Familiarity with the layout of Chongqing is also necessary, and conversational fluency in Mandarin Chinese is recommended.</p>
<p>Upon containment, SCP-7041-1 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-7041-2 is to be transported to Site-03's R&amp;D lab and implemented into ongoing containment efforts and Frith radiation research.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7041 is the collective designation for randomly occurring pocket dimensions containing iterations of Chongqing, China. These instances loop when approaching the city limits of Chongqing and lack any Foundation infrastructure or personnel. Hume levels within SCP-7041 instances are in a state of constant degradation, and instances will undergo a ZK-Class Failure of Reality Scenario roughly three to four weeks after manifestation. Civilians native to SCP-7041 instances display no acknowledgement of these anomalous effects.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="chongqing2.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7041/chongqing2.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">

<p>SCP-7041 instances are accessible via access points that appear within baseline Chongqing. These apertures usually manifest in small, obscured spaces, such as within dumpsters or air vents, and lead to the corresponding area within SCP-7041 instances. Once an instance of SCP-7041 vanishes, so too will the corresponding aperture. New instances manifest roughly four times a month on average. Apertures to newly-created SCP-7041 instances can also manifest within existing SCP-7041 instances, along with apertures to entire parallel universes. However, due to the temporary nature of SCP-7041 instances, these apertures have been deemed unsuitable for reliable trans-universal travel. No methods of expanding these apertures or preventing their disappearance have been found.</p>
<p>SCP-7041-1 is a male-presenting human who inhabits and travels through SCP-7041 instances freely. Subject appears to be between 30 to 40 years old, is of Middle Eastern descent, and can be identified by a large burn on the left side of its head. SCP-7041-1 displays anomalous traits such as precognitive abilities<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, minimal exhaustion after long-term athletic exertion, immunity to temporal anomalies, and innate knowledge of the location of SCP-7041 apertures<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Additionally, it has shown robust experience in parkour, urban traversal, hand-to-hand combat, and navigating the layout of Chongqing. The primary goal of SCP-7041-1 appears to be the prevention of acquisition of SCP-7041-2.</p>
<p>According to eyewitness accounts, SCP-7041-2 is a small (11cm x 11cm) metallic cast of a human heart. Approximately once every hour, SCP-7041-2 releases a large amount of Frith radiation, a recently discovered type of radiation capable of counteracting spaciotemporal anomalies. This is believed to be the cause of the gradual degradation of SCP-7041 instances. The release of this radiation allows for both easy location of apertures and tracking of SCP-7041-2's location. SCP-7041-2 is believed to remain on SCP-7041-1's person at all times, often fastened directly to its body via a harness.</p>
<p>SCP-7041-1 has currently evaded all attempts at containment of both itself and SCP-7041-2. Additionally, the Foundation has encountered several other anomalous individuals and Groups of Interest attempting to apprehend SCP-7041-1 or gain entry into contained SCP-7041 apertures. These interlopers appear to originate from both baseline reality and parallel universes - investigation into their knowledge of SCP-7041-1 and SCP-7041-2 is currently ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7041/1 - Frith Radiation:</strong> Upon discovery of SCP-7041-2's anomalous effects, Dr. Kanamori of Site-03 gave a presentation regarding Frith radiation. What follows is an excerpt detailing the properties of what would soon be classified as SCP-7041-2.</p>
<div style="display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BEGIN LOG</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Doctor Hisato Kanamori<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 15/2/2018<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> A presentation on the basics of Frith Radiation and SCP-7041. This presentation was held in order to request funding for a task force dedicated to containing SCP-7041-1 and SCP-7041-2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>(Doctor Kanamori adjusts his microphone and looks through his notes before beginning. An image of Site-54 is projected behind him.)</em></p>
<p>I think I speak for all of us when I say that the loss of Site-54<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> still weighs heavy on our minds. Those of us involved with spaciotemporal anomalies have had to… well, rethink everything we know about containment. Whether our equipment is up to snuff, which anomalies are unknowingly capable of catastrophic events, when the next containment failure will happen…</p>
<p>We're all looking for answers - looking for what to do next. Combing through every anomalous item and bit of research we have to find some way to bolster our existing spaciotemporal equipment and refine how we produce XACTS devices, all to ensure nothing of this magnitude ever happens again.</p>
<p><em>(Slide change to the skyline of Chongqing.)</em></p>
<p>Now, I hope you've all taken a look at the documentation I've sent over for SCP-7041, what little of it is currently set in stone. This anomaly, this infinite repetition of the mammoth urban playscape that is Chongqing, was brought to our attention when we detected a sudden burst of what we're calling Frith radiation.</p>
<p><em>(Slide change to a diagram displaying a "Frith source" and a temporal anomaly, each respectively emanating Frith particles and a temporal field.)</em></p>
<p>From the few tests we've been able to conduct within SCP-7041, Frith radiation particles are able to mitigate and perhaps even neutralize anomalous spaciotemporal fields. Whereas XACTS devices utilize relativistic accelerators to control such temporal characteristics, the use of radiation could lead to the creation of much more effective temporal sinks. Due to Site-03's research on both spaciotemporal anomalies and how non-anomalous radiation interacts with them, we believe we have the resources to reverse engineer the source of Frith radiation within SCP-7041 and potentially mass produce it for wider Foundation use.</p>
<p><em>(Slide change to a list of potential uses for Frith radiation.)</em></p>
<p>This means we could develop safer temporal equipment, help better contain dangerous anomalies, and… I hope I'm not speaking too soon, but perhaps even render the spaciotemporal anomaly around Site-54 inert. We imagine the uses for Frith radiation are even more plentiful, yet further research is needed to fully ascertain what's possible, what's practical, and just how easy it is to reproduce.</p>
<p><em>(Slide change to a blurry image of SCP-7041-1, taken while escaping from Foundation personnel).</em></p>
<p>But to do all that, we first need to contain the source…</p>

<p><em>(Whiskey pursues SCP-7041-1 through the stairwell of an apartment building.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Listen, would you mind answering a few questions? We're not going to hurt you, we'd just like to figure out what's going on.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 does not respond. On the sixth floor, it makes a turn and runs down the hallway. Whiskey follows.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Is there anything at all you can tell me about yourself or the object you're carrying? If you're going this far to keep it away from us, you must be-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> Stop talking. I'm not answering any of your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Why not? Why aren't you at least willing to tell us what you're trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> You're not a good listener, huh?</p>
<p>(SCP-7041-1 leaps over the floor's balcony, landing on an adjacent rooftop. Whiskey hesitates for a moment before following behind.)</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> What about the other groups and individuals also trying to detain you? Anything you're willing to disclose about them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> Do you have any idea how many people have tried doing this with me? There's no point in answering your questions, you're not going to listen to me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> You've been interviewed before? By those other groups, I assume?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> …People have tried. I guess I'm one popular guy, huh?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 climbs down a fire escape, jumping onto a closed dumpster before continuing down a narrow alleyway. Whiskey follows, once again hesitating and losing ground in the process.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> That's the only question you get. May as well give up now, you're not doing so great.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> I can do this all day, thank you very much. What about the pocket dimension we're in now, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> What do you want me to say? Beautiful place. Best city in the world. I could run here forever.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Look, give me something. Anything. What's so important about the heart and Frith radiation that you have to keep it away from us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> …Frith radiation?</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Yeah, the hourly burst of radiation that-</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 knocks over a large pile of trash bags as it runs by, blocking the alleyway and causing Whiskey to momentarily stop and attempt to climb over them. SCP-7041-1 stops and watches him struggle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> Listen close - this is all you're getting out of me. The only thing you need to know about the heart is that it lies. Whatever you have on it is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> Whatever this Frith radiation is, it's giving it off because it knows you want it. It's luring you in.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey:</strong> That makes no…</p>
<p><em>(Whiskey coughs, stumbling over the pile of trash as he momentarily succumbs to exhaustion.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 5<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> A squad of 15 MTF-Ρ-14 personnel are to chase down and apprehend SCP-7041-1, diverting its path towards a portable containment cell in the process.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-7041-1 is able to avoid apprehension for over three hours before escaping, including seven direct close calls with Ρ-14 personnel. All attempts to divert its path towards the containment cell fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 12<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> A squad of 90 MTF-Ρ-14 personnel are to chase down and apprehend SCP-7041-1, diverting its path towards one of ten portable containment cells in the process.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Same as Tests 11 through 1. SCP-7041-1 evades all attempts at capture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 15<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> SCP-████ is to be activated within the SCP-7041 instance in which SCP-7041-1 is located, stopping time within the area. MTF-P-14 has been equipped with temporally-resistant armor in order to locate and apprehend SCP-7041-1.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-7041-1 is unaffected by SCP-████ and escapes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 19<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> MTF-P-14 has been equipped with tranquilizer guns in order to sedate and apprehend SCP-7041-1.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-7041-1 is able to dodge over 150 shots, often using nearby civilians as human shields to do so. Civilian authorities within SCP-7041 are alerted and impede containment efforts long enough for SCP-7041-1 to escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 30<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> During another attempt at utilizing tranquilizer guns to sedate SCP-7041-1, MTF-P-14 Specialist October breaches protocol and procures a semi-automatic firearm, firing it at SCP-7041-1.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-7041-1 is able to avoid every shot fired at it, seeking cover in various positions until additional MTF-P-14 personnel can disarm October.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 45<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> SCP-7041-1 is to be sedated via long-range tranquilizers fired from a sniper rifle and apprehended.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-7041-1 blends in with a crowd of people, preventing a clear shot for over fifteen minutes before leaving the range of the sniper's nest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 47<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Procedures:</strong> Same procedures as attempts 45 and 46, now with 20 different snipers placed around the SCP-7041 instance.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Results initially identical to attempts 45 and 46. Containment attempt halted by the sudden incursion of an unknown Group of Interest attempting to contain SCP-7041-1, resulting in a firefight which allows SCP-7041-1 to escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attempt #:</strong> 50<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Beta:</strong> Golf, any signs of other groups trying to crash our party today?</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> None that I can see, no disturbances in baseline reality's apertures either. If you're being followed I'll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Juliett, me and Lima are almost there. We're not apprehending it yet, right?</p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> No, just make sure it doesn't get out of the…</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 notices Juliett on the balcony, stopping in its tracks and staring at them.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> Shit, alright, it's spotted me. Think it recognizes me<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, or does it just think I'm staring at it?</p>
<p><strong>Lima:</strong> It'll probably start running either way.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 continues to stare at Juliett before moving into a nearby building.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> You're right - it's off. Kilo, you're close. You know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> I think I saw it. Big red building southwest of the market, folks.</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Already in there. That one only has one set of stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Lima:</strong> Damn, you’re fast. Anyone in the elevator? Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><em>(Kilo turns a corner and spots SCP-7041-1 in a crowd in front of the elevator.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Goddamn, wish you were. It’s at the back of the crowd, I’m firing.</p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> Do it only if you’ve got a-</p>
<p><em>(Before Juliett can finish speaking, Kilo fires a taser at SCP-7041-1. It dodges the barbs, which hit a civilian. The elevator doors open, and SCP-7041-1 uses the crowd’s surprise to enter and close the door behind it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> …clear shot. Which I assume you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> Almost there. Kilo, any luck?</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Of course I didn’t have any fucking luck. It’s in the elevator - shit, shit, come on!</p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> Forget the civilians, just go!</p>
<p><em>(The crowd rushes away from Kilo. On the floor above, India summons the elevator, readying his stun baton. It arrives with nobody inside. India enters and opens the elevator hatch - no trace of SCP-7041-1 can be seen)</em></p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> It got in the shaft, no telling where it’s at now. Golf, ETA on the next Frith blast?</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> Uhhh… last one was 48 minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Any underground tunnels or easy ways onto other rooftops around here?</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> As long as you can get someone on the corner of Zhonghua and Xinhua, I think you’ve got it pinned down. It may try to escape through a window, but then we’d be able to get a visual. Someone else needs to stay by the Line 1 station too.</p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> I’ll stay at the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Foxtrot:</strong> I’ll hit the train once we get there.</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Alright. Keep an eye out, folks.</p>
<p><em>(Roughly 5 minutes of extraneous footage removed. SCP-7041-1 is eventually seen exiting an adjacent building and attempting to escape.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lima:</strong> Hold up. I think I might see it - heading south past Xinhua.</p>
<p><strong>Beta:</strong> Towards the river, right? Squad 1’s almost there. Alpha, do we flank it?</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> We can try. Bonnie, how close do we need to be?</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie:</strong> Maybe 25 meters?</p>
<p><strong>Clyde:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Good, that should be easy. Get ready, Clyde.</p>
<p><em>(Lima begins to give chase, with other MTF-P-14 personnel closing in as SCP-7041-1 runs south towards the river. Rain begins to fall. Squad 1 closes in and hides behind a parked truck.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> Storm coming in earlier than we thought, don't slip.</p>
<p><strong>Lima:</strong> I’m… huff… close… Squad 1, where are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Parked along the river. If it hops a boat again I swear to god…</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Lima, me and Kilo are on the street under Kaixuan. We've got your back - there's no way out for it but forward.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> Please don't jinx it.</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> 150 meters and counting from your position, Squad 1. Everyone else try to close in as best you can if it tries to dodge.</p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> Can do.</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> We’re pretty far away, but we’ll try.</p>
<p><em>(The storm begins to pick up, limiting visibility. SCP-7041-1 slows for a moment before jumping over the side of Kaixuan onto a newsstand below and continuing down the lower street. India and Kilo give chase.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Lima:</strong> And there it fucking goes.</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Kilo, I’m going to go into the side alley in case it tries to double back away from the river. You’re up.</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Hell yeah.</p>
<p><em>(As SCP-7041-1 approaches Squad 1's position, it turns its head to speak.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> You need to call them off, now! I don't want anyone to get hurt!</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> Plenty of people have gotten hurt because of you already, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>Juliett:</strong> …I’m sorry, did I hear that right? It’s never warned us like that before.</p>
<p><strong>Foxtrot:</strong> Weird. Maybe we finally have it cornered?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie:</strong> I said don't jinx it!</p>
<p><strong>Hotel:</strong> Keep going, Kilo.</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> 70 meters… 60 meters…</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> Alright, now!</p>
<p><em>(Squad 1 leaves their hiding spot and rides towards SCP-7041-1. India pops out of a nearby alleyway before SCP-7041-1 has a chance to turn into it. It ducks under India’s stun baton. Suddenly, it turns towards the two and pulls a 9mm pistol out of its coat. All three stop.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7041-1:</strong> Don’t make me do this. Let me go.</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> S-shit!</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> 50 meters… 40…</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Have… have you had that this whole time?</p>
<p><strong>Delta:</strong> Kilo? India? What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Kilo:</strong> It's got a fucking-</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> You’re in range.</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie:</strong> Clyde, Now!</p>
<p><em>(As Squad 1 closes in, Clyde strains as the asphalt begins to wrap around SCP-7041-1’s feet, pinning it in place. SCP-7041-1 turns and aims the gun at Squad 1 as they approach. A gunshot is heard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta:</strong> The hell?!</p>
<p><strong>Echo:</strong> Was that-</p>
<p><em>(The asphalt snare created by Clyde dissipates. SCP-7041-1 falls to the ground, avoiding Charlie’s attempt to grab it as he rides by. Clyde falls from his motorcycle, skidding against the ground and coming to a stop behind Kilo and India.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bonnie:</strong> Clyde? Clyde?!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 stands back up, gripping the pistol tightly and staring in shock at Clyde. Squad 1 comes to a screeching halt, Bonnie almost falling from his motorcycle as he scrambles over to embrace Clyde's limp body.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Foxtrot:</strong> Squad 1? Golf? What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>Golf:</strong> Life signs, uh… life signs from Clyde just went dark.</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie:</strong> M-Matthis… Matthis, my boy…</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7041-1 stares at Clyde’s body, its mouth agape. Members of Squad 1, India, and Kilo all stare at its weapon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Jesus, why the fuck would you-</p>
<p><em>(Kilo roars and breaks out into a dash. SCP-7041-1, still stunned, tries to scramble away, but slips and is tackled by Kilo. Both skid to the edge of the road and fall into the churning river below, out of sight. Kilo's body camera disconnects.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7041/4 - Post-Incident Testimony:</strong> Following his retrieval from the SCP-7041 instance, MTF-P-14 Specialist Kilo gave his testimony on what transpired between him and SCP-7041-1 following Incident 7041/50.</p>

<p>I think I came to while dash-1 was doing CPR on me. I could feel the water that was stuck in my throat, and each press made me heave up more and more… Honestly, I don’t even think it knew what it was doing. It’s weird, you chase this thing for almost a year with no luck at all, and you start to get the impression that it can do anything, that it’s this perfect superhuman specimen you’re never gonna catch, and here it is struggling to do something I learned in 10th grade.</p>
<p>So I start hacking up a whole bunch of water and it backs off. I look down and my body camera and tracker are gone, and we’re inside the hull of… some sailboat, I think it was. We must have been on the river somewhere, rain was still pouring outside. The door was open behind dash-1, so I guess it must have just broken in. The guy - sorry, the skip, just kinda sits on the ground across from me. It doesn’t get exhausted, we know that, but… it just looks weary. Like it could collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>At this point I’m still too out of it to nab it, before you ask. I wish I could, though. It brings up the name of our team - “Run, Rabbit, Run”. It thought that was hilarious, and asks if we really call ourselves that. "Cute name, really," it said. I reach for my stun baton or a grenade or something, but those are all gone too. So I say yeah, that’s us. Why are you helping me? What gives? And it turns away from me for a moment… and the guy says, “That was the first time I had to kill someone. Didn't want it to happen again”.</p>
<p>I didn’t really have a chance to meet the squirt from Pi-81, but… yeah, I was there. I saw. Tragic shit, right in front of his old man too. I didn’t know what to say to it. Were we supposed to know something like this would happen? It’s had contingency plans for everything else we’ve thrown at it, would it be so out of the question for it to have a gun in case of an emergency? It asks, “Why couldn't you have just listened to me?” not like it was expecting an answer, I think the guy was just a bit shaken.</p>
<p>So I ask about dash-2, if it’s worth killing people to keep it from us. Maybe not the best thing to say, but I can see the outline of it above its hip underneath its shirt. I know it’s got it harnessed there, like some kind of giant tumor. The defeat in its eyes suddenly turned into this… look of contempt. It opens its mouth to speak, and… honestly, I don’t know what happened. It’s like my body suddenly became a thousand times heavier, my head starts buzzing like there’s a swarm of bees in my skull, I think my nose started bleeding too. So it keeps talking, staring daggers into me this whole time, and I have no clue what it’s saying. I swear to god, its eyes were practically on fire. I beg it to stop, it shuts its mouth and suddenly everything stops hurting. “That's why. Had enough?” it says. Whatever it was that did that to me, I don’t think it was Frith radiation.</p>
<p>It tells me, “It doesn’t like when you talk about what it <em>really</em> is. I assume you know what an infohazard is, yeah?". Even though whatever just happened stopped, I still feel like shit, like I’m about to pass out at any moment. Suddenly it gets up and walks over to me. I thought for a second I was about to get strangled or something. It puts its hand under my chin and gets real close - I wish I could have grabbed it right there, I swear to god… And it tells me real low and aggressively, “The heart wants me to lose. It wants you to find it. And it <em>wants</em> to be contained. That's all you need to know.”</p>
<p>Without another word, it stands up to leave the boat. That's when it hit me - even though my mind's still foggy, the picture of dash-1 with the gun in its hand is still there. I only saw it for a few moments, and I thought I was imagining things, but… I could have sworn that was a Foundation-issue 9mm. The color of the slide, the way the grip was shaped… from what I saw, anyway. I used to have one back when I worked in site security. I call to it right as it's about to leave - the first thing that came to mind - what object class is it?</p>
<p>It stops in its tracks - guess I asked the right question. "Attis-class<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>," it says as it turns to me. Pretty sure it was smirking, too. "Just let me do my job, buddy. I was made for this. I was <em>born</em> to run - so let me," it says. And then it left.</p>
<p>I don’t know where it went, but my team found me a few minutes later. I wish we had better answers on dash-2, but maybe the skip was right. Maybe that is all we need to know.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Chief Silva,</p>
<p>First and foremost, allow me to offer my sincere apologies - I fear I've led you and the rest of your team astray. I kickstarted this whole goose chase without knowing what the consequences would entail, as it's clear that SCP-7041-2 is far more dangerous than we initially thought. Due to the passing of Specialist Clyde and the damage done to Specialist Kilo, I've sent in a request for the immediate halt of MTF-P-14's activities.</p>
<p>However, you and your team have a right to know what's going to happen next in regard to SCP-7041-2. I've been conducting my own investigation into the object's origins, and I'm not quite happy with what I've found. The only info I was able to find on it was from other GoIs whose databases or leaked communications we have access to, but a lot of the information is either contradictory or outright makes no sense. MC&amp;D thinks it's an anomalous piece of art, the Cogwork Orthodoxy has entire books on the thing, and the GOC wants it just because we do.</p>
<p>It's not just the Coalition, Insurgency, or other parallel-universe groups that have their eyes on the heart - almost every single group I could find has some sort of documentation on SCP-7041-2. And for some reason or another, they all want it. We might be chasing one giant lure that's hooked every anomalous group out there.</p>
<p>To be frank, I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but it's clear that we can't chase this goose any longer. I'm still working with the rest of SCP-7041's research team in regard to how we should go about containment from now on - I'll keep you updated in case anything changes.</p>
<p>-Doctor Hisato Kanamori, Site-03</p>
