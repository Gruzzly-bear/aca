<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-9301, emerging from its burrow following a successful hunt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A tracking device has been attached to SCP-9301 in order to monitor its movements. Site-110 researchers are to dispatch an M-Class unmanned deep sea submersible to SCP-9301’s location every 3 months to observe the anomaly and log any notable findings.</p>
<p>Due to SCP-9301’s location, no further containment measures have been deemed necessary at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9301 is an annelid organism with an appearance reminiscent of polychaetes.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Its body has a diameter of approximately 8 cm and a length of 28 m. SCP-9301 possesses an iridescent exoskeleton that shines when exposed to light.</p>
<p>Similar to certain non-anomalous species of polychaete,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> SCP-9301 possesses two large mandibles at the front of its head that it uses to hunt for prey. It is capable of rapidly snapping these mandibles shut at a speed that vastly dwarfs those of non-anomalous species.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> The force generated by SCP-9301’s mandibles is strong enough to generate a shockwave through the water that allows it to cleave through prey from a distance.</p>
<p>Since its discovery, SCP-9301 has remained on the seafloor, roaming the abyssal plains<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> of the northern Pacific Ocean. Its movements have proved to be erratic, lacking any discernible pattern. In the time it has been under observation, it has been consistently seen dragging SCP-9301-A along with it as it travels, using it as a shelter.</p>
<p>SCP-9301-A is the dismembered corpse of an unidentified male human. With the exception of the right leg, the corpse is missing all of its limbs, which appear to have been torn off the body by some considerable force. Its head has been sheared off just above the jaw, though its tongue remains intact. Its wounds have been observed to bleed sporadically; despite this, SCP-9301-A appears to be highly resistant to damage and seems to exhibit some level of self-regeneration. This regeneration, for reasons unknown, does not appear to extend to its missing limbs or head.</p>
<p>SCP-9301 will fully withdraw into SCP-9301-A when resting or hiding by retracting into an opening in the corpse’s chest. It will rarely leave the body entirely and will usually keep its tail end anchored within the corpse at all times. The only exception is when SCP-9301 is hunting, in which case SCP-9301 will emerge completely from SCP-9301-A and burrow into the seafloor. Its head will then appear out from the soil several meters away. SCP-9301 is an ambush predator; it will silently wait in its burrow for prey to enter the vicinity and, upon acquiring a target, will send out a shockwave to slice into the prey. Upon a successful kill, SCP-9301 will emerge from the burrow and return to SCP-9301-A. It will then crawl towards the prey as it falls to the seafloor and begin to eat.</p>
<p>During feeding, SCP-9301 has occasionally been observed attempting to shove pieces of its prey down SCP-9301-A’s esophageal tract. The reason for this behavior is unknown.</p>

<p>SCP-9301’s location on 2026/08/11.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On 2026/08/11, Lead Researcher Katrina Frost directed <a href="scp-9989.html">Kira.aic</a> — an AIC specially designed to study and manage deep sea anomalies — to remotely pilot an M-Class submersible to SCP-9301’s location for routine observation. At this time, SCP-9301’s tracker indicated it was currently located east of the Suiko Seamount, part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> in the northern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>As per protocol, Kira.aic would record SCP-9301 from a distance, making sure not to engage the anomaly directly.</p>

<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> This is Kira.aic. It is currently 18:22 local time. I have arrived at SCP-9301’s location and am approaching the anomaly now.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 comes into view directly ahead, barely visible in the darkness of the abyssal zone. Its head is protruding up from a burrow in the seabed. SCP-9301-A is lying motionless against a rock off to SCP-9301’s side.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> SCP-9301 appears to be engaged in hunting. I will continue to keep my distance as I watch the anomaly, so as to not be potentially mistaken for prey.</p>
<p><em>[Kira.aic monitors SCP-9301 for approximately 23 minutes. Suddenly, there is a loud crack as SCP-9301’s mandibles snap shut. The impact causes the submersible to rock in the water slightly. After a moment, SCP-9301 emerges from the burrow and crawls towards SCP-9301-A, retracting its body into the corpse tail end first.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> It seems SCP-9301 may have succeeded in striking something up above us. I will wait here to confirm the kill once it sinks to the seafloor. Since there seem to be no deviations in SCP-9301’s behavior, I will then conclude my observations and ascend back to the—</p>
<p><strong>UNKNOWN:</strong> So, you’ve returned to watch me once more? Haven’t lost interest in me quite yet, have you?</p>
<p><em>[The submersible’s camera darts about in all directions, searching for the source of the voice. After a moment, it settles on the sight of SCP-9301 crawling towards the submersible, dragging SCP-9301-A behind it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Come now. I finally choose to acknowledge you, and you have nothing to say? I was honestly expecting more of a reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You can talk?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 stops in front of the submersible and lifts its head. It lightly clacks its mandibles together.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Is it really so strange? Certainly no more unusual than the tiny metal box that repeatedly returns to the depths to spy on me.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I suppose not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Ah, think nothing of it. But perhaps now we can become properly acquainted.</p>
<p><em>[It nods its head at the submersible.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> You can call me Cervantes, a journeyman of the seas. Behind me is my compatriot, who goes by the name Aguado. And what would your name be, my box-shaped friend?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I am Kira.aic, an Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to engage in marine study and research. And for clarity, I’m not actually down here; I’m controlling this vessel remotely from my servers located up on land.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Well, regardless of where you are, I am pleased to meet you, Miss Kira. It has been some time since I’ve conversed with one engaged in scholarly pursuits, no less one from the surface. And to think that I might be a subject of your research — well, it flatters me so.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I appreciate your understanding, Mr. Cervantes. If you don’t mind, would you be willing to answer a few questions?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 tilts its head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> I don’t see why not. We have some time before my next meal sinks down to meet us. Please, tell me what you would like to know.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Thank you, sir. If it’s not a problem, maybe we could start with your friend? The one you called Aguado.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Ah, yes. Aguado here is the closest comrade I’ve ever known. A true friend through and through. The two of us have been through thick and thin together.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> And now you’re using his dead body as a shelter?</p>
<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> That is how it would appear, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I see… Well, how exactly did you meet?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> It’s simple, really. We were prisoners together.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Prisoners? Prisoners of who?</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause. SCP-9301 leans forward.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Do you— do you really not know? About <em>them</em>? Have you truly never heard that accursed siren song of those who plague the abyss?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I apologize. I’m afraid I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Hmm… perhaps it’s just as well, then. But needless to say, Aguado and I were <em>their</em> captives for quite a long time. So long, that I don’t even fully remember how either of us ended up there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> But you eventually managed to escape, is that right?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Well believe me, we certainly tried! Aguado and I, we pulled off all manner of harebrained schemes, and every last one of them failed in quite spectacular fashion. Eventually though, our captors had enough, and decided to punish us by— well, you see how my compatriot and I look now.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You mean to say you weren’t always like this?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 laughs again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> It is true that I was not always the handsome worm you see before you now. But that’s neither here nor there, my friend. The past is in the past, is it not?</p>
<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Still, sometimes I find myself oddly wistful of those days in captivity. Despite the torture and the starvation and the endless stream of horrors we were forced to bear witness to — I did enjoy having a friend to talk to, in the quiet moments. Aguado— well, as you can see, he is not much for speaking these days.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Your sympathy is appreciated, Miss Kira.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> So, how was it that you finally managed to escape?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Oh, it wasn’t that we escaped, in the end. Rather, we were liberated when a savior arrived to destroy our prison.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> A savior?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Aye. I remember hearing all the stories over the years, but I never quite believed he was real. A <a href="scp-4233.html">champion</a>, adorned in odd attire and brandishing an anchor, plowed into our prison one day and, with nary a word, reduced the place to rubble — driving out our tormentors back into the deepest darkness from whence they came.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> A champion? I think I might have something like that in my databanks. But you claim he didn’t say anything?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Nothing that I heard at least. Once the walls had all come down, he simply turned around and continued trawling through the abyss. I have the feeling that — though he will stop to help those in need — he is driven by an altogether different mission.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 shifts its gaze to the waters above.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Ah, would you look at that. It seems my prize has finally arrived to meet me.</p>
<p><em>[Kira.aic turns the camera upwards. Two large shapes begin to come into view as they sink to the seafloor.]</em></p>
<p><em>[It is the bisected corpse of a baleen whale, sliced cleanly in two through the middle.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 tilts its head as the two pieces hit the seafloor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> A North Pacific right whale.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> Likely a juvenile, based on its size.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Hmm… My senses aren’t quite what they used to be. I could have sworn it was a shark. This isn’t—</p>
<p><em>[Its voice lowers slightly, as if talking to itself.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Eh, we’re far enough out, and it’s small enough… perhaps the Banquet won’t…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> I’m sorry, the Banquet?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 jolts as it turns its attention back to Kira.aic.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Ah, apologies, Miss Kira! I was just thinking of my former captors, those vile phantoms who roam the seafloor. They place great importance on the whale falls, you see, and will invariably gather near them to lay claim to the feast that such things provide. You would do well to stay far away from them.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Is it unsafe to remain here then? Should we move somewhere else?</p>
<p><em>[There is a pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Well… I haven’t seen any sign of them for a number of weeks now, so we may be beyond the bounds of their territory. So long as their terrible song does not begin to creep out from the darkness, we should be all right.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 clacks its mandibles.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> But enough talk of such unpleasantness! Miss Kira, come, would you like to join me for a meal?</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Thank you, but as an Artificial Intelligence Construct, I do not require sustenance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Suit yourself, though I hope you don’t mind if I help Aguado to this feast as we continue our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 nods before it turns and tears into the flesh of the whale with its mandibles. It rips out a chunk of meat which it then proceeds to shove into SCP-9301-A’s esophageal opening.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> If you don’t mind me asking, why is it that you continue to feed and carry your friend with you even though he’s deceased?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Oh, Aguado here isn’t dead. He merely <em>looks</em> as if he is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> It’s true that he now lies helplessly in front of death’s door, yes. I am not so foolish as to deny the inevitable. But…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> During our time as prisoners, Aguado would often tell me about his homeland, which sat far above the waves, basking in the light of the sun. He very much wished to return there someday, and I promised that if we ever became free, I would accompany him on his journey.</p>
<p><em>[Kira.aic directs the submersible’s camera on SCP-9301-A and zooms in. After a moment, the camera picks up very slight movements from SCP-9301-A’s mutilated head. Its tongue is twitching and undulating, almost imperceptibly so. Its esophageal tract can also be seen contracting as the meat is gradually carried into it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> He’s alive. You’re keeping him alive somehow. So you can bring him home.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 nods.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> I have been wandering for many, many years, searching for Aguado’s home so that he can be laid to rest. In truth, I do not know the way, but I believe that if I keep at it, providence will eventually lead me to where I need to be!</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You would do all that for your friend?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> But of course, that is what friends are for! Though I will not deny that I might also be driven by a desire to experience the world Aguado spoke so highly of for myself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> I think… perhaps I would <em>also</em> like to see the sun. Maybe I did once, in some time long forgotten…</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> You two must have been very close.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Indeed. Which means that, until the day comes that my friend touches the soil of his homeland once more, I will not permit him to die.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Would you mind telling me a little about <em>how</em> you’re keeping him alive? I’m picking up some signs of thaumaturgical influence; is that your doing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> I’m afraid I don’t know that word you used. Perhaps you could explain—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 suddenly goes quiet and looks off to the side. After a moment, the submersible’s microphones pick up a faint noise in the distance.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Voices. There are voices singing in the darkness.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Damn. Even out here, it seems the Banquet can still detect a fresh fall.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Your captors, they’re here?</p>
<p><em>[The voices have become louder. SCP-9301 turns to face the submersible again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Miss Kira, I’m afraid this is where we must part ways. I understand that you’re not truly down here, but I urge you to steer your vessel back to the surface as quick as you can. You don’t want to give the Banquet — <em>them</em> — anything that can lead back to your people. They are capable of things you can scarcely imagine. What they did to the giants, all those years ago, I—</p>
<p><em>[The voices are even louder now. The singing is getting closer. SCP-9301 shakes its head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9301:</strong> Miss Kira, please go. Perhaps we will meet again someday, my friend. But until then, farewell.</p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> Of course, but—</p>
<p><em>[SCP-9301 wraps its body around SCP-9301-A and digs its head into the seafloor. It rapidly burrows down, sending up clouds of sediment in all directions. Soon, the pair are out of sight.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The seafloor has gone quiet once more. The voices have seemingly ceased their singing. The submersible has begun its ascent.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kira.aic:</strong> This is Kira.aic. Returning topside now. Estimated time of arrival is—</p>
<p><em>[There is a sound of laughter directly behind the submersible followed by a loud crack.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Connection with the submersible is immediately lost.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Kira.aic was unable to reestablish a connection with the submersible. According to SCP-9301’s tracking device, SCP-9301 remained at this location — presumably underground — for 3 days before moving to the north. Since then, SCP-9301 has returned to its former erratic pattern of movement.</p>
<p>Foundation statisticians have determined the probability of SCP-9301 and SCP-9301-A ever making landfall to be highly unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><span><strong>Addendum 9301-2:</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 2026/08/26, approximately 2 weeks after its conversation with SCP-9301, Kira.aic unexpectedly regained connection with the submersible for a fraction of a second before losing it again. In that time, a data packet was received from the submersible containing a single image.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Commonly referred to as bristle worms, known for their segmented bodies lined with chitinous, bristle-like protrusions. Polychaete species can be found in a wide variety of marine environments, ranging from the waters near the surface, down to the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. E.g., <em>Eunice aphroditois</em>.</div>

Environmental conditions have inhibited efforts thus far to measure the precise speed of SCP-9301’s mandibles.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. The flat, relatively featureless expanses of seafloor found across pelagic open ocean regions. These plains comprise over 50% of the Earth’s surface, with depths ranging from 3,000 m to 6,000 m below sea level.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. An oceanic mountain range in the Pacific Ocean created by movements between the Hawaii Hotspot and the Pacific Tectonic Plate. Most of the mountain range is underwater, with the exception of the mountains comprising the Hawaiian Islands at the southeast end of the range.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-6"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')">6</a>. Statements by Kira.aic during observation are recorded to the video log but are not typically broadcast to the submersible’s surrounding environment. The submersible is equipped with speakers that allow for this functionality, however, should the need arise.</div>
