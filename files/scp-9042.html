The O5 Council and Global Occult Coalition are informed of the event.</p>
<p><strong>12:02:</strong> Interceptors are launched in an attempt to disable the weapon's propulsion systems. Foundation AICs and personnel begin tracking the weapon’s launch origin and current vector.</p>
<p><strong>12:05:</strong> The weapon evades the interceptors utilizing thaumic-based teleportation capabilities, and vanishes from Earthbound Foundation sensors.

<p><strong>12:18:</strong> The raid on the launch site is met with no resistance. A Way was seen closing as personnel entered the main laboratory. Only one individual, Jasmine Fata Repara, renowned paranatural astrophysicist and biologist and apparent head of the endeavor was taken into Foundation custody. Recovered records revealed the identities of fifty individuals under her employ including a number of known Serpent’s Hands members, missing personnel from Foundation Bio-Site-84<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> and former employees of Prometheus Labs, Inc.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Repara Interrogation I</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Jasmine Fata Repara, former project lead of Prometheus Labs Space Exploration Division.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Head Researcher Amanda Graham, project lead for the Stellar Defense Arm within the Foundation Space Division.</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview took place directly after the apprehension of Dr. Repara and her associates on-site.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 06/21/30 12:24 UST&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Hello, Doctor Repara.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 sits forward, her eyes widening.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Really, Amanda? So formal. Tell me, darling, how have you been? You look startled.</p>
<p><em>She grins. Graham's brow furrows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Eigenweapons tend to have that effect.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I thought your ilk would be accustomed to that sort of thing. Didn’t the pitch mention defending the world from chaos and dread? Something like that?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Yes. Now, can you please explain your intentions? Who are you working for? Why the mixed batch when it comes to your personnel?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Does any of that really matter, Amanda? Your pretty toys destroyed half a decade of work in under a second. Despite that, and all this, it is good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Humor me?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> If you agree to do so in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> That will depend entirely on the information you provide.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 purses her lips and taps her fingers on the table for several minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I always liked it when you attempted to play hard to get. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Your team?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Right, well, I can’t honestly say I am working for any one person. There was a complex network of interested parties involved in my research, which resulted in a diverse group of helpers. It was nice to have different perspectives; I doubt you see that much amongst the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Safe. They did good work, a cold cell being their only reward for all they’d done hadn’t seemed fair.</p>
<p><em>Graham notes that response and looks back up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You got them out?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Of course, as I said, a lot of folk were interested in our work. Maybe they’ll keep at it, but for now, they’re out of your reach.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Little is beyond our reach.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> They’ve hooked you good and proper, haven’t they?</p>
<p><em>She leans towards Graham, her eyes narrowed. Graham focuses on her writing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> What were your intentions for the eigenweapon?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Now, now, I thought we agreed on a tit for tat!</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> I suppose we did, then. Please, what do you wish to know, Dr. Repara?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Again, so formal. Hmm, how about, do you still remember what you told me in Portland?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> That… I never wanted the night to end. Because I knew it was all going to change after that.</p>
<p><em>She leans away from POI-9042. Their eyes narrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Mmm, I remember some other aspects about that night, like-</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Please, back to the eigenweapon.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 wrings her hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Well, honestly, I think using that term is a bit extreme regarding my device.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You aimed a clock-tower-sized bullet at the sun with enough thaumic energy in it to shake the noosphere. What would you call it then?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 blinks, tilting her head slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> A vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> For what? Sol itself?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> No sickness exists for the sun other than rage; you should know that. No, the sun was to be my assistant in the inoculation process.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> For what?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 holds her arms wide.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> For all this.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> The Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> No, no, though your organization has not been very helpful in regards to the plights our world is facing. We were hoping to salve at least a few wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> How exactly?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Again, Amanda, I have to ask, does this actually matter to you? If I remember you correctly, this should make you quite happy. A great change halted.</p>
<p><em>Graham grimaces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> An act of great chaos, if you had succeeded. The question remains.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> If indeed. Now, my dreams lie dead amongst the stars, and hopes lie unnoticed at your feet. I’m sure your superiors can find the answers on their own, as plain as they are.</p>
<p><em>Graham rolls her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> How dramatic.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 leans back in, reaching for Graham's hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You liked it when I was dramatic.</p>
<p><em>Graham retracts her hand, yet POI-9042 keeps her extended.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Are you going to answer the question?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Unlikely. You no doubt have my memos, my notes, why lay it all out when you can find it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Well. Then for fairness' sake, more than anything, would you want to ask me anything more?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 stares at her for a moment, chewing on her lip.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Why not, Researcher Graham? Are you still stuck on the idea that you can build a wall against change? Did the Foundation assist you in finding it?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> In a way.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 finally retracts her hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Shame. I had hoped you’d learned by now. Well then, I think it’s time for you to leave. I wish to mourn my last great endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 12:42 PM UST&gt;</strong><br/>

<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Further attempts to extract information from Dr. Repara were met with silence. She has been remanded to permanent Foundation custody. Foundation personnel are continuing to search for her missing staff, who are believed to be under the protection of an antagonistic GOI.</p>

<p>Investigations into the materials recovered from Dr. Repara's laboratory revealed little regarding the eigenweapon’s actual purpose. It appears to have been based on mundane cargo rocket designs, with clear esoteric augmentation, including a complex alchemical runic algorithm etched along the interior of the central hold.</p>
<p>A list of alchemical ingredients tied to rituals of rejuvenation was also uncovered. Studies into Sol’s overall health are ongoing, alongside examinations of any lasting effects resulting from the destruction of the eigenweapon and experimental Foundation equipment.</p>
<p>Additionally, a memo between Dr. Repara and her staff was recovered and transcribed below.</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>FINAL MEMO</span></h4>
<p>I just wanted you all to know how proud I am to have gotten here with all of you.</p>
<p>We are doing the work everyone refuses to do.</p>
<p>They could, they could so easily fix it. But the Foundation, the Coalition, even the damn Hand, they are all too stuck in their ways and comfortable in their positions to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>There hasn't been ice in the Arctic for a decade. The last Bornean Elephant is alone in some tiny zoo. Florida, bane that it is, is quite literally sinking under the constant assault of hurricanes.</p>
<p>A death in the name of normalcy.</p>
<p>Well, today that stops. Places people, we have a date with Sol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Update 06/30/30:</strong> Current estimates show that Sol remains on track for previous expectations regarding longevity and stability, with no sign of intrusive entities within or around its orbit. SCP-179 remains in a relaxed state. Foundation sensors have detected minute thaumic fluctuations within Sol’s magnetic field, expanding outward, the furthest detected spike recovered from the observation satellite haloing Titan. However, these alterations are so minor that they are unlikely to have any long-term impact on the system’s thaumosphere.</p>
<p>Similarly, ejecta with markers of the Jovian interceptor’s construction have been detected, but are believed to be inert following exposure to Sol’s corona. Monitoring systems are returning to baseline tracking patterns.</p>
<p>The target of Dr. Repara’s “inoculation” remains unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Update 07/16/30 02:06 AM UST:</strong> A massive spike in thaumic and ontological radiation is detected by Foundation sensors across the Inner Ring, alerting staff across all connected bases on Earth, Venus, Luna, and Mars.</p>
<p>Lunar Area-32 demands that all nonessential Foundation monitoring satellites with video capability turn their attention towards the dark side of the moon. The target of examination is captured below.</p>
<img alt="Moon3.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9042/Moon3.png"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="style01-plaintext animation05" style='--content: "HUSH";'><span style="color: #03ac13">The Garden Emerges.</span></span></p>
<p>Personnel from Luna Area-32 immediately began investigating the sudden transformation of the moon’s surface, while reports of similar alterations started flooding in from other off-planet sites. The O5 Council is alerted, with plans being set in motion to control the evolving narrative and limit public exposure to the sudden changes.</p>
<p>The response team’s investigation is recorded below.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> We have arrived at the edge of the anomaly’s current expanse. Time from Area-32, exactly two hours. This should be the northernmost section of the Mare Orientale. Temperature gauges appear to be reading just south of freezing. Pressure is increasing the closer we get to-.</p>
<p><em>Her camera looks out over a shimmering expanse of shifting teal liquid.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> The ocean that appeared overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Always wanted beachfront property. Are you seeing this Command?</p>
<p><em>An affirmation is heard over the comms. Agent Abiko kneels beside the liquid.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Taking a sample, the analysis will take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> The rover’s scanner shows the region is tectonically stable, no signs of openings or fresh impact craters.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Would need to head out into that stuff to get a real idea, though. Can the rover-</p>
<p><em>Nors shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> It was built for ramrodding about craters and dodging canyons, not sure how well the servos would handle … water?</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Possibly. With the altered temperature readings, I’m even less certain of what we’re looking at.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Looks like water to me.</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Plenty of clear liquids in the world, ignoring the anomalous. Liquid nitrogen comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Anyone want to taste test it? Great leaps and all that.</p>
<p><em>Abiko ignores her as the analyzer beeps, reading the output.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> So, want to take bets this is due to the witch and her magic nuke?</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> A nuke that was only stopped thanks to stolen alien tech? Likely.</p>
<p><em>Abiko looks up to the Commander.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Cut the chatter, what is it, Abiko?</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> It’s water, Ma'am, pure H2O. Well, not pure, but the minerals contained within are to be expected of Luna. Slight hints of ontological radiation, though.</p>
<p><em>Marks glances up at the horizon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Our suits keep us from feeling the chill, right? Perfect thermoregulation?</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> They should.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> We went from the base directly into our suits, both modulated climates, and they’re saying the temps have gone up, considerably, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> They could be faulty signals.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> All four?</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Broken gear is hardly rare up here.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Yeah, but those are like centrifuges and coffee makers, not the gear meant to keep us alive in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Nors, send up the rover’s probe, triple check the environmental readings.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Yes, mam.</p>
<p><em>She bounds back to the rover while Lieutenant Marks kneels, staring intently at the water’s edge.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> You know there’s a quicker way to check. Pressure and temp are both reading as livable.</p>
<p><em>He taps the side of his helmet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Absolutely not!</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> The imaging showed greenery and clouds. All of that combined should equate to a working atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Anomalies rarely hold to convention, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Obviously.</p>
<p><em>Nors interrupts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Commander, the scans are matching the suit’s readouts.</p>
<p><em>Marks reaches for his helmet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Check again, the anomaly could be altering-</p>
<p><em>A declaration from Command cuts her off. Under no circumstances is he to remove his helmet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><em>He turns to Cross, who is glaring at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> You're an ass, and an idiot, and it enrages me that I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> But you do love me.</p>
<p><em>She scoffs and turns away. He looks at Nors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> We both know they're just gonna chuck a couple orange shirts out the airlock to see anyway, thought I'd save them the paperwork.</p>
<p><em>Nors snorts and shakes her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Polsun is gonna tear you a new one when we get back.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> My wife will beat her to it.</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> You're right, I will.</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> If we might get back on task, what now?</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> We keep going, see if we can’t find the source of the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Might want to hurry.</p>
<p><em>She points towards the other agent's feet. Looking down, a thin layer of grey-green foliage can be seen poking out of the dusty moonstone beneath them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Grab a sample, let’s see if we can’t track down one of the more verdant patches from the imaging.</p>
<p><em>An hour of relatively uneventful travel ensues, with the agents pointing out other changes in the topography, including the continued spread of the moss-like foliage along the emergent coastline, and the sighting of clouds on the approaching horizon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> That is a monstrous thunderhead.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Sensors are detecting an increase in thaumic energy, the biggest hit is directly over that rise.</p>
<p><em>He points ahead of them to their left.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> The biological composition of the plants we recovered has been compiled; they share elements with lichens and mosses found on Earth, but their photoreceptors are more extensive and structured. Quite honestly, the modules coming back from -32 almost make them resemble solar panels on a minute scale. They also show signs of secondary consumption of naturally occurring radioactive elements in Luna’s soil.</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Hmm… Killian, keep an eye on that storm. I’m not certain I want to learn what happens when Luna feels her first-ever downpour.</p>
<p><em>Marks nods. The rover crests the rise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Woah.</p>
<p><em>The cameras reveal that the expanding cloud forms are emerging from a towering structure that resembles a many-limbed, techno-organic tree, metal and bark threaded together in a complex pattern. The clouds rise from its many curved branches. Some cling to broad, angled leaves. Water falls in constant rivulets from cracks and crevices across its trunk. Green runes gleam across its breadth, including a central spiral that pulses with a regular rhythm. At its base, a forest of fern-like foliage can be seen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Command, I believe we have found the anomaly’s origin point.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> It’s massive! How did that thing sneak past our sensors? Hell, why didn’t -32 detect an impact tremor?</p>
<p><em>The agents depart the rover, weaving their way through the forest on approach to the anomaly. Agent Abiko kneels, studying the root structure. The Lieutenant continues tracking the oncoming storm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Logging for the record that gravity remains at baseline levels in the presence of the anomaly, even as pressure and temperature have continued to rise steadily.</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> I don’t think it landed here. Notice the pitted and piled soil around the base.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> It sprouted overnight?</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Less, frankly. The disruption is fairly new.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> You’re saying in a handful of hours this thing has spat out an ocean the size of the Pacific?</p>
<p><em>She throws her arms wide, camera tracking up as she attempts to take the entire structure in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> The moon is smaller than the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> You know what I mean! Something like this happening so quickly is-</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Terrifying?</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> How is this thing churning out a biosphere so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Magic?</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Very helpful Abiko…</p>
<p><em>Cross approaches the structure and cautiously places a hand against the trunk, tracing one of the runes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Command, do these have any known meaning?</p>
<p><span class="style01-plaintext animation05" style='--content: "THRIVE";'><em><span style="color: #03ac13"><strong>THRIVE</strong></span></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Come again, Command?</p>
<p><em>Her radio returns only static.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Outward comms are down, check your gear!</p>
<p><em>The others each attempt to reach Command, getting static in return.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> This thing is generating a lot of energy, thaumic, ontological, and otherwise; any bit of that might have scrambled the comms.</p>
<p><em>Marks glances back up at the storm, catching a flash of jade-tinted lightning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> That storm front is nearly on us. This structure will probably be a target for any lightning it wants to toss out.</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Then we shouldn’t linger. Gather what we can, including a sample from the primary anomaly if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> I’ll grab the multitool from the rover.</p>
<p><em>He turns and bounds back to the vehicle. The others move about collecting samples from the surrounding soil, foliage, and water. Agent Nors holds up an ampule of water to the Commander.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> It fogged the glass immediately. Scanner says it’s just above boiling.</p>
<p><em>Marks returns carrying the multitool across one shoulder, a thick sawing implement attached.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Y’all figure out how this thing is doing all this, excluding the obvious?</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> There is some manner of chemical alteration going on inside, but I can’t even begin to tell you the how or the why until we crack it open and take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> What I want to know is where it’s drawing the power to even do all this?</p>
<p><em>Abiko points at some of the angled leaves and then down at the roots.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> Solar? Geothermal? Radioactive elements in the interior?</p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Poor positioning for relying entirely on the former, with nowhere near enough of the latter. And, Luna isn’t geothermically active.</p>
<p><strong>Abiko:</strong> It wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Nors:</strong> So, what, you think this thing is pumping her heart at the same time it’s giving her a facelift?</p>
<p><em>Abiko nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Hopefully, the sample will be enough for the others to figure out how to slow or stop it before it hits sunny side. Can’t imagine how our counterparts on Terra will go about covering up ‘The Moon’s turning teal’.</p>
<p><em>He walks to one of the roots and activates the multitool.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> Go slow, there is no way of knowing how it might react to this.</p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> Yes, hun.</p>
<p><em>The tool cuts into the root, and each of their cameras begins to shake. A keening, gonging sound overpowers their comms. The ground roils before Lieutenant Marks, as the runes along the structure flash in unison. A featureless semi-humanoid entity with skin akin to Luna’s pitted surface, missing sections of its body, emerges and raises a hand towards him. The gong sounds again as the ground continues to shake.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marks:</strong> What-</p>
<p><em>His suit erupts as twisting grey-green foliage bursts his body apart, scattering viscera across the ground. The entity collapses into dust.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross:</strong> NO!</p>
<p><em>The storm breaks.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update 08/03/30:</strong> SCP-9042-A is the designation for a series of techno-organic structures detected on/within <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">three</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">seven</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">nine</span> all planetoids, dwarf planetoids, and a selection of larger asteroids within the Sol system, excluding Earth. Their forms are varied, though each resembles, in a fashion, a terrestrial form of flora. They are composed of a hybridization of nonterrestrial metals resembling the composition of SCP-████ terrestrial foliage, namely, trees. Sampled examples include holly, oak, banyan, ginkgo, and cypress.</p>
<p>SCP-9042-A’s primary function appears to be the recreation or origination of biospheres within the planet to which they are attached. Part of the process appears to be thaumic in origin, while other aspects rely on solar or geothermal power on the more terrestrial worlds, with wind power common amongst the gas giants.</p>
<p>The emergent biospheres created by SCP-9042-A are evolving at an extremely rapid pace.</p>
<p>A secondary ability to manifest mobile avatars that attempt to immediately terminate individuals who cause damage to the SCP-9042-A structures has been recorded. Outside of this defense system, SCP-9042-A has proven resilient, resisting outright or regenerating from all current termination attempts by current Foundation personnel. Containment attempts regarding SCP-9042-A are ongoing. Number of failed attempts: 46</p>
<p><strong>Defunct Containment Procedures</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Threat of Veil-Break Scenario is heightened. Foundation plants within global space exploration agencies and meteorological agencies are required to implant AIC-assisted, doctored footage into all satellite-based observation systems—sabotage of non-critical telescope systems is authorized. Shut down of all observatories open to civilian personnel is ongoing. Confiscation of private observation equipment had been authorized—the grounding of national and private space flight interests to commence. Monitoring of the International Space Station and possible intervention is currently under discussion with GOC representatives. Trends have shown that the current containment strategy is unlikely to be sustainable.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Repara Interrogation II</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> POI-9042 aka Dr. Jasmine Fata Repara</p>
<p><strong>Interviewers:</strong> Director Dillan Polsun, representative of the Non-Terran Foundation Operations, and Director Amanda Graham, head of the Foundation Space Division.</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following the rapid expansion of SCP-9042-A’s terraforming and the death of several Foundation personnel, POI-9042 was brought in for another interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 8:00 AM UST&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> POI-9042.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042</strong>: Hello again, Graham. Hello Graham’s associate.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 waves lazily from her seat at the table; the others remain standing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> I am Director Polsun. While your determined silence was noted the last time this was attempted, recent events require clarity. Which Director Graham and I will receive.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Director? Congratulations. I know a starry-eyed girl from Portland who would have been mighty impressed.</p>
<p><em>Polsun raises an eyebrow at Director Graham, her lips twitch downward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> What does she mean?</p>
<p><em>Graham goes to speak, but POI-9042 cuts her off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Jasmine, please.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 blinks and grimaces, looking down at the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Fine. What do you want?</p>
<p><em>Polsun steps forward, looming over POI-9042.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Clarity.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 looks up, tilting her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> On what, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> It’s pretty simple, really. We want to know why your “inoculation” is killing my people.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Or if what is currently occurring is what you were attempting to inoculate against.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042's eyebrows rise, her mouth agape. She blinks several times.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> These images might be illuminating.</p>
<p><em>She places a folder on the table, which POI-9042 opens. Several moments of silence pass as POI-9042 looks through the presented images.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Well, firstly, no, this was not what I was attempting to guard against, and to the oppositional point, why do you believe I did this?</p>
<p><em>Polsun plants her hands on the table and leans in. POI-9042 looks to Graham instead, who frowns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Someone else you know fire an eigenweapon at the sun?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 scoffs and crosses her arms, leaning back in her chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Not a weapon, as I told Director Graham and a dozen others to date.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You were reticent to clarify exactly what you and your team were trying to accomplish. How are we to believe this was not your intention?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I can think of a few reasons, Amanda, but namely, there was nothing to fix with Luna or any of these other bodies. Their lifespans were moving as they were meant to, no meddling to be had. I told you our intent was to mend things here on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Yet, you refused to specify how.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Were you planning to grow one of these things on Earth?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 sighs, shaking her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> No! The ritual was based on growth, yes, but not anything akin to this.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> What was it meant to do then?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> <span class="style01-plaintext animation05" style='--content: "Reverse";'><em><span style="color: #03ac13"><strong>Rejuvenate</strong></span></em></span></p>
<p><em>Both directors look at each other as POI-9042’s mouth appears to move, but no sound comes out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Thaumic sensors spiked, but I don’t-</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 rolls her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Ugh, rejuvenation, regrowth, renewal, rebonding! We were attempting to heal this world, and you went and kamikazed our hopes and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You were trying to reverse climate change?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 nods, then sighs and rubs her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I know you both have your heads up above the clouds every day, but it’s not great down here. Your little brain trust wasn’t doing much about it, despite urging from some internal factions. So, money, means, a few good hands, and boom a harmless ritual to shift the clock back. Swift, clean, and easy.</p>
<p><em>Polsun scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> It would have led to worldwide chaos. Witnessing the current rate of growth, it would have overtaken certain areas in just days!</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Oh no, someone’s house isn’t on the verge of being swallowed by the sea. Oh dear, the rainforests reclaimed a few acres of land. My god, insert species here, isn’t on the verge of collapse. Huh, we all care more about our home. All things well within your organization's ability to handle, by the way, without that little limiter called ‘normalcy’.</p>
<p><em>Polsun sneers and pushes away from the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> There would have been mass panic, unrest, and people wouldn’t have been able to contextualize the change! We would have had to step in.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 grimaces and pulls her arms tighter around herself.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Compared to the consumptive status quo currently, I’m sure many would have been delighted.</p>
<p><em>Graham approaches the table, leaning towards POI-9042 from the side, trying to meet her gaze.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Not everyone would have been so keen on it.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 bares her teeth, nodding towards Polsun.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Clearly, love. I’m sure your friend here would be at the front of the line to reburn down the Amazon. But I know you know, as high as you are station-wise, that she is choking. We were doing the right thing, and instead, Mercury is underwater, and there’s some pretty pine forests sprouting on Luna. Good job!</p>
<p><em>She pats Graham and leaves her hand on her arm, her eyes dilate as their gaze meets. Polsun snorts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> You’re blaming us?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 nods, breaking eye contact with Director Graham.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Who shot down my rocket? The Coalition? Should have let them; they’re used to egg on their face. The sister didn’t react; that should have been a clue enough to leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We couldn’t have known-</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 draws her hand away, expression hardening. Graham’s hand twitches.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> When did she ever steer you wrong before, Director?</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> So, if this is not your intention, can you at least explain what it is, or how to get rid of it?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 flips through the images again.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> The latter point, I couldn’t begin to tell you; you took a carefully anchored ritual and blew it to pieces. The magic could have gone wild in all manner of ways. The first, I have a theory, but it requires that I get to ask some questions.</p>
<p><em>The directors share a look and then nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> We got a read on what you sent after my rocket. Lovely paint job, very menacing, but the name that stuck out to me. Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You know we can’t tell you that.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Fine, but it is fairly self-evident, I mean… Jovian draws a pretty clear picture. Had you ever tested it before?</p>
<p><em>Polsun grimaces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Lovely, now, main-body or auxiliary, if we’re dancing around the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> We can’t-</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Auxiliary.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> Graham!</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> So, not initially a weapon, likely captured and scrubbed, altered to match your parameters, but the big question is, did you wipe the core programming? The repair protocols?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We were thorough.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Not thorough enough. So, to stop a device you did not understand, you launched a nonterrestrial craft that had yet to be tested. Allowing both to be destroyed, the undirected magic mixes with its complex nanotechnology-based internal mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> How do you know tha-</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Please. Galileo spotted it, you don’t think Prometheus had eyes and contingencies based around it? Anyway, back to my point, they collided within the corona, mixing and then dispersing on the solar wind as it billowed out across the system. A spell centered on life and a machine focused on repair, and you’re asking me why technorganic terraformers are popping up everywhere? Congratulations, Foundation, you sowed and seeded a vast new garden.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> How is this any more our fault than yours!</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 smiles and leans forward in her seat.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You didn’t have to intervene. See, that’s your problem: you can never leave something alone. And now, you have a problem so grand in scope that I can’t even begin to imagine how you’ll contain it, let alone what it might…</p>
<p><em>She stares at the last image, showing the entity that manifested on the initial sampling attempt of SCP-9000-A on Luna.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Might what?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Might wake up. Now that is a curious thing to think over. Regardless, I think you’ve finally created a problem for yourself that you can’t solve.</p>
<p><strong>Polsun:</strong> I wouldn’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Pride cometh and all that.</p>
<p><em>Polsun throws her hands up and walks away, leaving Director Graham alone with POI-9042.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We will find a way to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> If you say so, Amanda.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You doubt me?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> The Foundation? Principally. You? I didn’t, until you-</p>
<p><em>Graham abruptly walks away, leaving POI-9042 staring at the images on the table with a wistful expression.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 9:06 AM UST&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Shortly after this interrogation, faunal life was detected for the first time on Luna.</p>

<p><strong>Update 9/14/30:</strong> SCP-9042-B is the designation for the fauna spawned from the continued terraforming of SCP-9042. These entities are undergoing a rapid pattern of evolution, with new species emerging within days of previous iterations. Biological debris that should be left over from such a rapid growth and dissolution of life is worked back into the biosphere, leading to heightened growth periods across the breadth of SCP-9042. As of September 1, 2030, this process has shown no signs of slowing down and may indeed be increasing. Attempts to limit the spread or growth of these specimens through lethal means elicit the immediate retribution of the aforementioned Guardian entities against Foundation personnel and equipment, including those not involved in the inciting engagement. Loss of Foundation life is deemed too great; alternative containment methods are being investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Defunct Containment Protocols:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The threat of the Veil Break Scenario is rising. Resistance within global space agencies is rising, and replacement protocols are being investigated as a viable alternative to the current working relationship. Leaks on online communities are growing more frequent, likely due to CI or Serpent’s Hand agents, and targeted raids on known affiliates are being authorized. Limiting the spread of information regarding SCP-9042 is paramount; therefore, termination of numerous watch boards and forum sites, including and especially Parawatch, has been authorized.</span></p>
<p><strong>Update 10/06/30:</strong> The addition of new organisms has halted progress in limiting the SCP-9042-A’s terraforming. Termination of specimens is authorized, though heightened aggression of the guardian-class entity is likely.</p>
<p>Forming a concrete perimeter around afflicted regions is paramount. The long-term tenability of the current protocols is in question, as such a transfer of three-quarters of MTF personnel and half of the standing D-Class population to off-earth operations to facilitate containment has been authorized by the O5 Council.</p>

<p>Saturn’s guardian entity manifests as a deer, formed of ice and an unidentified mass of flesh. Curiously, the Saturn manifestation appears to have some manner of command of the other 7A instances.</p>

<p>Varied. Saturn's currently appears to be consolidated into a hexagonal forest/garden that resembles a terrestrial temperate forest.</p>
<p>Enceladus’s ocean environment has been revealed following a fracturing of the upper ice layer, leading to a region roughly analogous to Antarctica.</p>
<p>Titan’s emergent environment most closely resembles Earth’s biosphere, excluding its methane base.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Varied. Notably, all of Saturn’s emergent fauna share some features with terrestrial hircines.</p>
<p>Species of Interest: <em>Titanopithicus verdans</em> excluding the green coloration, these entities are a one-to-one copy of the Australopithecus. Tool usage is evident.</p>

<p>Located on Pluto, the SCP-9042-10A instance resembles a Japanese cherry tree and is situated directly in the center of Sputnik Planitia.</p>
<p>Its guardian entity manifests as a 7-meter-tall crystalline elephantine figure. It notably manifested before any termination attempts regarding the -10A instance, and has been proactively aggressive towards Foundation personnel.</p>
</td>
<td>The emergent environment most closely resembles a fusion between modern-day Antarctica and the Pleistocene.</td>

<p>The emergent fauna are analogous to Pleistocene era mammals, though they have a marked lack of visual organs, relying mainly on hearing and smell.</p>
<p>Species of Interest: <em>Plutomammut foderes</em> a burrowing proboscidean analogous entities; their five miniature trunks are dexterous and capable of easily manipulating stolen Foundation equipment.</p>

<h4 id="toc1"><span>NOTICE FROM THE LUNAR AREA-32</span></h4>
<p>We require immediate assistance from all available Foundation personnel within range of transmitters!</p>
<p>The site is under siege.</p>
<p>We had attempted to contain a population of <em>Lunalagomorpha fallacites</em> with signs of advanced cognition. Inside their burrow, we discovered signs of emergent culture: art, tools, weaponry, and, most critically, a place of worship dripping with both Akiva and ontological radiation.</p>
<p>We captured many of the individuals within as per containment protocol. Some had to be terminated as they tried to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Many reached for these little figurines, nothing anomalous about them, just carved rocks of a fetal figure.</p>
<p>Took a few, left the rest with their owners.</p>
<p>Those we captured began to vocalize rhythmically, young and old, with the same cadence, on the way back—a language.</p>
<p>Prayer.</p>
<p>Last week, they were just like any other entity up here, a bit smarter than most, or maybe they were hiding it.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter now. They can think, they can plan, and right now, they are moving in tandem with the environment itself to cut us off from the far-outposts. I've ordered all forces to open fire, but it won't be enough.</p>
<p>It's with them, kilometers away, but the ontokinetic sensors are past red.</p>
<p>We can see it.</p>
<p>It's not just a guardian.</p>
<p>It's Luna—their god.</p>
<p>They're all gods.</p>
<p>— Director Pulson</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lunar Area-32 has gone dark, and all personnel are believed to be lost.</p>
<p>The SCP-9042-A instances have been recategorized as ontological threats. Attempts to limit their contact with/separate them from the emergent sophont specimens are paramount.</p>
<p>All nonessential Foundation personnel are reassigned to find a solution to this growing dilemma. The GOC and other relevant groups have been informed of the full array of threats facing us.</p>
<p>— O5 Council</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following the destruction of Lunar Area 32 and reallocation of Foundation resources to fully focus on combating the SCP-9042 threat, a signal in an unknown language began beaming from each altered world towards Earth—failed Termination Attempts: 400 as of 2/2/31.</p>
<p>The messages contained within were eventually translated, and each declared the same phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sister. Why? Protect. Our. Children. Then. We. Come. For. Answers. We. Are. Coming.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="style01-plaintext animation05" style='--content: "Sister";'><em><span style="color: #03ac13"><strong><span style="font-size:125%;">We are Coming.</span></strong></span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Foundation personnel have been pulled back to a holding pattern surrounding Earth. Project Svalinn is to be activated as the current Containment Protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Repara Interrogation III</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> POI-9042</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Regional Director Amanda Graham</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The final interrogation between Director Graham and POI-9042.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 10:30 PM UST, 2/2/31&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Hello, Director, what-</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> I don’t have time, 9042. You knew.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 blinks, her pupils narrowing.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I… knew?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> The endgame of the terraformers, the entities that protected them, that they were-</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Nascent divinities? I believed that could be the case. I had thought your theologians would have put that together long before now; you’ve raised a few in the past and killed a few more.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> There are over a dozen of them, and everything we throw at them bounces right off.</p>
<p><em>Graham begins pacing around the room, rubbing fingers through her hair. POI-9042 raises her hands placatingly.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Surely your more martial friend has some idea what to do. Where is she? I can’t imagine she would miss a chance to rip into me for our-sorry, my grand mishap.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> She’s dead.</p>
<p><em>Graham wipes her eyes. POI-9042's eyes dilate, her smile falling away. She rises from her chair and approaches Graham, but the latter steps back.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I… Amanda, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><em>Graham turns away from her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We’re running out of time. You have to know something, anything that can help us win this.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 narrows her eyes and attempts to get closer to Graham, but she retreats once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> And what does victory mean to you? Everything back the way it was, all that life reduced to nothing but a forgotten memory? Every bit of change wrenched back?</p>
<p><em>Graham grimaces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We… the Veil can’t fall. They can’t stay, and more than that, they are coming here.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> They told us, though… I don’t imagine their message was meant for us.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042’s eyes widen.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> It was meant for Her. Wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Yes. They’re gathering their inhabitants to their sides, sophont or otherwise, preparing, and building. They are advancing so rapidly that they’ll likely have some form of spaceflight capability by the middle of this year.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Barring intervention of the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We’ve tried they just… come back, altered, stronger…. Angrier.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> The divinities or their followers?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Both.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 smirks, and Director Graham’s jaw tightens.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> It must be so frustrating for your superiors. Finally, finding people they can't drive to extinction.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Like what has nearly happened to your people?</p>
<p><em>POI-9042’s eyes become like slits, and her breathing falters.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You… know?</p>
<p><em>Director Graham produces a pistol from within her coat and points it at her. POI-9042 had been reaching towards her, and now she steps back, hands shaking.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Graham:</strong> Their messages helped crack your sigil work. A tongue only spoken by those…</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> <span class="style01-plaintext animation05" style='--content: "Faerie";'><em><span style="color: #03ac13"><strong>Under Hill</strong></span></em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You weren’t out to save humanity.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 keeps her eyes locked on the gun; her expression shifts through multiple emotions.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> No, I was not out to save humanity. I don’t recall ever implying so. I was out to save Her, and maybe save my kin too. My mother always said our bond was the tightest.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Polsun was right, there would have been mayhem.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Only if your ilk wished it to be, which they would, because why should we have the right to just Be.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> It doesn’t matter now, but… is that what is occurring with the SCP-9042? They’re responding to the sophont manifestations?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> They are defending their children. You know, I had always wondered if gods came about before their people, or were born of them, or grew together. Suppose I’ll have to wait and see</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> So if we got rid of them, would they-</p>
<p><em>POI-9042’s eyes turn from the gun to Director Graham’s face, her expression darkening.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Amanda… is something as trite and artificial as normalcy something your organization is genuinely prepared to commit omnicide over?</p>
<p><em>Director Graham looks away. She lowers the gun and begins pacing once more as POI-9042 steps towards her.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Why are you here? Why are you asking me about these things, offering up all this information? Are you here to kill me, tying up loose ends before whatever fool scheme your superiors have conducted?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> No! I-I don’t-</p>
<p><em>She stares at her silently for several moments before reholstering the gun and glancing at the observing camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Just tell me when you replaced her.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 blinks, and her expression softens.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> The girl you knew, the crush with all the gentle blushes. That was before.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Then you killed her.</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 shakes her head, lip quivering.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> No. Then she let me in, she-we changed, growing together. We-I became the her who loved you.</p>
<p><em>Graham slumps into a chair, rubbing her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> There is a plan. A dreadful, stupid, ugly plan, but it’s all we have.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Death and horror, I imagine. Letting loose another of your caged dogs?</p>
<p><em>Graham is silent. POI-9042 approaches the table and sits atop it beside her.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> There is another way to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Let them in.</p>
<p><em>Graham looks up, mouth agape.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> And let them slaughter us?!</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 looks to the ceiling and closes her eyes, whole body tense.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You don't know that is what they want! That's the problem with you Foundation types, too eager to find a threat, so rarely willing to put the blades down and wait to see what something's intentions actually are. That's how all this started.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> It was a bomb!</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> It wasn't! You assumed the worst-case scenario, and now over a dozen fresh divinities and their children are looking at their eldest sibling and wondering why hers are trying so hard to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Of course, we went to the worst-case scenario! Dozens upon dozens of times before it did, and we clawed it back. We stopped the world from falling apart. Do you think I haven’t considered all the possibilities?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> All the negative ones.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You are painfully naive if you think that isn’t an earned assumption!</p>
<p><em>Both women stand, glaring at each other, centimeters apart.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Have they ever once come at you when you weren't after them first?!</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> We… most of us don’t want to kill them!</p>
<p><em>POI-9042 points at her.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Most?</p>
<p><em>Graham exhales as her eyes dart about the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Some want to- We need them to stay where they are, keep them isolated. We can build enclosures, integrate them into the Foundation, and attempt to separate them from the gods. My plan it- We need time to make it all work, and I-</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You'd be devastating their culture, robbing them of their homes! Why can't you just let them Be?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> It's too late for that! They're already on their way; we've wounded them too many times. This won't end peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Because you assume they are naturally just like you! Throughout all this time studying them, have you ever attempted to actually learn about them, or just debated ways of keeping them locked away, despite that modus failing you again and again? They want their sister; they want you to leave them alone. Why can't you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Their sister is dead or as good as. What happens when they discover this?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> She doesn’t have to be! The Foundation can work miracles instead of terrors, and even if you fail, you won't truly know what will happen until they arrive. So, what are you going to do? Continue to blunt yourself on the encroaching wall, or actually make a change for the better?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You act as if we have not discussed any of this, like we haven't thought any of this through.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Then enlighten me.</p>
<p><em>She sits down, staring up at Graham, fists clenched atop her lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You believe, so many of you believe that we support the Veil, support normalcy because we loathe the oddity. You refuse to accept that cautious steps forward lead to better results; there always needs to be this vast and immediate change! You think you were going to help her with your ritual? What if you woke her up and all she felt was pain? Would she have lashed out? How many would die until she stopped? Would she simply suffer in silence? What if something else went wrong? Rampant diseases, sudden reorientation of climates, and storm systems? Climates rebounding and then immediately destabilizing?</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> You have no way of knowing things could go so poorly.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> And you have no way of knowing it wouldn't! Regardless, that isn't our problem; our problem is a dozen world-mind class divinities deciding they need to come here. Is that our fault? Would they have done it anyway? I have no idea. What I do know is they can't come here! Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Ignoring the tide of ontological radiation that will arrive with them, risking unraveling many carefully laid wards, challenging the domains of numerous jealous yet appeased divinities, and threatening dozens of locations that rely on dimensional gateways? It will upend society entirely; people will panic, they will do foolish, fearful things, and then, regardless of whether the Foundation intervenes or not, things will unravel. Even if they wind up being peaceful and understanding, someone, more foolish and hungry than anyone in this organization, will make a move, and they will react as Gods do—unthinking retribution.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> That is so painfully, unthinkingly cynical.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> A man made a mistake, and Luna turned him to mulch for it. He had no idea he would hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> She didn't know what she was doing!</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Neither did he. The difference is in the magnitude. We make a mistake, and someone gets hurt. They react, and a continent gets leveled. They can't come here.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Amanda, what do you want from me?</p>
<p><em>She reaches out and takes both of Director Graham’s hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> I don't know. T-They're planning to do something that we won't be able to take back, and no one seems eager to point out that escalation will break everything. We need more time to come up with something better.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Then why come here?</p>
<p><em>Graham looks down at their hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Because I was never more grounded, never less afraid than when I was with her.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Until you ran away.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You don't get to bring that up; that was between me and the woman I loved!</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I am that woman.</p>
<p><em>Graham tried to pull away but POI-9042 holds on tighter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> No. You aren’t; you changed. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> I was the Her that loved you. That might still love you. I'm here.</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> I-</p>
<p><em>She looks at POI-9042’s face and then suddenly draws her into a hug. POI-9042 reciprocates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Jasmine I-</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> What are you going to do, Amanda?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> Present an alternative.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> A good one?</p>
<p><strong>Graham:</strong> You'll hate it.</p>
<p><strong>POI-9042:</strong> Just tell me.</p>
<p><em>The feed cuts and is not noticed for a period of ten minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log, 10:42 PM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Foundation security personnel entered the cell and found Director Graham to be the lone occupant. She was momentarily incoherent, and when asked about the incident involving POI-9042, she was unable to provide a concrete response. She was remanded into temporary custody for a 48 hr observation period, while the site and her quarters were searched. She showed no signs of mental, physical, or emotional alteration during that period, after which she was released. POI-9042 is still missing.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3/13/35:</strong></p>
<p>Containment Attempts Terminated.</p>
<p>Phobos has begun shifting towards Earth.</p>
<p>An unidentified object has exited Jupiter’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>A tower arises on Luna.</p>
<p>A Veilbreak is imminent. The situation has become untenable. All relies on Project Svalinn.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9042.3 - Project Svalinn</strong></p>
<div style="border:solid 1px #999999; background:#121212; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h4 id="toc2"><span>PROJECT SVALINN</span></h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Project Svalinn is a three-part initiative created for the sole purpose of defending Earth and the non-anomalous population from the existence of SCP-9042. While the study of these entities will continue regarding their possible containment and termination, this will grant our organization the time to do so.</p>
<p>Or so is the hope.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative I - Dead Skies:</strong> This initiative is to be undertaken immediately: a global amnestic and propaganda campaign that erodes public confidence in space travel and the veracity of claims regarding life outside Earth, while also increasing long-term disinterest in the night sky. This procedure aims to limit humanity’s curiosity about the stars and facilitate the dissolution of organizations and jobs tied to space exploration and study through a combination of false flags and public pressure.</p>
<p>The hope is that refocusing humanity’s consciousness away from stellar interests, alongside campaigns regarding climate change, will lead to a heightened focus on repairing the ongoing issues on Earth.</p>
<p>A quarter of the Foundation’s resources will be anchored in perpetuating this obfuscation on top of administering to any SCPs on Earth that will not be worked into the remainder of the Svalinn Project, while also continuing to seek a solution to the SCP-9042 dilemma.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative II - Tip of the Spear:</strong> This initiative is to commence immediately. Entrenched positions outside of Earth are to be dissolved as efficiently and promptly as possible. All essential materials are to be stripped, and any manageable SCP instances stored on site are to be evacuated as well. Those deemed too dangerous to transport must be placed under long-term lockdown, with automated personnel responsible for implementing workable protocols.</p>
<p>Half of this personnel are to consolidate with the joint Foundation-GOC fleet currently orbiting Earth. Afterwards, the fleet will employ coordinated strikes against the SCP-9042 instances, targeting key locations and doing everything in their power to slow their progress.</p>
<p>Numerous eigenweapons and SCP instances have been authorized for use during this process. Secondarily, the gathering of required resources from SCP-9042, namely SCP-9042-5, falls under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative III - The Last Wall:</strong> Construction of this aspect of Project Svalinn is already underway. The ultimate goal is to create an artificial thaumic shield that surrounds the entire Earth.</p>
<p>The exterior will be reinforced with the remainder of the fleet. At the same time, anti-ontological energies and theological protections are inscribed across the exterior and readministered on a tight cycle by thaumic practitioners and exorcists under the Foundation's employ.</p>
<p>The interior will be covered with a projection of the sky prior to the emergence of SCP-9042, drawing from Foundation video logs with continuous AIC alterations working in conjunction with the efforts of the Dead Skies protocols to keep the Veil in place.</p>
<p>The shield’s power source is also under construction and requires the immediate transfer of all Type-Green material within Foundation custody.</p>
<p>Additionally, connected to all protocols within Project Svalinn is the acquisition of every space-based organization, both national and private, by the Foundation, anomalous or otherwise, by any means available. Individuals in the employ of these organizations will be vetted for their skill and trustworthiness, being brought into the Foundation or amnesticized accordingly.</p>
<p>Resistance is to be expected. Delegates to the various Nexus-Points have been sent, as their extra-dimensionality may prove a risk to the stability of Project Svalinn. Foundation occupation may be required, or the termination of their connection locus. Other GOI, such as the CI or Serpent’s Hand, are likely to be resistant to our plans. Terrestrial MTF forces are officially on standby.<br/>
——<br/>
This is it—our last Hail Mary.</p>
<p>I know some folks argued for a more proactive end to this conflict. Planet crackers, Type Greens, weaponized Keters — I heard it all, and so too, I imagine, did the O5s. But I am thankful they took my protestations to heart. We have no idea what effects such devastating actions could have, or, in truth, if they would have any effect at all, and not just leave us with even more problems to clean up.</p>
<p>Our observations indicate that the instances are in motion, but most have a considerable distance to travel. This means we have time to halt their progress, if even momentarily, or draw them back “home”. We stay on our toes, and it will keep them on their toes, or so is the hope.</p>
<p>I imagine many of you are wondering why you were recalled to Earth. The answer is evident, yet in three parts, the first is that Luna is our biggest problem, close as she is, and we need all hands to keep her at bay.</p>
<p>The second being, in regard to our farthest outposts, Ceres is closing ranks, threading the asteroid field together into a vast net that grows more and more by the day.</p>
<p>We are not entirely cut off; there are ways out, but for now, Earth truly will be the lone home left to us.</p>
<p>And, thirdly and most importantly, the SCP-9042 instances are coming for her. From their own words, they seek their sister. Humanity has done a number on her, and when they arrive, make no mistake, no matter our actions, they seem likely to reach us. We can't let them find her in this state.</p>
<p>Therefore, healing her must be the priority, on top of uncovering anything we can use to halt their advance. The Veil will stand, on altered and shaking foundations, but it will hold. We will make sure of it.</p>
<p>We can not kill them, but we can maim them. We will become like locusts, tearing away and dying in the dark of the void while the rest of humanity lives under the light of a false sun.</p>
<p>All that needs to be done will take considerable time; we are here to make sure they have it.</p>
<p>Welcome to Project Svalinn.</p>
