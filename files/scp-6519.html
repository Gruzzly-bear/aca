<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Witness testimony will be collected by the Spectrometry and Spectremetry Section of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43" target="_blank">Site-43</a> to attempt confirmation of SCP-6519's existence.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6519 is an alleged phenomenon wherein recently-deceased individuals interfere with radio broadcasts by inserting unscheduled material. In all cases, persons responsible for supervising the affected broadcasts are incapable of recognizing that anything unusual has taken place, either at the time or after the fact. The inserted material is, in all cases, a single pre-existing commercial music track. The phenomenon is always witnessed by one or more live subjects engaged in the act of remembering the deceased individual, most commonly during funerary rituals.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 6519-1, Investigation:</strong> The SCP-6519 dossier was opened by Dr. Anastasios Mataxas, Chair of Spectrometry and Spectremetry, in 2020 after a chance conversation with Dr. Harold Blank. Dr. Blank had described a potentially supernatural, recurrent event which he himself had experienced, forming the template for all other manifestations since recorded. Dr. Mataxas subsequently encountered scattered references to other postmortem media interference in archival material, but was unable to engage in further research before his retirement. He passed the dossier to his successor, Dr. Polyxeni Mataxas, who collected preliminary witness testimony from Site-43 personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Testimony:</strong> "I have only the vaguest memory of the first occurrence. It might very well be that I'm remembering my mother talking about it later. I was sitting in the back of her van, and we were driving in my great-grandmother's funeral procession. You know, a little convoy following the hearse. Dunno if people do that anymore. Mom had the radio on — she always had the radio on — and this song came on straight away. Distant horns, otherworldly, like they were coming across a big black lake at night, and then this gospel rock thing kicks in. The upbeat take on death. One long assurance that the next life is a good one, and someone's gonna head on over there and put in a good word for you ahead of time. When it's your turn to go, there'll be a spot saved for you. Typical Christian boilerplate, but still a damn snappy song, and it never stops feeling… like it knows more than it lets on, like it's in on some cosmic secret, like it's coming from a place other than just some one-hit wonder nobody's ever heard of. It made a big impact on my mom, that's for sure; dunno if she really thought it was her grandma saying goodbye, but I can certainly understand her wanting to see it that way. She never got tired of telling that story. Especially when… okay. My personal religious beliefs <em>aren't,</em> you understand, and as far as I know she was the same, but we were agreed that something spooky was going on here because it damn well happened again, years and years later. She was driving to the hospital, alone this time, just after my grandmother — her mother — died, radio on as always, and along comes Mr. Greenbaum again to tell her it's alright. She told me about it when she got home, and I believed her. Still do, because… well. Fast forward another decade or so. I was driving home <em>from</em> the hospital, the day my mom… yeah. I've had the bottom drop out of my stomach a lot, doing this job, but my heart doesn't usually leap into my throat at the same time. After all the weird shit I've seen, I still wasn't ready to hear those distant horns again, but I was goddamn glad when I did. Once I stopped sobbing, and had time to let it sink in. Takes a lot to make me cry, I'm thoroughly shit at it, and gospel rock is <em>not</em> my usual ticket. Nevertheless… I don't know if my mom's still out there somewhere, in some sense, but I'd obviously like to think it's the case. And I'd like to think that she's… happy? So I'm biased. I want this to be real, and that makes me a less than reliable source. But you know what we say in A&amp;R: once is odd, twice is strange, three times is data. As far as I'm concerned, my great-grandmother and my grandmother and my mom all phoned home to let us know they're okay, from wherever it is that they went."</p>

I fell way behind on my work. Completely drained. And then… one night, while I was moping, I turned on the radio just to occupy my mind. I used to crank it up real loud, drown out the… yeah. And this track comes on, almost right away, a sort of weird cloud of guitars and finger-snapping resolving into this halting sing-song, and an awkward harmony, tentative but heartfelt, and I let it play. It resonated, it was… like the music itself was working through something, the way I was working through something, and maybe we could figure out how to do it together. It was imperfect, but maybe that was the point? The perfect is the enemy of the good. And that's just the music; as for the words… well, that was a message. It just simply had to be. "It doesn't matter how bad the situation is, you can still make the best out of it. Keep trying. Put yourself out there. <em>Try.</em> Don't give up on good because you lost something great. There's second chances in every direction, lined up and waiting for you, so all you have to do is… move." So I moved, and you know what? There was something to it. I've kept moving ever since."</td>

Vivian<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Director Vivian Lesley Scout, founding Director of Site-43.</span> had finally died, at the sprightly old age of much younger than I am right now, and I couldn't go to the funeral because of <a href="scp-5616.html">my condition</a>. They had a radio set up so I could listen to the service. When the broadcast ended — and this is the strange part, because it was an internal Foundation broadcast — they played "We'll Meet Again." Viv and I worked together during the war, of course, so we heard that song a lot; he even saw Vera Lynn sing it to the troops once, while he was clearing out an archive in Bengal before the Japanese came through. So yeah, it was his kind of music: of the moment, and historically significant. It wasn't <em>our</em> song, though, not that we… it was never particularly special to the both of us, together. Just one milestone on two long, long trips. So if there's a reason he saw fit to reach beyond the pale and drop it in my lap again, I can't imagine what it was. To be sure there's the whole optimism-in-the-face-of-adversity, hope-for-tomorrow message, the sort of thing that might appeal to, for example, a woman trapped in an incinerator for endless decades, but… that seems too superficial for Viv. And the more direct route is no good either, because I'm not so sure he and I <em>will</em> meet again. I haven't aged since 1944, so natural causes are probably out of the question."</td>

<td colspan="2" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 100%; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px"><strong>Testimony:</strong> "The band is English, as am I, as was my mother. I never returned to England until she was on her deathbed, which I thought had made the maintenance of my cover story simpler; to my surprise, she had largely guessed at the facts of the matter in my absence. There seemed little point in dissimulating, given her condition, so I confirmed them to her in her final moments. Nothing against protocol, you understand. What I told her certainly informed the lyrical intervention which followed, although I will note that there seemed to be details which I did not pass along, suggesting that the dead enjoy a certain expanded clarity or even omniscience which may prove problematic for maintenance of the Veil. In any event: the lyrics to "The Land of Make-Believe" are addressed to dwellers in a realm of fantasy who are unwilling to acknowledge that fact about themselves, underscoring the potential for them to nevertheless overcome their personal difficulties to find happiness. This fantasy-land supposedly occupies an unwarranted amount of space — likely in this context a coded reference to our facility's location beneath indigenous land, one of the details I did not share, and perhaps even the Foundation's ever-growing net around the anomalous world. The concept of organizational secrecy is broached, in nearly direct allusion to the concept of living in the dark so that others might die in the light, and the singer rejects this whole-heartedly. Optimism is expressed that the fantasy-dwellers will nurture hope in their hearts, express it to the universe, and see it flower; they are further exhorted to open their locks and shutters and let the light in, breaking down the boundary between fantasy and reality to create a world where there are no more secrets. Engaging in this process will allow the subject of the song — myself, presumably — to ascend. Finally the singer demands that his audience take this message to the wider world, and surrender to universal love; the overall suggestion is, obviously, the end of consensus normalcy. I'm personally unimpressed with the song's utility for this particular allegory; it's too direct a metaphor, which detracts considerably from conceptual ambiguity of the original message."</td>

Deader than dead. She was facing down the fucking Hanged King in hell city itself, there was literally not one single way she could have survived. She gave herself up to save us — not just her friends, but everyone, everywhere. And you know what? I was not fucking having it. I don't know if it was faith in her, beyond all reason, or just mule-headed stubbornness, but I refused to sign the fucking forms or go to the fucking funeral or talk to her fucking parents — at least not until I had an action plan in mind. I went to a memorial service in Ipperwash Park, under heavy protest, to show the flag, but it just… just pissed me right the fuck off. I wasn't letting go. I went walkabout while everyone was telling sad and funny stories, getting used to the idea that she was gone in exactly the way that I was determined not to do, and I jammed my earbuds in and flicked through the local stations on my handheld. They were all playing Elton fucking John. All of them. Every single station belting out the clearest "Your friend isn't dead" signal I could have possibly asked for. That was the last straw. A few days later I was back in Alagadda, and the day after that we had our Applied Occultist back."</td>

That guitar was like pure sunlight in the gloom, clear as a bell — I suppose their windows were rolled down. No air conditioning. The song seemed kind of impossible, because I recognized a lot of famous voices in there all at once, like a band that couldn't exist in the real world: Dylan and Roy Orbison and at least one Beatle. That's one reason I remember it; the other reason is that when the first car finally got its green light and headed off, another one pulled up that was tuned to the same station."</td>

He knew damn well that I don't like the Eagles. But somehow it didn't matter… I hadn't heard this song before, or if I had, I'd forgotten it; forgettable-ass band, the Eagles. But it definitely helped. With, ah… you know. It helped. The sentiments were saccharine as fuck, but every once in a while it's nice to hear someone say "Hey, you: I hope it works out. I hope you can <em>make it</em> work out." That's my sort of message, even if it <em>is</em> paired with elevator music. I'm all about forcing things not to suck, and people backing me up on that. I thought that was why it resonated with me, but man, I guess I should've known better. Ran a semioacoustic battery on the waveform, just out of habit, and wouldn't you know it? The old bastard managed what looks for all the world like a Euler-Lillihammer Memetic Acceptance Agent from beyond the grave. That's why I sat through a whole goddamn Eagles song. You'd think he could have picked something I actually like? But, then, maybe that was the joke. He did have a good sense of humour, for an old fart. I still miss him a little bit, now and then."</td>

<p><strong>Addendum 6519-2, Potential Confirmation:</strong> Dr. Anastasios Mataxas died of natural causes in 2022 and his successor, Dr. Polyxeni Mataxas, proposed exploiting this occurrence to take spectremetry readings of any resultant SCP-6519 event. Her personal vehicle was fitted with fifteen separate high-sensitivity instruments before she embarked for the funeral, and researchers were dispatched to monitor local broadcast stations for anomalous activity. Audio transcription from Dr. Mataxas' vehicle is provided below, in lieu of a final report to be appended at a later date; initial spectremetry data has been compiled and queued for analysis.</p>

They're predisposed to pattern recognition, hyperpredisposed even. I don't think we have enough data to suggest that this is anything but a pleasant coincidence; if it were real, I'd expect to see way more cases than we have.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> The Euler incident didn't convince you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> The affected station was occupied by <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub" target="_blank">VKTM</a> for a month. That's the memetic equivalent of cross-contamination, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> The Okorie incidents, then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> I'm not predisposed to trust any message supposedly coming out of Corbenic. Especially ones that make sense.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Mataxas sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Maybe there's a ton of examples out there every day, but we never hear about them because most people are as skeptical as you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> You and I both know that most people are gullible idiots. They'd eat this idea up… again, no offence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> We want to believe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> Yeah. Look, if the spectremeter picks up something big, and then we get the go-ahead to canvass the whole Foundation, maybe we'll have something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> I just… ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Secondary Class: Ether. That's what half our damn files say. People are starting to think that's just the standard class for ghost stuff, Mali. It would just… be nice, to get some proof once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> We get proof all the time. What about that <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5729" target="_blank">barn ghost</a> you saw?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Woman can't live on barn ghosts alone. And this one… well, you know. I'd like this one to be legit.</p>
<p><em>[Song continues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> For him.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Wattana sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Doesn't look like you've got it all off your chest, Mali.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> I don't want to—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Just spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> Well, there's also the… tonal discrepancy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Something technical?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> No, sorry, what I mean is… okay. Not a single one of the recorded cases features a spiritual intervention to play something angry or accusatory on the radio. Nothing sexual, even. It's always uplifting stuff, cathartic or cautionary at the worst. What if we're just seeing what we want to — what if these people are <em>hearing</em> what they want to, and <em>not</em> hearing what they don't, and it only looks like a pattern because everyone who doesn't get a relevant piece of music, or does get one they don't like, fails to see it as a message?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> That's one possibility, sure.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> You've got another you like better?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Yeah. I've got another explanation for why these ghosts are only passing on messages of peace and hope, and I definitely like it better.</p>
<p><em>[Song concludes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Radio Host:</strong> That was "The Sticks," by Mother Mother. You're listening to another non-stop music mix on 96.5, "The Vibe."</p>
<p><em>[Song begins.]</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Queued for analysis (2/2).</span></p>
<p><em>[Dr. Mataxas laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Wattana:</strong> You know this one?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> You don't? It was one of his favourites. Journey, 1981.</p>
<p><em>[Song continues]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mataxas:</strong> "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8craCGpgs">Don't Stop Believin'</a>."</p>
<p><em><strong>&lt;Log ends.&gt;</strong></em></p>
