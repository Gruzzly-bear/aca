            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7258</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7258 is currently contained at Site KA-7258 and is surrounded by a three-meter thick titanium wall monitored around the clock by Foundation personnel. Expeditions inside SCP-7258 have been permanently suspended following the incident on ██/██/██ and the deaths of four members of MTF Unit Whiskey-9. Any Foundation personnel found to have entered SCP-7258 without authorization is considered lost and no further attempt to recover them should be made. Any personnel who believe they have seen SCP-7258-1 are mandated to report the sighting to the Site Supervisor.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7258 is a cornfield located in ██████████, Kansas, occupying approximately 198 acres of land. SCP-7258 appears normal from the outside, overhead imaging revealing no structures or clearings within the cornfield. Upon entering SCP-7258 from any direction, individuals will manifest in an alternate version of the cornfield. Exploration of SCP-7258 has revealed the interior to be a spatial anomaly, as Foundation exploration operations found no perceivable end to the rows of corn. Upon a subject entering SCP-7258 by any means, they are transported inside SCP-7258’s spatial anomaly. Whether the space inside SCP-7258 is a ‘pocket’ dimension or something else entirely is unclear.</p>
<p>Any attempts made to physically harm or remove any stalks of corn from SCP-7258 have been ineffective, as the stalks have proven to be immensely resistant to any physical harm. However, it is possible to remove ears of corn from the stalks. Physical analysis of the corn has revealed nothing anomalous or even abnormal about it, and it has proven safe for consumption. After removal, the ears of corn regrow over a period of 60-100 days, remaining consistent with non-anomalous corn.</p>
<p>The Foundation was first made aware of SCP-7258 in ████ when the FBI’s Unusual Incidents Unit turned the case over to the Foundation after three exploration teams were ‘lost’ within SCP-7258. A handful of members from the UIU remain closely involved with Foundation research efforts at Site KA-7258.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Logs:</strong> Numerous expeditions have been made into SCP-7258 with varying SCP-7258 degrees of success.</p>
