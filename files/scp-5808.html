<p>SCP-5808-1 is under the guardianship of Dr. Denis Westbrook, making full containment unnecessary. A monthly medical evaluation is to be performed on SCP-5808-1, followed by an inspection of SCP-5808-2's status. The Foundation's Maximus-507 research satellite is to constantly monitor SCP-5808-2 under the supervision of the Site-51 Astronomical Anomalies Department. Direct testing of SCP-5808 is currently restricted; all tests require direct authorization of Dr. Westbrook and Site-51's director.</p>
<p>If civilian discoveries occur, Foundation assets in the field of astronomy are to cover and/or discredit all findings relating to SCP-5808.</p>
<p><strong>Archived Update 2019/05/22:</strong> O5 Command is currently accepting proposals for the neutralization of SCP-5808-2.</p>

<p>SCP-5808 is an astronomical phenomenon affecting Peter Westbrook (SCP-5808-1) and a lunar satellite that manifested upon its birth.</p>
<p>SCP-5808-1 was born on 2009/08/25 at exactly 12:13:38 GMT, measuring 48 cm and weighing 4.8 kg. Its mother, Researcher Debra Westbrook, died during childbirth with no cause of death determined. SCP-5808-1 shows no anomalous properties other than its connection to SCP-5808-2.</p>

</div>
<p>SCP-5808-2 is a lunar satellite that manifested on 2009/08/25 at exactly 12:13:38 GMT, approximately 20,000 km from Earth. At the time of manifestation SCP-5808-2 measured ~4.8 meters in diameter with a similar radiological composition to Earth I. Annually on August 25, SCP-5808-2 undergoes a rapid expansion in size increasing in magnitude with each year. As of 2019/07/30 SCP-5808-2 measures ~170 meters, which is estimated to increase to ~250 meters on 2019/08/25</p>
<p>Any physical damage occurring to SCP-5808-1 or SCP-5808-2 will directly correlate to damage on the other. The exact means by with SCP-5808 operates is currently unknown but is theorized to be some form of anomalous quantum entanglement.</p>

<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>On 2009/08/25, Dr. Westbrook (Under Director of Astronomical Anomalies Department) confirmed SCP-5808-2's existence moments after it had manifested, during which time his wife, Researcher Westbrook, was giving birth in the Site-51 Medical Wing. The Statistical Analysis Team flagged the event as a statistical anomaly far beyond the chance of naturally occurring. Site-51 was put into temporary lockdown while the situation was analyzed, and SCP-5808-1 was isolated for observation.</p>
<p>A high-speed analysis drone (507/A) was dispatched from the Maximus-507 research satellite to run preliminary tests on SCP-5808-2. Once in range, 507/A deployed a penetrating laser on SCP-5808-2 in order to perform spectral analysis. At the exact moment of impact, SCP-5808-1 received a 3rd-degree burn on its left forearm, bringing an immediate halt to testing. Over the next several weeks low-risk noninvasive testing revealed the nature of SCP-5808 and the current containment procedures were enacted.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neutralization Proposal Summaries</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>Due to its rate of expansion SCP-5808-2 will pose an immediate threat to normalcy. As such, O5 Command has authorized the neutralization of SCP-5808-2, under the condition that SCP-5808-1 is not harmed in the process if possible.<br/>

<strong>O5 Command: <span style="color: firebrick">Denied</span></strong></p>

<h4 id="toc4"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neutralization Event</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>On 2020/01/18, the Astronomical Anomalies Department utilized SCP-████ to remove SCP-5808-2 from the Earth's gravitational influence. Upon activation of the anomaly, SCP-5808-1 received severe bodily damage with a total of 65 broken bones, internal bleeding, ruptured spleen, and brain damage in a manner typically found in high-speed collisions. SCP-5808-2 was moved approximately 1 km before the test was halted due to injuries sustained by SCP-5808-1. SCP-5808-1 was brought to the Site-51 Medical Wing in terminal condition, though Foundation surgeons were able to stabilize it. Two hours after the initial test Dr. Westbrook demanded all staff leave SCP-5808-1's room before shutting down the security cameras and sealing the room with himself and SCP-5808-1 inside. A monitoring device picked up the following recording:</p>

<p><strong>Westbrook:</strong> Hey kiddo… even after all this you're still holdin' on.</p>
<p><strong>Westbrook:</strong> Your mother would be so proud of you; you've been so strong these past 10 years.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Westbrook can be heard lighting a cigarette; SCP-5808-1's monitor continues to beep.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Westbrook:</strong> <em>[Heavy exhale.]</em> A lot stronger than I've ever been. I should've quit years ago… before you were born, before the promotion, before your moth… I just should've made more time for her, for everything. Maybe things would've turned out differently.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>At 13:12:35 GMT, SCP-5808-2 began to steadily increase in size by a rate of .5 meters an hour. Dr. Westbrook isolated himself in his office following the failed neutralization and refused emergency psychological counsel. At 16:30:45 GMT, a security camera registered a single gunshot originating from Dr. Westbrook's office.</p>
<p>SCP-5808-2 instantaneously demanifested at 16:30:45 GMT, effectively neutralizing SCP-5808. This led the Astronomical Anomalies Department to determine Dr. Westbrook to be the unknowing cause of the SCP-5808 phenomenon, prior to self-neutralization. The means by which this occurred is currently being investigated.</p>
