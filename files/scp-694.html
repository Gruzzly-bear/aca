<p>[REDACTED], Vermont. January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2005. 7:23 AM.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-694</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The neighborhood that SCP-694 occupies has been evacuated with a cover story of industrial contamination, and is to be kept sealed off; homes have been purchased from their residents, and used for the establishment of observation sites known as Site-48 extension Security Post-694.<br/>
<span style="color: white"><em>Many years before the Nothing:Something incident…</em></span><br/>
All routes that lead to the chase between SCP-694-1 and SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4 have been closed off, with personnel stationed to re-route drivers away from the anomaly. MTF-Zeta 10 ("Time Travelers") are to stand guard and provide assistance to have public awareness of SCP-694 removed. Any deviations from the standard SCP-694 "script" are to be reported to the site supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-694 is an externally observable time loop that has been cycling every 38 minutes since November 23, 2004, in the town of [REDACTED], Vermont. SCP-694 contains the events of an attempted kidnapping and armed pursuit, followed by a car crash in a ravine alongside [REDACTED] road.</p>
<p>SCP-694 occupies four spherical regions of space, each of which is approximately five meters in diameter and centered on one of the four participants in the loop (SCP-694-1, -2, -3, and -4) as they repeat their original trajectory, beginning at the residence of SCP-694-1 and -2, and terminating at the bottom of the ravine alongside [REDACTED] road.</p>
<p>Although personnel have been able to enter SCP-694, and add and remove objects, there is as of yet no known way to affect the events of the loop (see experiment log for details). Loop participants do not respond to non-loop stimuli (e.g., the presence of Foundation personnel, either as observers or experimenters), and can be assumed to be unaware of any and all non-loop events. When forcibly removed from the space within the loop, participants will continue to repeat the actions of the loop to the extent that this is physically possible, and will die when the loop reaches its terminus; autopsies have thus far not indicated any identifiable cause of death.</p>
<p><strong>Participants in SCP-694:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-694-1: identified as local resident Alexander Lang, aged 52. Caucasian. Listed as widowed, with no immediate family apart from SCP-694-2. No records have been found of SCP-694-1's existence prior to his arrival in Vermont (█/█/1999).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-694-2: identified as local resident Philip Lang, aged 6. Mixed race. Son of SCP-694-1; mother unidentified. No records have been found of SCP-694-2's existence prior to his arrival in Vermont (█/█/1999).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4: unidentified<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> kidnappers; both Caucasian males. Wielding empty handguns (reported stolen November 15, 2004).</li>

<p>Events within SCP-694.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 00:00 - 03:00.</strong> SCP-694-1 emerges from his residence and watches SCP-694-2 play with various toys on the front lawn for 3 minutes. He then tells SCP-694-2 to put away the toys so that they may go to the supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 03:00 - 06:30.</strong> SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4's vehicle (2002 Dodge minivan, black, reported stolen November 20, 2004, bearing the license plate of a 1999 Volkswagen Jetta, reported stolen November 21, 2004) pulls into SCP-694-1's driveway. SCP-694-3 and -4 emerge from the minivan, and hold SCP-694-1 and -2 at gunpoint. SCP-694-3 ties up SCP-694-2 and forces him into the back seat of the vehicle; meanwhile, SCP-694-4 ties up SCP-694-1, then takes SCP-694-1's cellphone and crushes it underfoot. SCP-694-3 and -4 then drive away, with -2 as their prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 07:00 - 19:00</strong> SCP-694-1 struggles to his feet, then hops into his garage and knocks down a hacksaw. He rubs against the blade so as to cut the ropes holding him. Once he has freed himself, he takes a pistol from a tackle box. Meanwhile, SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4 drive around in the neighborhood, but become lost. Notably, although the kidnappers' dialogue at this point seems to indicate that they are encountering multiple spatial anomalies, no such anomalies have been observed by Foundation personnel; rather, the kidnappers' vehicle abruptly changes direction on several occasions, and drives through multiple non-road areas (including a school playground, a farmer's market, and a public park).</p>

<p>One of the roads leading out of [REDACTED], Vermont. Picture taken on: August 24<sup>th</sup>, 2015. 12:48 PM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Time index: 19:00 - 20:00:</strong> SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4 drive past SCP-694-1's home just as SCP-694-1 is emerging from the garage and loading his pistol. SCP-694-1, SCP-694-3, and SCP-694-4 recognize each other; SCP-694-1 opens fire on SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4's minivan, then gets into his car and drives after them as they flee.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 20:00 - 27:00:</strong> SCP-694-1 pursues SCP-694-3 and -4, firing at them repeatedly. Analysis of SCP-694-3 and -4's dialogue during this stage indicates that they are no longer consulting the map; instead, they are driving down random streets in an attempt to escape SCP-694-1.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 27:00 - 27:45:</strong> As the pursuit continues along [REDACTED] Road, SCP-694-1 shoots out the minivan's left rear tire just as the minivan is driving over a patch of ice. The minivan spins out of control, goes through the guardrail, and falls over the ledge and into the ravine. SCP-694-2, SCP-694-3, and SCP-694-4 are killed in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Time index: 27:45 - 34:00:</strong> SCP-694-1 parks his car, gets out, and climbs to the bottom of the ravine. Once he has reached the wreckage of the minivan, he pulls open the driver's side door, and shoots the bodies of SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4 in the head, once each. SCP-694-1 then carefully extracts the body of SCP-694-2 from the wreckage and examines the body for signs of life, while weeping; SCP-694-1 then pulls a notepad out of his back pocket, draws an intricate pattern on its cardboard backing with a stick of chalk, and speaks to the pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transcript of SCP-694-1's speech</strong><br/>
"It's me. I want a repeat of the last thirty-eight minutes. … No, a <em>full</em> repeat. … You heard me! … Well, <em>make</em> it happen, dammit! … EXACTLY LIKE IT JUST WAS! YOU FUCKING OWE ME AND MY BOY IS DEAD! [several seconds pass] Good."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This apparent conversation finishes at time index: 37:15. SCP-694-1 sighs, puts the notepad in his pocket, and begins reloading his pistol. At time index: 37:50, he speaks the phrase "All right, you sons of bitches, here we fucking go," then counts down the remaining 5 seconds.</p>
<p>At time index: 38:00, SCP-694-1, SCP-694-2, SCP-694-3, and SCP-694-4 all dematerialize, as do both vehicles, and all bullets fired by SCP-694-1. The chalk-on-cardboard designs have not been found to manifest any anomalous properties.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Logs:</strong></p>
<h5 id="toc0"><span>Testing Log 694.1:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-694-3 and -4 are extracted at time index = 21:00.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-694-3 and -4 continue behaving as if they are within their vehicle and being pursued; their vehicle drives itself while being pursued, and falls into the ravine at time index = 27:40. Because SCP-694-3 and -4 do not fall into the ravine with their vehicle, they are not killed by the impact; however, they instantly lose consciousness, with electroencephalograms providing a null reading. After descending into the ravine, SCP-694-1 fires two shots into the spaces where SCP-694-3 and -4's heads would be.</p>
<h5 id="toc1"><span>Testing Log 694.2:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-694-1 is extracted at time index = 20:00<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Even when unarmed and restrained by Foundation personnel, SCP-694-1 continues behaving as if he is within his vehicle and conducting an armed pursuit. His vehicle pursues after -3 and -4, with his pistol shooting autonomously at them until they fall into the ravine at time index: 27:40. The pistol then descends into the ravine autonomously, positioned exactly where it would be if SCP-694-1 was carrying it. The front door to the minivan opens autonomously, and the pistol autonomously shoots the corpses of -3 and -4 . The corpse of SCP-694-2 floats out of the back of the minivan in exactly the position where it would be if SCP-694-1 was carrying it. At time index=38 minutes, the vehicles, cadavers,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> weapons, and ammunition all vanish.</p>
<h5 id="toc2"><span>Testing Log 694.3:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The minivan is destroyed with explosives at time index = 04:45.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-694-2, -3 and -4 position themselves in mid-air, where the minivan was, and "drive" away at the speed normally exhibited by the minivan. Non-loop objects placed "inside" the nonexistent minivan are not carried along with it. Bullets fired by SCP-694-1 have been observed to react as if they were impacting a minivan (i.e., slowing and deforming) at the times they enter the space where the minivan would be. At time index = 27:40, SCP-694-2, -3, and -4 all hurl themselves into the ravine and are killed by the fall.</p>
<h5 id="toc3"><span>Testing Log 694.4:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-694-2 is killed at time index = 00:30.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-694-1 continues speaking to SCP-694-2's corpse, telling it to put away its toys so that they may go to the supermarket. Subsequently, SCP-694-3 and SCP-694-4 tie up the corpse, load it into their van, and drive away; SCP-694-4 repeatedly chastises the corpse for making so much noise.</p>
<h5 id="toc4"><span>Testing log 694.5:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The minivan is destroyed with explosives at time index = 27:10<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-694-1 ignores the burning remains of the minivan, parks his car, climbs down into the ravine, fires two shots into the spaces where SCP-694-3 and -4's heads would be, then positions his arms such that he could carry the body of a child out of the back seat of a minivan.</p>
<h5 id="toc5"><span>Testing log 694.6:</span></h5>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The ropes binding SCP-694-1 are cut at time index = 07:30<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-694-1 continues to hold his arms behind his back, hops into the garage, and rubs his wrists against the hacksaw blade until time index = 14:50, cutting himself severely. Cameras planted in SCP-694-1's car indicate that by time index = 23:10, he has lost consciousness (presumably due to blood loss); however, his car and pistol continue the pursuit autonomously as in test 694.2.</p>
