<p>SCP-3606</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3606</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An electrified fence has been erected around the property on which SCP-3606 resides. Small holes along the bottom of the fence are regularly spaced to allow for the ingress of animals. A copse of trees has been planted around SCP-3606 itself for privacy. Humans affected by SCP-3606's attractive effect are to be retrieved, returned to their prior location, and monitored until death.</p>
<p>One live cow at least 500kg in mass is to be delivered to SCP-3606 at 48-hour intervals and sealed in its garage. If possible, the remains of the previous cow should be removed first. It should be noted that due to the effect of climate fluctuations on SCP-3606's anomalous properties, the amount of biomass delivered in a 48-hour period may be reduced by up to 50% if the outside temperature drops below freezing.</p>
<p>Standard supplies for extended residence, as well as writing and art supplies, are to be delivered to SCP-3606-A as necessary; SCP-3606-A may request additional accommodations by contacting SCP-3606's HMCL supervisor. Garbage and other refuse is collected from SCP-3606 twice per week. SCP-3606-A has accepted responsibility for clearing dust and skeletons from SCP-3606 so that personnel may retrieve them.</p>
<p>A stairway and tunnel in SCP-3606's backyard have been constructed to enable access to SCP-3606-B. SCP-3606-A has been told that this structure was built to access an unusual mineral deposit on the property, and must not be provided any information about SCP-3606-B.</p>
<p>While SCP-3606-B does not require active observation, surveillance footage should be collected and reviewed weekly.</p>
<p>Personnel are not to touch SCP-3606-B or remain in SCP-3606 for more than five minutes at a time under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3606 is a two-story house located in rural New Jersey, near █████. Living organisms within the walls of SCP-3606 (with the exception of SCP-3606-A) will rot, decay, or otherwise deteriorate at an accelerated pace, such that damage to such organisms manifests after about seven minutes. Death invariably occurs within twelve hours after decay first presents, regardless of whether the organism is relocated.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum A:</strong> This effect has been observed to slow when the temperature in SCP-3606's vicinity drops below 0°C. Due to the fluctuations of climate in recent years, these periods are less frequent and fluctuations in temperature should be noted for containment procedures.</p>
<p>When the amount of living biomass around SCP-3606 falls below a poorly characterized threshold, its area of effect will extend beyond the boundaries of the house at ~1.3 m/s until a sufficient quantity of such material is within its range, contracting when the total living biomass in the area of effect exceeds the minimum value. Current containment procedures have proven sufficient to prevent SCP-3606's effect from spreading.</p>
<p>Within a range of roughly 35 kilometers, animals whose death is imminent may experience a compulsion to travel to and enter SCP-3606 prior to death, generally dying within seven minutes. While this effect is apparent in most observed animal life, it is most pronounced in birds, which will invariably travel to SCP-3606 to die.</p>
<p>SCP-3606-A is a human male by the name of August Mayes, a resident of SCP-3606 for his entire life. He is notable primarily for his apparent immunity to SCP-3606's anomalous properties and his lack of observed aging since said anomalous properties first manifested. When SCP-3606-A moves more than three meters from SCP-3606, he will fall into a catatonic stupor that will only reverse upon reintroduction to SCP-3606. As these episodes cause SCP-3606-A extreme pain and distress, he is permitted to reside in SCP-3606.</p>

<p>SCP-3606-A experiences regular dreams featuring an individual he refers to as "████████", whose appearance is consistent with that of SCP-3606-B; he also reports experiencing waking hallucinations consistent with these dreams on occasion. SCP-3606-A is obsessed with SCP-3606-B, spending the majority of his spare time producing artistic works that depict SCP-3606-B in some manner, though he frequently expresses dissatisfaction with his works. SCP-3606-A exhibits a variety of intense emotional responses towards SCP-3606-B, most commonly those of love and reverence, though he often has difficulty expressing these emotions or his thoughts on SCP-3606-B.</p>
<p>SCP-3606-B is a humanoid male of indeterminate age located eight meters below SCP-3606's foundation, at the bottom of an apparently natural stone pit. Records from the house's construction make no mention of such a pit, and SCP-3606-A is unaware of SCP-3606-B's presence. SCP-3606-B resides in a stone coffin-shaped depression in the bedrock; imaging indicates the existence of an additional, liquid-filled cavity of indeterminate size beneath this coffin, though this has not been manually confirmed. This liquid also appears to excrete from SCP-3606-B in place of all regular bodily fluids, including saliva, sweat, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Organisms that make physical contact with SCP-3606-B or its excretions (with the exception of SCP-3606-A) will become desiccated and decay rapidly; death occurs within eight seconds, and the body will turn to dust completely within thirty seconds. Standard protective gear has been shown to be sufficient in counteracting this.</p>
<p>While SCP-3606-B is alive, it has shown no need for sustenance, and possesses no higher brain activity. It is fused to the interior of its coffin at several points, with essential organ systems extending at least three meters into the surrounding rock. Extracting SCP-3606-B from its present location is not considered feasible; furthermore, excavation of the area underneath or around SCP-3606-B's coffin carries a significant risk of injuring or killing SCP-3606-B. Samples of SCP-3606-B's excretions and tissue have not returned any anomalous results concerning their exact composition, although the liquid was noted to be "most similar to a slurry of decomposed flesh."</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-3606 was built in 1928, and displayed no apparent anomalous properties until June 18, 1951. On that day, SCP-3606-A's mother and younger sister, both residents of the house, were hospitalized for atypical necrotizing fasciitis;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> this ultimately proved lethal in both cases. Additionally, several minor earthquakes were detected near SCP-3606. SCP-3606-A was 23 years old at the time.</p>
<p>SCP-3606's development of its primary anomalous properties coincided with those of SCP-3606-A, as well as the beginning of SCP-3606-A's dreams of SCP-3606-B. The Foundation became involved within 36 hours, after reports of massive crop and livestock deaths. Eighteen human casualties were recorded before containment was established.</p>
<p>Infrasonic imaging of SCP-3606 and the surrounding property was conducted in 1972, leading to the discovery of the pit under the house; subsequent excavation revealed the existence of SCP-3606-B, which had not been given an SCP designation prior to its discovery. SCP-3606-A expressed surprise when informed of SCP-3606-B's presence and status, claiming to have had no prior knowledge on the matter. This information ultimately proved deleterious to SCP-3606-A's mental stability, and the decision was made to erase it from SCP-3606-A's memory.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following audio interview was recorded on September 13, 1998, and is considered representative of the content of most interviews with SCP-3606-A. Dr. Cabrini and SCP-3606-A conversed on the front porch of SCP-3606.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Good afternoon, August.</p>
<p>[SCP-3606-A does not respond. Scribbling sounds are heard.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> August, I said good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> Yes. Just a moment. It's almost done. I've… I've almost got him. Would you like to see it when it's done?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Of course. I'll wait for you to finish. May I sit?</p>
<p>[SCP-3606-A does not respond but shows no objection to Dr. Cabrini sitting. The scribbling sounds continue for the next 13 minutes of tape before the subject sighs loudly.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Are you finished, August?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> Yes. I think. Why don't the eyes come out right? I want everyone to see them… The way that I see them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> I am going to look at your drawing, August. May I take it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> Yes. Go ahead. You see? They aren't right. They aren't how they're supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> And how are they supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> His… His eyes. They're not like this. They're really dark, but also… incredibly bright. Stars. Water. The abyss. They swallow me. They… devour me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Ah. Very good. What prompted this drawing, August? What was the inspiration today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> I dreamed him again. He was… so much closer this time. Close to me. I was… I was at a picnic with some people… a man and a woman, and a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Would that be your family?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> My what? They… they don't matter. I'm talking about ████████.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Yes, about him. What happened in your dream, at the picnic?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> He… He sat beside me. He was looking down the hill, over the river. I said his name… His… It came out wrong, I couldn't hold it in my mouth. I felt so scared, so excited. And he… he smiled. At me! He was smiling at me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Did the people at the picnic with you see him? Did they talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> What people?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> You just mentioned people at a picnic with you when ████████ sat with you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> He sat with me. I could feel him, he was so close, Doctor. I could feel the heat of his body close to me. The… the cold. But I kept trying to speak, to beg him, pray to him, and nothing would come out right. My voice didn't work. And… [The subject moans loudly, then emits a high-pitched giggle.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> And what happened then, August? In your dream.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> He held out his hands to me… They were cupped, and full of… something. Liquid. Something thick. And I knew… I knew he wanted me to drink it.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> And did you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> Yes. I… I dipped my mouth into his hands. I drank what he offered me. I remember clutching his hands, trying to get it all. It didn't seem like it was going to end.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> Do you remember a taste?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> It was… sweet. But that's all I can say… There aren't words to describe…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> And what happened then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3606-A:</strong> … I… Dissolved. I was falling apart. I melted. I… And he… With me… We both…</p>
<p>[SCP-3606-A's speech becomes incomprehensible.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cabrini:</strong> August? Are you unable to verbalize what happened in the dream? Could you draw a picture for me?</p>
<p>[SCP-3606-A does not answer. No further comment could be elicited from SCP-3606-A for this session. The attached picture in oil pastel was provided after the interview.]</p>
