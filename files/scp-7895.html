<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Personnel assigned to SCP-7895 are to utilize a Foundation-created web crawler to search for keywords relating to SCP-7895 and report findings. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Affected individuals are to be located and mnesticized</span> Testing of affected individuals has revealed mnestic treatment to be ineffective, see <strong>Addendum 7895-T-1</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to maintain an active record on affected individuals, notices are to be sent annually on the first day of June to all known affected individuals inviting them to a gathering on 25 June under the guise of a birthday celebration. Guest logs for these events are to be stored in Site-47's research library. Non-affected Foundation personnel will pose as event staff, caterers, and live entertainment. A team of D-Class personnel will function as event janitors under the direct supervision from Site-47 Lead Custodian Zachary Grant.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7895 is a dream of Fallon, Nevada, USA, (<em>see <strong>Addendum 7895-A-2</strong> for a complete description of SCP-7895</em>). Individuals who experience SCP-7895 will have all memories of their early life, from birth to moving away from their hometown, erased and replaced with memories of being born on 25 June and raised in Fallon, Nevada by a strict-yet-loving family<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. The amount of time an affected individual spent living in their hometown is directly related to the depth of the implanted memories. There have been no accounts of memories that occur prior to four years of age, and only two known affected individuals possess implanted memories up to and including their 25th birthday.</p>
<p>Accompanying the erasure of memories and implanting of false memories is a desire to travel to Fallon in order to be "closer to home<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>." Interviews and research have revealed that this desire is not compulsory, and if an affected individual is incapable of relocating due to financial, physical, geographical, political, or religious reasons, then they will develop a passion for collecting memorabilia, such as photographs and books, about Fallon as mementos from home and samples of pyrite. In either case, SCP-7895 has no negative effect on the physical and mental health or wellbeing of affected individuals.</p>
<p>It should be noted that affected individuals will openly reminisce about their memories with other affected individuals without incident. When asked if it was at all disconcerting to them to have met others with the same life history, they will often regard the interaction as an amusing coincidence.</p>

<p><em>Addendum 7895-A-1: Initial Discovery</em></p>
<p>On 22 December, 2012, Site-47 personnel Research Assistant K. Chandler and Researcher T. Davis were overheard reminiscing about their childhoods in the town of Fallon, NV. The conversation was overheard by a member of the Foundation Inter-Site Human Resources Team who noted that this presented a major contradiction to Chandler's and Davis' personnel files. Human Resources Director's Assistant E. Holt initiated follow-up interviews<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> which indicated that both fully believe that they had been born in, and grown up in, Fallon and have these memories despite our records indicating that Research Assistant Chandler was born and raised in Yonkers, New York, USA, and Researcher Davis was born in Twizel, New Zealand and raised in Perth, Australia.</p>
<p>A selection of other personnel from Site-47 who also claimed to have grown up in Fallon, NV were questioned about their childhood. Out of the 240 questioned, 224 had shared childhood memories. Mentioned examples of implanted memories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I crashed my bike into a parked car just after getting my training wheels off and broke my wrist."
<ul>
<li>87.4% of interviewees share this memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"I contracted chicken pox during childhood."
<ul>
<li>75.1% of interviewees indicate they've contracted chicken pox once.</li>
<li>63.9% of interviewees indicate they've contracted chicken pox twice.</li>
<li>60% of interviewees indicate they've contracted chicken pox three times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"I fell off the bleachers and dislocated my shoulder in fifth grade while trying to impress the boy/girl<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> I had a crush on."
<ul>
<li>58.9% of interviewees share this memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"In Junior High, I contracted <em>shingles</em>, of all damn things, which formed a scar pattern that resembles a scorpion biting its own stinger on my lower-left side. The scar has faded to nothing now."
<ul>
<li>53.4% of interviewees share this memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"And that's when we/I left!"
<ul>
<li>99.6% of interviewees share this memory.
<ul>
<li>67.2% of interviewees indicate leaving in a plural form.</li>
<li>32.4% of interviewees indicate leaving in a singular form.</li>

<em>Addendum 7895-A-2: Narrative Description of SCP-7895</em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Excerpt transcribed from interview with Site-47 Research Director T. Fox. For this interview, RD Fox voluntarily self-administered a small dose of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/updated-amnestics-guide">Class X</a> mnestic in order to have perfect recall of SCP-7895.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, let's see. It starts out with me, standing in the middle of an empty highway that cuts through town, and I'm facing east. On my right is a strip mall with a coffee shop at one end and a pizza joint at the other. On my left is the local telephone/internet company's main headquarters. On the sidewalks around me, there are silver-gold auras, and they're moving around. I start walking forward, and it's a good fifteen or twenty minutes before I reach <em>Maine Street</em>. Yeah, funny thing, that! It's ‘Maine’ as in the state… maybe the city engineers had a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Anyway, I turn to my right to look down the main strip. On the right is the oldest casino in town, and on the left is a pawn shop, computer repair place, coffee shop, movie theater, and so on. There are still no signs of life anywhere to be seen, but the silver-gold auras are here as well. I walk down the center of Maine toward the fountain. <em>Beautiful</em> fountain, too! Hah, I remember, a few months after graduation, me and a few friends filled the fountain with detergent! The next day, the thing foamed up so much that there was a <em>wall</em> of bubbles as high as the buildings! <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>At this point, RD Fox burst into laughter for half a minute.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>Ah, you should have been there! <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Research Assistant O'Toole prompted RD Fox to continue recounting the dream.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>Shit, yeah. Sorry. So, I approach the fountain. The silver-gold auras seem to be gathering here around the fountain. Tied to the spigot of the fountain are three Mylar birthday balloons that read, "Happy 25th Birthday!" I can see my reflection in the balloons, and I seem to be emitting an aura similar to the auras around me. The plaque that hangs on the front retaining wall of the fountain is… open. Like it's the door of a hatch or something, and there's space behind it! I look inside, and sure enough, there's a ladder made of rebar leading down!</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-7895 ends here for 75% of known affected individuals.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>It's a tight squeeze, but I get in there and start descending the ladder. At the bottom of it is a room… like an office or a waiting room? All grey carpeting, white walls, and bright fluorescent lights. There are seven chairs lined up against the wall next to a pretty normal-looking door, and a small table between the fourth and fifth chair. Nobody in here, either. However, there's a framed photo from the 1910s or so of some miners looking up at a giant human male who was restrained in a dark cavern, and above the giant was an eel or a serpent of some kind. I can't remember exactly, but the giant looked like he was in a massive amount of pain and distress. Anyway, so I lie down across a few of the chairs and close my eyes.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-7895 ends here for ~25% of known affected individuals.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, I hear a female voice say, "It sure is a nice night. Look at all the stars glisten and sparkle like flecks of pyrite in a vein of wolframite, just perfect as they are." I open my eyes, and I'm lying on the dirt next to a campfire, and there is a woman sitting in a wooden chair across the fire from me. She's dressed like an old-timey miner and has a bright, blue aura, and there's a lantern with red glass<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> hanging from a hook on the arm of her chair. I say, "What?" She smiles and points up at the sky, and it's so dark overhead that, for a moment, it looks like we were in a cavern! When I look closer, I realize that the stars she's pointing at are all silver-gold auras! Suddenly, I feel something thump lightly against my chest. I reach for it and hold it up to look at it… and it's a piece of pyrite on a leather necklace! That's where the dream ended.</p>

<p><strong>RA B:</strong> Please state your name, date of birth, and birthplace for the record.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Yes. My name is Petar Mihalache. Born on 19 January, 1974, in Fallon, Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> Thank you. What brings you to Fallon?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> I moved to Romania after my seventeenth birthday but found myself with a very empty feeling. However, I felt that it would be unsafe for me to travel given the inaccuracy on my passport. When I finally took my heart in my teeth<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> to move back, it was quite easy.

<p><strong>RA B:</strong> What was inaccurate about your passport?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> My birthplace. It was listed as Constanţa, Romania, but I was not born there.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Fifteen minutes of extraneous footage expunged.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> So, who is your employer?</p>

<p><strong>RA B:</strong> I see. Very lucrative, I'd assume?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> The money is satisfactory, but the benefit we provide to humanity is better.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> The tungsten we mine is used in precision medical equipment.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> That does sound quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Rewarding. Quite so, given that our machinery is zero-emission.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> Zero-emission? Meaning what, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Meaning that the trucks, hammers, mills, and whatnot are not powered on fossil fuels. They just run.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> <em>How?</em></p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> By the power of the gods or something, I don't know! Look, I just work there as a miner and mill operator. I'm not a mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>RA Blackwell:</strong> You mentioned the that the fountain on Maine Street is important. Can you explain, please?</p>
<p><strong>Spencer Holland:</strong> Sure thing. It's one of the most powerful places in Fallon.

Anyway, the last time we set up our interference cameras, we detected something… odd.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> What was it?</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> Well, Jerry was given a new lens filter, and it was red. I figured there's no harm in giving it a shot, right? So, we installed it on the camera up on the roof of the Nugget, and we didn't see anything strange until nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>RA B:</strong> Come on, man. I'm conducting an interview, not watching a YouTube video.</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> Ope, sorry. I just get carried away sometimes. Anyway, when the sun went down, there were a bunch of, like, gold-ish lens flares!

<p>Testing has revealed no permanent improvement resulted from use of amnestic or mnestic treatments.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Addendum 7895-T-2: Lens Composition Testing and Further Usage</em></p>
<p>Chemical analysis performed on the lens sample has revealed that it is comprised primarily of standard glass with a thin film of the following minerals applied to one side via thin-film deposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cinnabar, three parts</li>
<li>Garnet, three parts</li>
<li>Pyrite, two parts</li>
<li>Magnetite, one part</li>

<p>In order to replicate the result mentioned by Mr. Holland, but in a more portable form, researchers have applied the mixture via thin-film deposition to the following appliances. The following is a condensed log of successful applications and the accompanying results:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Foundation-issue Nikon DSLR camera, applied to lens — Photo taken of Site-47 personnel in the Fallon Convention Center courtyard at night during the 2020 annual birthday party for affected individuals. Photo revealed all personnel exhibited strong silver-gold auras in the resultant photograph.</li>
<li>One shard of thin glass suspended over a lit candle — Junior Researcher Holloway and MTF-Y-47 Team Leader Constantin Laradeca exhibited subtle silver-gold auras which were visible to the naked eye.</li>
<li>One carbide lamp, applied to reflector — Junior Researcher Holloway, Research Director Fox, and Research Assistant Blackwell exhibited strong silver-gold auras which were visible to the naked eye.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>06/25/2021 - 21:35<br/>
Good evening Alex,</p>
<p>I would like to formally request a survey be performed around the abandoned dairy farm located at [REDACTED] in order to find the entrance to a cavern system that may lead under Fallon, NV. Thorgrima and I were discussing the end of SCP-7895 at the party (that was an amazing performance of "<em>Bridge Over Troubled Waters</em>" by the way), and we've come to the conclusion that there must be some indication as to the origin of SCP-7895 under the town. We've searched around the fountain, and there wasn't a hatch like our dream indicated, but there has to be <em>something</em>. A recent earthquake toppled one of the old silos at that dairy farm on the southeast corner of town, and we think there may have been a landslide there. I know The Lone Rangers are likely quite busy, but it would be great if they could spare some time to check into this potential lead.</p>
<p>If they are successful in locating an entrance to the caverns, I would like to be with them when they explore the caverns as I have extensive caving skills and would be a valuable asset. Subsequently, I would also like to request the use of the modified carbide lantern from our tests last year. The results yielded similar results to that of <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4359">the Sash Lantern</a>, and it may be able to lead us to something.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,<br/>
RD Fox.</p>

<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">21 July, 2021:</span></em> Team Leader Constantin Laradeca and three other members of MTF-Y-47 ("The Lone Rangers"), assisted by Foundation geologist Blake Lancaster, PhD, were tasked with surveying the former Westin Dairy farm and its surrounding areas. At approximately 2145, a small tunnel was located near the foundation of milk silo which had toppled over. According to Dr. Lancaster, the tunnel is a natural formation which was covered by a steel plate measuring 2x140x200cm. Recent seismological activity caused structural damage to the surrounding structures caused heavy debris to fall, damaging the steel plate and knocking it loose. The tunnel itself has been evaluated and was found to be stable. Upon initial investigation via Foundation-issued ResQ Corp recon drone, the tunnel ran forty meters and stopped at a vertical shaft. MTF-Y-47 cordoned off the abandoned farm in accordance to Protocol-44.5a ("Chemical Spill / Aerosolized Toxins") and placed a GPS tag on the location for future exploration.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">28 July, 2021:</span></em> Team Leader Constantin Laradeca, Agent M. Garrett, and Agent K. Mitchell of MTF-Y-47, assisted by Research Director T. Fox and civilian consultant on Norse Mythology Thorgrima Tjorvidottir, rappelled down the vertical shaft and explored the cave system. Following is a condensed transcript of the exploration footage from the body-worn camera on C. Laradeca. The complete exploration log is on-file in the Site-47 research library.</p>

Fox, an experienced caver, is smoking a cigarette and explaining to Mitchell and Garrett that the temperatures underground may reach below freezing. Tjor is coiling a mass of climbing rope. The camera pans down to reveal the cave entrance. It is approximately 35cm tall by 90cm wide. An audible sigh is heard from Laradeca.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><strong>0524</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Laradeca moves into the open tunnel first. The height of the tunnel remains consistent while the width narrows slightly. Scraping is heard as Laradeca pushes his way through. Ten meters into this tunnel at a downward slope, Laradeca comes to an area where he can get to his knees.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Laradeca:</strong> Shit, that was a tight squeeze. <em>I'm through! Mitchell, you're next followed by Garrett.</em></p>
<p><strong>0531</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Laradeca shines his flashlight into the entrance tunnel. The top of Mitchell's helmet can be seen. His head is turned sideways as to not allow his helmet to become lodged.

<p><strong>0540</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>The party reaches the edge of the vertical shaft. Fox instructs everybody to take a step back and shut off their lights. They all comply while he activates the carbide lamp using its built-in striker. In the glow, Mitchell and Tjor are in frame and begin to exhibit a bright, silver-gold aura. Fox then turns and points the lamp over the vertical shaft and reveals a bright orange directional marker, suspended above the shaft, indicating downward.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><strong>Fox:</strong> As expected, the lamp is now functioning similarly to the Sash Lantern. If my theory is correct, we simply have to follow these markers.</p>
<p><strong>Tjor:</strong> Strange. Fox, I think I've seen something like this before in the Crimson Sash copper mine near Hazen.</p>
<p><strong>Laradeca:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>sigh</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span> Yep. This is exactly like the lantern we picked up in the Ruby Mountains back in '13. Good guess, Fox!</p>
<p><strong>0559</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>Fox and Tjor set climbing anchors into the surrounding rock. Mitchell points out that previous groups had left anchors in the rock.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>

The grate is highly oxidized, and there is a hole in it large enough to fit an arm through. Laradeca moves up to the grate, removes his BWC from its mount, and holds it through the hole in the grating revealing an immense void of darkness.

She sits down on a chair made of large timbers, likely raw pine trunks, and is seen smiling.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span></p>
<p><strong>Unknown female voice:</strong> I see you have a device similar to the lamp that was gifted to me by friend, Jamie Short. I would introduce you to her, but she placed her lifeforce inside the lamp in order to let me see.</p>

<p><strong>Unknown female voice:</strong> It had been so dark for so many years. For a while, the miners would visit and chat with me, but one day, they installed the metal wall you passed through and stopped visiting. They trapped me here and were stealing my joy to power their machines. That day, I thought my joy had died. That was until Jamie visited and told me of a way that I could feel joy again by seeing. She spent several days with me, sharing stories of happiness and joy and sorrow and loss. As she told me these stories, I watched as the joy in her soul grew brilliant to the point that it shined and sparked like pyrite being struck by iron. At the end of those days, she said that she wanted to give me a gift… the gift of more joy, and more lights. She said that more lights will be drawn here as a result of her sacrifice. Oh, how I adore those lights, especially when they gather in clusters. Once a year, I see them gather over in that direction <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[</span><em>The blue light gestures into a segment of darkness.</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">]</span>, and they glow ever brighter. Every year, as Jamie promised, more lights come to that gathering. One day… when I am able to free myself from this void, I would like to attend that gathering.</p>

<p><em>Addendum-7895-Z-2: Excerpt from After Action Report</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Laradeca:</strong> After my BWC died, we spoke with the giant entity for several hours about our lives on the surface, different types of music, celebrations, and technological advances made throughout the hundred-plus years she had been trapped down there. As the giant entity is self-containing, we agreed to not initiate ConProcs at this time. However, we have agreed to meet with her twice a year to check up on her and reassess the potential need for containment.</p>
<p><strong>Laradeca:</strong> We made our way out of the cave system without incident, but I did take a chunk of that damned rock I tripped over.</p>

Okay, it seems to work now. This is Site-47 Technical Director Jason Lautner testing out modification FDS-7895 on our Footnote Dictation Service.

Two were DOA, <em>Rachel Ann Rhodes</em> and <em>Richard Alex Rhodes</em>. Third, <em>Timothy Ian Rhodes</em>, suffered minor injuries. Sources have confirmed this event happened on 21 August, 1996. When police questioned Timothy about the accident, he indicated that the three of them were driving home from visiting their grandmother in Fernley, NV. Shortly after the accident, the Rhodes family relocated to Missouri and went off-the-grid. On a personal note, I envy the forty-five-percenters for not having to live through this experience. <strong><tt>FDS-[RESEARCH DIRECTOR T. FOX. DoB 25 JUN 1980]</tt></strong></div>
