<h3 id="toc0"><span>Special Containment Procedures</span></h3>
<p>With respect to the abatement of <span style="color: #b1dee3">SCP-627</span>, those who are most readily able to cause change are conveniently those who may not, and cannot perceive the full extent of the abstract, indefinite world that lies centrally between the unbreakable floor and impenetrable ceiling of objectivity and abstraction, just outside of baseline conception. It is therefore the duty of the Department of Surrealistics to abate the future formation of irreparable chasms in the noosphere, through which all will be lost.</p>
<p>When everything but true objectivity has been stricken (the primary downstream threat of <span style="color: #b1dee3">SCP-627</span>), only direct observation may remain; one concept, one solution. Such a ludicrously restrictive sphere of universal thought is naturally inconceivable unless experienced, yet when the conditions for its perception are met, nothing will remain. All without a seat in this consequential iteration of <span style="color: #e36b99">“musical chairs”</span> will be left unnamed, unperceived, and unremembered.</p>
<p>In fact, the very phrase, <span style="color: #e36b99">“musical chairs”</span> will be violently ripped from the noosphere.</p>

<div class="notation">
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Description</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #b1dee3">SCP-627</span> is the phenomenon that represents the abscesses in agnostic <span style="color: #b1dee3">“reality”</span> left behind by letters and numerals that form rigid concepts. The relation of these otherwise imperceivable abscesses to the gnostic world controls their aspects, their form, and their destiny, which is, in return, inextricably linked to how they are perceived by those at baseline. Therefore, the use of these tools – often by those who are not and will never be aware of their consequential link to nonstandard reality – shapes the unseen underbelly of the noosphere in a manner that may one day puncture holes therein. These lacerations may grow until the grisly innards of gnostic reality spill into what is unreal, which will then reflect back a truth that cannot be known by those who do not exist in black and white.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>The Exception to the Rule</span></h3>
<p>Numerals have always been a sword held to the neck of the exonoosphere, yet one that must exist for the continuance of gnostic reality. The push and pull of surrealism and realism necessarily results in some areas of concession that must be overlooked, yet the intrinsic peril they pose abated at all costs.</p>
<p>Concepts described using letters shift and change throughout time, as the progression of time carries them along, sometimes in the form of a reluctant child or a tidal wave. The same ideas, the same objects, the same places…all associated with multiple combinations of diverse characters, scrawled on paper, carved in trees, etched into the very fabric of known reality, over and over. What is left, when collated into one overlapping mass is utterly unrecognizable, but when picked apart is essential. This mass, wide and dull and thick weighs heavy on the fabric of conceptuality, yet does not pose a risk to its integrity.</p>
<div class="floatbox">
<p>Unlike many exonoospheric concepts, the idea of such sharpness and dullness may be perceived by those at baseline, though seldom in the way that conveys the true nature of their collective reach. Often, this extends no further than the shape of the characters themselves, which, because this is often consistent throughout numerical systems, typefaces, and styles of script, may even contribute to <span style="color: #b1dee3">SCP-627</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Numbers, when in their purest form, when uncombined with any external meaning beyond their value, are sharp. Their edges hard and thin. Their necessity to the continuance of reality, only made more integral as time wears on stacks more and more weight on a tall, thin tower. Without the softening of their edges and the widening of their breadth, it is inevitable that the fabric of the noosphere will be torn; the lacerations thin yet multitudinous. If this occurrence is permitted, the flood of obligatory rigidity will instead be a slow and agonizing bleed that is yet unfelt by those unaware of what has been punctured in the first place.</p>
<p>Something, something…frogs, boiling water, etc…who cares, it'll be gone anyways.</p>

<h3 id="toc9"><span>Summary</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><em>Numeristic Onto-exo-semantic Overload</em></span> is a means to create a base, so to speak. A wider platform for each numerical tower to rest on. When drilling or cutting wood, it is not rare to place a piece a piece of less consequential material beneath. Its function is, of course, to lessen the chance that the drill or saw may damage what is below. Think of the purposeful widening of the breadth of meaning behind a numerical value as serving a very similar function.</p>

<h3 id="toc10"><span>Implementation</span></h3>
<p>Within this document, examples of the successful implementation of this procedure are included. It must be disclaimed that this is but one of thousands of possibilities of successful use of Abatement Procedure <span style="color: #ffffff"><em>"Numeristic Onto-exo-semantic Overload"</em></span>. Its true beauty, and the source of its effectiveness, is in the breadth of its potentiality. To prevent the descent into a black-white dichotomy, we need not produce only shades of grey — nothing is more effective than bright, vibrant color.</p>

<li><span style="color: #5d3a8c">Seven</span> stands out, perhaps most of all. Sharp, odd, prime, lacking the false sense of evenness enjoyed by <span style="color: #cc371d">five</span>. Nothing is hidden, yet it cannot be. If digits had rudimentary sapience, one would have quite a hard time imagining <span style="color: #5d3a8c">seven</span> as desiring the spotlight.</li>

<li>Purple is historically the color of royalty, truly fitting of such a number so worthy of attention. It's saturated and bright, yet not quite enough to be offensive to the eye.</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="color: #5d3a8c">Seven</span> is thick, heavy velvet — smooth, shiny, and possessing an unmistakable weight if its quality is high.</li>

<p>Seven people scheduled to die that day, one truly innocent. You knew it to be fact, yet you said nothing lest your subjects doubt your legitimacy. When the innocent man dropped, then fell limp, you could almost feel his spirit wrapping itself around your neck. The moment it disappeared was sorrowful. The spirit should have strangled you dead — no true leader allows himself to live through such cowardice.</p>

<li><span style="color: #69dbbf">Eight</span> is the number visually closest to infinity, yet is also similar in color to <span style="color: #7fced4">zero</span>. While not a midpoint numerically, its status as a visual midpoint allows it to claim a similar status within the noosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Its icy green-blue is similar to <span style="color: #7fced4">zero</span>, yet with a more natural, grounded tint. Like a frozen lake known to be murky in the summer. Cold, but possessing more depth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Both its shape and color bring about the imagery of figure skating. Of a time in which one allows the cold to claim them for a while, all for the opportunity to spend time on the ice. Some may consider these to be their halcyon days.</li>

<p>One figure eight across the lake, then two, then three. It hadn't had much time to freeze, but you hadn't fallen through yet. After the eighth, you'd become focused enough to ignore the cracking. Your first jump that day would be your last — perhaps the sourness of your regret would be enough to taste, even from beyond the grave.</p>

<li><span style="color: #e0b62b">Nine</span> is a rather harsh number. There is an intrinsic finality to it, being the final single digit number. Its colorful, eye catching yellow gives the impression of a warning, of something worthy of the attention of all who see it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It maintains a balance of the sharp/dull dichotomy, yet stands on its sharp end. Just as such, the number <span style="color: #e0b62b">nine</span> has an appearance of dull pointedness at the base. Not sharp enough to damage, yet sharp enough to be unmistakably felt.</li>

<li>Despite its finality, it carries with it an anticipatory hopefulness, like that of the sun heralding a new day — one that, if all goes well, will end in a beautiful, multicolored sunset.</li>

<p>He stood her up for a picnic date, just so he could come see me — I felt so lucky, even when my voice was still hoarse the next day. He hid who he was, and I neglected to look closer, but I finally realized it after the first blow to the head. After the ninth, he'd gone back to the bottle, same as always. I tried to call for help, yet only managed to dial the first number before the handset slipped from my blood-soaked hand. Perhaps the next life will be different.</p>
