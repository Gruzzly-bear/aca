<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-9876 is under the jurisdiction of personnel of the ADRX-19-001 project. When not in use, the device is to be stored within a standard storage container at Site-19. No further procedures are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-9876 is the designation given to a man-made device comprised of various gears, levers and pulleys, which are composed out of fossilized osseous tissues of an as-yet unidentified creature. The device measures 2 × 2 × 2 meters and is cuboid in shape. Carbon dating has placed the object's age anywhere between 65 000 000 to 67 000 000 years old.</p>
<p>The main anomalous property of SCP-9876 is, through a series of input commands on the device, the generation of an Einstein-Rosen bridge<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> to, what can only be theorized to be, a pocket dimension.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the interior space of where the portal leads to;<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> what can be ascertained from the outside is that the interior constantly emits concentrated bursts of cosmic microwave background radiation.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 07/20/2025</p>
<p><strong>MTF INVOLVED:</strong> Mobile Task Force Gamma-11 ("Side-Kicks")</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> <em>SCP-9876 was discovered after numerous seismic events took place underneath Site-19. Analyses undertaken of the area beneath could not locate any natural source for these phenomena, and investigative efforts were halted for the time being.</em></p>
<p><em>Two months after initial activity had started, seismic activity measuring at 7.9 on the Richter scale shook the entire site, causing massive structural damage to much of the below ground floors of Site-19. After half an hour, the activities ceased, and a large sinkhole opened up one kilometer away from Site-19. Preliminary observation revealed the sinkhole to have uncovered a previously undocumented series of underground tunnels that led deeper into the earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to the increased risk potential such events could have on operations at Site-19, an MTF unit was tasked with exploring these tunnel systems, in order to ascertain the phenomena's origins.</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;Mobile Task Force Gamma-11 makes their way down through the sinkhole.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Jesus…</em> Hey, Cap, why did it have to be us?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> I mean, why not send a drone here? Wouldn't this sort of exploration be reserved for those kinds of things?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> And risk wasting resources?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(mutters) I feel like I'm worth more than that…</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Gamma-11 settle on top of a knocked over stone pillar. Below them the hole leads further down. There is an opening to a tunnel in the side of the wall. Captain Tom Star shines his light down the tunnel, revealing a winding path that leads further down.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;He gestures for Agent Benn Hindleton to follow. The two venture into the tunnel.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The tunnel is comprised of some sort of rock. Much of the walls, ceiling and floor are withered. Dust settles the entire floor. The agents look around, careful of where they take their next step.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Who do you think built this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> You think it could've been aliens? I mean, how could ancient peoples build such large underground tunnels hundreds of meters below the earth? It must've been aliens!</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Or maybe the ancient peoples had help.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;They venture further into the tunnels. Suddenly, the walls buckle. Dust and debris settle slightly from the ceiling, before seismic activity ceases. The agents resume movement again.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Well, that didn't sound good at all.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;They arrive at a dead end. The wall in front of them is adorned with runes and intricate carvings that have been etched into it. The agents take a closer look.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Woah, Jesus… <em>(laughs)</em> Hey, Cap, look at this!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton shines his flashlight at a portion of the wall. The carvings depict several, what are theorized to represent, humanoid figures underneath some sort of large circular object. The largest humanoid is holding a cuboid object in their hands and are pointing it toward the large object.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Guess you were right with your underground people theory! But that thing above does look like a UFO, so I guess we were both right. But mostly me, because that thing is way larger than your humans down there.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star approaches the wall, eyeing the illuminated section intensely. He reaches out a hand to the wall and feels along its edges.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Umm… hey, what are you doing?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star backs away from the wall. He flips his flashlight and starts to tear chunks away of the wall with the back of his flashlight.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Jesus Christ!</em> Fine! You're <em>way more</em> right with your theory than me! Okay!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;When the dust settles, Cpt. Star shines his light through the hole in the wall to reveal a large chamber behind it. Agent Hindleton stares for a while.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star steps through the hole. Agent Hindleton follows suit.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;They explore the area. Massive stone pillars stand around them, reaching high into the ceiling. More runes adorn these structures, their exact appearance, due to excessive withering, unidentifiable.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;They arrive at the center of the room. There is a cuboid device in the center, positioned within a square hole. The object is slightly off-set in the hole. All stone pillars stand concentric around it. Gears and pulleys within the device manipulate themselves on their own accord.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The agents slowly approach the object.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(kneels in front)</em> Seems to be the cause of the tremors, yes.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Well, shoot! What now?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> We should bring it out of here. Director Reth most likely wants some tests done to it.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> How are we gonna move this thing? That thing looks like it weighs a ton!</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Maybe it isn't as heavy as it looks. Or we could maybe drag it across the floor.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Drag it?</em> That is <em>not</em> an option! I came here to explore some tunnels, not break my back trying to carry that damn thing! I mean, why would the Director even wanna have this?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Because it's from a structure belonging to maybe-ancient-humans, maybe-ancient-aliens. Everything in here could tell us about their culture.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Okay, okay… But shouldn't we get a research team to look at it <em>first</em>? I don't think the Director wants us to bring this <em>behemoth</em> back up, only to contain some eldritch horror or something—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Faint clicking noises emanate from the interior of the device. One of the gears of the object turns.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;There is silence for a while. Then the entire room shakes. The pillars begin to buckle, as large rocky chunks from the ceiling impact the floor. The only area still stable is the center of the room, where the agents rush to.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;They keep close to the device.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Please! I don't wanna die! I've never been to Hong Kong, I never had the want to, but now I really, really do!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star bumps into the side of the device, causing it to align slightly with the outer edges of the hole. The clicking noises spontaneously cease, alongside all other seismic activity. The agents look around, confused.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> I—is… is it… over?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The device moves of its own accord again. Gears and pulleys turn inside of the machine. A faint glow comes from within and above the device.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(yells)</em> Get down!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star knocks both himself and Agent Hindleton to the floor, far away from the device.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;An Einstein-Rosen bridge is created several meters above the device. The portal visually appears as spherical and completely black. It knocks everything in its vicinity away.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;As the portal pulsates above the device, the runes on the surrounding stone pillars begin to emanate a bluish hue. Soon, the device also begins to glow in the same color.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The glowing intensifies. Eventually, the device moves on its own accord again and the portal closes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;It is silent for a while. The two agents finally get up, look at the device, before they quickly vacate the area.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 07/22/2025</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> <em>After the discovery of the tunnel systems, excavation teams, headed by Captain Tom Star, and research teams, headed by Researcher Rita Reth, were deployed to uncover more of the area.</em></p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> What's team B's status?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(wipes sweat off forehead)</em> It's going all right… We uncovered more of those statues and a wall painting, too… <em>(pants)</em> Hey, I think Researcher Reth wanted to talk to you or something…</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> She wouldn't say. Other than that it was "classified". I find that very insulting. <em>(pauses)</em> And, hey, just between us, she's <em>single</em>, so in your position, I would—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;He lets go of him. Agent Hindleton clears his throat.&gt;</em></p>

</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> Researcher Rita Reth. So nice to finally meet you!</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Captain Tom Star of MTF Gamma-11. The pleasure's all mine. I've heard you've requested my presence?</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Yes, exactly. Please, follow me.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth guides Cpt. Star through some tunnels to a large circular chamber. The walls of the chamber are covered in wall paintings. Cpt. Star takes a step closer to admire them.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> Wow… <em>(pauses; points at wall)</em> Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Some sort of tale of the ancient peoples? I'd presume so, yes.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star takes another step closer. He lightly brushes his gloved fingers across the wall.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Now in full view under Cpt. Star's head-mounted light, the wall paintings depict various humanoid figures huddled together, while being surrounded by some sort of black mass.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Another painting shows a singular humanoid figure being in possession of some sort of black orb. The figure holds the orb out to the sky. There are wavy lines emanating from the orb.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The last painting depicts a square object, theorized to be SCP-9876, within a circle, which is further surrounded by three inward-pointing arrow designs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star remains speechless.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> Now, we haven't figured out the text yet. Our Linguistics Department is trying its best to cross-reference it with anything from our database.</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>This is incredible.</em></p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> It is, isn't it? Come on. Take a picture!<br/>

<p><em>&lt;He hesitates, before taking out his mobile phone and pointing it at the wall.

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> What else is there to show me?</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Those paintings had given me an idea. It seems in those, someone is <em>harnessing</em> something to use it for themselves. The orb and the wavy lines?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> My research department has been searching for a solution to a very nasty problem for years. We had tried every avenue, from solar, to thermal, to… <em>nuclear.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;They arrive at a large security door. Rsr. Reth scans in her credentials. The door does not budge, despite proper credentials. Rsr. Reth sighs.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> Sometimes you just gotta give it a little push…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth hits the scanner two times. The door heaves open and the two venture inside.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;They arrive in a large observation room. Rsr. Reth turns the lights on. There are large windows off to the side, with their metallic shudders down.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> The Foundation strives to contain that which can't be understood. Hiding it away in underground bunkers, faraway sites and facilities no ordinary person would ever stumble upon.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;She walks over to a control console and presses a few buttons.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> But how long are these fortresses gonna hold? A few decades? Maybe even the next hundreds of years, if you're optimistic.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The shudders begin to open.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> But <em>recent incidents</em> have shown the threat of the anomalous only rising. Estimations show that there will be a next big containment breach in three decades time, and the Foundation won't have the resources, nor man-power equipped to deal with it. Not with how much it has to juggle. I mean, Site-19 alone contains dozens of city-leveling threats, just waiting for the next big breach!</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Containment is <em>not</em> feasible in the long term. It just <em>isn't.</em> So, the Council opted for another solution. One that has been in the making for decades now…</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> I present to you: ADRX-19-001, or as my department likes to call it…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The shudders are fully open now. Bright light pours into the room. Once settled, the view is that of a massive mechanical hexagonal structure.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> <em>The Decom-Bomb.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star simply stares at ADRX-19-001.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> Through decades of research, and some tissue samples of our <a href="scp-682.html">big mean lizard</a>, we were able to create a device capable of wiping out all anomalous phenomena in the universe, with a pulse large enough to eclipse the observable universe. The weapon to trump all others. <em>The war to end all wars.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star approaches the windows to take in the sight of ADRX-19-001.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> The device, SCP-9876, constantly emits CMB radiation. Although the Council isn't too keen with my department's proposal, I have suggested the harnessing of the energy the device emits. <em>An infinite source of energy.</em> Finally enough to power the <em>Decom-Bomb</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth pours two glasses of wine and walks toward Cpt. Star.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;She hands him a glass of wine. He takes the glass, still in awe.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;She smiles and takes a sip.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>RETH:</strong> To the end of everything. Gone with the anomalous!<br/>

<strong>STAR:</strong> Why show me all of this?</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> We're partners, are we not? And I was <em>way too</em> excited to <em>not</em> finally tell someone. <em>(takes sip)</em><br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Suddenly, the door to the observation chamber slides open. In rolls Director Roig Reth, sitting in his wheelchair, accompanied by security guards. Rsr. Reth and Cpt. Star immediately turn around.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> Destroy the <em>anomalous?</em> Eradicate it <em>completely?</em> Are you <em>insane?!</em></p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> What is so insane about saving the world?</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> Anomalies are a <em>fundamental</em> part of our universe! If you rip the tumor out, god knows you might turn our universe into a primordial soup!</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Better ripping it out than dying slowly.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<p><em>&lt;Rsr. and Dir. Reth stare at each for a moment.&gt;</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;Silence. Dir. Reth appears defeated.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>RETH:</strong> Testing of SCP-9876 will commence on the 27th. It has already been approved by the Council; <em>there is nothing you can do to change that.</em> Now, please, exit the premises at once.<br/>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 07/28/2025</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> <em>Preliminary excavation and exploration efforts of the tunnel system have mapped out approximately 150 kilometers worth of area.</em></p>
<p><em>On July 26th, scanners detected a vast underground cavern 250 kilometers north of Site-19's location behind a closed-off section of the system, with evidence to suggest the presence of man-made structures present within the cavernous space. Therefore, an exploration team consisting of the members of MTFs Gamma-11 and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#zeta-9" target="_blank">Zeta-9</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> was dispatched to gain more insight into the nature and culture of the creators of SCP-9876.</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;Members of MTF ζ-9 are chipping away at a portion of a wall. Agent Hindleton stands nearby.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> So… How long have you been doing this sort of stuff for?</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> I dunno. How long are you gonna keep talkin'?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(gasps)</em> Aren't we on the same team here?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 steps in front of Agent Hindleton and pushes him from Agent ζ9-CAP's location.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>ζ9-1:</strong> The only thing we are is co-workers. We don't need you right now. You just stand pretty in the back and don't say a word. <em>Understood?</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton does not answer. He just stares at ζ9-1.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 smiles, spits on the ground and turns around again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton goes to the back of the tunnel, where Cpt. Star is leaning against the wall. He chuckles to himself.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> Told you they were a-holes.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Yeah…<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-2, who stands a few meters next to them and glares at the two.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>You heard me.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The portion of the wall finally collapses. The ζ-9 team members back away from the wall.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Once the dust has settled, all team members turn on their head-mounted flashlights and venture into the cavernous space.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Although not much can be discerned in the darkness, the flashlights' beams do not illuminate any walls or ceiling, placing the size of the space from anywhere between 500 meters to one kilometer large.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The team members traverse along a rocky path. In the dim light, there is a large structure in the distance.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton looks around the area curiously.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> Take in the sight, agent. We see these types of things e'ery Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-1:</strong> <em>Feel free to be impressed.</em><br/>

<strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> What did you say, <em>agent?</em></p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> I—I…<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star steps in front of him.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>STAR:</strong> He said that we should keep moving forward. We're wasting enough time down here already.<br/>

<p><em>&lt;ζ9-CAP stares at Cpt. Star, before moving on.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star pats Agent Hindleton on the shoulder, before continuing on as well. Agent Hindleton lets out a big sigh.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The team arrives at a large stony gate. The proportions of the gate are estimated to be well over 200 meters in height.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Oh, my God…</em></p>
<p><strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> Let's move on.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;They enter a vast chamber. Stone pillars erect from the floor to the ceiling. Intricate runes and paintings adorn every surface of the structure, all still in pristine condition.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> Looks to be a temple of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-1:</strong> Or a place of sacrifice. Can't have an ancient civilization without sacrifices.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 shines her flashlight up one of the stone pillars. Carved into it is a statue of a humanoid figure, possessing multiple sets of arms and legs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The other team members do so as well and discover more statues of humanoids carved into the pillars.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star shines his light on one of the pillars.

<p><em>&lt;On the far wall, there stands the structure's most opposing feature; a giant stone slab with the depiction of a square engraved upon it.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> <em>Aight</em>, plant the explosives.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 and -2 move over to the slab.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star rushes to them and blocks their path.&gt;</em></p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-1:</strong> <em>(smirks)</em> My job.</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> We've just discovered this area. Why blow it up?</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> <em>Captain,</em> our mission is to gather as much data as possible, which would also mean to figure out what's on the other side of that wall / door, if you can really look.</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> How do we know that there is even anything on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-1:</strong> <em>Move.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 pushes Cpt. Star aside. The two ζ-9 members plant the explosives.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> I'm on Captain Star's side with this one. We don't know if there's anything on the other side and won't we risk caving this whole area in?</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> Not with these explosives, <em>agent.</em> And if you would be so kind, no further input from you. <em>Thanks.</em></p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Really? I thought you Zeta-9 guys were cool! But you're all just a bunch of—</p>
<p><strong>ζ9-CAP:</strong> I said, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>You</em> shut up!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Suddenly, the entire area shakes. All team members cease their movements.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;It is silent for a while. None of the team members utter a word.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>What the hell was that?</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;There is a low droning sound coming from behind the stone slab. The entire area now shakes with greater intensity.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Portions of the ceiling fall down to the ground below, shattering on impact, sending dust and debris flying everywhere. The entire area is at risk of collapsing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The team members quickly get up and rush toward the exit.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-2 trips as the ground shakes, falls and gets crushed underneath falling rubble.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton trips as well, but Cpt. Star rushes to his side and helps him up.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The exit is now partially blocked by debris, only leaving a narrow opening through. ζ9-1 pushes Cpt. Star to the side.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>ζ9-1:</strong> Out of my way!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star stumbles into a hole, similar to the one SCP-9876 had been discovered in. He eyes it curiously, before he quickly gets up again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;ζ9-1 squeezes through the narrow passage. She strains as she is barely able to get through.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Another quake causes the passage to close in on itself, embedding rocky protrusions right through ζ9-1's chest and abdomen. She bleeds out.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton looks all around him.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<p><em>&lt;To the side, ζ9-CAP is sliding through an opening in the wall, exiting the structure. The two agents rush toward it.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;All three of them exit the structure and run to the cavern's exit.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A sinkhole opens up underneath the operatives. Cpt. Star and Agent Hindleton manage to reach the other side in time, but ζ9-CAP falls, just barely managing to hold onto the ledge. ζ9-CAP struggles to lift himself over the ledge.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>STAR:</strong> Don't you think it's a little suspicious—</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> —That whatever awoke did when the <em>Bomb</em> tests began? Of course I am suspicious. But there's not much I can do about it.</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(pauses)</em> Maybe your father was right. Maybe messing with something as fundamental as the anomalous will cause more trouble than it's worth.</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> <em>(agitated)</em> Is that what you think? Because, from the footage, all I see is a giant monster that wants to stop the construction of the Bomb. <em>All the more reason to finish it as soon as possible.</em></p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>Rita</em>, I think we should consider your father's—</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Director Reth is <em>irrelevant</em> to this conversation right now. All that matters is that the Bomb gets finished. <em>End of discussion.</em></p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Listen, what if he's <em>right?</em> Ripping out something so natural as the <em>unnatural?</em> Have you done <em>any</em> tests to confirm that it's safe—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth leans in to Cpt. Star.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>RETH:</strong> My mother and I have waited our entire lives for this. No one will take this away from us. <em>No one.</em><br/>

<strong>P.A. SYSTEM:</strong> Researcher Rita Reth, please arrive at your designated location.<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The P.A. system dies down again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth puts on her lab coat and exits the office. Cpt. Star follows close behind.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The two arrive at the sector. Rsr. Reth scans in her credentials, and they enter the observation chamber.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Shudders are raised, allowing the view onto ADRX-19-001, with SCP-9876 wired directly underneath it.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>RETH:</strong> Only a few more tests and the Decom-Bomb will finally be completed. <em>(speaks into microphone)</em> Start the device up.<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Personnel in full-body suits sign Rsr. Reth a "thumbs up", before manipulating several devices on SCP-9876.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>RETH:</strong> <em>(stares)</em> My greatest achievement. <em>Our</em> greatest achievement.<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star stares out ahead at the device with fear. Electricity acrs through the testing chamber, as ADRX-19-001 trembles under its support beams.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The door to the observation room opens. In comes Dir. Reth. Rsr. Reth audibly sighs.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>RETH:</strong> <em>(grunts)</em> I really can't need you right now—</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> Rita, listen!</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> I'm so tired of listening. So, <em>so</em> tired.</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> Please. Don't end up like your <em>mother.</em></p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> Don't even talk about her.</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> You're right. It was my fault. I—I should've been more careful. Should've been there for you. For <em>her.</em> But, please, stop trying to be like your mother!</p>
<p><strong>RETH:</strong> <em>This</em> is what she would've wanted! I'm completing her life's work, and I <em>don't care</em> what you tell me anymore! This is <em>our</em> achievement!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The portal expands in size, significantly greater than what ADRX-19-001's interior structure is capable of containing. Release of electricity increases in intensity.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star backs off from the window.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> She buried herself in her work, just as much as I did! It's me who didn't assign enough protective layering to the chamber, but it was <em>her decision</em> to continue on when she was told to get out of it!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Electricity arcs across the inner walls of the chamber. Portions of the walls begin to be severely damaged and charred.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Outside the facility, dark storm clouds begin to form over the site.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;An arc of electricity shoots through the observation room's window. Fluctuations in space-time, being emanated by the portal, are detected, temporarily nullifying gravity in the immediate area.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;All free floating objects begin to be rapidly pulled toward the portal.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth holds onto the edge of the shattered windows. She reaches out a hand to Dir. Reth.&gt;</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;Rsr. Reth is unable to maintain her grip and falls into the vortex of the portal. Dir. Reth screams out.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A wave of kinetic energy is released from the portal, pushing all objects away from it.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9876 manipulates and deactivates itself, causing the demanifestation of the portal.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Space-time fluctuations demanifest. The dark clouds dissipate.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star and Dir. Reth fall to the floor.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star looks up at ADRX-19-001, greatly damaged, directly into the portal. Within the pocket dimension, two luminescent orbs can be briefly observed within the vortex, before disappearing again. A low gutteral sound is heard.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>STAR:</strong> It… it all happened so slowly, yet so fast…</p>
<p><strong>KRUG:</strong> Take your time, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(silent)</em> She activated the machine. <em>The Decom-Bomb.</em> That other device…?</p>
<p><strong>KRUG:</strong> You mean SCP-9876?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Yes. <em>That.</em> It activated and created this black hole. Researcher Reth and the Director were arguing, I felt so stupid just standing there, unable to say anything. Come up with saying anything, I mean. Then <em>it</em> happened… <em>(pauses)</em> Maybe I could've <em>saved</em> her if I just would've done something sooner.<br/>

<strong>KRUG:</strong> In your file it says that you had lost your wife two years ago. She had a late night shift at the hospital, you had been on an assignment with SCP-████, so you had called your daughter to drive her back home. Then the <em>accident</em> happened.<br/>

<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>How is this relevant?</em></p>
<p><strong>KRUG:</strong> Captain, there might be a pattern in your thought processes here. You feel extreme guilt for what happened to your wife, so much so that you've taken to living on-site. Perhaps those feelings of guilt are now being reflected on Researcher Reth—</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> What <em>are trying to say here?</em></p>

<p>It has come to our attention that there has been a noticeable increase in poor health of staff members — an increase bordering on forty percent. We are aware of Site-19's status of possessing the highest turn-over and mortality rates compared to any other Foundation facility, but the spike has been too drastic to ignore.</p>
<p>Due to the recent trial experiments of ADRX-19-001 in the area, we suspect a common cause, and expect the issue to be resolved by the project head / Site-Director at once, or a better replacement will be chosen.</p>

<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(silent)</em> Director, why have you ordered me here?</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> I'm giving you some time off. With all that has happened. I want that you spend time with your <em>daughter.</em></p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> But Director, I can't… My duty—</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> —As a <em>father</em> is to take care of your family. How long have you not seen your daughter for? Don't answer it. I imagine the time to have been long. The <em>Council</em> doesn't <em>care</em> for such frivolities. But <em>you should.</em></p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(pauses)</em> What about ADRX-19-001? What about SCP-9876?</p>
<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> The <em>Decom-Bomb</em>, as Rita liked to call it, is near completion. In only three days' time, all anomalous phenomena will be wiped off the face of the universe. <em>Time for all to see their loved ones again.</em><br/>

<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> I have many regrets.

<p><em>&lt;Agent Hindleton is monitoring SCP-9876-α through observation cameras. The entity is completely motionless, only slightly stirring.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;In comes Dr. Imke Homoyodu.&gt;</em></p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> Agent Hindleton?</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> Dr. Imke Homoyodu. Linguistics.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Homoyodu is waving documents around. Agent Hindleton immediately stands up from his chair.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> You translated the runes?</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> As much as was still readable. Take a look.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Homoyodu places the documents on the table.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> Without boring you with the specifics…</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Thank God.</em></p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> … The texts tell the story of a civilization before humanity, <em>heck,</em> before mammals were the <em>dominant species</em> of this planet!</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(rubs head)</em> Wait, you're losing me…</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> Dozens of millions of years ago, presumably in the mesozoic era,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> there was some other race that developed alongside the first dinosaurs; human, non-human, it doesn't matter right now. They lived peacefully together, up until the rise of an entity of the dinosaur race, referred to only in all texts as <em>"the Dark One"</em>.</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> Apparently both races were intelligent; even moreso than modern humans, based on 9876. The Dark One desired to shape the world in its own image, so a war broke out between the two races. Some of these, <em>I'm gonna refer to them as</em> reptiles<em>,</em> joined together with whatever civilization these underground ruins belonged to, and fought on their side.</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> The war lasted for millions of years, with the aligned reptiles building vast underground chambers for this ancient race—</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Like the place below us.</em></p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> —for shelter, as the surface had become a barren, uninhabitable wasteland. But, eventually, the Dark One and its forces had found them. But the race wouldn't give up just yet. With the help of one their most intelligent reptile allies, a figure referred to as "the Guardian", they built a device to seal away the Dark One for good — they were successful.</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> They had trapped the Dark One within an endless expanse of nothingness, where it could take no form and dissolve in this abyss. With their leader gone, the remaining reptile forces were quickly dispatched, at least those, who still wanted to finish what their leader had started.</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> <em>And that's it.</em> Do you see the implications? <em>SCP-9876—</em></p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>—Is that device.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;He holds onto a chair and steadies himself.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(mutters) Holy shit…</em> Holy shit, holy shit, <em>holy shit!</em> Each time we activate 9876, it allows for the Dark One to find its way back into our reality!</p>
<p><strong>HOMOYODU:</strong> <em>The cage won't last forever.</em></p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> We need to tell the Director! <em>Now!</em><br/>

<p><strong>RESEARCHER 2:</strong> Unfortunately not. <em>(coughs) You lucky bastard.</em> I've gotta oversee the activation of the Bomb.

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The shudders open. SCP-9876 is activated. A portal opens, powering ADRX-19-001. The machine is rapidly charging up.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> The Council wanted a weapon built, and in the process, took away everything that I cared for.<br/>

<p><em>&lt;Dir. Reth wipes tears from his eyes as he stares at the machine, resuming.&gt;</em></p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> So I've decided to take away what <em>they</em> care for the most — <em>the human race.</em> I've given parts of myself to the machine, so that it instead targets <em>us</em>, instead of <em>them.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The portal becomes larger. Cpt. Star slams his fists against the console.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;He falls into a coughing fit. He spits out blood that lands on the console. He is trembling.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The portal increases in volume so much so that it is partially eclipsing portions of ADRX-19-001. Objects and massive cables within the chamber begin to levitate.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> <em>(tears up; smiles)</em> You <em>really</em> should've done as I said.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;He winds up for a punch. As he is about to hit the Director, a massive shockwave emanates from ADRX-19-001, knocking both of them back against the wall.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<strong>DIR. RETH:</strong> They've taken <em>everything</em> from us! My wife, my daughter, <em>your</em> daughter! They take and take, and we give up everything! It's not <em>fair! This</em> is <em>fair!</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star inserts the card into the console. After a few swipes, the console processes the request.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star leans against the console and slumps to the floor. His breaths are heavy and raggedy.&gt;</em></p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;It is silent for a while. Only Cpt. Star's strained breaths and the Director's wails are audible.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A low guttural sound emanates from within the portal, shaking the entire sector. Cpt. Star immediately stands back up and looks onto SCP-9876.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The portal has increased to such sizes as to eclipse immense portions of ADRX-19-001. A pair of brightly white shining orbs appear from within the portal, which appear to "blink" once.&gt;</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;An intangible black mass, in the form of a serpentine entity, emerges from out of the portal. Matter is deconstructed upon physical "contact" with the entity, tentatively designated SCP-9876-Ω.&gt;</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;SCP-9876-Ω completely destroys ADRX-19-001. Portions of the area collapse, burying Dir. Reth underneath, who screams out, before all of his vocalizations cease.&gt;</em></p>

<p><em>&lt;As he flies lower into the sinkhole, massive pieces of debris begin to break off from the walls. They nearly hit the helicopter.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Sensors indicate that -Ω has ceased its engagement with -α and is rapidly heading toward LoI-9876. -α roars and follows soon behind, albeit at a slower pace, due to inflicted wounds by -Ω.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star arrives to the bottom of the sinkhole. Members of Nu-7 are already unloading SCP-9876 and rapidly moving to the temple ruins. Cpt. Star follows them.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;They arrive within the temple ruins, now even more withered than before. Cpt. Star looks around and spots the hole. He immediately instructs the Nu-7 members to move SCP-9876 into the hole.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Suddenly, a spire bursts from the sky and hits one of the Nu-7 members. They are immediately deconstructed, leaving no traces behind.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;More black spires manifest from the sky and impact all around the personnel members. All of them take cover. SCP-9876-Ω is rapidly approaching, its howls even audible from such a great distance.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The entire structure slowly collapses. Several members get either crushed or deconstructed. Debris falls around the area of the hole, threatening to seal it shut.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Hesitating for but a moment, Cpt. Star rushes out of his safety spot and pushes his entire weight against the device. It budges slightly.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(grunts)</em> Come on!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;More debris falls, nearly hitting the Captain.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(yells)</em> Come on!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The device is approaching the hole. -Ω is only a few hundred meters away. It roars loudly.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>Come on!</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star grunts and yells all at the same time.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;-Ω breaches through the cavern's and temple's walls. It is only a few meters away from Cpt. Star, nearly making contact with him.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Then -Ω is violently yanked back; -α has caught up with it and is holding onto -Ω's tail with its mouth. -Ω vocalizes loudly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star finally manages to push SCP-9876 into the hole.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A shockwave is emitted by the device. Cpt. Star, SCP-9876-α and -Ω, as well as the structurally less stable portions of the temple are all thrown back. SCP-9876 whirs loudly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The runes on surrounding stone pillars begin to glow in a bright blue hue. SCP-9876 also emanates in the same hue.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;-Ω screeches and thrashes violently, as it gradually begins to lose form. It knocks several surrounding stone pillars to the ground, as it lunges at Cpt. Star.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;-α bites down on -Ω's neck, pulling it back. -Ω attempts to claw itself free, but is futile, as it grows less and less coherent.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Eventually, SCP-9876-Ω gives out one last howl of agony, before it dissipates in a bright flash of blue light into nothingness.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The surrounding area stops buckling. The area settles.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star opens his eyes again, breathing heavily.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-9876-α regains its footing. The entity looks around and stares at Cpt. Star. The entity gives out a low growl, before turning around and disappearing into the ruins of the temple.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;There is nothing but silence and the sounds of debris settling for a while. Then the radio crackles to life.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>(static)</em> You there, Captain?!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star stares blankly ahead. He takes a while to answer.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(silent)</em> Yeah… Yeah. I am.</p>
<p><strong>HINDLETON:</strong> <em>Yes!</em> I knew you could do it! <em>(more distant) I knew he could do it!</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star slumps to the ground and gives out a low chuckle. He looks up at the sky as the dark clouds slowly dissipate.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENTS:</strong> Captain Tom Star was recovered without difficulty. After a thorough search, the whereabouts of the SCP-9876-α entity currently remain undetermined, but the entity is theorized to have taken refuge deeper into the earth.</p>
<p>Former Site-Director Roig Reth was recovered in the rubble. Due to his actions, former Site-Director Roig Reth has been prosecuted by the Ethics Committee for treason of the highest order against not only the SCP Foundation, but humanity as a whole. He will be held at a secure installation until further notice. A replacement to take Roig Reth's former position at Site-19 will be elected at a later date.</p>
<p>Reclassification of SCP-9876 is currently underway. It has been decided by the Board of Directors that the object is to remain in its present location.</p>
<p>As SCP-9876 has been determined to be a threat to the world at large, as its activation poses the risk of unleashing SCP-9876-Ω again, all projects concerning and related to ADRX-19-001 have been cancelled or denied for the forseeable future, until such a time an alternative for SCP-9876 can be found.</p>

<p><em>&lt;Dr. Krug and Cpt. Star sit at a table.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>KRUG:</strong> How are you feeling, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> Never better.</p>
<p><strong>KRUG:</strong> Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>Mm-hm.</em> Change of scenery could be nice, too. Where were they gonna transfer us again? Site-67, was it?</p>
<p><strong>KRUG:</strong> Yes, indeed. But to touch up on the earlier point. <em>How do you feel?</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Krug sighs. He leans back in his chair, reaches into his pocket and pulls out a mobile phone. He slides it to Cpt. Star, who stares at it.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>KRUG:</strong> Make amends, Captain. <em>Call her.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;He takes in a sharp breath. He shifts in his seat uncomfortably and reaches out, hesitating. He looks at Dr. Krug. He just nods at him.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Cpt. Star takes in a deep breath. He takes the phone, dials his daughter's number and closes his eyes.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. Then there is a voice on the other end.&gt;</em></p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>J. STAR:</strong> Hello, Jennifer Star here. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(pauses)</em> Hi, Jen.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;There is silence on the other end. Then the sounds of gasps, sniffs and quiet sobs can be heard. Cpt. Star wipes away a few tears of his.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>J. STAR:</strong> <em>(sobs)</em> I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so sorry, it was all <em>my fault—</em></p>
<p><strong>STAR:</strong> <em>(shushes)</em> It wasn't your fault, Jen. It wasn't.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>&lt;The sobs and sniffs continue.&gt;</em></p>

<strong>J. STAR:</strong> <em>(sniffs; chuckles)</em> We're really breaking the cycle with this one, aren't we?</p>
