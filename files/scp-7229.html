<p>SCP-7229 depicted by Masasumi Ryūsaikanjin in the Kyōka Hyaku Monogatari (狂歌百物語) published in 1853 CE.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7229</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7229 must be kept in a standard enclosure for large primates. Concealed and caged surveillance cameras will monitor SCP-7229 for any unusual activity. Doors leading to the containment area must have remote-activated locks. In the event of a possible containment breach, the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/reach-s-blueprint-folder" target="_blank">Air Integrated Delivery and Saturation System</a> will fill the enclosure with an incapacitation agent. All instances are required to have a subdermal tracking chip implanted in them, and wear a remote-activated shock collar at all times. Interactions must occur remotely by robotic means whenever possible. If direct contact is necessary instances must be heavily sedated. Personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher must not approach the containment area without authorization. In the event instances acquire sensitive information, amnestics must be administered to them.</p>
<p>As ruled by the Ethics Committee, SCP-7229 are permitted to have a Buddhist shrine in their enclosure. However, it will be removed temporarily to punish uncooperative behavior when it is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Personnel are required to have knowledge of Japanese Sign Language. Mobile Task Force Omega-20 ("Thought Police") will assist in containment by providing security, and further facilitate communication with instances. They are also responsible for tracking wild instances, and subduing them from afar with a dart containing intramuscular detomidine and ketamine.</p>
<p>The Information Detraction, Censorship, and Rescission Division will discredit the existence of SCP-7229. Sightings are to be dismissed as hoaxes, and exaggerations of the Japanese macaque. Standard amnestic procedures apply when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7229 refers to a troop of Japanese macaque (<em>Macaca fuscata</em>). Instances are unusually large for their species by measuring over 80 cm tall.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The cause of their excessive growth is unknown. They regularly exhibit a preference for bipedalism rather than move with a quadrupedal gait. The average lifespan of instances is unknown. They do not age significantly in adulthood. Specimens have continued to live past 40 years over the documented lifespan of Japanese macaques.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Despite the lack of aging, other factors can still cause the death of instances such as disease or injury.</p>
<p>SCP-7229 are capable of telepathy with an average range of up to 3 m. They can fluently vocalize the thoughts of a subject, but they are not able to speak when isolated. Subjects do not mutually receive thoughts from SCP-7229, and their autonomy will remain intact.</p>
<p>Instances reproduce similarly to their mundane counterpart. However, the offspring between average Japanese macaques and SCP-7229 will inherit all anomalous characteristics. It has prevented inbreeding from occurring among the contained population of SCP-7229.</p>
<p>SCP-7229 exhibit advanced sapience unlike the rest of their species. They can communicate through sign language, read and write kanji or kana, understand Japanese dialects, use tools, and practice Buddhism. Instances often engage in meditation.</p>
<p>SCP-7229 originate from the Gifu Prefecture of Japan. Typically they remained isolated from humans by inhabiting nearby mountains. Locals eventually referred to instances as <em>Satori</em> (覚; "enlightenment") and incorporated them into regional folklore. During the Second World War, SCP-7229 were nearly neutralized by Imperial Japan (see Addendum 02). Foundation efforts have succesfully managed to contain most of the remaining SCP-7229 population.</p>
<p>There are currently 68 live instances of SCP-7229 in containment.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 01:</strong> Test log of SCP-7229 to ascertain the extent of their telepathy. Specimen SCP-7229-63 was selected for its compliance with personnel, which is the result of it being born in Foundation custody.</p>

<td>Same procedure as the previous test.</td>
<td>SCP-7229-63 began growling and barking like a dog in response to the subject performing the same action. SCP-7229-63 claimed that it was reflecting the hostile thoughts of the subject, which it personally felt no animosity towards. Furthermore, the subject was reported to have also been thinking about its handlers, who SCP-7229-63 was able to successfully identify later.</td>

<p><strong>Addendum 02:</strong> The following documents originate from the Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency (IJAMEA)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and the Imperial Japanese Army Special Medical Force (IJASMF).<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> They were acquired in 1945 after Imperial Japan surrendered to the Allies in World War II. However, some documents were destroyed by order of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and during air raids on Japan by Allied forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Satori</span></strong></p>
<p>The <em>Satori</em> are large and clever monkeys that dwell in the mountains of Japan. They are able to read the minds of whoever approaches them, and repeat their thoughts out loud. This makes catching the Satori difficult. Only a pure mind can approach them with ease, but it is also possible to subdue them from afar. They are creatures of flesh that can be wounded unlike most yōkai.</p>
<p>Satori can potentially serve the empire by sharing the thoughts of our enemies. However, it is difficult to instruct them towards a particular target. They are limited to speaking the thoughts of one person at a time. Assigned handlers must also be familiar with the language of foreigners. Satori born within our facilities can be made more civilized than those from the mountains, which makes them more worthy of becoming members of the Youkai Battalion.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Satori</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Acquire the means to mass produce enlightened soldiers for psychic warfare. Despite the gifted individuals already serving in the Kempeitai,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> they are too few and valuable. Thus we do not have the luxury of experimentation. The current breeding program is too slow to produce sufficient results. Our western enemies have their own spiritually gifted operatives in greater numbers.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> Some are able to see into the minds of our troops, and strike first before they can mobilize. If we are to defend ourselves we must spiritually surpass them.</p>
<p><strong>Assets:</strong> The satori of the mountains will be essential. As primates they are more likely to be compatible with humans than any other yōkai. However, we need a special team to catch them. The Man with the Green Gloves<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> has graciously bestowed upon us some of his enlightened followers. The satori will not be able to sense their minds, and they will bind the creature with an incantation. Research will require many specimens, including humans.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Pending. Unit Negative Numbers is seeking all possibilities with the Satori.</p>

<p>The following texts originate from the journal of Asahi Sato, a scientist for the Jofoku division of the IJASMF. Only fragments were recovered after the war, and Sato was able to evade capture by Allied forces. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">As of writing, his whereabouts remain unknown.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recreated the samples from Ishii's unit.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> Vivisection showed that the satori are vulnerable to plagues like all mortal creatures. It is disappointing. Kappa have more resilience than them. A hybrid with a human will likely not have any physical benefit, but we at least need their spiritual power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The brain is the physical source for the power of the satori. I slowly removed each part until only the head remained. The machines from Tatara did well at keeping the subject alive. It provided me the opportunity to make incisions into the brain until the satori could no longer speak any thoughts before dying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The latest experiment with the satori was disappointing. Despite sharing a spiritual and physical lineage with us, artificial insemination failed to produce a pregnancy for a hybrid. Perhaps they are too enlightened? We will likely have to use the fleshcrafting magic of the Hida Mountain People.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> However, I fear providing abominations with the ability to see into our thoughts. They are already difficult to control without the rest of the ancient texts. Nonetheless, I will submit a request to Tsuchigumo.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have conceived a safe procedure. We will extract the brain of the satori, and attach them to that of a human. If successful, the ability to hear thoughts should be shared between both subjects. Mundane surgery will require a part of the skull to be removed. However, fleshcrafting magic should bind them together with ease. I only require a healthy volunteer and incendiary team on standby.</p>

<p>The following texts originate from the journal of Denji Asano (浅野 伝治), a member of the Tatara division in the IJASMF. In 1945, Asano was acquired by the United States and granted immunity from prosecution. The US Department of Defense refuses to fully disclose his post-war work to the Foundation. However, after the closure of Prometheus Labs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> in 1998, recovered documents indicate Asano assisted the company in revitalizing their "Refurbished Infantry Personnel"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup> The CIA later designated Asano as a defector when he escaped from their custody. He was reported to the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition as a potential threat to national security and consensus reality. Efforts to locate and apprehend Asano are currently underway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The satori are fragile creatures unlike most yōkai. They refuse to wear armor or any clothing. I suggest drilling metal into them to reinforce their bodies. However, how do we maintain their loyalty to the empire? I'm sure the other divisions have already asked themselves the same question. We must make them like machines so they can never resist. I proposed to Isanagi that they become subjects in Project Tetsuo.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> We can turn them into worthy soldiers of espionage. I just hope additional materials can be spared to us. May the skillful Amatsumara<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup> continue to bless my work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have successfully installed a radio transmitter into the brain. Thoughts read by the satori were broadcasted to available receivers, including the ones implanted in human subjects. We can now turn the satori into a remote spy. I just have to severe their tongues and modify the throat to make them silent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently added light defensive measures into some of the satori. One has been implanted with a retractable blade in both of its forearms. They are coated with poison shipped to me from Noborito.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> I'm sure they are eager to witness the effectiveness of the satori.</p>
<p>Another specimen received modified parts of a Nambu pistol near the wrist of its right hand. Unfortunately, there is space only for a single cartridge to be fired. I can add a second barrel with its own chamber, but it is not worth the effort. The enemy will have more ammunition to fire.</p>
<p>I've strongly considered the addition of explosives planted inside them. If the satori become compromised in foreign lands they can be destroyed before the enemy captures them. However, I fear them being misused for bombings instead of espionage. Their spiritual power must not be wasted in such attacks. That must be made clear at Nakano.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sato suggested to me that the satori can be stripped of its frail body for a mechanical one. However, they will lose the ability to be stealthy and require much more metal. Their monkey bodies are already perfect. I suspect Sato is trying to sabotage me to gain Isanagi's favor for himself. It does not matter. Isanagi will recognize my brilliance for assisting the empire. Even the great Amatsumara would appreciate my craftsmanship on elevating these monkeys to a higher purpose.</p>

<p>Illustration from the Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki that reportedly depicts SCP-7229.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 03:</strong> Research by the Department of Mythology and Folkloristics into the possible origin of SCP-7229 has noted discrepancies. SCP-7229 is often conflated with <a href="scp-1000.html">SCP-1000</a> in ancient sources. Notably, in 1779 CE, the Japanese artist Toriyama Seiken depicted SCP-7229 in the book <em>Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki</em> (今昔画図続百鬼; "The Illustrated One Hundred Demons from the Present and the Past"); however, their appearance is modelled after SCP-1000 from the Wakan Sansai Zue (和漢三才図会; lit. "Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia"), which refers to them as <em>Yamako</em> (玃). Furthermore, the Wakan Sansai Zue appears to erroneously attribute the telepathic ability of SCP-7229 to SCP-1000.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-18" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-18')">18</a></sup> The influence of Toriyama's work is believed to have contributed to misidentifications of SCP-7229 throughout the Edo period. Some reports from the Foundation precursor Shūshū-In were affected by the misconception.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 04:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-auras-personnel-file" target="_blank">Dr. Aurora Vesta</a> has proposed a modification to the enclosure of SCP-7229. A section can be converted to simulate a hot spring. Dr. Vesta suggests that it will allow specimens to practice Buddhist purification rituals. They can comfortably bathe themselves without being hosed or confined to a limited space like a barrel. The mood of the oldest specimens may improve. Meanwhile, juveniles born in captivity can also feel indulged, and exhibit less delinquent behavior. The proposal is pending review.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 05:</strong> Interview Log</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7229-63</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Jiro Suzuki, WOLF asset of Mobile Task Force Omega-20 ("Thought Police")</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-7229-63 participated in the interview exclusively in Japanese Sign Language. Meanwhile, Agent Suzuki spoke to it in the Tokyo dialect. Minor telepathic communication was permitted to transcribe statements from SCP-7229-63 with greater accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> I just have some questions for you about the others. Have you been getting along with your elders?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> Yes, they are all wise and kind.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> I'm pleased to hear that. Have they shared with you any stories about the origin of your people?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> I have been told three different tales.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Please share them with me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> The first tale was that the monkey king from the west visited our land, and rested upon the mountain our ancestors dwelled. He shared the teachings of the Buddha, which granted us the path to enlightenment. The second states that it was the Buddha himself. As for the final tale, we descended from the mountain gods that perished when every flower bloomed.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Did you ask why there are contradicting stories?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> Some of them are from different mountains. The eldest of our elders perished long ago. Now none are sure what is true.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Which one do you believe?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> I do not know and it simply does not matter.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> There is no sense in dwelling on the past. It leads one astray from the path of enlightenment. The elders shared that wisdom with me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7229-63 appears pensive.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> Is something troubling you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> The elders have suffered great loss. I do not know what it is like to endure such burden, but they seem to be at peace.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suzuki:</strong> They are all safe here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7229-63:</strong> Perhaps. These walls are not forever.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 06:</strong> Mobile Task Force Mu-3 ("Highest Bidders") raided a warehouse owned by Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd. It contained four instances of SCP-7229 that had each received a lobotomy, and electrodes implanted in their brain. They were connected to machinery that maintained their vitals, which was identified as lost property from Prometheus Labs. Operatives also found a heavily disfigured instance that was still alive. According to recovered documentation it was modified by the Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory (JOICL; Japanese: 日本生類創研)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-19" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-19')">19</a></sup> for the purpose of being worn, and neurologically syncing with the wearer to grant them telepathy. All recovered SCP-7229 instances were euthanized.</p>
<p>Attached are the recovered documents.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Satori Phones are too niche. We only have one client renting them out to get around locked in syndrome. We could probably use them for interrogations, but Carter thinks they are a waste of Prometheus tech. Nonetheless, keep the others alive in case a spare is needed for that client. They are paying good money for them.</p>

<p>The prototype of the Satori Jacket is finally complete. You may feel some discomfort when wearing it for the first time, but it is perfectly safe. I have studied the satori before. The technology of today allows me to properly deliver a vision I once had for them. If you have any feedback please send them to me, but we're ready to make more at your request.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
