<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3832</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3832 is to be kept in a standard secure locker at <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-64">Site-64</a>. A tracking tag has been affixed for ease of recovery during a relocation event. Upon breaching containment, tag monitors are to determine which potential relocation site, and approximately where within said site, SCP-3832 has positioned itself at. The personnel stationed at the corresponding location are to be notified and containment procedures specific to their location are to be enacted.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3832 is a queen-sized bed pillow with an attached Post-It®-brand note depicting a crudely drawn face. The face has been observed changing, within the confines of its art style; however, these changes do not deviate dramatically from the default 'jagged frown' expression and tend to be small additions or the alteration of a single aspect, such as the curvature of the mouth. SCP-3832 is stuffed with goose and Grey Duck down feathers and consistently smells, and feels, as though it has been recently infused with scented fabric softener<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>SCP-3832 has demonstrated itself to be capable of teleportation, which it uses to breach containment. Relocation events occur randomly, though a higher frequency of relocation has been noted to occur when SCP-3832 is being directly observed. This frequency further increases when SCP-3832 is physically restrained. SCP-3832 has only been observed to be capable of teleportation into the interiors of locations it has previously been in, or near to when not in a sealed container. It is currently unknown what requirements exist to designate a new location as a potential relocation site. Current potential relocation sites are Site-64, PRS-Townhouse (where it was recovered) and PRS-Truffle (see incident 3832-NR1). SCP-3832 cannot relocate consecutively; it must initiate an attack before it can relocate again.</p>
<p>Following a relocation event, SCP-3832 is considered to be in an active state. In this state, SCP-3832 will mimic behaviors associated with ambush predators: it will hide itself as best it can (typically in containers or around furniture) and wait for an ambush opportunity to arise. Should an individual come close enough to SCP-3832's position, and there is an unobstructed path between SCP-3832 and its victim, an attack will be triggered. This involves SCP-3832 throwing itself at its victim at low velocities. To date, SCP-3832 has not been observed traveling at speeds capable of directly causing injury, nor at speeds significantly different from those of a human-thrown, non-anomalous pillow. Upon impact with its target, SCP-3832 has been observed to consistently make a "squeak," similar to that of a squeezed dog toy. Following an attack and prior to a relocation event, SCP-3832 is in an inactive state. In this state, it is completely inanimate and can be safely handled as a non-anomalous pillow.</p>
<p>The Post-It® note making up SCP-3832’s face is permanently affixed. Although more resistant to tearing than non-anomalous equivalents, attempting to forcibly remove SCP-3832’s face will immediately trigger a relocation event. The current theory is that SCP-3832 is capable and willing to use teleportation as an escape method if it feels threatened. In order to carry out 'facial adhesion' tests and/or other tests which could damage the face, SCP-3832 must first be cleared for potential neutralization.</p>

<tr>
<td>Behind the television in PRS-Townhouse</td>
<td>Field Agent Gordon Gompton and Field Agent Viola Smythe</td>
<td>After triggering an attack, FA Smythe and FA Gompton apparently began to throw SCP-3832 at each other. According to testimony, SCP-3832 began to make its characteristic squeak with every impact after repeated throwing, and its face had also changed into a significantly happier one. When asked to elaborate, FA Gompton provided a photograph confirming that, during the 'pillow-fight,' SCP-3832's eyebrows had disappeared, and its jagged frown had smoothed out and upturned to resemble a smile. Tests designed to replicate this effect have been unanimously approved by research personnel.</td>

<tr>
<td>Under the desk in Site-64’s Director’s office</td>
<td>Site Director Edgar Holman</td>
<td>SCP-3832 impacted with Director Holman’s shins. SCP-3832 relocated to PRS-Townhouse before research personnel could arrive for recovery. Interaction logged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inside <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3960">SCP-3960</a>’s humanoid containment cell</td>
<td>Senior Researcher Adrien Bleikoff</td>
<td>SCP-3960-4 was instructed by Agent Beatrice Ross to move SCP-3832 to the center of the cell and maintain physical contact. SCP-3832 remained immobile until Dr. Bleikoff entered for recovery, whereupon it launched itself. Due to 3960-4's hold, however, SCP-3832 could not effectively become airborne and only impacted with Dr. Bleikoff's feet. SCP-3832's characteristic impact squeak was notably lower in pitch and drawn teardrops appeared beneath the face's eyes. Interaction and image evidence logged.</td>

<p><strong>Incident 3832-NR1:</strong> The following report details the incident which led to the establishment of PRS-Truffle following SCP-3832's relocation into an on-site janitorial closet 2 days afterwards. PRS-Truffle currently operates under Cover Story-07, "Under New Management." Factory floor tours have been prohibited and civilian accessible areas have been deprived of opaque furniture and containers SCP-3832 would use to conceal itself.</p>
<p>On 02/14/2017, SCP-3832 relocated into the trunk of Big Sister's<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> car while technicians were attempting to fix a glitch with its tracking tag. The car was mobile and departing from Site-64 at the time. Along with SCP-3832's research team, neither Big Sister nor security staff at the gate were aware that SCP-3832 could relocate into mobile containers.</p>
<p>Big Sister arrived at PRS-Truffle, St. John’s Chocolate Factory, to pick up a delivery intended for [REDACTED]. Upon opening the trunk to store the box, SCP-3832 launched itself at Big Sister, colliding with the box in her hands, and propelling the tapered tip of the heart-shaped box into her mouth. After storing SCP-3832 into her trunk and recovering both the dropped goods and tooth fragment, Big Sister contacted the Foundation. A recovery team was dispatched and SCP-3832 was recovered without further incident. Camera footage that captured the event was appropriately doctored. Neither parking garage security nor Big Sister were disciplined.</p>
<p>During the debriefing with SCP-3832's research team, Big Sister shared a photograph she had taken using her cellphone while waiting for the recovery team. The photo has been logged into SCP-3832's research files and has yet to be reproduced under testing conditions. While SCP-3832 was recovered on-site displaying its typical jagged frown expression, Big Sister's photograph clearly shows that, for a brief time, SCP-3832's expression had significantly changed. In the image, SCP-3832's mouth is upturned into a dimpled smile, and its eyes are drawn to appear as cartoon-like hearts.</p>
