<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The former site of Chignik, Alaska.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9212-D</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Decommissioned<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The corpse of SCP-9212-D is kept in Cold Storage Locker 9AB at Site-47. All evidence of SCP-9212-D's existence has been expunged. Former residents of Chignik, Alaska are to be remotely monitored by Department of Continuity operatives.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9212-D was an anomalous humanoid resembling a middle aged Native American male. It was a thaumaturgist capable of teleportation, transfiguration, and spontaneous energy manifestation.</p>
<p>SCP-9212-D's origins are currently unknown. No record of the anomaly existed until March of 2015 — it is unknown if it has manifested previously.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Foundation was first made aware of SCP-9212-D's existence on March 20 2015. Two enforcement officers representing Carrick &amp; Westman<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> were attacked by SCP-9212-D while attempting to evict the residents of Chignik, Alaska, a small town in Alaska's Lake and Peninsula Borough — 63 individuals lived there at the time, 59 of them being of Native American heritage. All residents had been lawfully ordered to leave their homes by the State of Alaska after Carrick &amp; Westman purchased 23.5 square miles of land that encompassed the entire town, intending to redevelop the area as a lakeside hotel resort.</p>
<p>Chignik residents heavily opposed the ruling, with most residents refusing to leave their homes. It was these holdouts that the enforcement officers were attempting to remove. SCP-9212-D approached the two men in a house's front yard, briefly confronted them, then caused the men to spontaneously combust. It then de-manifested. The two men expired ten minutes later.</p>
<p>Foundation field agents embedded within local law enforcement intercepted and amnesticised all witnesses to the incident, and cover story "Fiery Car Crash" was implemented. SCP-9212-D could not be located at the time, and was later classified as Keter.</p>
<p>SCP-9212-D was observed again on April 02 2015 when it transfigured itself into a <em>Ursus arctos</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, and mauled a group of Carrick &amp; Westman developers surveying the surrounding area. One subject expired from fatal injures while two others survived with severe injures. SCP-9212-D reverted back to its humanoid form and cursed at the injured men before de-manifesting. All witnesses and injured parties were amnesticised and the attack blamed on a non-anomalous <em>Ursus arctos</em>.</p>
<p>SCP-9212-D was not located again until April 14 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9212-D.1:</strong> Decommissioning</p>
<p>On April 14 2015, vacated houses on the edge of Chignik began being demolished by a contractor hired by Carrick &amp; Westman, which caused SCP-9212-D to manifest.</p>
<p>The following is a log of the event captured by various video sources. Extraneous footage has been omitted:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 04/14/2015</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Department of Continuity MTF Epsilon-35 "Doorknockers" were stationed within Chignik in preparation of a SCP-9212-D manifestation, which allowed them to respond swiftly to the threat.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>10:19 AM:</strong> Two excavators begin demolishing a home near the shoreline. SCP-9212-D is seen manifesting five metres from the demolition crew. SCP-9212-D approaches the excavators and begins shouting at the operators. They continue the demolishment.</p>
<p><strong>10:22 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D causes one excavator to explode, instantly killing the operator. The remaining crew flee the area. SCP-9212-D then causes the second, now empty, excavator to explode.</p>
<p><strong>10:24 AM:</strong> Responding to the sound of the explosions, the five members of MTF Epsilon-35 begin deployment. They are led by Captain Robert Greene.</p>
<p><strong>10:25 AM:</strong> The contractors flee up a small embankment to their vehicles. Once inside, their doors are presumably locked by SCP-9212-D. All three men spontaneously combust.</p>
<p><strong>10:29 AM:</strong> MTF Epsilon-35 makes contact with SCP-9212-D and attempts to incapacitate it. Two MTF personnel spontaneously combust. SCP-9212-D de-manifests.</p>
<p><strong>10:42 AM:</strong> The remaining members of Epsilon-35 regroup. In an attempt to coax SCP-9212-D into re-manifesting, Cpt. Greene orders that a family of local residents are taken hostage within their home.</p>
<p><strong>10:46 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D re-manifests.</p>
<p><strong>10:48 AM:</strong> MTF personnel attempt to convince SCP-9212-D to allow itself to be contained. The civilian family is threatened as leverage.</p>
<p><strong>11:05 AM:</strong> Negotiations break down. One juvenile is terminated.</p>
<p><strong>11:06 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D causes two MTF personnel to experience cardiac arrest and are terminated. SCP-9212-D is shot twice in its right arm. It then transfigures into a <em>Selasphorus rufus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and flees the area.</p>
<p><strong>11:13 AM:</strong> Cpt. Greene and Agent Bryan Forsyth bind and gag the remaining hostages before calling for reinforcements. They leave the home and begin walking through the town's main street, towards the pier, ordering locals to stay inside their homes at gunpoint.</p>
<p><strong>11:15 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D returns to the home of the hostages and transfigures back to its humanoid form. It frees the bound civilians and then takes a M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle from one of the deceased MTF members. It carries the deceased civilian out of the home and lays them on the grass. It cries over the corpse. The anomaly leaves the area, taking the same route as Greene and Forsyth.</p>
<p><strong>11:25 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D catches the two MTF personnel off-guard and begins to fire at them. Greene and Forsyth take cover behind a pickup truck and return fire. Stray bullets from the firefight break windows and pierce buildings. Three civilians are non-fatally injured.</p>
<p><strong>11:28 AM:</strong> While attempting to switch cover, Agent Forsyth is shot three times in the abdomen by SCP-9212-D and is terminated. Greene flees up the street, now firing from his sidearm. SCP-9212-D pursues him.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The main pier at Chignik Bay.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>11:32 AM:</strong> Greene is cornered near Chignik's pier, where the two again take cover and begin trading fire. SCP-9212-D is grazed in the ear and pauses fire. Greene approaches SCP-9212-D's cover but is ambushed by the anomaly and shot in the left leg. Greene drops his firearm and SCP-9212-D kicks it away.</p>
<p><strong>11:35 AM:</strong> SCP-9212-D attempts to shoot Greene in the right leg but is out of ammo. It chooses to stomp on the Captain's leg until the femur snaps. The anomaly drags the now unconscious Greene across a small beach and dumps him into a rowboat. It ties the Captain's hands behind his back and begins rowing out across the bay.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
</div>
<p>Capt. Greene's body-worn camera then captures the following event:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D slowly rows towards the middle of Chignik Bay. The empty M27 lies at its feet. Cpt. Greene regains consciousness and briefly struggles against the rope.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Let me go.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D does not respond and continues to row.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Untie me and row back to shore. End this right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You're the one who started it.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Allow yourself to be detained and we will guarantee your safety.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Are you even listening to what I'm saying?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> If you cease all hostilities and return me safely, we can-</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D kicks Greene in the chest.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Shut up! You people piss me off. There's no talking with you.</p>
<p><em>Nobody speaks for a beat. The rowing continues.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You didn't have to shoot her. That child had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You- You refused to cooperate, we were under extreme duress. We had to. What about the men you've killed, huh? They had families, daughters like her.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Well, they should've thought of that before coming here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You know, maybe if a guy thinks if he knocks down our homes, somebody'll knock him down. And he'll worry. That'd be something, eh? If I could make them worry?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> We didn't destroy any homes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Why are you here then? You allow them to do this to us. You encourage it. Makes no difference to me.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You're killing people!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> So are you.</p>
<p><em>Greene scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> This is enough.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Enough? This is nothing. This is one town, one company.</p>
<p><em>Greene is silent. SCP-9212-D stops rowing and gazes across the bay.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> All of this will be gone soon. You don't even care. You have no idea what it's like for us, no idea at all.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You think hurting people will solve anything? You're just making it worse for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> As if you'd care either way. You want us to get on our knees and beg? We've been begging and crying for years, and look where that's gotten us.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D nods at the weaponry lying beneath him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> I'm just doing what you're doing, sir. This is me being civilised, I thought you wanted that?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D procures a pocket knife from its jeans.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Or maybe I should scalp you and be a real savage — I should be a real savage, shouldn't I?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Please stop this.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D laughs raucously.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You think this is funny?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> No, no, sir — I don't think this is funny at all. I'm so pissed off you wouldn't believe it. We're all so mad — mad and hurting. This is nothing.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D slashes Greene's cheek with the knife. Greene yells.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Stop! Please, God, listen to me: give up and we'll stop the demolition. Everyone can stay in their homes, I promise you. We'll protect the land.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You don't mean that. We both know you're going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> We won't hurt you if you cooperate, you'd be useful for us. We need you, people like you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> What, to be a soldier? Is that what you think of me?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Please-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Stop speaking.</p>
<p><em>The anomaly's voice is quieter now. It looks grave.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> The time for talking is over — it's been over a long time. You people have to pay. Someone has to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Listen to me-</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D stands up and stamps on the Captain's wounded left leg.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> No, you listen to <em>me</em>! I'm gonna skin all that white fucking skin off your bones! You have no idea-</p>
<p><em>Greene's shoulder-mounted radio suddenly activates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radio:</strong> Kappa-oh-nine zero-one incoming. Initiating two-forty-nine.</p>
<p><em>MTF Kappa-09 had been deployed to assist Epsilon-35 and had arrived in Chignik 7 minutes prior. According to protocol, they had taken roughly 35 citizens hostage and were currently holding them at gunpoint.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Who's that? What are they talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You fucking listen to me, okay? Right now there's a gun to the head of everyone in that little town. Surrender or we'll execute them all.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D looks behind Greene and squints. It is assumed it witnesses MTF activity on land, corroborating Greene's claim.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You wouldn't do that.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> You have no idea what we'd do.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You bastards. You people won't stop, will you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D sits down hard and puts its head in its hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> <em>[crying]</em> You bastards…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> I can't win… I can't win with these people. Lord, what's the point? I just wanted… Oh, God.</p>
<p><em>It sits in silence for a while, sniffling.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> Okay. Take me.</p>
<p><em>The anomaly begins to row back towards Chignik. Six minutes elapse in silence. The boat reaches the shore, where two MTF personnel are waiting with their weapons aimed at SCP-9212-D. Three more members of Kappa-09 are standing along the pier, holding bound civilians at gunpoint. It raises its hands in surrender and exits the boat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9212-D:</strong> You tell me what to do and I'll-</p>
<p><em>SCP-9212-D is shot four times in the chest by one of the MTF Kappa-09 agents. Its corpse crumples into the sand. MTF personnel remove Greene from the boat and transport him to a nearby Foundation outpost to treat his wounds.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-9212-D's corpse was removed from the area two hours later and transported to Site-47 for study, while the corpse of the terminated civilian was transported to Area-809 for experimentation. Cpt. Greene survived his wounds and was praised for following protocol. SCP-9212-D was re-classified as Decommissioned.</p>
<p>All 62 remaining residents of Chignik were administered Class-F amnestics, and relocated to nearby towns and cities in Lake and Peninsula Borough under new names and identities. Chignik was cordoned off for a period of six days while Foundation demolition crews destroyed buildings and terraformed land damaged during the incident. Carrick &amp; Westman later assumed full ownership of the area, with their lakeside resort project being completed in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9212-D.2:</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of Cpt. Greene's body-camera footage connected SCP-9212-D's appearance to that of a 37-year-old Alaskan man named Ron Starblanket, who was reported missing in December of 2011. Before his disappearance, Starblanket displayed no signs of anomalous behaviour.</p>
<p>Starblanket's home was discovered abandoned days after his mother, whom he cared for full-time, passed away. The following note was found within his house:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Mom has died and the Earth has swallowed me whole. Pale devils poisoned her for sixty years and I was the only one left to save her. I failed. I'm sorry, Mom.</p>
<p>Take the food out the cabinets, I won't need them.</p>
<p>Love, Ronny</p>
</div>
<p>It is unknown who this message was left for — Starblanket had no living family, close acquaintances or a romantic partner. Further research revealed that Starblanket's mother was forced to move-in with her son after developing multiple severe health issues due to heavy air and water pollution affecting her former home.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown if Starblanket was SCP-9212-D, and if so, how he gained anomalous properties. Attempts to locate Starblanket are still ongoing.</p>
