            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6035</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6035 is currently secured in a standard high-value storage locker at <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations" target="_blank">Site 73</a>. To prevent possible reactivation of its anomalous properties, it may not be removed from its current location without permission from the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6035 is a vinyl LP of the 1980 album <em>Is This Real?</em> by the punk rock band Wipers. When not activated, SCP-6035 is identical to non-anomalous vinyl records of the same album.</p>
<p>SCP-6035’s anomalous properties manifested when it was placed on any working turntable or other device that is intended for the use of vinyl records. When the first song, titled <em>Return of the Rat</em>, was played, two large anthropomorphic entities resembling common brown rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and carrying electric guitars manifested in the immediate vicinity of SCP-6035. These entities (designated SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B) would then proceed to act out the lyrics of the song in a mostly literal manner, and had elongated human-like arms and legs for this purpose. The subject who activated the record would be periodically interacted with as the song progressed.</p>
<p>Once <em>Return of the Rat</em> concluded, the entities de-manifested and the rest of the record could be played with no anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>Sample SCP-6035 Test:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test Subject:</span> D-53995. Subject is instructed to place SCP-6035 on the testing turntable, play the record, and observe the results.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6035.A: Accidental Neutralization of SCP-6035:</strong> On 22 Oct 2019, SCP-6035 was accidentally neutralized during regular testing.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of a standard test, researchers instructed the test subject (D-46924) to remove SCP-6035 from the testing turntable and immediately replace it with a non-anomalous vinyl of <em>Eight Songs for Greg Sage and The Wipers</em>, a 1992 tribute album consisting of covers of various Wipers songs. Following the conclusion of the third song on the album, a cover of <em>Return of the Rat</em> by the grunge band Nirvana, SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> manifested in the testing chamber. One was wearing a Nirvana-themed shirt and the other a shirt which mimicked the cover art for <em>Is This Real?</em> Both entities then made loud screeching vocalizations at one another in an apparently argumentative manner for the next five minutes.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the argument, the SCP-6035-A/B instance wearing the Nirvana shirt picked up SCP-6035 and threw it against the testing chamber wall. Both instances then slowly walked towards the opposite end of the testing chamber before de-manifesting. Following this event, SCP-6035 displayed no anomalous properties in its subsequent activations; SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B have not appeared since the aforementioned test. SCP-6035 has been reclassified as Neutralized.</p>
