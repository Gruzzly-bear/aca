            <h1>SCP-8365</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8365</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8365 and related artifacts are currently stored in minimal risk long-term archival storage wing of Site-19. No further testing is planned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8365 is a gold “Parker” branded fountain pen formerly owned by the late author Andrew R. Sherman. Its anomalous effects only manifest when a user attempts to write with it. When used, the nib excretes blood with a similar viscosity and appearance to standard red fountain pen ink. DNA testing reveals that the excreted blood always belongs to the person writing with the pen.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which blood is extracted from the writer into the fountain pen’s reservoir is currently unknown, but this process results in discomfort for the holder, increasing in severity as the subject continues to write with it.</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> The specific effects were determined based on testing with two D-class subjects, D-17319 and D-17321, who were both tasked with transcribing “Crime And Punishment” using SCP-8365.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Duration</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 minute</td>
<td>Sensation described as mild discomfort, with both specifically noting an “itching” sensation originating just below the skin. (Pain scale: 1)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5 minutes</td>
<td>Full body discomfort. Subjects are unable to concentrate on verbal instructions but can continue with the assigned task. (Pain scale: 4)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>30 minutes</td>
<td>D-17321 is unable to continue and falls off their chair writhing in pain. Similar descriptions from both test subjects of unbearable fire emerging from their bones (Pain scale: 8).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>38 minutes</td>
<td>D-17319 is unable to continue beyond this point. Subject drops the pen and begins to sob. (Pain level for D-17319 could not be verbally ascertained).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Both test subjects were sent to the infirmary after the conclusion of the test to treat blood loss. All sensations of pain were determined to be purely psychological, with the intensity of the pain reducing back to its original level after the user spends approximately 16-18 hours without handling SCP-8365.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8365 was purchased by ████ ███ (username “fortytwo”) from a yard sale held at Sherman’s former home. A Foundation IRC crawler flagged the following chat logs as a potential descriptor of an anomaly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]<br/>
<strong>dodgethis:</strong> the guy who wrote eternal soul? i actually thought he died a long time ago<br/>
<strong>neartoo:</strong> I remember reading that book in school.<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> yeah, that guy! they were selling a bunch of his old stuff and i grabbed some pens and a couple of his old journal books<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> but this stuff is so old i think it might give me lead poisoning or something<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> i was testing out one of his pens and i think it was actually making me sick lol<br/>
<strong>dodgethis:</strong> maybe the ink is expired or something? does it take like regular pen ink?<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> idk lol, i didn’t refill it or anything, let me check how to unscrew this thing<br/>
<strong>neartoo:</strong> Hope you’re going through all that stuff in a well-ventilated room?<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> oh my god i can smell it<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> i think it’s filled with blood<br/>
<strong>fortytwo:</strong> jesus fucking christ<br/>
[…]</p>

<p>A Foundation field team was dispatched to retrieve SCP-8365, all related artifacts, and administer Class-C amnestics to all civilians with knowledge of SCP-8365. The field team found that Sherman’s wife and son were not aware of SCP-8365’s anomalous effects and therefore did not risk any contact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #1: History</strong></p>
<p>The retrieved journals were analyzed to find more information about SCP-8365’s creation and use. All possible mentions of pens are listed below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>19 February 2004</strong><br/>
Haven’t written anything this whole week. My pen is mocking me. Vince is going to be disappointed again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9 July 2004</strong><br/>
Three years since mum died. Two pages in the last month. Guilt is burning me up from the inside; I deserve it. Trip with the boy tomorrow. Bought fresh notebook and new pen, hope the distance from the city inspires me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>16 July 2004</strong><br/>
Told Vince; reminded me I actually penned most of Eternal Soul right after mum’s death. Wish I was still grieving. Maybe I’m too content now for my own good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 September 2004</strong><br/>
Van Gogh. Sylvia Plath. I’ve become too complacent. Moved on. Wish I was still hurting. Pricked my finger with the pen nib today. Wish darling would understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>23 October 2004</strong><br/>
I feel the sensation in my bones. Don’t know how, but I did it. The pen only writes in red, can't help that. I need this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>12 December 2004</strong><br/>
Darling asking me why I feel so weak so drained so lost every night. Do I tell her about the pen? Perhaps after publication. I need to give myself to the manuscript fully, at least for another year. Perhaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum #2: Additional acquisitions</strong></p>
<p>Out of caution, a Foundation front company also purchased any remaining unsold writing implements and furniture owned by Sherman, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-century desk chair (poor condition; worn out armrests)</li>
<li>Collection of literature (423 English books, mostly fiction and classical)</li>
<li>A slant-top writing desk (containing letter; see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon further scrutiny and testing, none of these objects were found to be anomalous. However, one partially written letter was found in one of the drawers of the writing desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>19 February 2005</strong></p>
<p>Dear Vincent,</p>
<p>I'm writing to you personally because, as my agent for the last five years, you have been nothing but kind and patient with me. I apologize for having never given you anything that quite reached the popularity of Eternal Soul, but it wasn’t for lack of trying.</p>
<p>But I have too much at stake to keep suffering — my wife and my son. They deserve much better from me, and I’m so grateful for allowing me to better myself for them. Perhaps you’ll see too when you have a family of your own.</p>
<p>Maybe a new kind of inspiration will strike me some in other wonderful manner, and when it does, you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew R. Sherman died in a vehicular collision on 21 February 2005.</p>
