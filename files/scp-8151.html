            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8151</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Any external manifestations of SCP-8151 are to be recorded and sent to the Temporal Anomalies wing at Site-34. Foundation personnel who witness manifestations of SCP-8151 may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>, regardless of clearance level, receive amnestic treatment until after the events portrayed either come to pass or are circumvented. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in mandatory amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">D-Class assigned to SCP-8151 locations are to be provided adequate provisions as per Document 422341-CA</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Staff assigned to monitor SCP-8151 locations must be given bi-weekly psychiatric evaluations. Any staff obtaining lower than a 50 on the Düren-Henderssohn Psychological Stability Scale<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> must be reassigned.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">The previous procedure is under review by the Ethics Committee.</span></p>
<p>Personnel assigned to official SCP-8151 locations must comply with all Delphi event regulations, including cooperation with the GOC in disseminating only relevant and necessary information to participating world governments. Due to the often time-restrictive nature of SCP-8151, Foundation emergency response teams are to remain on standby 24 hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8151 is a standard single-hung 24" x 36" domestic window. SCP-8151 can manifest in any enclosed, windowless room up to 15 sq meters in size. It will not manifest in rooms that are not of a standard (rectangular or circular) shape.</p>
<p>Manifestations of SCP-8151 are labeled as "Delphi" events. During Delphi events, SCP-8151 will materialize on a wall within the room, displaying vague, foggy patterns and shapes on the window for approximately five minutes. If a sentient being is not present within that time, the window will de-manifest and the Delphi event will cease. If a sentient being is present, the image outside the window will spontaneously shift to depict a current or near-future tragedy, typically of anomalous origin.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Depictions are highly detailed and graphic, often involving catastrophic loss of life and/or severe harm to human persons.</p>
<p>Prior to 2013, the disasters depicted during Delphi events were determined to be roughly 50% ongoing crises with no possibility for Foundation or GOC intervention that could mitigate damage. The implementation of thaumaturgic spatio-temporal focusing rituals, developed by Dr. Tilda Moose, allowed Foundation thaumaturgists to filter out ongoing disasters and only depict future ones. This also allowed for Foundation thaumaturges to specify certain locations where Delphi events were exponentially more likely to occur. There are currently 18 Sites, with Site-34’s Temporal Anomalies wing being the central location, designated for Delphi events under Foundation control.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1 - Preliminary Trial of SCP-8151:</strong></p>
<p>Before deployment as a full Thaumiel-Class anomaly, SCP-8151 was set to undergo a series of preliminary testing to determine its efficacy and ease of use. Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were promoted to Senior Researchers and tasked with helping to oversee the trials. They were selected for their naturally very high psychological and cognitive resilience.</p>
<p>Parameters for testing were selected to show low potential for loss of life with moderate to severe structural and financial damages. Volunteer D-Class were used as subjects for viewing SCP-8151 during Delphi events.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid">
<p><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test 1:</span></strong></span><br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> Monsoon flooding on Tioman Island, Malaysia<br/>
<strong>Expected Losses:</strong> 15 dead, 7 missing, $3,000,000 USD<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Island and surrounding areas were evacuated fully, protective seawall and storm borders reinforced. Damages not expected to exceed $100,000 USD.<br/>
<strong>Comments:</strong><br/>
<em>Polletta: Finally some recognition around here. About time we started doing something actually useful.</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Just hope that this promotion doesn’t lead to all that extra paperwork.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test 2:</span></strong></span><br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> Very late season tornado striking Columbia, Missouri, US<br/>
<strong>Expected Losses:</strong> 3 dead, $500,000 USD, 1 Foundation Auxiliary Site<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Foundation weather drones deployed. Unexpected cold front dispersed before severe weather could form.<br/>
<strong>Comments:</strong><br/>
<em>Cross: Huh. Wonder why we don’t do that kind of thing more often. It could certainly help a lot of people.</em><br/>
<em>Polletta: Ozzie says the devices are extremely expensive and work in an extremely short range over an extremely short period of time.</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Well that sounds a bit-</em><br/>
<em>Polletta: I swear to God.</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Can’t I have a little fun every now and then?</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Ok, fine. You know, if we keep doing this well, maybe the Foundation will start deploying more drones like these. We could really start saving lives.</em></p>

<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid">
<p><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test 10:</span></strong></span><br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> Minor eruption of Mauna Kea, Hawaii<br/>
<strong>Expected Losses:</strong> 9 dead, $10,000,000 USD, 2 Foundation research outposts, 1 GOC base<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Preemptive negotiations with local thaumaturgic flora and fauna resulted in a redirection of lava flow away from settled areas.<br/>
<strong>Comments:</strong><br/>
<em>Cross: I think we’re starting to get the hang of this.</em><br/>
<em>Polletta: Even the D-Class are getting into it. I heard one of them talking about setting up a schedule so everyone gets a fair share.</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Was it Attleburgh? D-438249?</em><br/>
<em>Polletta: …maybe. Hey, listen, just because he’s weird doesn’t make it invalid!</em><br/>
<em>Cross: Sure, sure.</em></p>

<p>Following a series of successful trials, SCP-8151 was approved for deployment as a Thaumiel-class anomaly.<br/>

<strong>Addendum 2- Record of Major Delphi Events:</strong></p>
<p>Following the ratification of the Treaty of Athens, a research hub was established at Site-34. Senior Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were named as Project Co-leads. The following is a record of major disasters predicted by SCP-8151 at Site-34 up to December 31st, 2017. (Note: this list does not encompass every disaster predicted, only those with high potential for loss of life)</p>

<p><strong>Polletta:</strong> Before we start with our questions, do you have any questions for us?</p>

<p><strong>Polletta:</strong> Are there any external factors that contributed to your decision?</p>
<p><strong>McNamera:</strong> I wasn't sleeping well. My girlfriend said I started randomly crying recently and it freaked her out. It didn't sound like crying, but it looked like it.</p>

<p><em>"Forget what?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Everything. Site-34, the Foundation, everything. We start over, completely. Or it kills us. Either way, we’ll be free."</em></p>
