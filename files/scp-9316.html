<p>The "Hintze Hall" of SCP-9316.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the nature of its location, SCP-9316 is partially contained alongside the rest of SCP-1678. A reinforced electric fence has been constructed along the boarders of SCP-9316 to prevent potential tampering. A line of properties across the "Cromwell Road" district have been converted into Area-9316, where SCP-9316 is remotely monitored from.</p>
<p>Following recent events, all exploration into SCP-9316 is forbidden.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9316 is an approximation of the London Natural History Museum, located exactly 1km below the original. Whilst originally regarded as part of <a href="/scp-1678">SCP-1678</a>, recent findings have warranted for it to receive its own item number.</p>
<p>SCP-9316 follows the same general floor plan as its surface-level counterpart. It is a two-story building, comprised of rooms arranged in a vaguely circular formation. The interior of SCP-9316 is noticeably more ornate than that of the real Natural History Museum; monolithic marble structures are used in place of the more traditional stone bricks. The infrastructure is decorated with intricate carvings and silver inlays. Interestingly, matriarchal imagery is common throughout the structure.</p>
<p>Notably, some sections of SCP-9316 are more homely in design, with carpeted floors and open chandeliers in place of the typical gas lamps. Similar to the rest of SCP-1678, lighting within the museum is unreliable; how it is supplied with a stable flow of oxygen and gas is unknown.</p>
<p>The primary difference between SCP-9316 and the real Natural History Museum is the exhibits. Whilst architecturally similar, they vary wildly in subject matter. In place of the traditional scenes of nature, displays within the museum refer to a variety of creatures, plants, figures and events not recognized by the general public.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The most notable exhibit within the museum is “The Fall of Man”, a collection of displays centring on an ambiguous “apocalypse”.</p>

<p>SCP-9316 was discovered alongside the rest of SCP-1678 on 8/16/1998. The site was quickly marked as a point of interest, however due to the hostile nature of its surroundings exploration was limited.</p>
<p>The first manned expedition into SCP-9316 was lead by MTF Alpha-5 ("Paranaughts") on 3/3/2006. Initial entry proved difficult due to an unusually high density of SCP-1678-A instances throughout the grounds, with the team only able to enter the building after almost an hour of combat.</p>
<p>Once inside the team performed a basic sweep of the structure, noting several discrepancies between the structure and its surface counterpart; a partial list of which can be read below:</p>

<p>A total of 24 manned expeditions were made into SCP-9316. Future missions were planned, with the goal of eventually converting the museum into a Foundation site. However, these have all since been aborted.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9316.2:</strong> Exhibits</p>
<p>Over the many excursions into SCP-9316, researchers have been able to study its various exhibitions in great detail. A list outlining each of the primary exhibits can be read below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E-9316-1</strong></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="horsie.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9316/horsie.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Taxidermy of an unknown creature, often depicted alongside instances of SCP-1678-A.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>AKA: "UnNature"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The purpose of E-9316-1 seems to be showcasing different wildlife found throughout SCP-1678 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJ9arEKQl0">and possibly beyond</a>. At the entrance there are models of a number of recorded entities, including variants of SCP-1678-A in different uniforms, as well as instances of SCP-1678-B in varying states of decay.</p>
<p>Certain bodily features have been shown to be common amongst different species, regardless of kingdom. These include faded colours, emaciated appearances and lack of facial features; it is as if they had adapted to live off minimal amounts of light or nutrients.</p>
<p>One display, labelled "Cortex Worms: Hidden Killers", is comprised of several glass cases, containing a number of rouge-pink slugs. A series of diagrams depict the slugs entering through a person's ear and burrowing inside their brain. Upon inspection, one of the cases was found to be empty.</p>
<p>At its far end, the hall connects to an aquarium-like area, labelled "It Came from the Channel!". Three of the room's walls were comprised of large interconnected fish tanks, host to a variety of aquatic lifeforms. The largest recorded was a seal-like creature with a notably humanoid body plan. It watched Foundation personnel through the glass for several minutes before swimming deeper into the enclosure and out of sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E-9316-2</strong></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:185px;"><img alt="bw2.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9316/bw2.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Recovered daguerreotype. The words "T.T.B. Cira 1850" are written on the back.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>AKA: "Natural Oddities"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> E-9316-2 is decorated with depictions of nature, with various species of plants (some known, some unknown) set up in displays throughout. The taxidermied body of <a href="/scp-1000">a large ape-like creature, with shaggy fur and a hairless face</a>, is stood amongst a group of potted bushes near the entrance.</p>
<p>The exhibit showcases a number of ecofacts with supposed connections to mythological creatures. In one area a complete set of jawbones, roughly 55 inches high, are on display; a plaque on the podium below claims them as having belonged to "The Last Feathered Chinese Dragon."</p>
<p>Several exhibits throughout the museum are noted as having been donated by outside benefactors, however little information is given on the identities of these individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E-9316-3</strong></p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="dino.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9316/dino.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The automaton in its dormant state.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>AKA: "Fossil Animalia"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> As the name suggests, E-9316-3 is almost entirely made up of various animal fossils, many of which are accompanied by model reconstructions. These reconstructions are far more accurate than what would have been achievable in the Victorian era, possessing a number of features that would not be proposed until years later.</p>
<p>In an adjoining room, there stands a life-sized automaton, resembling antiquated depictions of the tyrannosaurus rex. The mechanism within is almost entirely worn down. The only recorded movement has been in the eyes, which are known to follow any individuals that enter the room. There have also been reports of it emitting low growling sounds. Examination revealed its outer layer to be organic in origin, possessing several genetic markers found at other <a href="/scp-1265">anomalous sites</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E-9316-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>AKA: "Ancient Wonders"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> E-9316-4 features a substantial lack of organic displays, compared to other exhibits. Instead, visitors are presented with a variety of artefacts, accompanied by descriptions and images depicting their relation to nature. In one corner there is an array of simple, yet well crafted tools laid out on a table; a painting on the wall above shows group of <a href="/daevite-hub">hooded figures</a> using said tools to tend to various plants, shaped like human body parts.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:195px;"><img alt="bride.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9316/bride.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Marble bust located near the described display. The words "The Final Face of the Mournful Bride" are carved into the podium below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In another corner there stands a suit of armour, ornately decorated with patterns of gold and silver. The make does not resemble those of any known culture. Several additional pieces of metal are arranged behind the main body, positioned as if meant to cover two extra appendages sprouting from the wearer's back. An information board beside the case reads the following:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Once worn by the Archangel Ariel during her last stand against the Scarlet Hordes, this armour was crafted with a level of power and complexity unachievable by the hands of mortal men. It is said that the Eviscerator himself was blinded by its radiance as she plunged her flaming pike deep into the heart of one of his devourers. However, the Legion's ruthless might proved too great even for one as magnificent as her, and she too eventually fell to the blade of the dreaded Guardian of the Gates.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>E-9316-5</strong></p>
<p><strong>AKA: "The Fall of Man"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Unlike the other exhibits within SCP-9316, E-9316-5 does not correlate to any existing areas of the museum above. Instead it is located within a large subbasement, accessible only via a staircase near the back of the building.</p>
<p>A tall square platform stands in the middle of the room, with various displays organised around it. Atop the platform is a large marble statue of a humanoid figure. The figure is depicted as being in the foetal position, with their wrists and ankles cuffed and chained to the platform.</p>
<p>On the wall left of the entryway, there is a framed charcoal sketch of <a href="/scp-4290">a giant humanoid entity, regurgitating black liquid</a> over a village as screaming residents flee. Beside it is an oil painting depicting a pillar of red liquid reaching into the sky, with <a href="/scp-1654">several human bodies levitating around it</a>.</p>
<p>On the wall to the right of the entrance is a collection of clockwork devices of various sizes. Each of their mechanisms are clogged-up with an unidentified organic substance. Artworks on the wall above depict scenes of <a href="/scp-2406">colossal war machines</a>, battling <a href="/scp-2095">emorphous entities of flesh and bone</a>, as well as <a href="/second-hytoth-hub">tall creatures with spiked skin and several sets of eyes</a>.</p>
<p>The far wall is entirely taken up by a single large mural. The mural depicts thousands of people, many with visible injuries, crossing a barren landscape. On the edges of the mural are scenes of ruined cities, with the silhouettes of large entities looming over them. The crowds all join at the centre, surrounding the base of a single tall pillar. An individual stands at the top of the pillar, with their arms outstretched as the people below reach up towards them.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 9316.3:</strong> Incident-9316-A</p>
<p>On 14/07/2022, as researchers were analysing the structure's foundations for potential expansion, a piece of false panelling was disturbed in the floor of SCP-9316's lower basement. Underneath, there was discovered to be a stairwell, connecting the basement to a series of interconnected chambers appearing to predate SCP-9316. MTF Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) were soon gathered to investigate and a copy of their exploration log can be read below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Exploration Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 14/07/2022</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> MTF Zeta-9 were employed to explore a series of previously undocumented chambers underneath SCP-9316. They are accompanied by two members of Area-9316's research staff.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zeta-9-1 - Captain/Team Lead</li>
<li>Zeta-9-2</li>
<li>Zeta-9-3</li>
<li>Zeta-9-4</li>
<li>Dr. Sokov - Resident Parahistorian</li>
<li>Junior Researcher Mariner - Dr. Sokov's Assistant</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>[Begin Log]</p>
<p><em>(The team descend down the stairwell in a single-file line, with Zeta-9-1 and Zeta-9-2 at the front, Zeta-9-3 and Zeta-9-4 at the back and Dr. Sokov and Jr. Researcher Mariner in the middle. As they move further from the entrance shaft, they rely on the flashlights mounted to their firearms to navigate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> …So how far down is this place, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Brief said about sixty metres, so it shouldn't be that much further. There, see that?</p>
<p><em>(The stairwell empties out into a large stone chamber. Six pillars, arranged in two rows of three, reach from the ground to the ceiling, each covered in intricate series of carvings. The chamber is otherwise completely featureless.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The MTF members assume standard defensive positions as they scope out the area. Dr. Sokov breaks away from the group to inspect one of the pillars.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Careful, doctor. I wouldn't advise wandering off until we know for sure this place is empty. How are things looking guys?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-3:</strong> All clear on my end.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Clear.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-4:</strong> Yep, clear for me too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> My apologies madame captain, it's just that these carvings are… Could I get some more light please?</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-3 aims his flashlight at the pillar, illuminating the carvings.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Remarkable… James, come look.</p>
<p><em>(Jr. Researcher Mariner moves to stand beside Dr. Sokov.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> Wow, it's a whole story! And these symbols are so complex, Daevite?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> I don't think so. Here, run your hand along the grooves.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-4:</strong> What is that supposed to prove?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> You can tell a lot about a people from the state of their carvings, miss. Here, see this? Look at the shallow indent, the course texture around the edges…</p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> You're right, these weren't done with metal tools. They'd had to have used just regular rocks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Exactly! These people, whomever they were, carved out these pillars, most likely the entire complex. It would have taken them years, decades maybe, working practically by hand. That's how much they cared, cared about… whatever's down here.</p>
<p><em>(For the next ten minutes Dr. Sokov and Jr. Researcher Mariner analyse each individual pillar, as the Zeta-9 members take photos. Logs cut for brevity.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Eventually the team gather around a rectangular doorway on the far side of the chamber.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Everyone here? Good, heading in.</p>
<p><em>(The second chamber is nearly identical to the first, however instead of pillars there is a large cylindrical platform in the centre of the space.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Looks like some kind of ritual chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> It is, and that means there must be… Yes, over there!</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Sokov gestures to the right. Zeta-9-2 moves his flashlight in the same direction, casting light onto a small square podium. Dr. Sokov, Jr. Researcher Mariner, Zeta-9-1 and Zeta-9-2 walk over, as Zeta-9-3 and Zeta-9-4 inspect the platform.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> I was right, look at these.</p>
<p><em>(An array of what appear to be rudimentary tools are laid out across the podium. Dr. Sokov inspects one, before handing it to Zeta-9-2.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Just a sharpened rock.</p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> I just don't understand, how could they have done all of this if they didn't even have proper tools? And what does any of this have to do with the museum?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> My boy, the first rule of being a historian is that you have to get used to not having all the answers. However in this instance, I think it's safe to say there may be other forces at work.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-3:</strong> Captain, take a look at this.</p>
<p>(Zeta-9-1 walks over to where Zeta-9-3 and Zeta-9-4 are standing, with the other three following behind. Zeta-9-4 points her flashlight down, illuminating a series of lines, carved along the edge of the platform.)</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Thaumaturgy?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-3:</strong> Looks like it, but our scanners aren't picking up on any residual energy. Doctor, any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> It's… interesting. It's the right layout, but far too simple for any branch I know of. Unless…</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-4:</strong> Unless what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Well, location can often be just as important as iconography.</p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> You think being so far underground might have had something to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> That's the working theory at least.</p>
<p><em>(The team continue to inspect the platform for another 12 minutes, before moving on to the next chamber. The third chamber is similar to the other two, however beyond the entrance are two thin cylindrical posts. The tops of each post are divided into three separate plates.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Okay, that's interesting.</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 reaches out to feel one of the posts. She puts more force onto one of the plates, causing it to rotate.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Looks like some kind of puzzle, but for what?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-4:</strong> Uh, I think it's for that.</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-4 points her flashlight across the room. Like the previous chambers, there is a doorway on the far wall, however it is blocked by two large stone panels.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Hold on, there's something on here.</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-2 crouches to inspect the plates.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Little symbols, carved into the sides.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> So maybe if we line them all up it'll open?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> That's the idea.</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 and Zeta-9-2 rotate the plates on their respective posts. The doors remain shut.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Hmm, maybe we're meant to do it at the same time?</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 and Zeta-9-2 pull the top plates back.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Alright. Three, two, one…</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 and Zeta-9-2 slot the plates back into place at the same time. A low grinding noise can be heard as the stone panels slowly begin to pull back.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Dr. Sokov begins to approach the opening doors.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Incredible! This kind of engineering… It challenges everything we know about past technology!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Look doctor, I get your enthusiasm but I think it would be best if you let us scope it out first.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Don't worry captain, I'm simply admiring the craftsmansh-</p>
<p><em>(As the doors reach their fully opened state, a series of loud clicking noises can be heard emanating from the chamber beyond.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Don't love that.</p>
<p><em>(As the noises continue, a long object can be seen coming through the doorway, slowly sliding across the floor. It resembles a large insect leg, approximately 60cm in diameter with black leathery skin and several joints along its length. At the end of the appendage is a large curved point, resembling a claw or a stinger.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> What in the-</p>
<p><em>(A second identical appendage suddenly comes out of the darkness, slamming on the ground. Vision is briefly obscured by the resultant dust cloud.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sokov:</strong> Oh-!</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Sokov attempts to back away, however the first appendage rapidly moves, impaling him in the chest and lifting him into the air.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jr. Researcher Mariner:</strong> DOCTOR SOKOV!</p>
<p><em>(Jr. Researcher Mariner suddenly dashes forward. Before another team member can pull him back, the second appendage springs up and hits him in the side at high speed, knocking him into the air. A loud cracking noise can be heard as he impacts the wall, before collapsing limp on the ground.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Goddamn it! Open fire!</p>
<p><em>(All members of Zeta-9 open fire, with minimal effect. The first appendage is drawn back into the chamber, still carrying Dr. Sokov's limp body. Two more emerge in its place, with all three beginning to swipe at the team.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-4:</strong> Our bullets are barely doing anything!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> If in doubt, use a flash!</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 takes a flash grenade from off her harness and throws it towards the doorway. Upon detonation, high-pitched screeching noises can be heard as the appendages begin to move more erratically, seemingly in distress.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> That did something! Alright, everyone on my mark!</p>
<p><em>(Zeta-9-1 throws another flash grenade. On detonation, the team once again opens fire. More screeching can be heard, as the appendages quickly retreat back through the doorway. Zeta-9-3 and Zeta-9-4 rush to rearrange the plates on the posts, resealing the doorway.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-3:</strong> Alright!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-2:</strong> Captain, we're losing this guy!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-9-1:</strong> Ah shit, hang in there kid!</p>

<p>Following extraction, Junior Researcher Mariner was rushed to receive medical attention at Site-44 and is currently in stable condition. Dr. Sokov's body is yet to be recovered.</p>
