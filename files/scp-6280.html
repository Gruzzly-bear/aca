<p>SCP-6280 is secured within a low-priority storage locker in Site-77. The object shall remain inside a fully opaque envelope at all times, except during testing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="toc2"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></span></h3>
<p>SCP-6280 is an object with a strong memetic effect, which influences human perception on a highly individual basis. The object is described differently by all observers; in some cases even a single individual may give conflicting descriptions if exposed to the object more than once. As a result, the exact physical properties of SCP-6280 are unknown. For example, any attempt to record its size results in conflicting measurements, even if taken at the same time and with identical equipment.</p>
<p>The one exception is the composition of the object, which has remained consistent every time it has been analyzed. Therefore, it has been deemed that SCP-6280 consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A canvas, which has been recorded to be anywhere between 5x7 cm and 32x48 cm in size.</li>
<li>Oil paint, which has been applied to said canvas. There has been, however, no consistency in the identified pigments.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, it can be assumed the object is a painting. This is an assumption which matches all descriptions reported by observers. The contents of said painting are, however, likewise dependent on individual perception. Subjects report a wide array of art styles, techniques, and color palettes. Despite this, all observers agree that the painting is in a state of incompletion.</p>
<p>The object has a weak compulsion which causes observers to become interested in examining it with care. During this process, observers may begin experimenting foreign thoughts which interject their own inner thought process. These manifest as sentences in either Dutch, French or broken German. This effect occurs even for subjects who do not possess an active inner speech, and these subjects will be capable of understanding the thoughts despite not speaking said languages. Observers will also not recognize these thoughts as foreign until they have ceased looking at the object.</p>
<p>The memetic effects of SCP-6280 can, in some cases, extend to items which are perceived as linked to the object. Most notably, if the object is displayed next to a museum label, the contents of said label will likewise be perceived idiosyncratically. This effect ceases as soon as the subject stops simultaneously observing both the label and SCP-6280. Therefore, no exact information such as title or year of publication can be obtained by this approach. The one exception is authorship, as the object will invariably be attributed to Dutch painter Johannes Van Hedel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup><br/>

<p>The following is a list of different interpretations of SCP-6280, as perceived by observers. A CRD (Cognitive Recording Device) was used to document each subject's individual perception of the object, as well as the thoughts that manifested during exposure. Said thoughts were accordingly translated.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Assessing the roles of cultural and individual factors in idiosyncratic appraisal and interpretation of anart</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><strong>Experimentation Methodology Overview:</strong></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><strong>Section B.2: Civilian exposure to SCP-6280.</strong> The object will be part of the exposition to be held at Cambridge University. During the initial setup, the object is to be the third painting in order of exposure. Afterwards, the daily rotation proposed in section A.1 shall be followed closely, as to avoid order effects bias.</p>
<p>The non-invasive CRD provided to each subject shall record the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conscious, and unconscious attitude towards the object, both measured using the Glass-Heiden scale.</li>
<li>The subject's individual visual perception of the object. This shall be analyzed closely to determine factors such as style, and technique. For details see section C.3.</li>
<li>In accordance with SCP-6280 testing protocols, manifested thoughts shall also be recorded, despite them not being of further relevance for the aim of this paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results shall be paired to the archetypal personality profile of the subject obtained in section B.1, and to the results given in their survey detailed in section B.4.</p>
<p>In accordance with civilian exposure protocols, redundant safety measures are to be included to account for the nature of SCP-6280. These are to include monitoring of vitals, memetic transmission (waves type K and V), and eye movement pattern (clusters A,H and J). For details, see section B.2.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><strong>Specific Aims:</strong></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><strong>Specific Aim 4: Usage of SCP-6280.</strong> Out of the various objects that I had shortlisted as candidates, I am convinced SCP-6280 is the best option. Although SCP-6280 is not the only piece of anart which both influences and is influenced by spectators, the effect in its case is rather prominent. The object has been shown to manifest a wide array of styles from the modern and contemporary periods. Additionally, the current test samples provided in the file have all taken place with observers who belong to Eurocentric cultures. But limited testing with subjects of non-Eurocentric descent have shown potential for more variety in how the painting shall manifest. I believe this is of utmost importance, given the diversity in the pool of subjects I aim to procure.</p>
<p>Lastly, although not the main objective of the paper, I believe the reactive nature of the object could unveil new discoveries, were it to be exposed to a larger audience. It has already begun to display changes in recent years following a larger number of tests. For example, the completion percentage of the perceived painting continues to rise slowly. A significant increase in spectators could yield further changes to the behavior of the object.</p>
<p>If so, my main aim is to continue experimenting with the object to further study how a higher visibility affects it.</p>

<p>Greetings, Dr. Amanda</p>
<p>I have a query regarding the entry for SCP-6280 I have linked it above, as it is currently displayed on my terminal. As you can see, the latest version is still quite outdated.</p>
<p>Since -as far as I am aware- you are still the one in charge of this object; I wanted to ask if you know when the file will be updated?</p>

<p>Dear Elin</p>
<p>I am so happy to finally hear from you again, it has been a while. I see you still write like you searched on google for how to write a formal email. No worries, I get it. Sometimes I still do as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, the file is probably going to be updated sometime next week. It's the standard, as the modifications are being approved. But I'm sure you already knew that.</p>
<p>After three years as your superior I've somewhat become accustomed to your ways, and I mean that in the best way. I'm truly so proud of you, and the work you are doing. Watching you flourishing like this is why I love my job. I can’t wait to see what you do next.</p>
<p>But I digress, I’ve become accustomed to your ways. So tell me, what did you really want to ask?</p>
<p>Dr. Amanda Ward</p>
<p>PS: Speaking of outdated things, what is up with your signature? Wear your title with pride, you’ve earned it!</p>

<p>Guess I am still that obvious then.</p>
<p>Really, I just wanted to thank you again. I know I already have before, several times… And for several reasons…</p>
<p>But now that I have basically finished every Eduskip program available, I felt I had to do so one last time. And I really mean it. I’m not sure I would have ever applied for the grant, were it not for your assurance. Not to mention all the guidance you gave me prior. On each and every step.</p>
<p>But above all, I want to thank you for believing in me and my project.<br/>
After all, SCP-6280 is still a rather inconspicuous object. It had been stored in a locker collecting dust for so long that even those concerned by its uncertain nature had accepted it was harmless. They had accepted it was worthless.</p>
<p>But you still saw that maybe there could still be something left to learn. Even if there was no objective, logical, or scientific reason to do so, you understood my desire to study it further. You understood this meant more to me than what the title of my paper might suggest.</p>
<p>I know you have read my entire thesis already. I know you are aware of the results. I know you have even experienced the positive change in behavior of SCP-6280 yourself.</p>
<p>But still, you allowed me to prove there was something more behind the surface of that canvas, something human.</p>
<p>I’ve attached part of one of the latest reports from an exposure test, one I did not include in the paper. In the end, all I can say is I'm not going to thank you again, not myself.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br/>
Dr. Elin Van Hedel</p>
<p>PS: You are right about that. I have actually decided to start using my mother's maiden name, so I figured I would change the signature when all my employee records were updated. But might as well begin now.<br/>

<p><strong>Johannes Van Hedel</strong> (1904-)</p>
<p><em><strong>A Finished Masterpiece</strong></em> (?)<br/>
Wherever creation is born, Anywhere</p>

<p><strong>Manifested Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>Still, it isn't perfect.</p>
<p>The lines are rough. The pigments are faded. And the meaning, it is somewhat lost in the shapes.</p>
<p>Could the masters still utter a word they would concur; this piece is not worthy of its title. Tomorrow, maybe. Yet, not today.</p>
<p>But, for one thing, if anything.<br/>
It is here. And it is complete.<br/>
I think that is enough for now.</p>
<p>And so, here and now as you lay your eyes upon me, I am finally seen.<br/>
Thank you.</p>
