It is to remain within the pre-approved Foundation Academic Service Computer system stored at University-12's Information Technology Laboratories in Geneva, Switzerland.
<p>Staff being transferred departments or trained in understanding articles are to believe that the anomaly is solely part of the SCP-Foundation’s training program, as an example of an SCP Article in the database. The article must be used for training, as removal from the program results in a shutdown of the Foundation's article documenting system.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
</div>
<br/>
SCP-8287 is an anomalous series of text boxes present within the article labelled with the same name, originally used for testing purposes. The anomaly responds to statements and questions made throughout the training article, with regular appearances utilising text boxes, often in bright yellow.
<p>The anomaly has sporadically appeared alphabetically on Foundation Academic Service computers numbered AB-12-44 through to XS-36-01.</p>
<div class="offset-right right-3">
<div class="turbo-block bg-yellow border-black text-black">
<p>So the anomaly believes it's in<br/>
training..?<br/>
How does that work?<br/>
Shoddy writing from the training<br/>
department in my opinion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The anomaly does not seem to be actively aware that it is within an article, and the memory of the anomaly is wiped upon the shutdown of the computer it is active on at the time.</p>
<p>SCP-8287 has been described as "tempting to respond to", due to its highly sarcastic nature according to first-hand accounts of researchers, examiners and trainees alike.</p>
<div class="heading">
<p>INITIAL DISCOVERY REPORT</p>
</div>
<p>On 04/12/1991, SCP-8287 was first observed on the Foundation's training computers, on a mock article of the same name. The article would be about a conscious article, however it did not initially contain any anomaly.</p>
<p>Guiying Cai, a recruit from Peking University, would be the first to notice the anomaly and bring it to site authorities attention, namely Simon Plunkett, the invigilator for his examination. It is, however, expected the anomaly may have occurred earlier, albeit unreported.</p>

<div class="turbo-block bg-yellow border-black text-black">
<p>I don't think I would<br/>
believe him…<br/>
There is no way such<br/>
a thing exists… right?</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>04/12/1991 14:55 UTC</strong><br/>
<strong>Cai:</strong> "Excuse me. Excuse me?" He would be observed raising his hand.<br/>
<strong>Plunkett:</strong> "I hope this is important. You are under examination conditions."<br/>
<strong>Cai:</strong> "Yes, this computer… It is talking?"<br/>
<strong>Plunkett:</strong> "Its… talking to you?" He would look into the screen "Oh, this is just part of the article, clearly."<br/>
<strong>Cai:</strong> "No, sir. This is… strange. This feels, alive."<br/>
<strong>Plunkett:</strong> "Sure, whatever you say…"</p>
</blockquote>
Plunkett would take note of the incident, noting what he believed to be paranoia from Cai and for him to be removed from the course. Over the following weeks,

more reports would come in and after observation would be confirmed as anomalous and studied by a newly founded Department of Academic Containment.</div>

<br/>
As part of a refurbishment of the SCP Training program, SCP-8287 would be shortly removed from the system, and moved to property of the Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration (RAISA).<br/>
At 04:45 on ██/██/1996, the file containing SCP-8287 would be formally removed from the program. At 05:00, all RAISA files would become unreadable, with the exception of SCP-8287.

<div class="turbo-block bg-red border-white text-white">
<p>I AM NOT REAL<br/>
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
RAISA would quickly revert SCP-8287's file back to the Foundation Academic Service, and all damage would be reverted immediately. SCP-8287 is to remain within the training program in future.

Containment would attempt to communicate with SCP-8287. The anomaly would begin to panic and gain consciousness of its existence. As part of this, it would follow this procedure:<br/>
1. Refusal that the anomaly exists<br/>
2. Refusal it is the anomaly<br/>
3. Panic that it is 'not real'.

Attempts to calm it after this fact would not work, and the anomaly would begin to corrupt the remainder of the file.<br/>
It would be observed that the anomaly would forget upon the shutdown of the computer in which houses it at the time.Despite SCP-8287 forgetting
