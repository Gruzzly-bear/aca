            <h1>SCP-3956</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3956</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> At least one member of MTF Mu-33 ("Show-goers") must be present at all showings of musical productions in London's West End. If SCP-3956 manifests, the theatre is to be sealed off until all mealworms have been removed and all civilians inside have been amnesticised.</p>
<p>The acting leader of MTF Mu-33 will decide whether or not an attempt to capture SCP-3956-2 will be made based on the risk of civilian casualties.</p>
<p>All Foundation personnel investigating SCP-3956 are to wear noise-canceling earmuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3956 is an event that manifests in theatres found in the city of London. Thus far, SCP-3956 has only been observed during performances of musical theatre.</p>
<p>The event lasts an average of 15 minutes and is identifiable by the following occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second act, an actor will sing an unscripted solo about mealworms for 2-3 minutes. The opening line is always, "Mmm, tasty mealworms".</li>
<li>During the solo, audience members who hear the song will be affected by an anomalous phenomenon. Several mealworms<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> will emerge from the ears of affected individuals; these mealworms will then approach the stage. In later manifestations, at least 1 mealworm will remain in the individual's ear.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the mealworm song, the actor will gather and consume the mealworms on-stage. This typically takes approximately 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Once all mealworms are consumed, the audience will applaud and the show will continue as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals who hear the mealworm song live, designated SCP-3956-1, do not perceive the event as unusual and will instead react to SCP-3956 as though it is a normal part of the show.</p>
<p>SCP-3956-2 is a 2.1-metre-tall humanoid entity composed entirely of mealworms. It first appeared during the third manifestation of SCP-3956<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. Following this appearance, additional recurring events pertaining to SCP-3956 manifestations have been noted. SCP-3956-2 now enters the stage at a seemingly random point during the second act and will perform the song itself. An actor being present on the stage is no longer required.</p>
<p>The first manifestation took place on 30/12/2016. Appearances are relatively sporadic, though seem to be increasing in frequency. A definite cause of SCP-3956 has not yet been determined.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Log of notable manifestations</strong></p>
<p>This is an abridged log of manifestations, for a full list please see document-3956-01.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 14/02/2017</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Number:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Show Name:</strong> <em>Wicked</em></p>
<p><strong>Description of events:</strong> The event began as normal; however, once the consumption was complete, SCP-3956-2 crawled out of Tracy ██████'s<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> mouth. SCP-3956-2 attempted to perform SCP-3956; SCP-3956-1 reacted poorly to this and directed several insults towards SCP-3956-2. This caused SCP-3956-2 to flee the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> N/A</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 17/08/2017</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Number:</strong> 4</p>
<p><strong>Show Name:</strong> <em>The Book of Mormon</em></p>
<p><strong>Description of events:</strong> SCP-3956-2 entered the stage slowly and looked at the audience several times. All other actors on stage stopped and observed SCP-3956-2. After 5 minutes, it performed SCP-3956. SCP-3956-1 reactions were mixed, with several audience members not applauding. At the end of the show, SCP-3956-2 returned to bow with the cast.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The first attempt to capture SCP-3956-2 was made during this performance. Agent ██████ fired a tranquiliser dart into SCP-3956-2. A single mealworm was dislodged from and then consumed by SCP-3956-2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 06/01/2018</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Number:</strong> 9</p>
<p><strong>Show Name:</strong> <em>Wicked</em></p>
<p><strong>Description of events:</strong> The song "No Good Deed" was cut completely from the show and replaced with SCP-3956. SCP-3956-2 was lowered onto the stage via the bubble device typically used by the character Glinda. SCP-3956 began as SCP-3956-2 descended. At the end of the consumption phase, SCP-3956-1 gave a full standing ovation. SCP-3956-2 returned to bow with the cast and performed an encore, causing another SCP-3956 event. After the show, SCP-3956-2 was sighted in the main lobby shaking hands with instances of SCP-3956-1.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-3956-2 approached Agent ██████, the sole observer of this event, once the show had ended. It handed him a program with the message, "I've seen you at all my shows. Thank you for never giving up on me! - WORMS" written inside along with several mealworms. It then placed its mouth against his hand and exited the lobby. Agent ██████ later described SCP-3956-2 as "a talented showman".</p>
