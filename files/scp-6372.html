</div></div><div class='text-content'>Object Class:</span> Euclid</p>
<p><span class="h-span">Special Containment Procedures:</span> The star system in which SCP-6372 is located within must remain closed off from public access under the guise of a highly unstable reality, caused by prior en masse testing of Lang Distortion Drives. All civilians entering through are to be detained, amnesticized, and released as per standard protocol.</p>
<p>Provisional Site-6372 has been established at the top of SCP-6372 for further research. Finding a viable way of entry into the structure and deciphering the symbols it bears should be considered an utmost priority.</p>
<p><span class="h-span">Description:</span> SCP-6372 is a massive<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> stone monolith, located on the surface of BU-45996-V<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and piercing into its exosphere. It is solely constructed from a currently unidentified smooth, black, and seemingly indestructible material.</p>
<p>Despite this, engravings with, as of yet, untranslated runes regularly appear on its surface. As of writing, these runes do not correlate to any language known by humanity, the Martians, the taronyu, or otherwise, as depicted in <strong><tt>Fig 1.1</tt></strong>. Foundation empaths and telepaths claim the symbols emanate a "worried feeling of abandonment." The exact meaning of this and the translation of the symbols discovered are still being compiled by Provisional Site-6372 personnel.</p>
<p>Although SCP-6372 bears no points of entry, a Foundation scan revealed the structure to be hollow inside after just 10 meters of wall depth, forming approximately 9 959 km<sup>3</sup> of emptiness within. What — if anything — resides there currently remains unknown. From inside, the monolith itself constantly exudes a notable buzzing sound — whether this is caused by some unidentified property of the stone it was built with or is made by additional anomalous phenomena within the structure itself remains under investigation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A clarification for my colleagues: it is not just the sound of "buzzing" that has piqued our interests. We are aware of multiple materials that emanate similar sounds — this, in and of itself, is no different.</em></p>
<p><em>While the document is not technically incorrect, it severely lacks specificity and context. Beyond the aptly put "buzzing" are faint echos, reminiscent of undecipherable whispers. Myself and many others have heard it during our research. Further deeper the sounds are louder — almost as if a loud drum was being played somewhere inside. Really, there is a certain rhythm within SCP-6372; and its songs are what truly intrigue us.</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever it may be — we must know the truth.</em><br/></p>

<p>SCP-6372 has been, thus far, entirely resistant to every type of damage the Foundation attempted to inflict on it, anomalous or not. This property seems to also extend to immunity to weather patterns and standard physical forces that should affect the structure.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> This trait has ensured that any approximation of the structure's age, research into its exact composition, or further analysis of its characteristics remains impossible by current means.</p>
<p>The only thing that can be extrapolated about SCP-6372 from currently available data is the fact that it is not native to the planet it is located on.</p>
<p><span class="h-span">Addendum 6372-1:</span> SCP-6372 Entry Attempts</p>
<p>Following extensive study regarding SCP-6372, Provisional Site-6372 personnel have come to the conclusion that further research and understanding of the structure's purpose is entirely unfeasible without gaining entry inside it.</p>
<p>As such, the usage of direct force in hopes of achieving this has been authorized by Overwatch Command. Additionally, an official request for the deployment of a linguopath<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> to SCP-6372 was put forward. The request was later approved, but the expected arrival time for the aforementioned asset was determined for the next decade due to project overload.</p>
<p>In the meantime, entry testing officially began for SCP-6372. Attached below is the log of Foundation attempts to breach the structure via the utilization of technology shipped to Provisional Site-6372 by supply spaceships.</p>

<td>Numerous thaumaturgic rituals ranging from alchemical mass exchange through focused rays of energy to attempted ripping of the material from the inside out were attempted by shipped Thaumaturgy Department personnel.

<td>Nuclear bombardment</td>
<td>A nuclear missile was detonated at the bottom of SCP-6372. Following the dissolvement of the mushroom cloud that was formed during the explosion, research staff determined the blast peeled away 1 μm of SCP-6372's shell in the radius of the blast. Although this was noted to have indeed damaged the structure, further testing with this method has been deemed impossible, as total forced entry into SCP-6372 would require the usage of approximately 10 000 000 warheads, should identical blasts deal the same amount of damage to the walls.</td>

<p><span class="h-span">Addendum 6372-2:</span> Provisional Site-6372 Exploration</p>
<p>Shortly after the commencement of the most recent test entry, all contact with Provisional Site-6372 was abruptly lost. For this reason, the results of the aforementioned test remain unknown. A fleet of recovery ships was promptly sent to investigate and ascertain the status of Provisional Site-6372.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the Foundation came to find the Provisional Site having been destroyed entirely. Its structure had seemingly melted, and all on-site personnel were reduced to skeletons. Their suits and apparatus were likewise rendered unusable.</p>
<p>Following further examination, SCP-6372 was verified to have been breached. A small, several centimeter opening was found at the northern-most face, roughly 1.25 m above ground-level. A single broken knife handle was found nearby, with additional skeletons surrounding it and the opening. Personnel peering into the structure from the opening reported it being empty, and that it appeared to be composed entirely out of cake from the inside.</p>
<p>On the southern and opposite side of SCP-6372, another larger breach was also discovered. Cake material scattered several kilometers away from the opening indicates that a sudden large explosion was the cause of the breach. SCP-6372 was also noted to have been silent for the first time since its discovery.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent loss of all data stored at Provisional Site-6372, the unsealing of its Exclusionary Deepwell Archives revealed a record of all data transfers into and out of the Site. Among standard project files previously submitted to the inter-Foundation SCiPNET databases, a single edit request was found that had not received authorization.</p>
<p>The edit request in question was submitted by the account of Samantha Baker,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> containing a singular sentence with a message titled "SCP-6372 Translation". Its exact meaning — and importance to SCP-6372 and the Site's fate, if applicable — remains unknown. It is attached below.</p>
