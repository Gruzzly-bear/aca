<p>SCP-4178</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4178</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
SCP-4178 hives are to be housed in a medium-sized habitat no less then 30 x 30 meters in size. The interior is to be constructed in such a way as to ressemble an underground cavenous formation. One <em>Sus domesticus</em> (domestic pig) is to be introduced into the chamber once per week to feed the colony.</p>
<p>In order to control the population within the hive, an advanced thermal scanner is to be installed inside the chamber to allow a rough estimate of how many instances are within it. A scan is to be done periodically to ensure the hive does not exceed a rough population of 40-45 instances. Maintenance on the scanner is to be done remotely with a drone.</p>
<p>Due to the highly flammable nature of the SCP-4178 webbing and the tendency of the instances to cover every surface with said webbing, controlled removal of excessive webbing is to be done by two Class-D personnel equipped with reinforced apiarist's suit to prevent any potential incident that could endanger the hive. No item capable of producing sparks or generating an open flame are allowed within the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP-4178 is the collective designation for a species of carnivorous arachnids resembling members of the Araneidae family. Compared to it's non-anomalous counterparts, SCP-4178 instances possess what appears to be the abdomen and wings of large Vespidae<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> past the cephalothorax. These attributes are proportional with the rest of the body, resulting in an abdomen and wing span much larger than any existing hornets due to the already large size of SCP-4178 instances. Female instances are noticeably larger than the males, a common trait seen in regular spiders and most wasp species.</p>
<p>SCP-4178 instances are able to produce venom in both their stingers and fangs, with the stinger venom noted to be much more potent than the venom in the fangs. Contrary to normal wasp species, male SCP-4178 instances do possess a stinger that they use for hunting and incapacitation. No other sexual dimorphism was noted between the male and female instances.</p>
<p>SCP-4178 instances are social arthropods that live in large nests. To establish a nest, several individuals will seek out a place they deem safe enough to start reproducing. SCP-4178 instances don't seem to have specific criteria to establish nests as the locations have ranged from cramped caves to an entire apartment complex. Once a nest is established, the instances will use their spinnerets to cover the walls with a webbing similar in texture and appearance to a common wasp nest. Once the webbing has solidified, the resulting material was noted to be comparable to hardened wood. SCP-4178 nests seem to constantly emit a "scent" that draws more SCP-4178 to it's location, integrating the hive. Instances were noted to cover each other with a derivative of their web to help blend in with the walls of the hive. If left untouched, an SCP-4178 nest could continue to expand and grow to dangerous proportions.</p>
<p>Once an instance has spotted potential prey, it will emit pheromones that attract any nearby instances to it's location. SCP-4178 instances were noted to carefully examine the subject from a distance, seemingly "sizing it up" to figure out wether there is a risk. If they decide to attack, the instances will swarm the victim and repeatedly sting it until the venom takes effect. Once paralysed, and if enough instances are around, the victim will be taken back to the nest after which the instances will begin to encase it in a sort of cocoon. To do this, SCP-4178 instances make use of spinneret glands located at the tip of their abdomen under the stinger. This process tends to take up to 40 minutes for humans; larger prey can take up to an hour to be fully covered by the webbing. Solidification of the cocoon usually takes up to 15 minutes. After solidifying, the web takes the same appearance as the walls of the SCP-4178 nest that surrounds it. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Unlike regular eusocial wasps, it appears that SCP-4178 hives do not possess any semblance of a "queen".</span> <strong>[See Addendum 4178.2]</strong></p>
<p>Once a cocooned victim is brought to the nest, one of two things can happen:</p>
<p>- The most common occurence is the cocoon serving as a food source, several instances will bite the paralysed victim and inject them with special enzymes that liquify the inside of the victim. Analysis of cocooned specimens shows that the cocoons preserve the body for long period of times even after death. It is believed that the cocoon does this to avoid the food from rotting and potentially attracting pests to the nest that could feed on the young. It is unknown how the cocoons created by SCP-4178 are capable of this.</p>
<p>- A female instance, that has been preemptively impregnated by a male, will proceed to implant fertilized eggs within the cocoon using a specialised ovipositor similar to regular parasitoid species of wasps. The eggs are carefully placed on top of the paralysed victim who, at this point in time, is still conscious albeit in a suspended state. Up to twenty eggs can be placed in a cocoon formed from a human host, these eggs will take between two to three weeks to hatch. Once hatched, the spiderlings will begin to eat the host before emerging from the cocoon, leaving whatever scraps of food that weren't eaten to the adults.</p>

<p>Compound LP-4178 is a black fluid similar in texture to thickened blood. When consumed by itself, Compound LP-4178 does not have any particular effects on the human body, being reported of having a chewy texture and possessing an after-taste similar to peanut. However, it was discovered that excessive consumption over a short period of time will lead to the subject's blood thickening exponentially, leading to blood clots and similar health issues. Compound LP-4178's main use reveals itself when combined with freshly laid SCP-4178 eggs, resulting in a very powerful recreational drug similar to heroin.</p>
<p>The resulting mix has to be injected into one of the subject's veins to take effect. Once injected, the eggs within the compound will almost immediatly hatch upon contact with the subject's blood-cells. The newly hatched instances, now labelled SCP-4178-A, will make their way to the host's spinal cord and brain. Once these are reached, the instances will latch and partially fuse onto them before releasing unknown chemicals. During this process, subjects have reported feeling a surge of pleasurable sensations the intensity of which varied depending on how many instances were injected and how rapidly they reached the brain. This surge is usually accompanied by occasional hallucinations, clouded mental functions and eventually addiction.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">

</div>
</div>
<p>Once the subject becomes a host for SCP-4178-A instances, they have to periodically take unaltered Compound LP-4178 or otherwise risk dangerous withdrawal side-effects. Compound LP-4178 acts as a deterent to halt SCP-4178-A's growth in the host as well as continuously release it's chemicals. Subjects with recorded long-term use of Compound LP-4178 have reported that the intensity of the effects grows with continuous usage. Some have reported not feeling in control of their body at times, reporting that they felt as if they were watching someone puppeteering their body. Auditory hallucinations were also reported by several subjects, stating have heard whispers and even voices talking to them.</p>
<p>Should the subject stop the regular intake of Compound LP-4178, the SCP-4178-A instances will begin to grow rapidly in size over a period of several weeks. Signs and symptoms of withdrawal include: anxiety, restless legs syndrome, headaches, nausea, excessive sweating, and acute pain. Once the instances have become too large for the host, they will attempt to break out by piercing the skull and/or back, leading to the death of the subject.</p>
<p>Research is currently on-going to find a way to remove the SCP-4178-A instances while ensuring the safety of the host. Usage of special chemicals that would kill the instances when injected is currently being explored.</p>

<p>While SCP-4178 instances have been in foundation custody since 196█, the usage of their eggs as a drug was only discovered on the 23rd of November 200█. This usage was revealed to the foundation following a raid by the New Hampshire State Police Department following the suspicious disappearence of several people. For a while, the department was unable to find any lead until an an unidentified informant notified the police department. The newly acquired evidence pointed towards an abandoned building located on the outskirts of ██████. At the time, the building was suspected of being an active drug house by the Hampshire State P.D. The deparment's SWAT was mobilized to the scene, among them was Field Agent ████, who was acting undercover at the Tactical Operations Centre for the police department and would overview the operation.<br/>

<p>[START OF LOG]</p>
<p><em>Camera footage starts with Officer Morton facing one of his colleagues within the SWAT's vehicle. Rain can be heard hitting the roof of the vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> So, what do we know of the place TOC?</p>
<p><strong>TOC:</strong> [Radio] This is TOC, the building used to be a small apartment complex. It got abandonned after a lack of tenants in the █0's and has been empty for a while, until recently. Suspicious individuals were seen going in and out around the place. Atleast five suspects are possibly within the building according to the person that tipped us.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Hmm, So there's a very high chance that the place is being used as a crack-house?</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> Guaranteed even.</p>
<p><em>Miscellaneous chatter between the officers can be heard, some can be seen checking their equipment while others are killing time by fidgeting. Officer Morton can be seen tapping his feet on the ground restlessly in anticipation. After another 10 minutes, the transport vehicle halts.</em></p>
<p><strong>SWAT Driver:</strong> We're here boys.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> Alright, everyone out.</p>
<p><strong>SWAT Drive:</strong> I'll stay in the car, 'wouldn't want to get a parking ticket y'know. <em>laughs</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Jackass.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> Quit the chatter. TOC, how many entrances are there?</p>
<p><strong>TOC:</strong> [Radio] This is TOC, the building's plan appears to show only two entrances. The main one which leads into a foyer and a side entrance that leads to the basement. Although take note that I'm seeing reports about the second entrance being condemned.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> Roger that, we'll go through the front.</p>
<p><strong>TOC:</strong> [Radio] Best of luck out there.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> Alright. Once we've taken control of the foyer we will separate into teams to cover the entire building. Morton and Reeds you'll take the upstairs, Harris and Jones you will go look into the basement while me and Garcia will sweep through the ground floor. Be wary of potentially armed suspects but keep an eye out for civilians.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton can be seen following the others, slowly entering the foyer of the complex. Visibility within is extremely poor, what little can be made out through the camera feed show that the interior is completly thrashed with debris and refuse. Each of the officers make their way to their designated area until only Officer Reeds can be seen from Officer Morton's camera as they go up the stairs. The hallways upstairs are in a similar state as the foyer, being overtaken by mold and debris.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> [Pause] Alright, it's clear. Let's move.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Urgh, It smells awful in here. Almost like something died.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Stay focused, we have to check the rooms.</p>
<p><em>After a further 4 minutes of searching, a trail of blood leading to the end of the hallway is noticed by the officers. Camera footage shows that the walls further down the hallway are starting to exhibits signs of SCP-4178 webbing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Morton to TOC, we have a lot of blood up here.</p>
<p><strong>TOC:</strong> [Radio] Thi- [Static] -s TOC, I have confirmation through your camera feed. [Static]-tinue with caution.</p>
<p><em>As the officers walk past a room, a loud bang from within is heard. Officer Morton can be seen motioning to Officer Reeds towards the side of the door as the two men get ready to breach in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Police!</p>
<p><em>As Officer Reeds shines their flashlight at the other end of the room, the silhouette of a man can be made out through the light. The suspect can be seen holding a firearm and aiming at the officers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> He's got a gun!</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Don't shoot! I'm the one who tipped you guys!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Put the gun down!</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Okay okay!</p>
<p><em>The person can be seen lowering the gun to the ground. Officer Reeds can be seen moving towards the suspect to handcuff them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Why are you 'cuffing me!?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> We're doing this for your safety, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> And ours.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> TOC, this is Officer Morton. Civilian is in custody, claims to be the person who tipped us.</p>
<p><strong>TOC:</strong> [Radio] [Static] -epeat, [Static] -orton. [Static] -u copy?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> TOC, you're breaking up. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><em>Static can be heard on the radio as TOC isn't heard responding.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> The druggies here probably installed a jammer somehow. We had something similar a while back.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Awesome..</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] Is there only two of you? You need to get me out of here, please!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Sir, calm down. Our collegues are sweeping the building for the other people you mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> They're already gone! We have to leave before <em>they</em> sense you're in here!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Who are you talking abo-</p>
<p><em>Officer Reeds is interrupted by the static of the radios blarring out. Officer Reeds goes to answer the radio while Officer morton remains with the informant.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Who's they?</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] I don't really know! They're a bunch of people in dark robes that barely spoke english! They came to me several months ago, gave me a package and claimed it was a new drug on the market. Looked like some weird syringes, they let me tr-try it. It's something I never felt before, made me completly estatic!</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] I was completly hooked on the stuff man! When I begged them for more, they gave me a-a deal. Brought some weird-ass containers and told me tha-that if I wanted to keep receiving my fix, I had to let the eggs inside hatch and feed them…</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Feed them? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] It started small y'know, whatever pet I could get my hands on. Then very qu-quickly they came back to me, said I should start to bring people in to let them "experience the revelation". Whenever these people took the drug, they'd be in a state that left them completly defenseless. That's when <em>they</em> came in and got them..</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Wait, sir. Were you being held here against your will?</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] Pretty much.. They allowed me to leave the building temporarily at times, to d-draw in more people. Every time I was outside I could feel that they were not far, wat-watching..</p>
<p><em>Closer inspection shows that the informant is extremely thin, a common symptom of heavy drug usage. At this point Officer Reeds re-enters the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Radios are completly busted, the little I understood is that Garcia is joining us here and that the others finally found the door to the basement. Though it's apparently blocked by something behind the door.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Let's stay put and try to re-establish contact with TOC, we seem to have a somewhat better signal up here. Once Garcia meets back up with us we'll extract the civilian and go help the others.</p>
<p><em>The next 15 minutes of recording shows the officers attempting but failing to contact TOC. By this point, the undercover TOC agent contacted Site-248 after reviewing the footage and confirming signs of potential active SCP-4178 presence within the building.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Garcia sure is taking his sweet time.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton's radio can be heard emating static again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> This is Morton, over.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> [Radio] [Static] -is Becket, get your asses dow- [Static] -ere ASAP. We manag- [Static] -ust open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] Wait, the basement?! They can't go down there!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> [Radio] Walls [Static] -ocevered in wood? Wait, ther- [Statis] -ivilians down there!</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> You don't understand, the basement is their nest!</p>
<p><em>A distant buzzing sound can be heard echoing around the house, followed by several gunshots.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lead Officer Becket:</strong> [Radio] What the- [Static] -hat are these things?!</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> We have to go help them. Let's go!</p>
<p><em>Distant shots and screams can be still be heard below the officers. Officer Reeds and Morton can be seen running outside of the room until they come across Officer Garcia stumbling down the hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Garcia:</strong> Help..me..</p>
<p><em>Officer Garcia falls forward to the ground, revealing an SCP-4178 instance on their back. The instance can be seen biting and stinging the officer in the gaps of their kevlar vest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> What the hell is that thing?!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Move!</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton can be seen running towards his colleague's body and lifts the instance. A struggle ensues as Officer Morton holds the aggravated instance that is trying to sting him in return.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> [Grunt] Get it off of me!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Stop moving!</p>
<p><em>Officer Reeds manages to throw the instance to the ground as both officer repeatedly stomp on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> A-are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> [Panting] I'm fine. Reeds, go check Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> I feel a pulse, he's still alive! We have to get him out now.</p>
<p><em>Officer Reeds lifts the unmoving Officer Garcia on his shoulder, dragging him along. The informant can be seen helping him by grabbing onto the other side. The officers make their way to the top of the stairs as the gunshots from the basements stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> They stopped shooting. Maybe they're okay?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> We're almost there</p>
<p><em>The group runs down the stairs as best as they can. As they reach the door, they find it completly locked.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Damn it! Who locked the fucking door!?</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Stuttering] It must have been those people.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton attempts to forcefully open the door by hitting it repeatadly with his shoulder. As the sound grows louder, so does the buzzing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Stop it, Morton.</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> You're going to bring the whole hive down on us!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> What do you suggest we do then huh?! We don't have anything to open that door. Becket and the others had the battering ram and C2 charges!</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> We have no choice… One of us has to go to the basement and retrieve one of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> You're insane, your colleagues didn't last 10 minutes down there.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> We have no way to break down that door fast enough without attracting all those creatures here.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> …I'll go. You two stay here with Garcia, going alone means there's less chances to be spotted.</p>
<p><em>Several minutes go by as Officer Morton can be seen tapping his feet on the group, supposedly to cope for the stress of the situation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> It's been to long, he should be back already.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Stay quiet, he'll be here soon.</p>
<p><em>A loud buzzing can be heard echoing within the foyer followed by Officer Reeds yelling down the hallway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Morton, the door is jammed! Get me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> I'm on my way.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Hurry! I think I stepped on one of their babies and they aren't happy.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton runs to the aid of his colleague, coming up to a decrepit metal sliding door a quarter of the way open. Officer Reeds can be seen on the other side trying to force his way through the opening. Both men try to pry open the door to no result, Officer Reeds stops and looks repeatedly behind him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Fuck, here take the battering ram. Get the hell outta here.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> What about you?!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Reeds:</strong> Don't question it, go! TOC mentioned another exit that leads outside, i'll try to go through there.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton can be seen relunctantly taking the battering ram before running away. Looking over their shoulder as they see Officer Reeds running back within the basement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> Where's your friend?!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> He's taking another route, move.</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton strikes one of the old sturdy wooden doors with the battering ram. After several repeated hits, parts of the door breaks which allows the group to exit the building. The storm outside intensified compared to when they arrived on the scene earlier.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> It's open. Let's go!</p>
<p><em>Several distant gunshots are heard as the group exits the building. Both men are carrying Officer Garcia until Officer Morton runs towards the SWAT's transport vehicle, banging on one of the d. ETA 4 minutes before foundation intervention team arrival.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> Open the doors! We have to get the fuck out of her-</p>
<p><em>As Officer Morton opens the passenger door, they discover the deceased driver. Closer inspection showed that their throat was slit, the driver's body being stuck in the motion of grasping their neck as they bled out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> This is a nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> What are we going to do!?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> I'm moving the body, get in the back with Garcia-</p>
<p><em>Both men freeze as the click of a firearm cocking is audible behind them. As Officer Morton turns around, two robed figures come into the camera's view. One can be seen aiming an unidentified handgun at Officer Morton while the other is a bit farther away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer Morton:</strong> [Stuttering] N-Now, whatever you're going to do. Think long and hard about it firs-</p>
<p><em>Officer Morton is interrupted as they are shot in the head by the figure, their body dropping instantly to the ground. The informant drops Officer Garcia's body as they scream in surprise from the gunshot. They are heard running towards the back of the vehicle before locking themselves within.</em></p>
<p><strong>Informant:</strong> [Muffled] I'm not going back inside, screw you!</p>
<p><em>Loud metal bangs are heard, seemingly from the figures banging on the vehicle's backdoors. This continues for a short while as the banging eventually stops and distant sirens can heard approaching the area. Due to the angle that Officer Morton's body is oriented at, nothing of note is seen until two Foundation vehicles enter the frame.</em></p>

<p>Following the detention of the informant, later identified as Daniel E█████, Mobile Task Force Echo-5 ("Sting Operation") operatives began a sweep of the building. Around twenty individuals in various state of cocooning were discovered in the basement, among them the freshly cocooned bodies of the officers. Officer Reeds' body was found deeper within the hive, being consumed by several newly hatched SCP-4178 instances. Due to the amount of individuals within the building, the SCP-4178 colony had to be terminated with the usage of a specialized gas. Several crates bearing an unknown sigil were seized during the raid, the content of the crates includes dried SCP-4178 eggs along with several bottles of unknown origins, later revealed to be Compound LP-4178. The body of Officer Garcia along with the unknown figures were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>During the majority of it's existence, A█████'s economy was primarily built around farming and coal mining as well as maintaining a self-sufficient culture which seemed to shun outside interference when not needed. During the Spanish Civil War, a small tank division was stationed near the village. Following the war, most of the vehicles were abandoned and repurposed by the villagers for usage in the mine.</p>
<p>On the 21st of May 2004, Esteban Salvador, resident doctor of the village, unknowingly approached foundation personel who were posing as spanish authorities regarding recent strange occurences regarding their village.

<p><strong>Esteban Salvador Interview - 21/05/2004</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;">Agent José Verdeja - Site-34</span></p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> Please state your name for the recording.</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> R-Right <em>ahem</em>. My name is Esteban Salvador and I am the local doctor of A█████, a small village situated in the León province.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> And you have come to us regarding… [Sounds of paper shuffling] "Strange occurences" in your village?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> Do you mind elaborating, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> [Clears throat] Following the war and Franco's subsequent rule, we became a <em>very</em> isolated village. The villagers became weary of "outsiders" and didn't adopt much modern technology as time went on. It had come to a point that the only people that actively left our village was I and my nephew, he owns a truck that he uses as a mobile shop to bring goods to the village-</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> Let's get to the point if you don't mind, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> R-right, sorry. A few months ago, during the village's festivities, our mayor introduced to us a strange group, all of them wearing black robes to the village with their faces hidden by their hoods. We were told that they were travellers who approached him regarding the village's recent hard times and claimed they could help. I-I've known our mayor for a long time you see, and he.. something just felt off about the way he acted. At the time I ignored it because I trusted his judgement.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> What do you know of these people?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> What little I know is that they are part of a cult they called "Los Cuidadores", they were given a small decrepit house on the outskirts of the village and would mainly keep to themselves initially. At first, their presence actually helped the village. They brought equipment to help reopen the mine, help reinforce the aging buildings etc. However, a few weeks back, they approached me regarding the administration of a new vaccine to the entire village, they had concerns regarding a new disease that was spreading in the region and managed to convince me to help them.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> And you didn't question it?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> I… I didn't at the time, there was in fact a small viral outbreak in the region so I agreed to help them. However a majority of the village refused to be injected, they are vividly religious you see and didn't really believe that this would help them. A couple of days after that, I discovered one of the villagers had suspiciously died in their sleep, those zealots began to claim it was some sort of divine retribution which caused mass panic. <em>Everyone</em> immediatly began to knock at my door, begging to be given a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> What was suspicious about the death?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> I examined the body before he was to be sent to our pastor for burial. When I looked closer, I noticed a singular large puncture mark near the neck with swelling that reminded me of an anaphylactic shock. All the symptons didn't add up to the disease that was in the region at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> What about you doctor, did you also receive the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> I.. [Sighs] One day, our pastor came to me with concerns regarding several people in the village falling sick. By this point we were probably the only people left that hadn't received a shot. While we talked, we were interrupted by a group of these.. zealots that barged into my cabinet. They insisted that we injected ourselves with the vaccine. "Wouldn't want to lose our good doctor." they told me…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> And what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> I had to comply… Initially, after I was injected, I had a major fever the entire time but… I- I had never felt something like this before, It felt like something was crawling within my body. The pain was so intense I had to be constantly bedridden. Before long I also began to experience hallucinations.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> Could you.. describe them?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> It started with a constant buzzing sound, similar to a bee or a fly passing by your ears every second. Soon after I began to hear a voice, echoing within my head and supressing all of my thoughts. It felt like I was losing control of myself. In my feverish state, I made a sort of desperate cocktail of various medecine in my cabinet and took it. I was convinced I was going to die…</p>
<p><em>E. Salvador can be seen clenching their fists while talking and tensing up. After a short moment, they relax and sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> When I got better, I immediatly went out to the village to check on the others. I was horrified to see what became of them… What used to be a very lively community, turned into a silent mob that… <em>stares</em>. They move around like clockwork, doing the same tasks everyday following the exact same path. Then, they all converge towards the church, to drink something given by the cultists. It felt like I was in a nightmare.</p>
<p><em>E. Salvador can be seen placing several photos on the table and pushing them towards Agent Verdeja. Closer examination revealed the pictures to be containing shots of SCP-4178 instances in various locations. Agent Verdeja can be heard writing down on his notes before stopping.</em></p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> When I thought the worst was over, these.. creatures began to appear in and around the village.<br/>
Several hikers went missing in the surrondings of the village when these things appeared. Despite this, I noticed that they seemed to ignore me and the rest of the village.</p>
<p><em>E. Salvador is staring at his hands, becoming paler and visibly sweating.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Verdeja:</strong> Do you need a break, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> I… Recently, I witnessed a young lady I didn't know being dragged by some of my peers off to the mines.. I could have helped her but I was to afraid. This is what prompted me to come to you in the first place. I don't know exactly what happened, but I'm sure that those religious zealots are the cause of all of this. Please sir, help my village.</p>

<p>Following the interview, an agreement was reached with E. Salvador. Due to the reportedly violent behavior of the villagers and as to not arouse suspicions. Foundation agents, operating under the guise of local law enforcement, were authorized to infiltrate the village. An abandonned house located on the village's outskirts was selected as a base of operations for monitoring both the village and its inhabitants. Usage of specially designed camera drones was approved by Site-34.</p>

<p>Confirmation that Agent Verdeja and Agent Breda have arrived on location. We reached A█████ at approximately 0115. Contact was established with E. Salvador, who lead us to an abandoned hunter's residence, located approximately ██ km south of the village.<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Camera-drones were dispatched to the following locations:</span><br/>
- Church - two cameras <span style="color:green">[OPERATIONAL]</span><br/>
- Village square- three cameras <span style="color:green">[OPERATIONAL]</span><br/>
- Dr. Salvador's cabinet - two cameras <span style="color:green">[OPERATIONAL]</span><br/>
- Mines - two cameras <span style="color:red">[CONTACT LOST WITH SECOND UNIT]</span><br/>
- Surrounding forest - four cameras <span style="color:green">[OPERATIONAL]</span></p>
<p>The hosts do not appear to notice the surveillance equipment. No confirmed sightings of alleged cultists and SCP-4178 occurred during the deployment phase. It is assumed that the second mine camera ventured too deep and subsequently lost signal. We will report further progress in the next scheduled update.</p>

<span style="font-size:115%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confirmation of SCP-4178 Presence.</span></span></p>
<p>At 0317, we were alerted of abnormal movement by the surveillance cameras located within the forest. Upon review, the footage showed two hunters running through the woods firing at something out of frame. Moments later, robed figures similar to the ones seen in the [LP-4178 Discovery Log] appeared into frame, chasing after them. At least one of the figures was confirmed to have been struck multiple times, showing no visible reaction. Additionally, SCP-4178 instances were also identified in the vicinity. Given these circumstances, both civilians are presumed deceased.</p>
<p>We recommend establishing a blockade around the village, extending approximately two kilometers outward from the perimeter of A█████. The possibility of additional civilians inadvertently entering the area cannot be ruled out, and any such intrusion risks compromising the operation.</p>

<span style="font-size:115%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Typical routine.</span></span></p>
<p>The first ringing of the bell occurs precisely at 0700, prompting the village to awaken. Morning is when the hosts are the most "human-like" in both behavior and movement. Most of the morning is then spent tending to agricultural tasks or house-care. Some hosts can occasionally be seen conversing with one another as if nothing was wrong. The zealots remain within the mines for most of the morning, and SCP-4178 activity is extremely low during the day.</p>
<p>At 1200, the bell rings again. At this point, the demeanor of the hosts shifts dramatically, becoming almost robotic in their movement. All hosts converge to the church to participate in the <em>"ritual de limpieza"</em> (cleansing ritual). According to our inside man, the hosts sit on the benches and listen to a sermon delivered by the zealots. At the end of the sermon, each host is made to ingest a red liquid given by the zealots. The sermon is spoken in a derivative form of Old Castilian. The following excerpt was recorded during one such sermon:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:106%;">"Somos la mente colmena.<br/>
Un colectivo de mil ojos.<br/>
Morir es vivir,<br/>
Por su conciencia.<br/>
Morir es vivir,<br/>
Por el beneplácito de Madre."</span></p>
<p>Following the cleansing ritual, the hosts proceed to the mines, where they won't be seen for the rest of the day. Late at night, they exit the mines and head directly to their homes. After this, the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>We were contacted by the doctor, according to him it was an emergency.<br/>
They had just received a phone-call from their nephew and were told that they were on their way to the village.<br/>
The best we could do was monitor the cameras placed near the forest roads; going on foot would have been too dangerous.</p>
<p>We spotted the truck around 0348 on Camera #11. Despite our warnings, the doctor left in a hurry in an attempt to intercept his nephew. Visual contact with the truck was lost shortly afterward.<br/>
We didn't hear from the doctor until about an hour later, at 0425. From what he told us, he found the truck stopped in the middle of the forest road, the engine still running. Visible signs of struggle were present on the vehicle, including a shattered windshield and SCP-4178 webbing.</p>
<p>He begged us to help search for his nephew. As much as we wanted to, we had to refuse. Since then, the doctor has been more reluctant to follow our requests and has barely left his home. We advised him to continue attending the rituals to avoid raising suspicion among the cultists.</p>

<p>The behavior of the hosts has suddenly shifted. The brief moments of "clarity" they previously exhibited during the day are now gone. Now they just stand, motionless, spread about the village for the entire day. Only moving when summoned by the church bell. They no longer sleep or visibly eat and drink, yet don't exhibit any signs of withdrawal from a lack of the aforementioned necessities.<br/>
SCP-4178 activity has increased exponentially too, camera footage shows them settling within the village's buildings during the day. Some even perch on the hosts, remaining there for extended periods of time. The cultists became more bold as well, we've observed them wandering the village as if seemingly monitoring the changes.</p>
<p>Our informant's condition is deteriorating. We assumed the sudden decline in their health was because of the loss of a close family member… However according to them, pain and nausea have returned just like before. He also reported hearing a voice speaking to him. It appears that the SCP-4178-As within them were only temporarily neutralized and are now waking up. We advised him not to try another of his "desparate cocktails" as the chance of him dying are to great.<br/>
While he attended the <em>ritual de limpieza</em> today, he overheard the cultists talk. They were talking about an important ritual, something about "preparing for her arrival". This must be what we were looking for all along. We'll be sending the doctor to the mines to set up multiple cameras inside.</p>

<p>Report 17# was the last report received from both agents. Six days later, a distress signal originating from the agents’ safe-house was detected by the nearby Site 34.<br/>
Mobile Task Force Echo-5 ("Sting Operation") was selected to evacuate the agents due to their prior experiences with SCP-4178.</p>
<p>Arriving near the village, the operatives made their way to the designated safe-house.Neither agents were within the building. The interior was trashed, with multiple signs of struggle possibly with the infected villagers or cultists.<br/>
The house of Dr. Salvador was the next place of interest to be searched. During the search, a torn page, seemingly from the doctor’s personal journal, was discovered :</p>

<p>Entering the heart of the village, it was found completely abandoned with no sign of SCP-4178 instances or any other inhabitants. Most of the buildings had been severely damaged from unknown causes.</p>
<p>Marking the mines as the next place of interest, exploration of them was initiated. Most of the mine was turned by SCP-4178 instances into large hives; multiple casualties in various state of decay were discovered. Further down the mines, a ritual chamber was found. Within the chamber laid next to an altar a total of seventeen calcinated cadavers, all but two of them were decapitated. The last two bodies were able to be identified as the missing agents, both of them had their throat slit.</p>
<p>In a corner of the room, a damaged camera was found, possibly having been placed by the doctor or agents. Although heavily damaged, most of the footage was able to be recovered:</p>

<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 11:37:46:</strong> <em>A large cavern is found at the bottom of the stairs. Several zealots can be seen on a lower platform, surrounding an altar with a body placed on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 11:39:27:</strong> <em>The doctors discreetly manoeuvres around the room to a secluded corner of the cavern. The zealots appear to be repeatedly chanting the same phrase.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zealots:</strong> [Chanting] To die is to live, to live is to die.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 11:44:12:</strong> <em>Following the source of the pulsating sound with their gaze. The doctor stumbles backward as they notice a giant cocoon hanging from the ceiling. A large number of SCP-4178 instances can be seen on the pulsating cocoon.</em></p>
<p><strong>E. Salvador:</strong> [Whispering] Dear god.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 11:49:14:</strong> <em>Looking around them, a couple of Italian tankettes from the 1930s, seemingly repurposed for mining operations after the war, are noticed by the doctor.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 12:04:46:</strong> <em>The doctor approaches the vehicles, they appear to retain their original armament.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 12:09:29:</strong> <em>Camera A is placed on the roof of the tankette. Camera A overlooks the altar down below along.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 12:26:10:</strong> <em>While attempting to leave the room, the doctor begins to violently thrash about while holding their head. The chant stops as footsteps are heard approaching the doctor.</em></p>

<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 22:55:21:</strong> <em>Feed opens up on a large group of zealots surrounding the same altar as before. Three figures can be seen in the distance held against a wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:00:00:</strong> <em>A large group of people enters the room, placing themselves around the room either side of the altar.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:07:16:</strong> <em>A cultist steps out of the mob and approaches the altar. They can be seen wearing a ceremonial gown.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> Mother’s Children, hear my voice. The day we have been waiting for, the day SHE’s been waiting for, is finally at hand.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:07:39:</strong> <em>The priest gestures towards the prisoners, they are shortly brought before the altar as the priest turns to look at the cocoon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> I am truly sorry dear doctor. We were genuinely hoping you’d come around. But thanks to you, you’ve brought right to us the last pieces for Mother’s arrival.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:10:07:</strong> <em>Agent Verdeja and Agent Breda can be identified at this point, it’s unknown how the agent’s location was discovered by the cult.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> [Gesturing to the agents] These two sacrificial flies were the final key to have Mother enter our world.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:12:45:</strong> <em>Two cultists can be seen approaching the agents.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> The mind…</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:13:26:</strong> <em>Agent Breda can be heard yelling shortly before their throat is slit open by the cultist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> …The body…</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:13:59:</strong> <em>Soon after, Agent Verdeja meets the same fate. Lite tremors can be observed at this point.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> …And you, my dear doctor, are the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:14:41:</strong> <em>As the agent’s bodies lay motionless, unknown fluids can be seen exiting them and going towards the cocoon. Upon making contact, the fluids are absorbed and the cocoon begins to crackle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> As she bridges the gap between our worlds. Those that refused Her gift will come running to your window, peering in and crying out! Only justifying their mistake to give up just that little cost of entry into her paradise.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:16:12:</strong> <em>Loud crackling sounds echo within the cavern as the cocoon breaks open.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> Oh Mother, we have guided your children as you it was foretold. Allow us to enter the heaven you promised to us. To help you spread your bliss and stay the course of your expansion ever farther.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:21:30:</strong> <em>Reality appears to distort as the Priest suddenly lifts up in the air. As they begin to speak, a different voice is heard emanating from them. An unknown darkness can be seen seeping out from the cocoon, slowly overtaking the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Priest Zealot:</strong> [Distorted Voice] Children.. I can feel you.. Mother is close to being there with you..</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:24:18:</strong> <em>Large arachnoid-like legs emerge from the cocoon as major visual distortions start to take over the footage. The legs can be seen embracing the Priest before bringing him into the cocoon.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Mother”:</strong> [Distorted] Do not be afraid… It’s all okay…</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:28:30:</strong> <em>Several cultists and villagers fall to the ground twitching in pain. All of those affected have their heads suddenly burst open as multiple SCP-4178 instances emerge from them.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Mother”:</strong> [Distorted] After all this time.. We will.. be able to shape this world.. turn it into the perfect heaven.. for our family..</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:35:07:</strong> <em>Only what is presumed to be high-ranking zealots and "chosen" hosts remain standing.</em></p>

<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:43:26:</strong> <em>The figure enters the tankette, accidentally pushing the camera which falls to the ground. The field of view is partially obstructed by the tracks of the vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:46:04:</strong> <em>A jet of flame suddenly erupts from the tankette’s armament. The hive immediately catches on fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:47:35:</strong> <em>The entity screams as the hive begins to burn, several SCP-4178 instances can be seen flying erratically in a panic. Some of the legs of the entity can be seen attempting to shield the cultists below.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Mother”:</strong> [Distorted] No! You are.. hurting them..</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:49:10:</strong> <em>The doctor exits the vehicle, facing the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Mother”:</strong> You wouldn't fathom.. the fate of the unworthy.. within the endless void..</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 23:58:17:</strong> <em>The fire reaches several dynamite stacks that were stored within the room. The video feed is knocked out by the ensuing explosion. Screaming is heard throughout.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Mother”:</strong> [Distorted] My dear children… In your vessels.. all so unbecoming.. I'll turn you all.. into a martyr.</p>
<p><strong>7-18-2004 | 00:13:07:</strong> <em>All sounds muffles as the only thing left audible is the noise of a woman crying. This repeats for the rest of the recording until the camera is damaged further by rubble.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4178.3:</strong><br/>
Further exploration revealed a network of ancient tunnels containing various archeological findings. Those revealed more about the origins of Los Cuidadores. Among the findings were numerous murals in varying states of preservation. Some depicted SCP-4178 instances, while others showed different Los Cuidadores rituals. One specific mural was noted to depict what appeared to be the entity referred to by Los Cuidadores as "Mother" seemingly facing what is presumed to be one of the castellan of the area. A family-crest bearing the words "Salvador" can be seen sketched above the castellan.</p>
