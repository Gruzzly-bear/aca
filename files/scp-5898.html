<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5898-EX is a male human. Documents found near SCP-5898-EX at the time of its discovery indicate its birth name is Ernest Whittaker, born July of 1960 in the North Kansas City Hospital. It should be noted that no copies of these documents have been located in the hospital, state, or national archives. Additionally, no relatives of SCP-5898-EX, living or dead, have been found. Investigations into SCP-5898-EX's personal life prior to its discovery in 2019 have yielded inconclusive results, although this may be due to its reclusive lifestyle as an agricultural worker.</p>
<p>All testing conducted on SCP-5898-EX<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> has revealed it to be physically and biologically non-anomalous. However, a series of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">potentially</span> anomalous events have occurred in close proximity to SCP-5898-EX since its initial discovery. As such, SCP-5898-EX was allowed limited freedoms under close supervision of its residence until the extent of its anomalous properties could be ascertained.</p>
<p>Following Incident-5898-B, SCP-5898-EX has been reclassified as Thaumiel. Refer to <strong>Addendum 5898.6</strong> for further details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreward:</strong> On 12/8/2019, SCP-5898-EX entered the Foundation front company "Smith &amp; Charles Produce", 20 miles North of Kansas City. SCP-5898-EX then briefly spoke with Agents Langston and Kazinsky, who were present at the location, before being detained and transported to Site-91.</p>
<p><strong>Agent(s) Present:</strong> Agent Brandon Langston, Agent Paul Kazinsky</p>
<p><strong>Anomaly Present:</strong> SCP-5898-EX</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> …and I told him, I told him "the worst day down in '91 is better than the best day up at Produce."</p>
<p><em>[Langston laughs.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A bell rings as SCP-5898-EX enters the store.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> <em>[Sighs]</em> Welcome to Smith &amp; Charles Produce, how can we help you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Hey fellas, my name is Ernest, Ernest Whittaker. I live, maybe a half hour's drive up the road from here. I came by last week, but y'all were closed.</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> That's uh… great, sir. Need help finding anything?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Naw, just wanted to let you guys know that I'm goin' be busy with some potentially dangerous Corn for a couple weeks, and I suggest steerin' clear of my property for a lil' bit.</p>
<p><strong>Langston:</strong> <em>[Laughs]</em> I'll make a note of it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Oh, this is a serious matter, fella. This Corn could kill someone if I mess up, yessir. Seen it happen before. Hell, I was gonna stop by the police later. See if they can set up some kind of a perimeter or something.</p>
<p><strong>Langston:</strong> What… exactly do you mean by "corn"?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> A ghastly thing, sure is. Seen it take down a whole town in a matter of hours before. Even seen a bunch of government agents show up all Men-in-Black style one year when the Corn was 'specially bad.</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> That's… odd.</p>
<p><em>[Kazinsky motions to Langston, who begins contacting Site-91 for assistance]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> <em>[Turning to leave]</em> Anyways, just wanted to give y'all a heads-up.</p>
<p><strong>Langston:</strong> <em>[Quietly speaking into a handheld radio]</em> Site-91? This is Langston over at Produce. We have a potential security breach, requesting back up…</p>
<p><em>[Kazinsky fumbles his belt for handcuffs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Hang on sir, just hold right here for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> 'Scuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> I'm uh, just going to take you to around back for a few questions.</p>
<p><em>[Kazinsky approaches SCP-5898-EX, who is handcuffed and escorted to a secure holding cell in the back of the structure.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[End Log]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-5898-EX complied with Agent Kazinsky's requests, and is detained for fifteen minutes, at which point additional agents arrive from Site-91. SCP-5898-EX is then transported to Site-91 for preliminary questioning. Agents searching the vehicle owned by SCP-5898-EX discovered several items of interest, including a birth certificate, photographs of possible relatives, and several dozen photographs, illustrations, and scientific papers of corn. Additionally, several partially damaged cobs of corn were found in the trunk. While analysis of the corn did not suggest a known cause for the damage, consumption was ruled out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreward:</strong> SCP-5898-EX was interviewed by Site-91 staff following standard humanoid testing protocols. As SCP-5898-EX tested non-anomalous in every test, SCP-5898-EX was placed in a standard interview room rather than containment. Interview is as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Sahra Penot</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-5898-EX</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Penot enters the interview room. SCP-5898-EX is seated, with its hands folded in its lap.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Hello, Mr. Whittaker, is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> That's right, ma'am. You can call me Ernest, though.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Alright, Ernest.</p>
<p><em>[Penot takes a seat opposite of SCP-5898-EX.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Let's start from the top, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> <em>[Shuffling papers]</em> Alright, have you seen anything… unusual lately? Disturbing, even?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Well, I lost my keys the other day. Spent the whole afternoon lookin' for 'em. Turns out, had 'em in my back pocket the whole time! If that's not supernatural, I don't know what is.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5898-EX laughs]</em></p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> That's… not what I meant. Do you have any interest in the paranormal?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> <em>[Pauses]</em> No, I don't really care too much for that kind of stuff. I'll believe in Sasquatch when I see him, right? Though I am a big fan of the fiction. Makes for good movies.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5898-EX laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> I'm more concerned about the corn you mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5898-EX shifts in its seat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Oh, right. I don't want to bore you with a lecture, but me and this corn have a long history. Ever since I was a boy, I've been workin' with the plants. My father taught me how to farm. Showed me how to plant 'em, taught me patience, told me not to rush 'em, that they'd grow better that way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Worked great until he passed away. Since then, the Corn ain't been what it used to. 'Stead of farmin' the corn, sometimes it feels like it's farmin' me.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> What exactly is so special about this corn?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Biggest damn nuisance on the planet. Keeps me from livin' a normal life. Every year, I gotta come up with some new rigamarole, some new ritual to make it happy.Else it <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6776">takes over</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> And what happens then?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Well then I gotta go somewhere else. The Corn always seems to follow, though.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Do you have any samples of this corn for us to look at?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Not yet, no. They'll come up later in the year. Oh, and if the Corn isn't dealt with by me and me alone, things tend to go south real fast. That's what happened last year anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> What exactly happened last year?</p>
<p><em>[Silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Mr. Whittaker? Ernest?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> <em>[Panicked]</em> They're sproutin' up, I can feel it. Been gone too long already.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Where? Where are they sprouting?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Should be at my farm. Please, I should get goin'.</p>
<p><strong>Penot:</strong> Mr. Whittaker, I'm sending a team there to check it out now, just please stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Sorry ma'am, but I gotta go now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[End Log]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-5898-EX attempted to leave the interview room. After finding it locked, it became increasingly agitated, at which point security was called. SCP-5898-EX was then restrained and moved to a temporary holding cell. SCP-5898-EX did not provide additional useful information following its relocation.</p>
<p>A team was dispatched from Site-91 to SCP-5898-EX's residence, an ~150-acre farmhouse. The property was searched, but no abnormalities were detected. Several stalks of corn were found emerging from the ground approximately 50 meters from the property's front entrance, but testing confirmed them to be non-anomalous.<br/>
<br/>
SCP-5898-EX was held at Site-91 for twenty-four hours while the property was monitored. After no additional abnormalities developed, SCP-5898-EX was allowed to return to its residence.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note From the Department of Containment</strong></p>
<p><em>Due to Ernest Whittaker's knowledge of a potential anomaly, he would usually be required to undergo standard interrogation and given an appropriate amnestic before being released somewhere far away from here. However, due to his inability to provide concrete information on his situation, the Department of Containment has decided to refrain from typical protocol at this time.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Whittaker will be tentatively designated as SCP-5898-EX until an actual anomaly can be confirmed. He will be equipped with a tracking device and monitored closely via hidden cameras located in and around his residence by Site-91 staff, and allowed to undergo his normal daily routine. Should concrete evidence of an anomaly emerge, further action will be taken. Thank you for your understanding.</em></p>

<p>On 11/09/2019, all camera feed of SCP-5898's residence, both inside and outside, were reported to have undergone technical issues.</p>
<p>A team dispatched to investigate discovered unusually dense corn growth surrounding each camera. When questioned, SCP-5898-EX apologized for the incident, stating it "took a day off". When questioned further, it claimed it wouldn't let the plant growth "blindside" it again.</p>
<p>Samples collected from the corn revealed it to be non-anomalous, despite the high likelihood of an anomaly being responsible for the incident. As such, a monitoring station, designated Barn-001<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, was constructed 100 meters from SCP-5898-EX's residence to allow for a quicker response from agents, should another incident occur, and to more closely monitor SCP-5898-EX's behavior to confirm any potential anomalies. SCP-5898-EX will be allowed to remain in its residence for the time being, as it claims "all hell will break loose" should it be prevented from completing its daily routine.</p>
<p>Following the incident, SCP-5898-EX has been observed tending to its farmland for increasingly longer periods of time each passing day, although it has yet to participate in overtly suspicious activity.</p>

<th>Event Date</th>
<th>Event Description</th>
<th>Additional Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13/11/2019</td>
<td>SCP-5898-EX observed spending 48 consecutive hours outside its residence watching a sprouting corn stalk. SCP-5898-EX occasionally made short trips into its home for food and water. After SCP-5898-EX returned to its residence, the corn stalk was analyzed and found to be severely dehydrated, but otherwise normal.</td>
<td><em>How the hell did this guy go for two straight days with nothing but some canned vegetables and sink water? Not to mention no sleep either? Notify me immediately if he does this again.</em> - Lead Researcher Penot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>24/11/2019</td>
<td>SCP-5898-EX reported leaving its residence and driving to a local <em>Farm &amp; Home Supply</em> store. As staff prepared to intervene, a handwritten note was discovered on the exterior of Barn-001 reading: "Be back soon. Need to pick up weedkiller." Staff were instructed to observe SCP-5898-EX's behavior from a distance, but not to intervene unless necessary. SCP-5898-EX purchased one container of <em>Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Concentrate Plus</em> before returning to its residence.</td>
<td><em>For the record, we've never specified the location of Barn-001 to the subject. It's possible he could have seen one of our personnel entering or leaving the station during shift rotations, but I'm going to lean on the side of caution for now. New security measures are now in the works.</em> - LR Penot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>03/01/2020</td>
<td>SCP-5898-EX observed tampering with a hidden camera facing the front door of SCP-5898-EX's residence. All four on-duty security personnel were mobilized to halt SCP-5898-EX's behavior<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Upon returning to Barn-001, security personnel noticed severe corn growths had manifested in and around the structure.</td>
<td><em>This confirms the presence of an anomaly. I'm issuing an official statement to the DoC<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> in Site-91 for SCP-5898-EX's reclassification and containment plan revision. Additionally, I'm ordering the construction of Barn-002, as Barn-001 is unusable in its current state.</em> - LR Penot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13/01/2020</td>
<td>SCP-5898-EX attempted to enter Barn-002 but was halted by security staff before it could enter the building. Upon questioning its intentions, SCP-5898-EX insisted that "the Corn's gonna get rough soon," and that "the thing with the barn's just the start." SCP-5898-EX could not provide additional details and was subsequently returned to its residence.</td>
<td><em>I'm issuing a reminder to all staff that Barn-002 should not be left unattended at any point, in case SCP-5898-EX's right and we'll be seeing an increase in corn growth in the coming weeks.</em> - LR Penot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15/01/2020</td>
<td>Sharp increase in corn growth detected over the course of several days. SCP-5898-EX observed yelling hysterics at large patches of corn. In such patches, growth was observed to slow for a period of time.</td>
<td><em>After several agents reported getting lost in "corn mazes" I'm recommending heightened caution when leaving Barn-002.</em> - LR Penot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>29/01/2020</td>
<td>After several days of no activity, SCP-5898-EX was observed exiting its premises wielding an improvised flamethrower. It then proceeded to burn various areas of dense corn growth before it was detained by security personnel. SCP-5898-EX was then held in Barn-002, awaiting transfer to Site-91 for violating the terms of its freedom<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>29/01/2020</td>
<td>Several minutes after SCP-5898-EX was placed en route to Site-91, an abnormally large cob of corn sprouted from within Barn-002, resulting in the structure's collapse. Several additional cobs of corn manifested in and around SCP-5898-EX's residence.</td>
<td><em>Containment Specialist here. Ordering the immediate return of SCP-5898-EX to its residence and the dispatch of burn crews to deal with the corn growth. Further instructions are being sent to all SCP-5898-EX staff.</em> - Containment Specialist Drew Langly</td>

<p><strong>Foreward:</strong> SCP-5898-EX was interviewed following the sharp increase in the anomalous activity around its residence. This interview was held in hopes of identifying a way to counteract or otherwise limit the spread of the anomalous plant growth. Due to the short timeframe of the situation, the interview was held in a vehicle en route to SCP-5898-EX's residence.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Containment Specialist Drew Langly</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-5898-EX</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> <em>[Shouting over the noise of the vehicle]</em> Mr. Whittaker, can you tell me clearly what exactly is going on with the corn?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Say again?</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> <em>[Louder]</em> What's the deal with the corn!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Oh, the Corn! I told y'all it was goin' get wild!</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> Clearly you don't have a grasp on the situation, or this wouldn't have happened! My team will take it from here, Mr. Whittaker!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> Don't you worry fellas, I've got it all under control! I've figured out a way to keep the Corn out for good! I'm gonna have to head out pretty soon, Corn's a bit too close for my liking, but don't you worry! You'll be in good hands!</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> Oh, you're not going anywhere! You haven't given us a clear answer to a single one of our questions! As soon as this crisis is over, you can count on getting locked up for sure!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[End Log]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-5898-EX arrived at its residence along with a containment crew armed with standard-issue flamethrowers. Although available firepower would be sufficient to control non-anomalous plant growth, the containment crew was unable to deal significant damage to the corn due to its alarming rate of regrowth. Containment Specialist Langly delivered an emergency notice to Site-91, and additional resources were dispatched. SCP-5898-EX failed to provide useful knowledge to combat the plant growth during the incident.</p>

<p><strong>Foreward:</strong> The following is a transcript of Incident-5898-B captured from the body-worn camera of Agent Paul Kazinsky.</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Containment Specialist Drew Langly</p>
<p><strong>Anomaly Involved:</strong> SCP-5898-EX</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Begin Log]</strong></p>
<p><em>[All personnel arrive at the residence of SCP-5898-EX and disembark the transport vehicle. The entirety of the property is overgrown with corn. Several enormous cobs of corn are visible above the fields.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Alright, arch up, standard formation!</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Voices:</strong> Copy!</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Squad, up ahead.</p>
<p><em>[Unintelligible]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Yeah, over by the corn. Keep a distance, though.</p>
<p><em>[Unintelligible]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Alright, prep flamethrowers. <em>[To Langly]</em> On your word, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> Mr. Whittaker, anything you want to say before we light this stuff up?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> If y’all were payin’ any attention, fire doesn’t work too well. Give me another day and I’ll sort this mess out, promise!</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> I’ve had enough of this. Kazinsky, fire away!</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> You heard him. All units, fire!</p>
<p><em>[Several seconds of radio silence as the containment crew engages the corn growths. Damage sustained by the corn is mitigated by its anomalous regrowth.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Unintelligible]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Look out! Watch our flank!</p>
<p><em>[Corn begins sprouting from beneath members of the containment crew.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Squad, fall back! We need more space!</p>
<p><strong>Langly:</strong> What’s happening, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Unknown, sir. I suggest you stay behind me─</p>
<p><em>[Langly, along with several members of the containment crew, are separated from Kazinsky by a dense wall of corn.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Unintelligible]</em></p>
<p><em>[An enormous cob of corn rapidly grows overhead, blocking out the sun.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Call for backup, quickly!</p>
<p><strong>Unidentified:</strong> Can’t, sir! Radio contact’s lost!</p>
<p><em>[Unintelligible. Screams are heard before being abruptly cut off.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Brandon! <em>Shit</em>. Squad! Regroup!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-5898-EX is seen on the ground, clutching two cobs of corn.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Hey Whittaker! Get up! We’re moving!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5898-EX:</strong> You’ve had your way far too long, ya hear! Wait ‘till ya get a taste of <em>modern farmin’</em>!</p>
<p><em>[A high-pitched screech is heard from an unidentified source.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> The hell? Hey, watch out!</p>
<p><em>[Corn rapidly materializes around SCP-5898-EX, crushing it under its weight.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Leave him, we've got to move!</p>
<p><em>[Kazinsky turns to run, but is tripped by corn growth and falls, landing on his forearms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> Agh! <em>[motioning]</em> Go! Go on without me!</p>
<p><em>[Kazinsky rolls over, tearing corn growth from his body.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> <em>[Breathing heavily]</em> Death by corn, eh? Not so bad…</p>
<p><em>[A bright light is seen emerging from underneath a mass of corn.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> What the─</p>
<p><em>[The camera is obscured by white light. When clarity is restored, corn growths around Kazinsky have been substantially reduced. Projectiles of corn are seen being launched away, the source of which is an unidentified object obscured by white light.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> What in God's name is…</p>
<p><em>[The light subsides, and a</em> John Deere S700 Series Combine Harvester <em>is seen materializing. The</em> Harvester <em>activates. No driver is visible.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Kazinsky:</strong> How the Hell did that─ <em>[audio is overpowered by the sounds of heavy machinery]</em></p>
<p><em>[Plant matter begins to rain down from corn stalks above. Several screeches are heard as plant growth congregates around the</em> Harvester<em>. After eight minutes, an explosion of light is seen and camera feed is lost.]</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> <em>SCP-5898-EX displayed aggressive and potentially catastrophic properties during Incident-5898-B. Things would have gone poorly if it weren't for the appearance of an additional anomaly, which spontaneously manifested during the incident and automatically began neutralizing instances of anomalously altered plant matter. The object has since been contained and designated as SCP-5898-PRIME. Despite SCP-5898-PRIME's effectivity in eliminating said plant life, trace amounts of similar growths have been detected across the greater Kansas City area. As such, I am designating the anomalous corn growth as SCP-████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> . Containment procedures have been altered accordingly. As for SCP-5898-EX proper, we found no trace of it at the location of the incident. Until SCP-5898-EX can be located, it is to be listed MIA. If it's out there, we'll find it.</em><br/>
