<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9856 is to be kept in a standard item storage locker. Under no circumstances is it to be played outside of testing. All tests must be approved by Dr. Landon Pierce.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9856 is a two minute long song recorded on a cassette tape. The song is sung in an unknown language by a single female voice. In the background, songbirds, wind, and footsteps are audible. When SCP-9856 is played, strawberry plants<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> rapidly grow from the source of the recording. As testing is still ongoing, the full capabilities of SCP-9856 are currently unknown.</p>

<p>Location of SCP-9856's discovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9856 was discovered by MTF Theta-4 ("Gardeners") after intercepting a 911 call placed at 1:40 PM local time on 3/20/2023. The caller reported sighting rapid plant growth and flashing lights in a greenhouse outside of Jefferson City, Missouri. When Theta-4 arrived at the greenhouse, they found it overrun with strawberry plants. Inside the greenhouse were dozens of speakers of different kinds, each playing SCP-9856 at a high volume. The tape containing SCP-9856 was then recovered by Theta-4, and brought to Biological Containment Site-66 for further testing.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9856.1:</strong> After the submission and approval of his proposals, Jr. Researchers Kyle Myers and Giselle Tomazini began their experiments on SCP-9856. Results from these experiments are below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPERIMENT 1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE: 4/8/2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERFORMED BY: Junior Researchers Kyle Myers and Giselle Tomazini</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TEST:</strong> SCP-9856 is inserted into a cassette player, which is connected to a speaker. This speaker is placed in a growbed within Site-66's safe class greenhouse. SCP-9856 is played.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Ten seconds into SCP-9856, sprouts of <em>Fragaria × ananassa</em> begin to rapidly grow from the speaker, then spread onto the soil. Strawberry plants grow from the speaker, blossoming and bearing fruit as the song progresses. Forty six seconds into the song, the plants grow until the plastic bulges, then breaks. The speaker was rendered unusable, and disposed of.</p>
<hr/></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPERIMENT 2</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE: 4/9/2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERFORMED BY: Junior Researcher Kyle Myers</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TEST:</strong> To attempt to stop plant growth within speakers playing SCP-9856, the speaker was laid face down into the soil.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Rapid growth of strawberries began within the speaker, causing it to short circuit only fifteen seconds into the song. Test considered a failure.</p>
<hr/></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPERIMENT 3</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE: 4/9/2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERFORMED BY: Junior Researcher Kyle Myers</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TEST:</strong> To attempt to stop plant growth within speakers playing SCP-9856, the speaker was buried within the growbed.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Soil filled the speaker, rendering it incapable of playing SCP-9856. The test was ruled another failure.</p>
<hr/></div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPERIMENT 4</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE: 4/11/2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERFORMED BY: Junior Researcher Giselle Tomazini</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TEST:</strong> Two speakers playing SCP-9856 are set at opposite ends of a grow bed. SCP-9856 is played.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Plant growth begins with small sprouts within the speaker itself, but as SCP-9856 continues, plant growth is observable within the growbed itself instead of being confined to the inside of the speaker. Plants from speaker A grew towards speaker B, and vice versa. Growth persisted from both speakers, with the plants growing towards the source of SCP-9856. Growth ended when SCP-9856 reached its conclusion, with both speakers intact. Test is considered successful.</p>

<p><strong>TEST:</strong> Two speakers were set on opposite sides of a grow bed, facing towards one another. Acoustic foam was placed between the speakers and the soil filling the growbed.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Plant growth begins approximately ten seconds in, but is confined to the speakers. While the song may be the catalyst of SCP-9856, it does not spread unless there is another source of vibration close by.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>TEST:</strong> SCP-9856 is played and recorded by a standard Foundation PAD, and saved as a digital file. This file is played through two speakers on opposite sides of the growbed.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> SCP-9596 begins to play, causing strawberry plants to grow rapidly towards opposite speakers. Audio format does not affect SCP-9856‘s behavior.</p>

<p><strong>TEST:</strong> SCP-9856 is played at twice the normal speed from speakers on opposite sides of the growbed, to observe whether or whether not that would affect growth speed.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Technical difficulties prevented the experiment from being conducted. The speakers that had been requisitioned for this experiment were damaged internally. I have placed a requisition order for more speakers.</p>

<hr/>
<p><em>[Interior footage of Bio Site-66's cafeteria, a large open room full of rows of tables. People queue in line for food at long counters, then walk to their tables to eat. The room is loud with chatter.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Giselle Tomazini walks from the line with a tray of food in her hands. She waves to someone before sitting at a table, alone. At this point, she reaches into her bag. She takes her headphones out, and puts them on. Pulling out her phone, she plugs the headphones in. After a few moments of scrolling, she frowns. She taps on her screen.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Tomazini's eyes widen. Her phone clatters onto the floor. She grabs her headphones, attempting to pull them off. She pulls, barely separating the headphones from her skin. Thin green shoots become visible.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Her arms spasm, and she collapses onto the ground, twitching. Bystanders shout, several rushing from their seats to circle around Tomazini. She thrashes uncontrollably, before going rigid. Tomazini gasps for breath. She chokes, lips starting to pale.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A bystander attempts to wrench the headphones off of her head, but is unable to due to the thick plant growth. Tomazini screams. Leaves are visible in the back of her throat, clogging her airway.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Internal pressure shatters her nose from the inside. Blood pours down her face and onto the floor, pooling around her rapidly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The skin above her sinuses begin to swell as more strawberry plants force their way deeper into her skull. Her nose stops bleeding, now staunched by roots rapidly growing into nearby blood vessels.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A green stalk rises from her left tear duct, then another, and another. The groaning of strained bone and cartilage becomes audible. Tomazini whimpers.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Tomazini's skull cracks open in several places. Grey matter, blood, and strawberry plants mix with chunks of bone and hair. SCP-9856 is audible, and plants continue to grow from her headphones, out of her skull, and into the floor. The bystanders around her step back. Blood soaks their shoes.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Site security arrives, and confirms time of death at 12:31 PM standard time.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum.9856.3:</strong> After the incident on 4/29/2023, an investigation into Jr. Rsr. Tomazini's cause of death began. A recording of SCP-9856 was found on Jr. Researcher Tomazini's phone, sent to her via email on an unknown account. The email was later traced to Jr. Researcher Kyle Myers.</p>
<p>Jr. Researcher Myers was apprehended by Site security and confessed to sending the file to Jr. Researcher Tomazini. A day later, he was transferred to Area-06 due to suspected cognitohazard exposure. SCP-9856 was also sent to Area-06 for further testing.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that SCP-9856 has a secondary anomaly; a memetic compulsion agent that instills homicidal thoughts into the listener, compelling them to kill any others who had listened to the song. This manifested as sending Jr. Rsr. Tomazini the SCP-9856 file.</p>
<p>Because of the change in circumstance, Jr. Researcher Myers has been cleared of all charges relating to Jr. Researcher Tomazini's death.</p>
