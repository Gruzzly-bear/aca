</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-518 is contained within a refrigerated unit inside Site-19’s morgue.</p>
<p>While standard cover-up procedure was observed during SCP-518’s inciting incident, Foundation WebCrawlers are to monitor for combinations of relevant keywords used in conjunction with one another. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>”Westmoreland Elementary”</li>
<li>”Field Day”</li>
<li>"80s”</li>
<li>”Police”</li>
<li>”Monster”</li>
<li>”Creature”</li>
<li>”Muppet”</li>
</ul>
<p>And other tangentially related lexemes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-518 is the carcass of an entity similar in appearance to a full-bodied "Muppet" character.</p>
<p>SCP-518 is 2.1 meters in height, with dark green fur, yellow horns, and an orange, pear-shaped nose. Stylistically, SCP-518 possesses the visual language and aesthetics of a Muppet creation, but does not correspond to any existing character from the franchise or other puppet-adjacent media.</p>
<p>Chemical analysis has revealed that SCP-518’s body is composed of miscellaneous materials, including reticulated polyfoam, antron fleece, and wool. Autopsy has found clusters of these materials inside the body, giving the entity mass in regions where other suit-puppets would be hollow to accommodate human performers.</p>
<p>Following Incident-518, SCP-518 ceased to exhibit any sign of function. SCP-518 does not decompose, yet standard cooling temperature (2.5°C) is still maintained within its container. Thorough analysis of SCP-518’s internals has raised questions about the nature of its biology, as there is little to differentiate SCP-518 from an inanimate object. While the Foundation did not observe SCP-518 in an active state, accounts from Incident-518 corroborated that the entity was mobile and demonstrated apparent consciousness prior to its ‘death’.</p>
<p>SCP-518 had sustained significant damage <em>ante mortem</em>. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puncture wounds on the left hand, as deep as 7.7 cm in diameter</li>
<li>Twenty two entry and exit wounds within the torso and upper body areas</li>
<li>Blunt trauma resulting in polyfoam fractures in the back, leg, and head areas</li>
<li>Laceration on the right shoulder area, incised wound travels to upper-right torso</li>
<li>Evidence of attempted ligature strangulation around the neck, possibly ineffective due to lack of discernible respiratory systems</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-518’s body was discovered on 1986/9/25 in Newton, Iowa, within Westmoreland Elementary’s school library, following a 2-hour siege on the school carried out by local law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-518.1:</strong> Testimonials</p>
<p>The following are abbreviated testimonials from civilian interviews conducted by the Foundation during its assessment of Incident-518, dated 1986/9/25.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Charles Poyke, Age 4, Preschooler at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><em>After being placated and relaxed, Poyke is asked to give an account of the events related to Incident-518.</em></p>
<p><strong>Poyke:</strong> Uh, we were with Miss Teller. And we were watching a movie. […] It was Muppets. They were dancing to a song. One of the Muppets came in front of the other ones and was dancing too. […] He was dancing in front of them. […] The other ones were dancing and then they stopped. The green one didn't stop. They looked angry at him. And then the green one stopped dancing.</p>
<p>The green one just looked at them and then he looked at us and then his hand came out of the TV. He came out of the TV. (<em>Poyke becomes visibly angry</em>) So we ran around and he ran too. Everyone yelled like (<em>Poyke yells</em>). And it was scary, he was a bad monster.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Sophia Teller, Age 28, Preschool Teacher at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>Teller:</strong> It was supposed to be a field day. Some classes were out, but we were waiting to be called. So I rolled in the TV and put something on for them. Uh, one of the maintenance guys had some stuff he recorded on tape, so I picked one of those. Muppets, they like the Muppets. I like the Muppets. I’m doing my planner and all of the sudden I hear them screaming and I look up and there’s— there’s a fucking guy in a Muppet costume in my classroom. I couldn’t even— I don’t know how they got there. It didn’t— it makes no sense. I jump, and I just— I grabbed the hole punch and threw it at him. Probably made things worse but I had no clue what was happening. I just started screaming at the kids to run. We ran out of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Isabelle Nunez, Age 9, 3rd Grader at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>Nunez:</strong> I was waiting to use the bathroom and they all came running out of the class. And this guy in a… like a green guy in a costume is chasing them. I didn’t even know what to think, I thought it was a game they were playing. I don’t think it was chasing them, because they ran one way and then the guy ran away from them, and then down the hall where I was. […] It was making like, a cartoon voice sound. Like (<em>Nunez growls</em>). Teachers started looking out of their classrooms and they started yelling and there was just— there was so much happening. I felt like I needed to do something but I was so scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Marcus Slausen, Age 45, Gym Teacher at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>Slausen:</strong> I tackled the fucker. I knew something was wrong, instantly. Kids running and teachers shouting for help and— I was in the halls, so I tackled the fucking thing. I tried pulling the— you know, the mask off the suit, but he managed to knock me off and he ran down the hall. I have no fucking clue what this guy was doing or how he even got in but I wanted to make sure he wasn’t making it out. So this guy runs into the library and I grab one of those big, big encyclopedias near the entrance and I chuck it at his head. Goes down instantly. Kids are screaming, the teachers in there are screaming, so I yell “Hey, help me!” I needed help restraining this guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Christine Locusky, Age 58, 8th Grade Teacher at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>Locusky:</strong> We just… uh, we all started kicking the shit out of this guy, for lack of a better word. Mark was on top of him, just punching him and I was in the library too so I joined in. I knew instantly that this guy was doing something he shouldn’t have been. I needed to protect my kids, that was my first priority. So I grabbed a chair and just pummeled him with it. Julia and Leonard come over, they join in. We’re all just beating and beating on this guy— I don’t know if he was, like, a pedophile or what but, he shouldn’t have been in a school. I had a pencil in my pocket and I just stabbed him with it— only thing I could think of. It went like, right through the hand. Like (<em>gestures a puncturing woun</em>d)</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Julia House, Age 37, 5th Grade Teacher at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> I jumped right into action. I pulled a bookcase down on him. Crushed him. He’s still wiggling around and trying to get out but he was crushed under there. Pokes his head out and I grab the shawl that I have on. (<em>gestures</em>) This one. And I wrap it around the neck of the costume and I’m just trying to strangle the guy. Get him to pass out or something. The kids— I think it was a first grade class in there— they were in tears, freaked the hell out. But I had to stop him somehow. This was a very, very large man and I don’t know what he was capable of. […] He did not pass out. He got back up and then, uh, Leonard got him in the shoulder with a pair of scissors.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Harry Van Horton, Age 27, Newton, Iowa Law Enforcement Officer</p>
<p><strong>Horton:</strong> We thought it was a joke at first. Guy in a costume running around a school. We weren’t even going to go but the Chief said “no, you better send someone out there”, so we did. Thank God. Uh, we went inside and they had this guy cornered in the library. He locked himself in a little personal bathroom in there and they couldn’t get in. Um, so we called for backup and then we moved all of the kids out. It wasn’t that bad since most of the kids were outside for their field day anyways, but we made sure to get all of the kids and teachers out. Took like an hour, while the rest of us posted outside the bathroom. He wasn’t coming out. No luck, he just keeps growling or whatever. There’s clearly something wrong with him. And I’m thinking it’s some fucking homeless guy, clearly, or— or someone who just isn’t all there. So we kick the door down and as soon as I saw him I just— I don’t know, something in my brain was telling me this guy was bad news. All of us fucking unload into this freak. Like, thirty or forty shots.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Sarah Bowens, Age 5, Kindergarten Student at Westmoreland Elementary</p>
<p><strong>Bowens:</strong> I saw them beating the monster up.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did that make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>Bowens:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Bowens:</strong> He was bad.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Bowens:</strong> He looked bad. And he wasn’t supposed to be here.</p>
</div>
<p>Investigation of the tape students were shown found an ordinary broadcast capture of an episode of <em>The Muppet Show</em>. There are no onscreen resemblances to SCP-518.</p>
<p>As frequent collaborators with the SCP Foundation, GoI-402, the Jim Henson Company, was contacted for inquiry regarding SCP-518. A liaison between the two organizations vehemently denied prior knowledge of SCP-518, and expressed a disdain for several aesthetic elements on the entity itself, citing poor craftsmanship and a lack of "personality".</p>
<p>A study attempting to find compulsory effects related to SCP-518, specifically its ontological or moral perception when viewed, has yielded no discernible results. Several Foundation medical examiners and pathologists have nonetheless displayed unusually callous handling of SCP-518’s body during postmortem analysis.</p>
