<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A single instance of SCP-9126 is to be contained in a glass insect terrarium located inside a standard animal containment chamber at Site-66 and provided with sustenance appropriate for its species.</p>
<p>Only one researcher is to be assigned to the anomaly at any given time. This researcher is to maintain and regularly (at least once per day) check a detailed list of ideas they personally associate with the anomaly, each of which must contain references to other concepts. Should the researcher identify the object with a concept not pertaining to the anomalous, they are to immediately report for reassignment. When an entry in the list no longer appears sensical, the researcher must immediately use the associated references to reconstruct the idea. They must then terminate all but one instance of SCP-9126 in the containment chamber.</p>
<p>Reconstructed ideas are to be immediately uploaded to the SCiPNet database and disseminated to all personnel who are known to have previously worked with them, or who report confusion about suddenly forgetting an idea they were previously familiar with.</p>
<p>In the event that an idea known outside anomalous organizations is erased, a containment breach is to be declared. The presiding Site Director and senior staff must be immediately informed of the nature of the anomaly in order to coordinate a response.</p>
<p>When the assigned researcher is reassigned from SCP-9126, they are to be administered Class-C amnestics in order to remove all memory of it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9126 is an anomalous subspecies of the ichneumon wasp <em>Podogaster Cactorum</em>. SCP-9126 instances appear identical to their non-anomalous counterparts, and behave mostly identically as well.</p>
<p>SCP-9126 instances' anomalous properties become apparent in their reproductive cycle. All instances are female, and they do not mate or lay eggs. Instead, once an instance reaches sexual maturity it will land and go through the motions of stinging and ovipositing in prey, despite no prey being present. It will die soon after. 10 to 15 days after this occurs, a small number<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> of new SCP-9126 instances will crawl out of apparently-empty space near the instance that initiated the event.</p>
<p>When this occurs, a single idea will be erased from collective understanding. All humans<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> will no longer be able to name or explain the idea, although those familiar with it may be able to reference it nonspecifically. All written or otherwise recorded namings or explanations of the idea will remain unmodified, but anyone accessing them will not be able to comprehend them. Testing indicates that the ideas targeted by the anomaly are consistently those that observers closely associate with it. Affected ideas can be reconstructed given information connected to them. Anyone who reconstructs an erased idea or learns it via a reconstructed source can understand it as normal.</p>
<p>SCP-9126 was discovered in [REDACTED], Brazil, after a Foundation webcrawler detected an unusual missing persons case filed in the city. All persons that claimed to know the missing individual were unable to produce their name, or any other identifying information. A vacant apartment whose tenant was similarly unidentifiable was found by investigating field agents. 22 living instances of SCP-9126 were found in a terrarium in the apartment, as well as at least 40 deceased instances. Fragmented remains of further deceased instances were found in a nearby garbage bin. SCP-9126 is believed to have been created by the missing person that previously inhabited the apartment, an unidentified anartist designated PoI-9126-1.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> A notebook, presumably belonging to PoI-9126-1, was recovered along with the initial instances of SCP-9126. Several of the pages were entirely covered in ink. The legible portions are included below, although some words were blotted out.</p>

<p>Entry #1:<br/>
New project, new notebook!<br/>
████ wasn't my finest work, but I've got a real humdinger of an idea this time. An ontological parasite is a concept that needs to be attached to another concept to exist. Were you to extrapolate that to other forms of symbiosis, you might imagine an "ontological parasitoid". Not just that, though. There could be a whole host of what I'll call "█████".</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #2:<br/>
The theory should be simple. If a mundane parasitoid is brought to ████ quickly enough, with the right ████, it could develop a taste for concepts, so to speak. Something like this'll really put me on the map with █████.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #3:<br/>
Setting to work on it. I can feel the ███ already.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #5:<br/>
It's done, I think. Now to wait.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #7:<br/>
It finally did something!<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems I erred in my definition of "concept". I intended it to parasitize objects at a conceptual level, but nothing disappeared. What <em>did</em> happen is I forgot everything about my last work. New wasps appeared, too. I'll have to cull them regularly.<br/>
This isn't what I wanted, but I'll still talk to █████. Maybe he'll still be impressed? I just hope he's not sick of me yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #8:<br/>
Called █████. Explained the project. He actually sounded excited about something for once. I'll find a way to show it off to him ASAP.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #10:<br/>
I forgot <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">K</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">E</span> him. His phone number, his address, his name, his face. All meaningless.<br/>
I'm killing them before they can take anything else.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #11:<br/>
They're dead, but their eggs aren't. I'll have to kill the new ones too. Just hoping they take small things. Maybe I can ████?</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #13:<br/>
I could've destroyed the eggs with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">t</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a</span><br/>
But that's gone too.<br/>
How many are left?</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #16:<br/>
My old notes don't make sense anymore. I'll survive this, but my work won't.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Entry #17:<br/>
I don't want to look back anymore. I've blacked out what I lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>A man with a familiar face came to my door. He knew my name.<br/>
The first thing he asked was:<br/>
"Who am I?"</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Who am I?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

PoI-9126-1 has not been found. The man mentioned in the notebook, designated PoI-9126-2, is also unaccounted for. Locating and apprehending these two persons is to be a top priority, assuming they remain alive and aware of SCP-9126's existence.
