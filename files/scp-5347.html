<p>A Manifestation of SCP-5347-1 off the coast of Carpenteria, California (Right).</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5347</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Gödel-Euclid</span> Gödel-Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5347-1 is currently uncontainable by Foundation efforts due to the failsafes of those who did not flee to the <strong><span style="color: green">arboraceous nomenclative hazard</span></strong>, though it is largely contained by the effects of SCP-5347-2. Photographic and visual evidence of SCP-5347-1 has been discredited due to its resemblence to a <em>Fata Morgana</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and entry to SCP-5347-1 has been deemed impossible by any means outside of SCP-5347-2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-5347-2 is known only to occult groups and thus requires no special containment procedures.</span> <span style="color: blue">The proliferation of an unrelated non-anomalous meme has made a part of SCP-5347-2's procedure a common phrase in certain communities, and as such has led to an exponential increase in victims of SCP-5347-2 since May 2020.</span> New information regarding the procedures of SCP-5347-2 should be reported to the SCP-5347 Research Head.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5347-1 is a partially-submerged island off the coast of <a href="/a-foul-storm-in-a-fair-land">Hy-Brasil</a>. Due to the transitive nature of Hy-Brasil itself, SCP-5347-1 has appeared at multiple locations, usually appearing approximately 3 nautical miles off the coast of a calm and temperate beach. Attempts to approach SCP-5347-1 by any form of non-anomalous travel has been deemed impossible, as despite attempting to approach SCP-5347-1, any vehicles or persons appear to move in place approximately 1 mile from SCP-5347-1. SCP-5347-1 will maintain its position for exactly 3, 5, 13, or 17 days before disappearing under heavy fog.</p>
<p>SCP-5347-1 uniformly manifests with identical topology and size. Slight shifts, such as felled trees, fishing nets, and small signal or cooking fires indicate individuals sent to SCP-5347-1 remain active between manifestations. Sub-surface imaging has revealed <a href="/scp-2932">large cocoon-like pods</a> attached to the island's coast.</p>
<p>SCP-5347-2 is a series of thaumic rituals and triggers which, when enacted properly, teleport an individual to SCP-5347-1. The current specifics of SCP-5347-2 are unknown, though certain aspects and phrases have been identified in <a href="/taboo">Document Hayforth-ESHU</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Findings of Document Hayforth-ESHU</strong> was a book obtained from college student and amateur occultist Vanessa Hayforth following her 1966 entry to the <strong><span style="color: green">Pseudonymous Timberland</span></strong>. It described several occult rituals, including some mentions of SCP-5347-2. Much of the document's mentions were unclear, but the following mentions could be gleaned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be painted with ceremonial tattoos and markings. This is believed to be a purely ceremonial aspect of the ritual, as no victims of SCP-5347-2 have been known to have been painted with such markings.</li>
<li>The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be of fae bloodlines, or have had their ancestors sworn to a fae blood pact - due to the proliferation of fae geneology during the first occult war, approximately 70% of humans alive today are believed to have trace amounts of fae blood.</li>
<li>The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be within <em>"three times five times 13 times 17 Deiscéim"</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> of the current manifestation of SCP-5347-1.</li>
<li>The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be told the exact phrase "<span class="bblock"><strong>You are going to Hy-Brasil</strong></span>"</li>

<strong>Addendum 1:</strong> In early 2020, a non-anomalous image macro was proliferated around the internet with unfortunate similarity to the specific trigger phrase of SCP-5347-2. Due to this, an on-going coverup campaign is in progress.<br/>
