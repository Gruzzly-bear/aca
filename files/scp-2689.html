<p>SCP-2689 in containment</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2689 is to be kept in a standard fish tank located at <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169">Site-169's</a> break room. Attempts to accumulate other possible instances have been abandoned per order of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED) due to their non-disruptive nature.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2689 designates a male blood parrot cichlid,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><em>Amphilophus citrinellus × Vieja melanurus</em></span> more colloquially referred to as "Percy" by Foundation personnel. Physically, it is similar to other non-anomalous members of its species.</p>
<p>SCP-2689's main abnormality is its ability to induce a slightly heightened level of motivation and serenity in those who observe the specimen.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">This anomaly is also present in recordings and photographs.</span> This effect lasts for approximately ten minutes following cessation of visual contact. It is presently unknown how SCP-2689 possessed these unusual properties, though investigation into its origins has been denied for the time being.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-2689 was initially obtained at an annual festival that was held within <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sun-talk">Prescott Valley,</a> when Dr. Mayfield won the anomaly at one of the town's stalls. Although, its anomalous properties would not be discovered until her decision to transfer SCP-2689 to Site-169 a week afterward.</p>
<p>As a result of its relocation, personnel and anomaly morale had increased considerably. Research into the cause revealed SCP-2689's abnormal qualities, subsequently leading to its official designation as an SCP object.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>»AUDIO LOG«</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following is a recording log of Drs. Kirby Case and Melissa Mayfield's conversation regarding SCP-2689's retrieval. Footage was taken within the facility's break room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>(The two are staring at SCP-2689, which is swimming around in its tank. Case is sipping from their coffee mug while Mayfield is wiping her spectacles.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> So you got this guy at the festival?</p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> Hm? Oh, yeah. I got it from a stall. It's a game where you catch fish with a paper net. First try, too.</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Really now? Good for you.</p>
<p><em>(Case pauses then chuckles. Mayfield raises an eyebrow.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> What's so funny?</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Ah, nothing. It's that… (<em>chuckles</em>) I'm just picturing a grown woman like you participating in such a game. Somehow, it fits.</p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> Oh, be quiet! Can't a woman enjoy her free time? I managed to scoop up Percy here too.</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> I know, I know. I don't mean to offend.</p>
<p><em>(Mayfield puts on her glasses.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> I'm surprised you had the time to even go to the festival. Don't you usually have a tight schedule?</p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> I'm not the only counselor here, Kirby. My kindness just overtakes my will for free time.</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> (<em>Scoffs</em>) Well, aren't you so noble?</p>
<p><em>(The both of them laugh.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> You think there are others like Percy? Shouldn't we do something about that?</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Ah, no worries. Even if there are similar ones, I doubt they would be a worry any time soon. They're just fishes, after all.</p>
<p><em>(Case looks over the various items surrounding SCP-2689's tank: Drawings of the specimen, aquatic-themed decorations, and photographs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Besides, it'd break my heart to steal them from other people. We're not the only caretakers out there, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> Heh, you can say that again.</p>
<p><em>(Case takes another sip.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> (<em>Sighs</em>) Man, I should really stop and enjoy times like these. Sitting here, having a nice cup of joe—</p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> Eyeing on the… hm… the happy fish? Yeah, the happy fish.</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Very happy fish, indeed.</p>
<p><em>(The two laugh, focusing on SCP-2689.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> But yeah, I agree… sometimes it's all about the little things.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-2689 briefly faces the both of them before swimming off.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mayfield:</strong> (<em>Quietly</em>) …All the little things in life.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Event Reminder!</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>This is just a reminder that we'll be having an upcoming welcoming party for our dear fish Percy. Make sure you wear clothes fit for the party's theme: 'Under the Sea'.</p>
<p>It will also serve as a commemoration for him, for bringing us just a little spark of positivity every once in a while. And obviously because I want my fish (that's right, <em>my</em> fish) to have a grand time here at the facility.</p>
<p>With that said, we'll see you there. Have a fishtastic day, everyone!</p>
