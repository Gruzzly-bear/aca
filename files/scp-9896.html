<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Members of SCP-9896 are to be kept at Site-43. Requests for their use must be submitted to the O4 Council. Members of SCP-9896 are to be given Level-1 access to the facilities of Site-43. Members of SCP-9896 are not allowed to interact with their baseline counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9896 is a group of six individuals who spontaneously manifested on October 27, 2025, in Vancouver, Canada. The group claims to be “The Hero’s Party” that slayed “The Demon King” in the First Occult War. Records from the time period are inaccurate but do attest to the existence of such a party. The group also claims to be time-displaced Foundation employees from Site-27. This is corroborated by DEEPWELL, which shows the disappearance of eight individuals from a previous iteration’s Site-27. It is highly likely that SCP-9896’s presence in the past created a different future, the current baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Members of SCP-9896:</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-1:</strong> “The Mage”—Dr. Enjae Song. Baseline Enjae Song is deceased, having committed suicide in 2022. SCP-9896-1 claims to have been the Deputy-Director of the Department of Philosophy, a department which was disbanded in baseline. SCP-9896-1 is an exceptionally capable thaumaturge, among the most capable ever recorded. She claims to be substantially weakened after the battle with “The Demon King.”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-2:</strong> “The Healer”—Dr. Uday Skull. Baseline Dr. Uday Skull is employed by the Foundation’s Department of Biology and married to Dr. William Roux of the same department. SCP-9896-2 claims to have been the Co-Director of the Department of Theoretical Biology with Dr. William Roux. SCP-9896-2 is capable of manipulating the “vital force” of any living organism. He is effectively capable of healing any wound, though claims to have been able to “improve” upon living beings prior to the battle with “The Demon King.”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-3:</strong> “The Thief”—Dr. Neil Ghost. Baseline Dr. Neil Ghost is the Director of Site-23. SCP-9896-3 claims to have been the Director of Site-27. SCP-9896-3 is completely invisible and can make anything he touches invisible. SCP-9896-3 has a constantly festering wound in his torso that he claims to have suffered in the battle with “The Dragon.”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-4:</strong> “The Shield”—Pablo Marquez. Baseline Pablo Marquez works as a plumber in Chicago, notable for being the brother of Tony Marquez, D-11424. SCP-9896-4 claims to have been an agent of the Foundation. SCP-9896-4 is anomalously durable and can heal any wound.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-5:</strong> “The Guide”—Arthur Kayley. Baseline Arthur Kayley works for Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. SCP-9896-5 claims to have been an agent of the Foundation. SCP-9896-5 has superhuman attributes and, according to him, an “uncannily good” sense of direction. This sense does not substantially depart from normality.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-6:</strong> “The Knight”—Myrna Chao. Baseline Dr. Myrna Gears is deceased. She was employed by the Foundation’s Department of Containment and married to Dr. Charles Gears. She was killed by Dr. Iceberg in 1999. Her daughter, Alison Chao, is a Person of Interest, the “Black Queen.” SCP-9896-6 claims to have been a Foundation employee, heading Site-27’s Research and Containment Section. She had separated from Dr. Gears and raised Alison alone. SCP-9896-6 has superhuman attributes and owns SCP-9896-A-2, which she calls “The Hero’s Sword,” an anomaly with similar properties to SCP-6500-α-Sword.</p>
<p><strong>Two Associated Anomalies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-A:</strong> “The Hero” [Deceased]—Katherine Osmanski. Baseline Katherine Osmanski is employed as a Foundation agent at Site-120. According to SCP-9896, SCP-9896-A was an agent of the Foundation working at Site-27. SCP-9896-A was supposedly a great warrior who sacrificed herself to slay “The Dragon.”</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9896-B:</strong> “The Demon King” [Deceased]—Dr. Jihoon Jang. Baseline Dr. Jihoon Jang is a Level-5 Foundation employee. According to SCP-9896, SCP-9896-B was the Director of the Department of Linguistics. SCP-9896-B arrived several decades before the rest of the Site-27 employees and set about attempting to conquer the world. He was killed by the members of SCP-9896.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews:</strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Nhung Ngo (Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology Section, Site-43)</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Arthur Kayley (SCP-9896-5, “The Guide”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> Super. You know what they didn’t have thousands of years ago? Soft beds. Haven’t slept so well in years.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Why do they call you “The Guide”?</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> Because I always find the way. Nah, in all seriousness, I just got the short end of the stick. Others got the cool names, and I got stuck with coming up with something not stupid. I like maps, so I led us around on our little adventure and called myself the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Let’s talk about Katherine. From what I understand, you two were close, right?</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> Not romantically or anything. No, we were…Katherine was…She was the best agent I’d ever met. Strong, confident, ok, maybe I was a little in love with her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> The others described it as obsessed.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> Yeah, I was. She was the whole reason I joined the Foundation. Met her back in ’93, on a trip to Vancouver. She convinced me to join, to do something with my life. Katherine told me, when we were back in time, that she was selfish and a terrible person, and only cared about those close to her. And I asked her, why does she try so hard to save the world? And she told me that she took her selfish feelings and buried them as deep as they could go, and that’s what makes her human. And, when facing down that monster, I hid and watched the greatest hero of all time sacrifice herself.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> I know I couldn’t have done anything. Because I’m just a guide.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> You have to live up to her. Live on for her sacrifice. The others need their guide.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Kayley:</strong> If only they had one who could think for himself.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Arthur Kayley is depressed, caught up in the death of Katherine Osmanski. He considers himself to have little intelligence or moral character. He actually has a large amount of both. He is, however, not fit for active duty due to his distrust of his own abilities.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Uday Skull (SCP-9896-2, “The Healer”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> I am sorry to inform you that your request hasn’t been granted. As you know, meeting your baseline counterpart and his husband constitutes a breach of containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Uday Skull:</strong> I know. It just doesn’t hurt to try. Just knowing Will’s out there brings me a lot of peace. But meeting him would be…reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Maybe someday, we will try our best, won’t we? Now, can you explain your abilities, from your perspective?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Uday Skull:</strong> Every living thing has a ‘vital force.’ This is what makes it alive and not merely a rock, subject to the laws of physics. I can manipulate these forces, make organisms healthier, or more like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How would you assess the mental health of your party members?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Uday Skull:</strong> Arthur’s in the gutter, of course. Enjae’s probably fine. Neil too. Pablo is…uh, Pablo, thinks he’s useless when he’s a damn hero. I’m worried about Myrna. She wanted to get back more than anyone, and now that we’re here, Alison’s gone. She puts on a brave face, acts like her stupid ex.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> And how would you assess your own mental health?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Uday Skull:</strong> Adequate. I had already lost Will, so, if anything, coming back here has made things better. The whole trip to the past feels like a fever dream. I did help people, though, saved some people. That felt good. I would like to help out now, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Overwatch approval for deployment is pending.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Uday Skull:</strong> Enough about me, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Good. I’m good.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Uday Skull is in good mental health and capable of deployment. On a personal level, I get the feeling that he cares a lot more about seeing his former partner, William Roux (at Site-19), than he is willing to admit.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Pablo Marquez (SCP-9896-4, “The Shield”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> Good maybe. Probably not so good. Been thinking a lot about Tony now, is all. How he died here, too. Saved the universe both times, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How was your relationship with Tony?</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> You ever met a pair of brothers where one inherited all the smarts, all the charisma, all the ambition, and the other got nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> I have.</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> Well, that’s the opposite of me and Tony. You see, neither of us inherited anything good. Though we have our strengths, I guess. Tony was scrappy, gotta give him that. He could figure out how to run from anything. And me, I can regenerate from any injury, also pretty cool. Must’ve seen him last like ten years ago. We fought over something stupid. Wish I could see him again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Now, Pablo, I’d like to ask about Dr. Jihoon Jang.</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> You’d be better off asking one of the others. I didn’t know him particularly well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Just give me your honest thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> He was a bit of an arrogant prick. I guess he was also pretty nice at times, gave all of us agents a pizza party couple of times. Oh, he was rich, like real rich. The others told me he’s a complicated guy, lots of demons and stuff like that. But, I think he was just pretty normal, a guy with some problems in his life, all of us have something like that. Though I suppose I just don’t like him cause he tore me in half.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Thank you. <em>Pause.</em> Pablo, you’re important now. And that’s not just my opinion; that is an objective fact. You changed all of time, for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Pablo Marquez:</strong> I’ll do my best, for Tony.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Pablo Marquez is a deployable asset. He has some problems with motivation and some lingering emotions regarding his late brother. However, we did deploy Wettle.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Myrna Chao (SCP-9896-6, “The Knight”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> Considering I lost my daughter and spent decades fighting for my life, I would say I am doing fine, or normal, right on that baseline the Foundation loves so much, depressed, but holding it together.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> In baseline, your daughter is alive and well, albeit an enemy of the Foundation. How does that make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> She’s not my daughter. My daughter is dead. I got my revenge and I saved the world, only thing left for me is to finally take it easy, no responsibilities, no one left to care for.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> You mentioned revenge. On “The Dragon,” I presume.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> Horror incarnate, or some dark God or something. Doesn’t really matter, was a destroyer of worlds, now dead and buried, some centuries ago. World was saved, you're welcome. Now I get to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> What was your relationship with Katherine, such that she gave you her sword?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> She would’ve given it to Arthur if he wasn’t so useless. Poor thing would’ve been broken by the responsibility. We were close enough, Katherine and I. Hung out from time to time. She was a good person, truly. She gave me the sword because I’m not. I’m not a good person, but I’m not too bad either. Just good enough to swing the sword.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Myrna, do you owe anything to the Foundation? Do you still consider yourself a Foundation employee?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> My Foundation’s gone. I’ve heard what you guys say about Katherine’s sword. You have a whole other team dedicated to saving the world. What do you need me for? I’m satisfied sitting here, getting fed, with an acceptable level of socialization. I was a Gears, you know. I can make do with little.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> And what if the party needs its hero?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Myrna Chao:</strong> I’ll be there, because if I’m not, Katherine and Alison would keep me up at night.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Myrna Chao is depressed, but generally aware of her mental state. She consistently expresses a desire not to be used by the Foundation. Though perhaps just my own speculation, I believe that Dr. Chao does possess some desire to see baseline Alison Chao. Such a meeting may prove advantageous in negotiations with the “Black Queen.”</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Neil Ghost (SCP-9896-3, “The Thief”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> I am doing as well as I can be. My mental condition is optimal. My physical condition remains consistent. I am not capable of being utilized.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Can you elaborate on your wound?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> Although invisible, there is a fire constantly burning my chest, around the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Our sensors have failed to pick up any sort of flame, or you, for that matter. You are completely absent on every sort of test we’ve run. Even Dr. Astrauskas came up with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> Such is the nature of my ability. I can still interact with the world, pick up objects and such, but I am completely invisible. It’s not mimetic, at least not exactly, Dr. Song told me that it’s more metaphysical. I force the world into ignoring my existence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> And what of the flame? Is that simply undetectable because of your ability?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> No, that would be the work of “The Dragon,” which gave me this injury.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> The flames can’t be put out? The others mentioned the flames dying out once the dragon was slain. Why is your wound different?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> I was the only one injured by the flames. The others were protected by Dr. Song.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> What makes the dragon’s flames anomalous?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> They are less physical and more mental. They seem to force the burned to relive the worst moments of their life.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> And what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> The moment I sacrificed a hundred million people to save seven billion.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> This was before being displaced?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> Yes, simply another responsibility of a director.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Do you see them, the people you sacrificed?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Neil Ghost:</strong> Only one. My wife, crying, holding her swollen belly.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Ghost assesses his condition well enough. He is incapable of deployment. He needs help. I will do my best, but I can’t help but feel like he is walking on eggshells around me. As if he can’t say certain things. I can’t tell truth from lies with this one. Though somehow, I doubt his sentiment is a lie. He is deeply hurt and obviously feels invisible. Even the other party members don’t talk about him much. Like he’s a fly on the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Events of April 18th, 2026 at Site-27 in a previous iteration, recovered from DEEPWELL:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>13:37:12</strong>—“The Dragon” attacks Site-27, which suffers severe structural damage. Black flames are seen site-wide. Approximately 72% of site personnel are killed in the initial attack or burned alive by the flames.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Enjae Song (SCP-9896-1, “The Mage”)</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt begins.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> Terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Today, I want to talk about your baseline self.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> She killed herself, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> Yes, why do you think she did?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> I mean, I had absolutely nothing before the Foundation. I was a nobody, not respected, poor, no family, no friends. I studied philosophy for God’s sake. With the Foundation, I gained everything I had only imagined, everything I had rejected for the sake of my studies.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> The others call you a genius.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> Come on, you don’t believe that. I mean, you’ve talked to me. I’m no Reynders, or Lillihammer, or even Okorie. I know philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> And magic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> Again, not really. I know magic non-scientifically. It kind of just flows out of me. I don’t know the theories or anything. Though I have been reading up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> What do you think of the “Hero’s Party” as a whole?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> We’re a bunch of losers, thrown together, who somehow managed to save the world. Pablo says he’s a loser, and until he stops saying it, I’ll believe him. Arthur needs to get his head off Katherine. Myrna’s just as cold and dead as her ex. Uday’s a nice guy, but too idealistic. Katherine had one moment of heroism, and suddenly everyone forgot her cowardice and relationship issues. Neil’s always been invisible, now just a bit more so. He needs to reevaluate his life. I mean, I’m the closest thing that guy has to a friend, and I barely like him. And me? I’m just some loser who would commit suicide if she didn’t stumble into some random secretive group that controls the world or something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nhung Ngo:</strong> That being said?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Enjae Song:</strong> We’re damn cool. I mean, we saved the world, killed some sort of god, and managed to rip the heart out of a dear friend who decided to end the world.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Excerpt ends.&gt;</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Enjae Song is a deployable asset in generally good mental and physical health. I will note here that Dr. Song refuses to mention how she exactly came to be employed by the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Baseline Enjae Song’s Suicide Note:</strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>You ever feel like nothing matters? Like the world around you is just meaningless nonsense. You might look out at the ocean and then hear a car horn and realize that you’re nothing and the world has been ruined.</p>
<p>Well, I’m here to tell you you’re wrong. There’s abundant meaning in the world. It can be everywhere and in everything. In the view of the city at night, in the lights of millions of people across the world. Even the internet provides connection, stretching across the entire world. And yet, meaning is not for everyone. Whether by circumstance or perhaps just the way you’re wired, some people just can’t have meaning. Even though all the meaning is there, you just can’t reach out and grab it.</p>
<p>And even when you grab it, even when you hold it deep within your heart and mind, meaning still just degrades. It seeps through the wounds in your brain, circulated by every pump of your heart throughout your bloodstream. Meaning is a constant cry for progress. For something ever more meaningful. How can knowledge be used? How can my belief be used? How can I be better, do better for everyone around me? How can I help the world progress? How can I help the economy? How can I help society’s progress? Each question another step to that cliff’s edge. Progress can be happiness. Progress can be suffering. But most of all, progress never ends.</p>
