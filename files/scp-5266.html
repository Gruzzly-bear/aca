<p>SCP-5266-1 instance 82. Note that no SCP-5266-2 instances are visible in this shot.<br/>
The individual in the video has yet to be identified.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5266</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor all video-sharing platforms for links with titles consistent with SCP-5266-1 title patterns. For videos tagged by the webcrawler, standard digital recursion tests will be made to determine if the links will yield a URL when opened, indicating an SCP-5266-1 instance. Links found to lead to SCP-5266-1 instances will be summarily deleted.</p>
<p>Additional media-monitoring webcrawlers are to search for possible mentions and coverage of SCP-5266 events. Agents will be dispatched to possible cases to confirm the anomaly, and subsequently retrieve SCP-5266-2 instances and administer amnestics.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel education course C-32 "Hazards Of The Web" has an included portion demonstrating the best response to Foundation personnel being targeted by an SCP-5266 event. Personnel will be advised to immediately call for help before seeking out and either contacting or destroying SCP-5266-2 instances. An onsite medical team with a UAD<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> kit and defibrillation gear is to be dispatched immediately to the target's location, where they will either aid in deactivation of SCP-5266-2 or attempt to resuscitate the affected person should initial attempts fail.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5266 is the collective designation for a series of anomalous YouTube videos and the phenomenon resulting from viewing them. Individual instances of videos are referred to as SCP-5266-1.</p>
<p>New SCP-5266-1 instances are uploaded on an estimated average of once every 2 weeks, and each video ranges from 3 to 4 minutes in length. The videos, when played, have no associated upload channel or URL address, and to date searching for SCP-5266-1 instances has yielded no results. The only known method of initially encountering SCP-5266 is for an instance to spontaneously appear in the viewer's recommendations tab. Only the first occurrence of each individual video can trigger the major anomalous properties of SCP-5266, and videos can be safely viewed and saved after the initial event has concluded.</p>
<p>SCP-5266-1 instances are typically titled consistently with internet clickbait, featuring exaggerated descriptions of the contents of the video in all capital letters.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Each video is a recording of a previous SCP-5266 event, featuring a single subject suffering the effects of such while accompanied by a song written and performed by American disco group <em>Village People</em>. The videos always end with several seconds of a black screen, with a short series of high-pitched tones and bursts of static playing over it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-5266-1 videos are commonly recorded from any security cameras or other recording devices present on the scene, proven by camera angles and video quality. The cameras are reverted back to a normal state with no signs of tampering after the event concludes. In the event that an incident occurs in an area without pre-existing cameras, the video appears to be shot from an unknown handheld device by an unknown operator, indicated by swaying of the camera present in the video along with the faint sound of breathing. It is noted that no victims of SCP-5266 have ever been seen to react to the presence of the camera's operator, and no physical traces have been left behind to date. Research into a potential camera operator POI and further sub-anomalies is pending.</p>
<p>Upon opening an SCP-5266-1 video, an as-of-yet unidentified toxic substance<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> immediately begins entering the viewer's bloodstream through anomalous means, at a rate ensuring that a fatal dose is reached exactly as the video ends. It is noted that SCP-5266-1 video instances are unable to be paused, and will continue playing even if no power source is present. In 32% of cases, all exits out of the immediate area will spontaneously lock themselves if possible. Upon the music in the video beginning to play, 4 to 7 instances of SCP-5266-2 will manifest in the immediate area, usually hidden from sight or otherwise slightly obstructed.</p>
<p>SCP-5266-2 instances are human shrunken heads genetically identical to past or present members of the aforementioned <em>Village People</em>. SCP-5266-2 instances wear a variety of different headpieces, including cowboy hats, police helmets, hard hats and Native-American headdresses. Instances are capable of motion, and upon manifesting will immediately begin to sing along to the song playing in the active SCP-5266-1 video in unison, with instances serving as backup singers or solo singers as necessary. SCP-5266-2 instances will continue to vocalize until either being damaged or coming into contact with the current target of SCP-5266's effects.</p>
<p>In order to halt the effects of an SCP-5266 event, all active instances of SCP-5266-2 must be made to cease vocalizing by either of the aforementioned means. Upon doing so, the toxin will immediately vanish from the subject's body and the heads will lose all anomalous properties aside from origin. At this point subjects will most likely survive, but it is still possible for them to succumb to the lingering symptoms of the toxin if they have pre-existing health conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Video Contents Date:</strong> 05/21/2015</p>
<p><strong>Video Subject:</strong> Officer Mitchell ███████, later interviewed in Log 5266-38-B, alongside other subjects present. Other persons in the area were later amnesticized.</p>
<p><strong>Video Title:</strong> Big Dude Dances!! IS HE A HOT COP ENOUGH??</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Subject is seated behind his desk in █████████ PD District 7. A smartphone is being used to watch videos in the left hand as subject consumes a bagel with their right hand. The video is being recorded from the building's security cameras, and changes perspective several times. The initial shot is from the camera over the office door. No other persons are present.</em></p>
<p><em>2 seconds pass after subject can be seen tapping his phone to select the video. The music begins and SCP-5266-2 instances manifest. Two instances can be seen, one on top of a filing cabinet behind the subject, and another inside an empty coffee pot left on the opposite counter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> What, my headphones crapped out? C'mon.</p>
<p><em>Subject removes listening devices from ears and attempts to pause the video, to no avail. They continue to attempt to pause the video several more times, before holding it to their ear to confirm the music is not emanating from the device. 10 seconds have passed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> The hell?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> Music! Music is my thing!</p>
<p><em>Subject looks up and notices the SCP-5266-2 instance in the coffee pot, freezing when they do so. They then slowly reach down to a walkie-talkie on their belt, bring it to their face, and begin speaking into it. SCP-5266-2 instances continue singing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Paulie. Get up here. And help me confirm what. I. Am. Seeing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> Pleasure is my game, pleasure will lead to my fortune and fame, all right!</p>
<p><em>Subject stands up and slowly approaches the coffee pot, maintaining direct line of sight as he does so. Upon reaching the pot, picking it up and inspecting SCP-5266-2 closer, he can be seen to recoil in revulsion, then wobble slightly due to the toxin's effects. 35 seconds have passed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> But baby I'll burn you, if you're dancing with me!</p>
<p><em>A secondary subject, henceforth referred to as Subject B, enters the office. Initial subject will be referred to as Subject A for the remainder of the log.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Hey, Mitch, what're you ringing me up here for? I could barely hear you over the-</p>
<p><em>Subject B notices the SCP-5266-2 instance on the filing cabinet and screams, before drawing their pistol and firing rapidly at it 5 times, with the fourth shot making contact and neutralizing the instance. Startled, Subject A drops the coffee pot, which shatters and neutralizes the instance within.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> 'Cause he's a HOT COP! Hottest cop on the disco scene!</p>
<p><em>Subject A curses, before rushing across the room to another set of desks, following the voice of another SCP-5266-2 instance.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> People say that I'm a dancing machine!</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> What the hell is this Mitch?! This ain't natural! Christ!</p>
<p><em>Subject B steps back into a wastebasket, knocking it over and causing another instance to roll out amidst crumpled papers. 46 seconds have passed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> 'Cause he's a HOT COP! Hottest cop that you'll ever see!</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Christ! Fuck! There's another one!</p>
<p><em>Subject B stomps on the instance repeatedly, neutralizing it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Paulie, don't just wreck 'em! We gotta keep one of the damned things, see if the feds or somebody knows what it is.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> I bet you never meet a cop as funky as me!</p>
<p><em>Subject A opens several drawers, before finding an instance and pulling it out, causing it to cease vocalizing. 68 seconds have passed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Oh hell, I regret touchin' this. I'm gonna puke in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> Boogie, boogie! Boogie, boogie! Get on down!</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> The song's still going! There's more somewhere!</p>
<p><em>Both subjects continue to scour the room until 108 seconds have passed, at which point Subject A collapses due to SCP-5266's effects.</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> Mitch? Hey, Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>Subject A:</strong> Hggh. I-I think my heart's going.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> Party! Boogie, boogie! Boogie, boogie! Get on d-</p>
<p><strong>Subject B:</strong> SHUT IT!</p>
<p><em>Subject B draws their pistol again and fires twice towards a window, presumably aiming at a nearby SCP-5266-2 instance. The window can be heard shattering and shards of glass can be seen falling onto the floor. The vocalizing ceases after the instance was presumably destroyed, ending the SCP-5266 event. Subject B can be seen rushing to perform CPR on Subject A before the video ends.</em></p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Subjects A and B were both interviewed after being identified from the video, ███ days afterwards. Both had chosen not to reveal the details of the events to others, for the stated reason of <em>"Not wantin' to look like a fuckin' headcase"</em>, which resulted in them being fired from their positions as a result of causing property destruction and negligent discharges with no given explanation.</p>
<p>Post-interview, the intact SCP-5266-2 instance was retrieved from Subject A, and both subjects were offered positions in Foundation security after showing proficiency in responding to anomalous events and maintaining rational thought during a crisis.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Onsite security can be seen following standard hostile intrusion procedure, forming a blockade at the end of the hallway. The M-Class entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> steps into frame opposite the security team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sec. Officer Trudeau:</strong> Visual. Get behind the barrier.</p>
<p><em>All members of the security team assume positions behind the deployed P-84 Antikinetics Barrier. Entity M-A6 continues approaching with no change in pace.</em></p>
<p><strong>Trudeau:</strong> Okay, standard munitions test. It has a head; aim for that.</p>
<p><em>Security personnel open fire with standard armaments. Fire is maintained for 3.7 seconds, during which bullets are seen to sublimate before making contact with the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sec. Officer Messina:</strong> Nothing. Deploying Hardlight Rifle, get the TD-Lance ready too.</p>
<p><em>Messina fires at Entity M-A6. The beam contacts the target above the secondary left eye, where it is refracted back towards the team. The barrier absorbs the impact, but stray photon condensation damages the surveillance system.</em></p>

<p><em>Footage is cut off as the security camera shorts out.</em></p>

<p><em>Footage resumes from onsite Office 11. Entity M-A6 is seen entering through the doorframe after ripping the door off its hinges. The entity has since grown two additional sets of mandibles and is dragging an unconscious Junior Researcher Haldings behind it with one hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Awaken.</tt></span></p>
<p><em>A blue gas can be seen exiting Haldings' mouth and eyes, and he startles awake.</em></p>

<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Reveal. Scriptures. Forbidden.</tt></span></p>
<p><em>The entity points towards the computer monitor at the office's workstation. The computer in question is primarily used for access to SCP files, for cross-reference to acquired GoI documents. An open YouTube tab can be seen on the screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> What? N-no, I can't give you access, the other anom-</p>

<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Reveal.</tt></span></p>
<p><em>Haldings is thrown towards the desk, where he slowly gets to his feet and looks back at the entity, before placing his hand on the mouse. He begins to close the tab, but halts, and can be seen inspecting the screen closer. After a second, he repositions the mouse without closing the YouTube tab and then taps at several keys with no effect before turning back to face Entity M-A6.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> Okay, I've, I've got it all ready for you. Just, uh, press this here, with your finger.</p>
<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Obedience. Satisfactory.</tt></span></p>
<p><em>Haldings moves to the side as the entity approaches the computer and clicks once with the mouse on the SCP-5266-1 instance that he had noticed. The event begins, and SCP-5266-2 instances manifest. One instance appears in the water cooler tank adjacent to Haldings, who upon seeing this grabs the jug and begins running out the door as the music starts.</em></p>

<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Insolence. Punish.</tt></span></p>
<p><em>The entity smashes the computer monitor with its forelimbs. The music continues playing, prompting the entity to look around in confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> <span style="font-size:120%;"><tt>Resistance? Audacity.</tt></span></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find, many ways! To! Have! A! Good time!</p>
<p><em>A SCP-5266-2 instance rolls out from the lifted lid of a photocopier, dislodged by its own vocalizations. Entity M-A6 swivels to face it, before lunging forwards to crush it in anger. 59 seconds have passed since the event began.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> It's fun to stay at the <em>Y-M-C-AY-HAYHAAY!</em></p>
<p><em>The entity continually screams as it overturns the rest of the office, demolishing the room and the SCP-5266-2 instances contained within. 127 seconds total have passed as it finishes rampaging and stands still, breathing heavily from both exertion and the effects of the toxin. It looks around for the source of the music, before noticing the trail of water left behind by the fleeing Junior Researcher Haldings. The security cameras in the office give out due to damage.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Footage is resumed from a series of cameras in the Site's hallways. Haldings is seen running frantically, clutching the jug to his chest. An angry screech can be heard from a ways behind Haldings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck its coming-<em>Will you shut up?</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> -Y-M-C-A! They have ever-y-thing, for your men to enjoy-</p>
<p><strong>Entity M-A6:</strong> [Furious screaming in an unknown language]</p>
<p><em>Haldings continues running and turns a corner, still trailing water. Entity M-A6 enters the frame and skids into the wall as its motor functions begin to atrophy, failing to make the turn. Haldings screams and increases speed, and the SCP-5266-2 instance continues vocalizing. After several seconds, Entity M-A6 attempts to stand up before slipping in the puddles, screaming again, before successfully righting itself and resuming pursuit. Haldings, now further away, can be seen frantically attempting to open the Site's tertiary saferoom. 168 total seconds have elapsed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> …C'mon, c'mon, open you dumb thing!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5266-2:</strong> That's when! Someone came up to me, and-</p>
<p><em>Entity M-A6 rounds the corner as the armored door opens, and Haldings ducks inside with the jug, closing the doors behind him. The entity charges, and begins clawing at the doors, beginning to visibly damage them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> No, no, please, just a little longer!</p>
<p><em>At this time, Security Officer Messina slowly limps into frame, with their left arm missing below the elbow and dragging a prototype Thaumaturgical Destabilization Lance behind them. Entity M-A6 has created a large gash in the armored doors, and has begun to reach inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Messina:</strong> Hey. Fucker.</p>
<p><em>Entity M-A6 turns to face Messina.</em></p>
<p><strong>Messina:</strong> Remember me?</p>
<p><em>Messina fires the lance, impacting the entity and causing a large plume of smoke to obstruct it from sight. After several seconds pass, the entity staggers out of the cloud and begins to step towards Messina, but instead collapses to the ground as the SCP-5266-2 instance fades out its singing and the event concludes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Haldings:</strong> Oh, uh, Messina! Y-you're alive!</p>
<p><strong>Messina:</strong> Just-Gah!-Just get me some morphine.<br/>
[END LOG]</p>
