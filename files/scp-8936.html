<h4 id="toc0"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Containment Procedures:</span></span></h4>
<p>SCP-8936 must pursue its contributions to baseline reality only when doing so does not endanger the human race.</p>
<p>SCP-8936 is held at <strong>Site-Ω-3</strong>, an offshore ancillary facility located near the San Francisco Peninsula. Site-Ω-3 is under the joint ownership of the Foundation and the United States military. As per both parties' agreement, the facility cannot be used to contain other SCP objects and cannot hold any weapons of mass destruction, anomalous or mundane, at any time.</p>
<p>SCP-8936 may be brought out of Site-Ω-3 when doing so is absolutely vital for its contributions to baseline reality. Both the Foundation and the United States military are authorized to escort it when necessary. While away from Site-Ω-3, SCP-8936 must be under the direct supervision of at least twenty personnel and cannot be brought within one hundred miles of any major military base.</p>
<p>Note that SCP-8936's containment does not guarantee the continued existence of the veil, the Foundation, the United States of America, modern civilization, or any given person; merely that the human species in its entirety will not go extinct. Any disaster scenario capable of compromising SCP-8936's containment, directly or indirectly, remains a threat to human life.</p>
<h4 id="toc1"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></span></h4>
<p>SCP-8936 is a minor god presiding over the concept of extinction. It takes the form of a small forage fish with a fire in its abdomen - a species it calls a "candlefish." The fire is visible thanks to the fish's thin, transparent scales, creating a unique form of bioluminescence that makes it hypervisible even in extremely dark environments or deep waters.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:100%;"><img alt="hearthfish.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8936/hearthfish.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-8936.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8936 can mimic any method of communication from any animal species, including humans. It is also capable of freeform flight, appearing to "swim" in midair, and is consistently aware when any given species is nearing extinction. These are believed to be aspects of its godhood, rather than traits common to the "candlefish" species as a whole.</p>
<p>SCP-8936 must be present in order for the last member of any given plant or animal species to die. Until it becomes present, the plant or animal will survive and, if SCP-8936 is especially delayed, may spontaneously repopulate (see incident 8936-A.)</p>
<p>When SCP-8936 approaches the dying plant or animal, it will begin slowly circling above it, communicating with it if applicable. SCP-8936 will stay with the animal for several minutes after its death. If multiple plants or animals go extinct in the same general location, SCP-8936 will repeat this process for each of them individually.</p>
<p>When not facilitating the extinction of living things, SCP-8936 enters a docile state believed to be similar to the natural behavior patterns of the original "candlefish." It will seek large bodies of saltwater, then swim aimlessly, feeding on algae and regularly running itself into, or chewing on, large rocks and corals. When approached by other animals (most notably humans,) it may break from its expected natural behavior pattern to directly communicate, generally to politely excuse itself and leave as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Specimens of <em>Glaucopsyche xerces</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8936 was discovered 4/19/1941 in the Sunset District of the San Francisco Peninsula, overseeing the extinction of the Xerces blue butterfly (<em>Glaucopsyche xerces</em>). Reports of a "flying, speaking, glowing anchovy" were initially fielded by the California Academy of Sciences, then quickly escalated to the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub">Federal Bureau of Investigation, Unusual Incidents Unit</a>. SCP-8936 was then re-discovered 7/5/1941 near the town of Myitkyo, Bago Region, Myanmar, overseeing the extinction of the Jerdon's babbler (<em>Chrysomma altirostre</em>). The FBI UIU was dispatched to retrieve and interrogate the entity.</p>
<p>An interrogation log has been attached below.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incident 8936-A:</span></span></h4>
<p>SCP-8936 was held in FBI UIU custody for the next eight months, during which time the Foundation was unaware of its existence. In March of 1942, SCP-8936's incarceration meant it was unable to attend to the extinction of the Texas gray wolf (<em>Canis lupus monstrabilis</em>) in Waco, Texas. A UIU account of the resulting incident has been attached.</p>

<p><span class="uiu">WE WERE CALLED INTO WACO ABOUT AN EXPLOSION OF WOLVES. THAT WAS THE EXACT WORDING OF THE MEMO, AN "EXPLOSION OF WOLVES." THERE WERE DOZENS, MAYBE A HUNDRED, ALL GATHERED TOGETHER AT ONE RANCH. THEY APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE, SO SAID THE RANCH'S OWNER, AFTER HE HAD SHOT A SINGLE WOLF TRYING TO GO AFTER HIS CHICKENS. THE LAST TEXAS GRAY.</span></p>
<p><span class="uiu">IT WAS STILL ALIVE. BLEEDING FROM THE CENTER OF ITS HEAD. MAKING A GARGLED WHIMPER AND KICKING ITS LEGS. THE OTHER WOLVES CIRCLED AROUND BUT DIDN'T ACT QUITE RIGHT.

WE ROUNDED THEM UP AND DEALT WITH THEM EASILY, BUT THE FIRST WOLF - THE ONE THAT SHOULD'VE DIED - IT WAS STILL THERE. WE COULDN'T KILL IT NO MATTER WHAT WE DID. IT KEPT KICKING. IT KEPT WHIMPERING, OR TRYING TO WHIMPER.</span></p>
<p><span class="uiu">IT TOOK US A DAY TO TRANSPORT THE CANDLEFISH TO WACO. WE BROUGHT IT OUT IN A CLEAR GLASS BOX, AND WHEN WE OPENED IT UP, THE FISH SWAM THROUGH THE AIR. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO POINT IT TO THE WOLF. IT ALREADY KNEW.</span></p>
<p><span class="uiu">AND THEN IT HOWLED. THE FISH HOWLED. THE FISH HOWLED AND THE WOLF STOPPED KICKING. ITS BREATHING SLOWED. IT LOOKED CALM. THEN IT DIED.</span></p>
<p><span class="uiu">THE FISH RETURNED TO THE GLASS BOX WILLINGLY. IT DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO CONSIDER ESCAPE. SOMETHING ELSE WAS ON ITS MIND. IT SEEMED SORROWFUL. IT CLEARLY TAKES NO JOY IN WHAT IT DOES.</span></p>

<p>The Foundation was indeed contacted soon after, and SCP-8936 was officially classified and its containment procedures were codified.</p>
<h4 id="toc4"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incident 8936-B:</span></span></h4>
<p>Continued research and interviews with SCP-8936, held by both the Foundation and the United States, revealed its estimation of the time until humanity's extinction to fluctuate wildly. SCP-8936's estimation sharply decreased to only one year at the beginning of April 1945, then increased to twenty years at the end of that same month. From there, its estimation decreased exponentially each passing year.</p>
<p>On 7/13/1955, when the estimation fell below one year for the first time, an emergency meeting was held between SCP-8936, United States Senior General Leslie Richard Groves, and the Administrator.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>7/13/1955 EMERGENCY MEETING TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> General.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Administrator. Oh, and the fish.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Let's make this meeting quick. That thing freaks me out. I assume this is about-</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> About the imminent threat to the human species?</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> If you want to be dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> General, in the past ten years this fish has attended to the extinction of <em>dozens</em> of species. Many of them went extinct due to military interference.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> <em>Your</em> military's interference.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Among others.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> I, personally, do not believe <em>our</em> species to be immune from that interference, as perhaps you do. And now, the candlefish's estimate is much lower than it ever was even during the war.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Well, if you want my opinion, and I'm here, so you do, it sounds like there's a threat to the world as we know it that needs to be eliminated as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> I agree.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> And that threat is the USSR.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> I… <em>partially</em> agree.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> And I'm sure we could work together to eliminate this threat. The United States could use the Foundation's resources at a time like this.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> General, I'm trying to <em>avoid</em> a war here, not start one. I'm speaking with you - and with others - about <em>disarmament.</em></p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Disarmament, while the Soviets have the ability to destroy our nation entirely?</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Focus, general. This is about more than just the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Nothing ever is. Let's stay on topic and talk about <em>winning this war.</em></p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Let's not. General Groves, you are-</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Maybe we need a second opinion. Candlefish, how about you remind us how long is on the clock?</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> …If you think you can use the extinction of the human race as a <em>negotiating token</em>-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> It- It's lower. It got lower.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Come again?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Three months now. <em>Two</em> months now. Oh. Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Tick-tock, Administrator. I <em>can</em> make sure this war doesn't start, but I need some promises made on <em>your</em> end.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Groves, please. Are you more loyal to your country than you are to <em>life itself</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> You're not going to like my answer to that question.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Three weeks. Still falling.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> General Groves-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> <em>General-</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> One week. One week. One week.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> <em>Alright.</em> If self-preservation isn't enough for you, what are your demands?</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> I want complete transparency between the Foundation and the United States government.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Done.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> I want Foundation surveillance focused on the USSR for the next ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Done.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> It's… it's going up again… One month now. A year. No, two. No, ten.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> I want exclusive cooperation between the Foundation and the United States military, and I want all Foundation involvement with other militaries to cease immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> …Done.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> It's… it's more than a hundred now! But it stopped going up.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Good enough. We'll take it. Groves, we'll… keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> We're <em>all</em> extinction gods now. Don't forget.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Groves stands and turns to SCP-8936.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> At least you're not doing it alone anymore, little fish.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> You… you're no god.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> You're not much of one yourself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> You're a- a child. Throwing a fit. Killing anyone for a <em>tantrum</em>, and acting like you're the adult in the room for doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Ignoring that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> One day. One day, I'll be the only one to remember humanity. And, and when I do. I think it would honor them best if… I try to forget you, Mr. Groves.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> What a shame. I'll be so devastated when I'm dead.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> Oh, is that how long we have now all the sudden? Fifteen years?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> No. Only you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Extended pause.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Groves:</strong> I'm leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Good. Meeting adjourned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[Groves exits.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[The Administrator sighs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> I worry we're going to be the death of <em>all</em> life, one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Humans?</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Americans.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Oh. Oh. Well, if it helps… the bacteria around us will be here for… a long, long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Strangely enough, it <em>does</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> …What do you say to the lonely creatures you help? What do you say to all the last ones?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> Something different for all of them. They all have different voices, and they all just… want to hear those voices from someone else. I think. And I try. I try to make them feel not alone. And I promise to remember them. And I always do.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> I see.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[The Administrator stands to leave.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> Thank you for your help today. You're a good god, "Candlefish."</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8936:</strong> I don't feel like one. I just… I just feel like a fish.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator:</strong> And I think that's why.</p>
