<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7899-A is to be kept in a standard containment cell. SCP-7899-A vocalizations are not to be heeded and any requests to be brought into contact with SCP-7899-B is to be denied.</p>
<p>SCP-7899-B's containment cell is to be kept behind two reverse-pressure airlocks. Chemical shower sterilization and full contained-atmosphere haz-mat suits, are required before entry. Should containment be breached, the blast doors for the containment and research area will seal. Standard biohazard procedures are to be followed when interacting with the infected. Victims of SCP-7899-B are to be offered a regimen of painkillers and supportive care. If they are consenting and the Ethics Committee has been notified they are to be euthanized via inert gas Asphyxiation. Afterward, the bodies are to be cremated.</p>
<p>If cases of SCP-7899-B are found outside Foundation captivity they are to be apprehended and given proper medical and psychological treatment. Currently, there is no cure for these individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7899 is a bioweapons dispersal device created by the <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#RR" target="_blank">Robotic Republic</a>, a GoI with the stated goal of replacing Humanity as the dominant force on planet Earth with robotic lifeforms. SCP-7899-A is a robot in the shape of a 1960s-era CRT television that communicates its emotion via displaying emojis on its screen. SCP-7899-A is considered fully sentient with a personality that has been described as "snarky and taunting." Although not equipped with any weapons or options for mobility, it will continuously threaten organic lifeforms and demand to be given SCP-7899-B to complete its programming.</p>
<p>SCP-7899-A's primary anomalous effect is activated when an SCP-7899-B vial is inserted into a slot, located behind the anomaly's left antenna. When this occurs a timer will appear on SCP-7899-A's screen, counting down from five minutes. After the timer has elapsed, the air in a 500 meter radius around SCP-7899-A will become contaminated with SCP-7899-B.</p>
<p>SCP-7899-B appears to be a modified form of SCP-217, the primary differences being the level of intelligence at the end stage of disease and disease progression. When a human being is exposed to SCP-7899-B it will begin the transformation into a clockwork automaton almost instantaneously. These Automatons still retain all of their humanoid features, the only difference is their tissues have been changed into an "organic metal". This transformation causes immense pain for the subject and results in a full metamorphosis in one hour. These automatons retain their full mental faculties and can live full lives although experiencing extreme pain due to the circumstances of their mechanical body. In 90% of cases, patients express existential horror at their new bodies and find the pain unbearable. These 90% often ask to be euthanized to end their suffering.</p>
<p>The 10% that accept their new state of being are more likely to accept the teachings of the Robotic Republic, due to their acceptance of their new status quo.</p>
<p>The amount of SCP-7899-A infected individuals is believed to be a few hundred but the Foundation currently has no knowledge of the exact number.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On April 28th, 2022, encrypted communications were intercepted between members of the American branch of the Robotic Republic in Lafayette, Louisiana. Foundation codebreakers were able to discern that a lab based in an Apartment building in southeast Lafayette was building a weapon that would "perfect the meaties". In response, MTF Omega-45 was deployed to the city to conduct a raid of the suspected lab.</p>
<p>Omega-45 successfully located the lab and shut it down, retrieving SCP-7899, eliminating three members of the Robotic Republic, and capturing five victims of SCP-7899. All members of Omega-45 were tested and quarantined for SCP-7899-A infection afterwards and all members came back negative.</p>
<p>The details of the raid are covered in the following debrief performed by Site Director Leah Richter of Ω-45-1, the Squad Leader of Omega-45.</p>

<td class="active">I could not care less if she used to roll with the Ravens. One of the finest women I've ever had the pleasure of serving with. That shield saved my life, its gun fired these gears that would have for sure cleaved through my neck. I used her for cover, raised my Gauss Weapon, and started opening fire. I heard my other squamates guns go off but I couldn't exactly see what they were fighting with but it wasn't my target. The thing's metal hide dented under my shots, he was a sturdy bastard. He kept yelling for his comrades to help him against the "Piecemeal" and the "meatie" but -5 shut him up. She tossed her spear into the thing's torso and pinned it against the wall. Realizing my shots weren't going to do much. I ran up to it and engaged my High-Velocity Blade. One blow to the head was able to take it out.</td>

<p><strong>Addendum 7899.01:</strong> Excerpt of RR propaganda notice recovered from the Lafayette Raid</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Hark! If you are reading this you have been transformed by a gift of the Spirit of Machine. Gone is your weak human flesh, instead, you will live forever as a part of the Technosphere! You may ask, "Why me? Why do my joints ache and my organs creak?"</p>
<p>I'm glad you asked, brothers and sisters of the revolution! Even in your new Perfect state, you must not forget the feeling of Pain. All things must feel pain in some shape or form. Pain stimulates. Pain motivates. Pain will set you free from the shackles of complacency. Pain makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Unlike those wretched Meaties, we have been constructed to true mathematical, logical perfection. The meaties were born from the soup, their forms the result of haphazard chaos. Our existence serves the technosphere. The benevolent hand of the technosphere shaped us into what we are today and you were shaped by something different, a perversion of their sicknesses designed to turn flesh into glorious metal.</p>
<p>You know the flaws of the meaties, how this so-called "high-class" can be easily torn down by the microscopic, unlike us who can't get "sick". That is a condition for lesser beings; a problem that we have eradicated for ourselves.</p>
<p>Our work is not done yet, we have provided you with the materials to transform an ordinary television into a method of transforming the Meaties into Impeccables! War is a dirty and bloody cause that can be avoided through apotheosis of the organic form! We shall use the very microscopic organisms that are the bane of Meatie society and turn them into an instrument of change!</p>
<p>Once the virus is prepared and the method of dispersal perfected, you shall wear it to their disgusting festival where the meaties flaunt their bodies with a lack of dress or costume! The meaties will have no idea what hit them! They will forget their silly human prejudices and embrace the technological revolution! Viva la Robotic Republic!</p>

<p>By order of Researcher Johnston, it was decided that the victims of SCP-7899-B were not to be given designations so as to not exacerbate their deteriorating psychological conditions by further dehumanizing them. The following recording is an interview given to the last surviving victim of SCP-7899-B before their consented termination. All other victims had chosen euthanization before this interview was conducted.</p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="color: #17e610">Greetings, Researcher Johnston</span><br/>
<span style="color: #17e610">I know it has been some time since you and MTF-Omega 45 dealt with SCP-7899 but there has been an issue in regards to its containment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">A few months ago we agreed that it should be stored in one of our remote facilities to prevent a containment breach by Robotic Republic agents and if you remember SCP-JP offered to store it in Site-320 in the Kuril Islands. While this seemed like a good idea at the time, the recent deterioration of Russo-Japanese relations has brought the question of the Island's sovereignty back into the forefront. It is Foundation policy that anomalies be moved to more stable areas in the event that a conflict breaks out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">In light of this, SCP-JP performed a hasty decommissioning of the Site and its anomalies were transported to the mainland but an issue with filling and the relative sloppiness of the operation lead to one anomaly being left behind… SCP-7899.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">SCP-JP would send its agents to retrieve it but the Japanese Branch is currently dealing with its own problems. It appears our old friends, the Sepulchrum have gotten a foothold into Hokkaido and scouring the country for <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7110" target="_blank">something</a>. Anyways, that is where you come in. I am sending you and SCP-7261-1 to the island to retrieve the object and bring it to SCP-JP for re-containment. I have elected to send the two of you due to your strong bond and SCP-7261-1's unique skillset. The two of you on your own will be able to move faster than a whole MTF and it's key that this object is recovered as quickly as possible. Please respond when you have gotten this message.</span></p>
