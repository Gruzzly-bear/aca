<p>SCP-9850</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9850</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Personnel inside the distillery during operation must communicate in writing. No vocalizations or audio playback are permitted until the run has ended and the copper assemblies have cooled.</p>
<p>SCP-9850 is held under Foundation ownership via the Lits &amp; Litres Heritage Trust. Public access to the distillery is prohibited.</p>
<p>SCP-9850 is operated one night per month to relieve pressure accumulation in the copper assemblies. All distillate produced is to be sealed and stored in Locker 9850-A. Sampling requires Level-3 approval. SCP-9850-1 is to remain in the distillery office; removal is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9850 is a working pot-still distillery located in the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>During distillation, individuals within the distillery experience a metallic taste and chest pressure followed by a compulsion to deliver a specific withheld apology tied to an identifiable harm. Generalized remorse does not resolve symptoms. The compulsion persists until the individual speaks the apology aloud into an opening connected to the copper line while the stills are warm.</p>
<p>Following vocalization, symptoms cease. Within 1-12 hours, the apology appears as fresh ink in 9850-1, a bound ledger present on-site since at least 1891. Entries include the apology text, a date, and a volume in litres. Reported volumes do not correspond to recorded production and occur regardless of the status or identity of the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Distillate produced during anomalous runs transmits the effect. Ingestion produces the same symptom progression in the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9850.1 — Acquisition:</strong> Foundation attention followed a cluster of undelivered "wet letters" appearing in village homes without postage. Each contained an apology for a specific act, often decades old. Recipients reported the smell of new make spirit on the paper.</p>
<p>On 27 May 2009, the distillery’s owner attempted to sell the property at a steep discount and refused to enter the distillery. He was found drowned the following morning. Barley husks were packed into his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9850.2 — Ledger Extracts (9850-1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 April 1901 — 7.3 Litres</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>To the men I sent back into the heat: I called it time. I called it profit. I did not call it what it was. When the door stuck I kept my hands clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>18 November 1956 — 0.5 Litres</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Mary, I let them laugh. I stood beside you and did not speak. I have been drinking that day ever since.</p>

<p><strong>14 May 2009 — 12 Litres</strong></p>

<p>Dad, I used your silence as a tool. I learned it too well.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9850.3 — Interview (Excerpt)</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Euan MacLeod (descendant of former head distiller)<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Havel (prior evaluations note "strict witness control").</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Interview requested by Agent Havel. He declined offered whisky "on principle."</p>
<hr/>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Your file says there was a fire. Date.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> It’s not-</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Date, Mr. MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> I don’t know the exact-</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Year, then.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Early on. Before my time.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> That doesn’t help me…</p>
<p><em>(Havel doesn’t look up when he says it. His pen keeps moving.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> You’re asking it like it’s… a thing you can pin.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> I’m asking it like it killed people. How many?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Depends who-</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Don’t. Don’t do that. Give me a number.</p>
<p><em>(Euan shifts in his chair. The edge of his mouth twitches.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> The papers said two.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Names.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> I couldn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Were they local? Staff? Contractors?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Men.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Were there families?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Then don’t tell me “men.” Tell me who.</p>
<p><em>(Silence. Havel looks up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> You know, you’ve got that tone… like you’re trying to get it to sit still.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> I’m trying to get it on record.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> It’s been on record… That’s half the problem.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Tell me what happened. Start at the beginning. Keep it- keep it clear.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> You say "fire" and everyone pictures flames. This was… you ever open an oven and the heat hits your face? Now imagine it’s the whole room. They called it steam. Said it like it was weather, like it just rolled in.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> So there wasn’t a fire. There was a steam release.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> If that’s what you need to call it.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> That’s what it was.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> It was men screaming and nobody wanting to say why.</p>
<p><em>(Havel’s pen pauses. He watches the ink bead at the tip.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> How many were hurt?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> The papers said two… Two keeps it tidy, two fits in a paragraph. My gran used to set three plates when she was tired. Not on purpose, just… hands doing what they remember.</p>
<p><em>(Havel opens his mouth, then pauses.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Three plates.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><em>(Havel sets his pen down carefully. He rubs his thumb over a smudge on his notebook. It doesn’t come off.)</em></p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> …Alright. Don’t give me a number, just tell me what everyone pretended not to see.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Aye…</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> The distillery reopened a week later. Of course it did. That’s the sort of place it is. You scrub the stone, you polish the copper, you tell everybody it was handled.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> And it was?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Handled, aye. Same way you'd handle a cut by running it under water and going back to work.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Did anyone apologise? To the families.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> No.</p>
<p>(Havel pauses.)</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> The ledger. When did you first hear about it?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> When I was wee. I’d come down with my grandfather, and he’d stop at that office door like there was a dog on the other side. Then he’d smile at me—big, harmless smile—and say, "Stay here, son."</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> And you stayed.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> I listened. You can hear plenty through those old walls.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Nothing dramatic, that’s the worst bit. Just a man talking like he’d been holding his breath all day. Low and careful, like he didn’t want the words to wake anyone.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Who was he talking to?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> The copper.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> You say he believed it listened.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> He didn’t talk about belief, he talked about relief. He’d come back out and his shoulders would be down where they belonged, then he’d tell me a joke and act like that was the whole of it.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> Did he ever say what he’d said in there?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> No. He’d look past me and go quiet. Same look as when the kettle starts to scream and you’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> You think the place made him do it.</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> I think the place gave him somewhere to put it. That’s different.</p>
<p><strong>HAVEL:</strong> And you?</p>
<p><strong>EUAN:</strong> Me? I don’t go in.</p>
<p>…</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9850.4 — Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>Agent Havel entered the distillery during a scheduled run carrying an unauthorized flask. After drinking, he spoke into the still’s manway for approximately three minutes. He exited without resistance and requested reassignment the next day.</p>
<p>A new entry appeared in 9850-1 within hours.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>[REDACTED DATE] — 9 Litres</strong></p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p>To the people I told to be quiet so the work could go on: I mistook order for virtue. I am sorry.<br/>
If you are reading this, keep your mouth shut in there. The copper is thirsty.</p>
