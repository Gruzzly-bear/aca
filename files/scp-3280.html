<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3280 is to remain in place at its point of origin in the defunct Johnston Labs and Pharmaceuticals Research Center, which has been seized by the Foundation. Containment Liaisons are in the process of devising long-term containment solutions for SCP-3280.</p>
<p>Should SCP-3280 reach the entrance to Sub-Level 2, the Site will enter a security lockdown, making entrance and egress impossible. Do note that this will also activate Blackout-Protocol: ensuring that no hazardous or sensitive information is broadcast from the Site. This will be necessary to prevent a full containment breach and failure of Third Mission (Protect) goals.</p>

<p>But of course. Despite the repeated assurances that your security upgrade was in the process of being implemented, you're still Level 0, and thus, effectively worthless as far as Overwatch is concerned.</p>
<p>The file though. Was that image even right? You've glimpsed the file previously - surely it… no. No. That cannot be right. No time to be worried about something so inane, however. You need to get in.</p>
<p>The faint <em>drip, drip, dripping</em> of Nichols reminds you of his presence. Gingerly, you finger about his body, feeling for his security lanyard in the dark. It's wedged beneath him, but you're able to slide it out and detach it from the loop. Thankfully, Nichols was the type of person to scrawl their password on the underside of their clearance card, as you discover upon turning it over in your hands.</p>
<p>You approach the terminal with renewed vigor.</p>

<p><strong>Object <span class="translucent">Class:</span></strong> <span class="translucent">Euclid</span></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> One D-Class personnel is to be deposited into Sub-Level 2 per week <span class="translucent">through Subterranean Access Point Gamma.</span><br/>
They are to be presented with misleading information concerning the nature of SCP-3280, and instructed to progress to the lowest level of the facility. They are to be equipped with a flashlight, as well as a security baton for self-defense. An ultra<span class="translucent">sonic transmitter is to be sewn into their clothing, which will broadcast a freq</span>uency capable of drawing SCP-3280 to their location upon accessing the deepest area of the sub-level. This should <span class="transparent">draw SCP-3280 away from the sub-level's entrance,</span> to its preference for live prey.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3280 is a sapient entity composed of a fluid physically identical to water, capable of travelling ~2.5 km/h. Non-anomalous wa<span class="translucent">ter introduced to SCP-3280 will be incorporated into its mass, and remo</span>ved samples prove to operate identically. At the time of its discovery, the entity was approx. 66.4 liters in volume; it is currently estimated to be ~2500 liters.</p>
<p>The entity is hostile to human life. SCP-3280 will seek out humans within its vicinity, forcing its mass into open orifices. SCP-3280 is also readily absorbed through the pores. The affected experience symptoms such as loss of motor control, weakening of the micturition reflex, visual hallucinations, and abdominal pain.</p>

<p>The roiling in your stomach becomes unbearable. You recoil backwards, away from the monitor. You drunkenly stumble, struggling against the thing inside of you, out into the hallway. The storm outside rages. Torrents of raindrops spatter across the windows. You fall against the wall, face pressed against the cool glass.</p>
<p>It is only in those final seconds, as water wells up to your throat and expands, that you notice the raindrops streaking towards your face, in defiance of gravity.</p>
