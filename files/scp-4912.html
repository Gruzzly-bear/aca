<p>SCP-4912 is contained in a standard Euclid-class anomalous item locker and is not to be removed unless for cleaning. Handling of SCP-4912 is to be done entirely by an all-female staff crew to oversee maintenance and regular upkeep of the costume.</p>
<p>Male staff members are prohibited from entering SCP-4912's chamber and are forbidden from interacting with it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4912 is a standard spandex costume with no known manufacturer, with a design based on Spider-Man, a popular Marvel Comics character.</p>
<p>SCP-4912 regenerates all damage done to it at a rate inversely proportional to the degree of damage (small cuts require up to three months, while large incisions may be repaired within hours). When held or observed by a male human being, SCP-4912 compels them to put it on. Individuals who are under the influence of SCP-4912's compulsion effect are designated as SCP-4912-A instances. This compulsory effect does not extend to pictures or video footage of SCP-4912. SCP-4912 is also capable of enlarging itself to accommodate people of different sizes.</p>
<p>SCP-4912-A instances are otherwise normal human beings with a desire to protect their surrounding neighborhood or city. Instances will try to locate any acts of crime being committed and attempt to stop it. Most of these preventions in crime will usually end up with the SCP-4912-A instance in a state of injury or death, due to the lack of protection other than SCP-4912 itself.</p>
<p>This desire of SCP-4912 wears off after spending a certain amount of time away from it until the instance of SCP-4912-A has become disinterested in wearing SCP-4912 (usually taking a minimum of three months to a year to lose the effect). In certain cases, however, the instance will suffer from withdrawal and attempt to substitute their need by participating in various Spider-Man related paraphernalia, such as attending conventions, interacting with others by bringing up topics related to Spider-Man and his philosophy, and wearing non-anomalous variations of the costume in an act of cosplay. Amnestic treatment of these instances will only alleviate these symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4912-A6</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Harper</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Hello there. Please take a seat.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> State your name-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> I'm not in trouble am I? I was just helping the old guy out.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Uh, my name is ██████ ███████, but you can call me █████.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Alright █████, would you like to tell us how you found the costume?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> What, you mean this? <em>(Gestures to himself and pulls at the fabric.)</em> Well, I uh- I found it on my way home from school in an alley. I uh- I found it in a trash can. It had a couple holes in it but it didn't look too out of shape.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Why did you go to the alley?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> It was a shortcut. I always passed through there; it didn't look dirty or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> So you brought it home. Didn't your mother ask why you'd bring a costume in the house?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> She uh- wasn't really the type of person to keep a close eye on us.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> "Us"?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Oh sorry, I have like, four half-brothers. Crazy, right?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Yes, that's certainly insane. <em>(clears throat.)</em> So you took it home and you wore it, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Well, not immediately- I washed it first and I put it on just like that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Could you describe what you felt when you wore the suit?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> It felt pretty comfy; dunno why anyone would throw this awa-</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> N- No. I meant if you experienced anything when you wore it the first time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Nothing, really. It just felt cool to be Spider-Man.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> Uh-huh. Then why is it that you tried to save that old man from getting mugged? Why in the costume?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> I'm- I'm not insane if that's what you're asking.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> I never said you were, but I don't know why you'd want to save a guy wearing a costume when you could've done it without. Sounds ridiculous, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> I- I guess but uh-</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> But?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> It felt great to be Spider-Man. It's- I know I don't have any responsibility or obligation to save anyone, but it felt- it felt right, y'know? I don't- I don't feel like anything's changed. I just feel like I had to.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> But why the costume? Why act like a someone who doesn't exist?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> I've always asked myself that question too, actually. Why do I keep doing this? Why? Like- I realize now that there's a reason behind it all. Behind what Spider-Man is. What he means. <em>(Smiles)</em> I mean, I don't expect you to understand. Not sure if I understand it either but- but Spider-Man isn't just a hero that people aspire to be because of the cool powers or the witty remarks… Spider-Man is an idea. The idea that anyone can put up that mantle and be just like him. Personally? Under the mask, Spider-Man is all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harper:</strong> That's… quite the insight. Do you have anything else to say?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4912-A6:</strong> Yeah uh- no.</p>

<p>On November 12th, 2018, SCP-4912 became animate and escaped its locker. SCP-4912 proceeded to take on a humanoid form in a similar state of being worn. SCP-4912 escaped the chamber and started running towards the nearest exit. MTF Chi-85 ("Heavy Resistance") was dispatched to contain SCP-4912.</p>
<p>A distress call was picked up from MTF Chi-85; claiming that SCP-4912 had begun to manifest anomalous qualities unseen before. Among these qualities are included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased physical strength.</li>
<li>Increased agility.</li>
<li>Hyperreactive reflexes.</li>
<li>Adherence to all physical surfaces by the palms and feet.</li>
<li>Discharging of an adhesive, semisolid substance with similar qualities to spider silk from the underside of the wrists. Analysis of the substance has revealed it to be composed of both organic and inorganic compounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>After incapacitating one of the members of MTF Chi-85, SCP-4912 ran away from the group and escaped. A site-lockdown was enacted to prevent SCP-4912 from escaping, but it proceeded to punch at the reinforced door until it was weakened enough to be torn off of its hinges. SCP-4912 then ran in a path towards the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, located in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Eyewitness reports claim to have seen SCP-4912 "swinging" from the rooftops and "running up the sides of the buildings." Mobile Task Force Delta-23 was immediately dispatched to apprehend the entity.</p>
<p>SCP-4912 arrived at the location and began to run towards the front of the building's doors before abruptly stopping and began to kneel. MTF Delta-23 arrived and began a defensive posture against the entity and slowly approached.</p>
<p>SCP-4912 knelt in place for thirty seconds before it placed its left hand to cover its face, with the other hand holding the ground. The entity then raised its head to look up at the sky before it began to enervate and return to its original inanimate form. Amnestics were distributed across Beverly Grove with SCP-4912 taken for processing. SCP-4912 was noted to no longer possess its anomalous compulsion and was classified as Neutralized.</p>
<p>Close inspection of SCP-4912's "eyes" revealed them to leak a watery, saline solution. This solution has been chemically analyzed to be of similar composition to that of human tears.</p>
<p>The significance of this event is currently unknown.</p>
