<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Known instances of SCP-8297-1 are to be monitored for non-Foundation entry.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8297 is a spherical pocket dimension roughly one kilometer in diameter, resembling a temperate North American rainforest. The environment of SCP-8297 differs from baseline forests in a number of ways:</p>

<li>No living fauna<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> is present within SCP-8297, despite the lush flora.</li>
<li>The sky is perpetually overcast, and light rain falls intermittently.</li>
<li>Cadavers within SCP-8297 do not decay.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-8297 is only accessible through a series of Ways in major cities around the globe, designated SCP-8297-1. SCP-8297-1 manifest on small paths in public parks, universally branching off from the main trails and leading deeper into the park itself. Documents found within SCP-8297 suggest that instances of SCP-8297-1 "admitted" certain individuals in their vicinity into the pocket dimension. Despite this, the anomaly has not demonstrated this property since containment began, hence its classification as "Safe".</p>
<p>SCP-8297 was discovered shortly after the end of the <a href="scp-6500.html">Impasse</a>, after local EVE scannings detected the manifestation of SCP-8297-1 instances. It is presumed that many of these Ways were rendered inert as a result of SCP-6500, and were restored following its conclusion. Mobile Task Force Alpha-48 ("First Responders"), alongside Dr. Wendy Silverman (Foundation Thaumaturge), performed initial assessment. Entrance was gained via SCP-8297-1-34 in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Sa'ar Kesner</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Type Blue reality bender. Known member of Gamers Against Weed, under the alias "VenusianBird". Prior to the Impasse, possessed a remarkable affinity for conjuring Ways. Arrested multiple times during radical-left protests in Three Portlands, Backdoor Soho, Eurtec, and East Jerusalem. Subject’s phone contained remarkably little data in internal storage, and held no external memory card.</p>

<p>Hey, uh, Cass? I just wanted to, uh- god damnit. <em>&lt;Sharp breath.&gt;</em> Sorry, I'm really, really tired. I can't feel my legs, I don't know where I am- some forest-graveyard thing- I can't— I can't move. I—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Several deep breaths. Kesner's breathing stabilizes. Their voice grows calmer.&gt;</em></p>
<p>Listen. I don't have much time left. Everything's numb now, and I've got maybe a few hours before my lungs give up for good. It's alright, I'm not scared. There's just one thing I wanted to, well, tell you.</p>
<p>I remember the day I met you. The UIU protest in 3Ports, you screamed your fucking heart out. I still remember how awed I was; it was my first time at a serious demonstration, and you were just so <em>strong</em>.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Twenty-four seconds of calm breaths&gt;</em></p>
<p>You're awesome in ways I genuinely can't put into words. You've got so much, fuck, sheer <em>goodness</em> in you it's mindblowing. And inspiring. I guess what I'm trying to say is I… I…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Deep breath, followed by a short pause.&gt;</em></p>
<p>I hoped I could say this to your face. But I wasn't brave enough, not like you. I love you, Cass. Goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Former Prometheus Labs employee and Type Red ("Regenerator") reality bender. Defected to the Manna Charitable Foundation, where she worked for more than twenty years.

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I am dying. This saddens me, but I am not as afraid as I thought I would be, using the last of my strength to write these words. Here, amongst the silent foliage and under the mourning sky, I am calm. Calm, and yet not content. These words will never reach you. A pity, I am rather proud of them all.</p>
<p>It appears that fate has chosen the forest floor to be my deathbed. Or is it fate? There are others here around me. It seems that they too succumbed to exhaustion, and found themselves a comfortable trunk to lie against in their final moments. I have no doubt I will join them soon. And yet, I can't help but wonder… why?</p>
<p>I suppose I can take comfort in the fact that my mind has remained that of a scientist, all these years later. What is this place? I remember how I got here, walking home alone through the park, my legs aching. I took my favored route, the quiet side path away from the cars and commotion. Then a shift, my knees buckling, and the rain.</p>
<p>This place took me, of that I am certain. It was no accident. Why, then? There is no one here but the dead and the dying. Could it be trying to ease the Impasse’s victims into oblivion? Mother Nature’s final embrace? Perhaps. Certainly poetic, and this overwhelming tranquility might not be natural. Yet I’d much rather have died in my own bed, with you at my side, than alone in this strange forest. I’m sure many of the others are much the same.</p>
<p>Is it malevolent then? Does it feed on us, drawing out what’s left of our magic to sustain itself in this twilight era? When I entered, I felt my exhaustion catch up to me in an instant, my head spinning. But I was barely walking in the first place, and it is very likely I would have met a similar end halfway home regardless.</p>
<p>A bird has landed on my leg. It is small and black, and looks at me quizzically. Fascinating. It's singing. How beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8297.2 - Video Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> During the initial survey of SCP-8297's geography, Dr. Silverman set up surveillance cameras in several key locations within the anomaly, per standard procedure. The following log was captured while she and the two accompanying agents from MTF-A48 were still within SCP-8297, roughly 500 meters west.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Begin log.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Camera is mounted on a low-hanging tree branch, displaying a view of a small clearing. The corpse of Sa'ar Kesner ("VenusianBird") is seen slumped against a tree. Light rain falls through the canopies.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A Way opens, filling the clearing with bright green light. A figure with long black hair steps out, and the Way closes. Facial recognition software identifies ver as Cassandra Bloom (“castatratatrophy”) of Gamers Against Weed.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Ve notices Kesner's corpse, and rushes towards it.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Bloom:</strong> Sa'ar! Are you…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Ve trails off as ve crouches down next to the body, putting ver hand to its face, then its chest.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Bloom slams ver fist into the earth. Ve stands up and kicks a nearby tree, again and again, cursing loudly. The words "jailor" and "fascist" are heard. After a few seconds, ve stumbles, falls to ver knees, and screams.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>Transcription Note: At this point in time, the assessment team overheard Bloom's scream, and began to move toward ver location.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Bloom pauses at the sound of flapping wings. SCP-8297-A flies into view, landing on Kesner's body. It chirps, tilting its head at ver, and opens its beak.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8297-A:</strong> [COGNITOHAZARDOUS AUDIO EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Bloom:</strong> What— who's— I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8297-A:</strong> [COGNITOHAZARDOUS AUDIO EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Bloom:</strong> I—I can't go on like this. I just can't.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8297-A:</strong> [COGNITOHAZARDOUS AUDIO EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Bloom:</strong> I can't leave them here!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Bloom's eyes are visibly watering. Ve rises to ver feet shakily. The bird continues to sing, louder now. The feed distorts briefly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Bloom:</strong> Oh. I get it. I'll… I'll try.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-8297-A goes silent, and flies off. Bloom steps towards the body, holding out ver palm. Black sparks flicker into being around the corpse, arcing across its skin and clothes. They dance to ver palm, coalescing and solidifying into a small object. Ve clutches it tightly and runs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;A Way is opened and swiftly closed. Foundation personnel arrive at the scene. Everything is still.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;End log.&gt;</em></p>
