<p><strong><tt>Description:</tt></strong> SCP-7790 denotes the remains of a humanoid automaton of unknown origin, most of which was previously located within an abandoned factory in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska.</p>
<p>SCP-7790 is partially functional. At random times, the anomaly will become active and simultaneously do the following before deactivating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast a series of radio transmissions through its speakers;</li>
<li>Spontaneously manifest and demanifest a set of unrelated objects within a 100m radius;</li>
<li>Violently rub the floor with its feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-7790's back is heavily damaged, although the word "DIVISION" can still be seen visibly burned onto its surface.</p>

<p>(<em>A loud thump is heard.</em>)</p>
