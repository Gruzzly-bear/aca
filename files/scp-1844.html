<p><strong>Capsule Alpha, prior to entering service</strong></p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1844</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> At least twelve members of Task Force Omega-144 are to be stationed at Site-308 at all times, with no fewer than three members of the task force concurrently conducting their respective containment protocols within a deposited capsule at any given time. The containment protocol is to be conducted as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The capsule’s ablative heat shield integrity is to be thoroughly inspected and repaired if necessary. The capsule is to be provisioned with food, drinking water, breathing air and requisite equipment<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> for the conduct of the containment protocols by the relevant task force members.</li>
<li>Five task force members are to enter and be sealed in the capsule.</li>
<li>The capsule is to be deposited within SCP-1844 by means of heavy helicopter lift. Whenever possible, the existing capsule within SCP-1844 is to be retrieved. Capsule placement, including the position of the capsule within SCP-1844 and the orientation of the vertex-focus axis of its parabolic dome, is to conform to instructions provided by the Foundation's computus desk.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
<li>While the manned capsule is on site, at least three of the five task force members in the capsule are to concurrently conduct their respective containment protocols, continually and with conviction in a loud, clear voice for the duration of their respective duty shifts. These task force members are to operate in rotation in order to allow for rest in shifts.</li>
<li>The capsule is to remain in place until the next capsule is ready to relieve it in rotation. Every effort is to be made to provide that no capsule remains in place for more than 960 hours.</li>
<li>When the capsule is relieved, it is to be recovered from SCP-1844 by means of heavy helicopter lift (provided that capsule recovery is not to be attempted until the placement of the successor capsule is confirmed) and the task force members are to be extracted. The task force members are to be afforded recovery time before return to service, if practicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each capsule is to be constructed according to the specifications in Document 28.3.GEH, including heat and soundproofing tolerances. The dome of the capsule is to be composed of silver of millesimal fineness not less than 995 (recycled sacramental equipment preferred), and is to be parabolic in shape. Internal metallic surfaces of the capsule are to be microinscribed with appropriate texts. Capsules are to be retired from service when they are no longer capable of being maintained within required tolerances.</p>
<p>The current roster of Task Force Omega-144 consists of the individuals identified in the table below. The table below also identifies the containment protocol to be performed on-station, within the capsule, by the task force member in question:</p>

<p>Each Omega-144 member professes an Abrahamic faith, has qualified by means of apostolic succession or equivalent extra-Foundation protocol, and has been screened by the Foundation's Special Duty Office as consistently rating at least 135 centiakiva in piety. The Special Duty Office actively recruits additional suitable members to replace retiring team members. Retiring members of Omega-144 are to be administered a Class B Amnestic. The containment protocols for individual Omega-144 members have been developed based on their proven efficacy in controlling the growth and temperature of SCP-1844; as additional refinements to the containment regimen are developed this document will be accordingly revised.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1844 is an elliptical open pit or crater located at 31.7███° N, 35.1███° E. The pit has a present mean diameter of approximately 70 meters and a typical floor depth of approximately 260 meters, although there are several narrow fissures in the floor with an indeterminate depth. The vicinity of the pit is maintained as a secure location under the cover story that it was a military ordnance dumping ground and that unexploded ammunition presents a public danger.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="crater.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1844/crater.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-1844 (inspection by Dr. Garcia)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The temperature at the bottom of the pit normally ranges from approximately 3000 K to 5000 K, occasionally spiking to as high as 9600 K. The source of this heat is incompletely understood. The atmosphere within the pit contains high concentrations of carbon monoxide, sulfur and other mephitic compounds.</p>
<p>The pit, or an extradimensional space accessible through the pit, contains an indeterminate number of hostile entities, the escape of which is arrested by means of the containment regimen. Under ordinary conditions, these entities are believed to be incorporeal. Due to the efficacy of the containment protocol, SCP-1844 has been classified as a Type-II theoeschatologic hazard.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the existence of SCP-1844 has been known for an extensive period of time prior to the commencement of Foundation control over the site, and that some form of containment protocol (albeit more primitive and neither as rigorous nor as effective as that maintained by the Foundation) has been undertaken on a more or less continuous basis for at least thirty-six hundred years. Partial documentation and containment log follows:</p>

XII) chronicling an Egyptian military campaign into the Levant. Records indicate that the Egyptian army was directed to leave unmolested a "temple cult" headquartered at a site conforming to descriptions of SCP-1844.</td>

<td>c. 636 CE</td>
<td>Correspondence of Khalid ibn al-Walid to Umar, the Rashidun Caliph, describes SCP-1844 and requests that Islamic religious authorities inspect the site in order that the activities conducted there be augmented. Letters refer to a "circle of pious Christians and Jews who stand in a ring around the smoking hole and pray, so that the "Whisperer of Evil" (شيطان) shall not come forth from it."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c. 1208 CE</td>
<td>Journals of Geoffrey de Villehardouin, chronicler of the Fourth Crusade, describe what amounts to a containment breach at SCP-1844. The account refers to a Benedictine monastery and a Muslim madrassa that had been constructed next to the pit, and that a "wind of fire" erupted from the pit, destroying both buildings and preventing the monks and Muslim clerics from carrying out their normal containment activities for a period of several days, during which entities described as "demons" or "devils" are described as roaming freely. It should be noted that Geoffrey is not believed to have visited the site, but compiled his account from second-hand sources.</td>

Re: SCP-1844 Containment</p>
<p>Hector — I got your memo, and I don't understand why you would advocate scaling back the containment protocol. We've got them bottled up and people aren't getting burned or taken anymore. I would have thought that you — a Jesuit priest, of all people — would be happy about how successful the improved protocol has been. You seem to have forgotten what the "C" in "SCP" stands for.<br/>

From: Hector Gomez, S.J., Ass't. Site Director<br/>
Re: SCP-1844 Containment</p>
<p>Yusuf — let me try this again. I've been keeping an eye on the instrument readouts for SCP-1844 for the last couple of weeks, and I am really worried that the contrathaumaturgic pressure that's building up under the bottom of the pit is getting dangerously high. All I'm saying is that before we keep patting ourselves on the back for attaining 99.6% containment efficacy over the last two months, we ought to think about the possible unintended consequences of screwing the lid on too tightly. By analogy, a boiler explosion is a hell of a bigger problem than a steam leak.<br/>
Yours in Christ,<br/>
Hector</p>
