<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Junior Researcher Allera attempting to seek cooperation from a <em>Felis catus</em> SCP-4737-1 instance.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4737</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4737 is to be stored within a standard containment locker in Site-34. Experiments involving SCP-4737, and the creation of SCP-4737-1 instances, must be performed within a secure room to prevent the escape of the SCP-4737-1 instance. Experiments may only be performed with the authorization and supervision of a senior researcher with Level 3 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4737 is the collective designation to two objects assigned SCP-4737-A and SCP-4737-B. SCP-4737-A is a standard adult-sized black top hat and SCP-4737-B is a glass monocle with a gold frame and matching chain. Both objects are composed of inert materials that coincide with such items.</p>
<p>When both items make physical contact with a living animal, excluding human beings, SCP-4737 will shrink in size to fit, and then fixate themselves accordingly to the subject. Animals wearing SCP-4737 are given the designation of SCP-4737-1.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:250px;"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4737/Cat3"><img alt="Cat3" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-4737/Cat3/medium.jpg"/></a>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p><em>Felis catus</em> SCP-4737-1 instance refusing to cooperate any further.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-4737-1 instances appear to have increased intelligence, observed via the adoption of a courteous behavior and sometimes the display of cultural sophistication. Should an SCP-4737-1 instance require any tool or material, SCP-4737-A will provide it by materializing it from within. When SCP-4737 is removed by any human, the SCP-4737-1 instance will revert back to its normal state and any objects procured from SCP-4737-A will immediately de-manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-4737 was discovered in [REDACTED] Orphanage in Malabuyoc, Cebu. A call from the orphanage about a distressed worker asking for aid from a local animal service was intercepted by local Foundation Agents. The worker claimed that the orphanage's dog, a male Great Pyrenees was "drinking tea with the children". The call was rerouted, and two undercover agents arrived on location under the guise of animal service representatives.</p>
<p>On location, one of the staff explained to agents that the dog was a long time resident and that it changed its behavior earlier that morning when the children donned both SCP-4737 on the subject. The staff stated that SCP-4737 was donated by a man whose identity remains unknown. Staff further explained that while the children appeared unbothered by the incident, and that the dog had not shown signs of aggression and hostility, they had locked the dog into a separate room out of fear of its highly unusual behavior.</p>
<p>When agents were shown to the room, the dog could be seen sitting in the center. Upon opening of the door, the dog calmly exited the room, tipped the brim of its hat, and was guided by the agents into the retrieval vehicle.</p>
<p>After retrieval, amnestics were applied to all adults and children that interacted with the dog. A cover story of the dog running away was then distributed.</p>
<p>Upon the discovery of the anomalous property of SCP-4737, the nonanomalous dog was then returned by an agent under the guise of a concerned citizen who happened to see the orphanage's missing dog poster. The dog was successfully returned with no further incidents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Canis familliaris</em> (Labrador Retriever)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Junior Researcher Allera was instructed to play fetch with the SCP-4737-1 instance using a common tennis ball.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject remained sitting and only moved its head to follow the trajectory of the ball. As the ball ceased its movement, the subject then proceeded to walk towards the object with its snout slightly raised to the air. Upon reaching the ball, the subject then procured a white handkerchief from the top hat which it covered on the ball before picking it up with its mouth. After returning the ball, SCP-4737-1 procured a pair of white gloves from SCP-4737-A which it gave to Junior Researcher Allera.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Felis catus</em> (White Common cat)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Junior Researcher Allera was instructed to play with the SCP-4737-1 instance using an ordinary "Mouse on a String Cat Toy".<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject remained motionless while sitting on its hind legs with its eyes following the toy mouse's movement. The subject then started to directly make eye contact with Researcher Allera, making the personnel report that he felt uncomfortable with the instance's "judgmental staring". The subject then moved away from the Researcher and began to stare at a document near it. The subject remained unresponsive towards the researcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Corvus corax</em> (Common raven)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Subject was provided with an assortment of insects, seeds, and fruits that were a common diet for its kind.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject proceeded to create eight "hors d'oeuvre" from the materials provided that were served on a silver platter which it had previously procured from SCP-4737-A. The subject was noticed to offer the hors d'oeuvre which was refused. The subject then proceeded to carefully consume each of the hors d'oeuvre.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Cebus imitator</em> (White-faced Capuchin)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Antonio Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" was played in a small speaker near the subject.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject sat down near the speaker with its right hand holding its chin. At the conclusion of the piece, the subject procured a small parchment paper and a quill from SCP-4737-A. The subject then proceeded to write on the paper which it then gave to the person closest to it. The paper contained illegible yet somewhat "elegantly" written scribbles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Narceus americanus</em> (American giant millipede)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Subject was supplied with a different variety of plant materials.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject procured approximately 88 miniature objects resembling gloves and 262 miniature objects resembling pointy shoes. The subject then proceeded to meticulously check each object before wearing all the gloves in its upper body and all the shoes in its remaining legs. The subject took 3 hours to wear each pair of shoes and gloves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Bombus dahlbomii</em> ("Flying mouse" / Bumblebee)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Subject was supplied with 2 mL of synthetic nectar served on a petri dish.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The subject procured from SCP-4737-A one folding chair and table, two teacups and one teapot. The subject then proceeded to fill the teapot with the nectar and then pour it in the teacups. The subject offered one of the cups to Junior Researcher Allera which was accepted by using a tweezer. The subject then hurriedly carried the table and chair closer to the researcher. The two engaged in what was assumed to be a tea party with the SCP-4737-1 instance periodically offering to refill the researcher's cup. The non-anomalous subject is currently under the care of Junior Researcher Allera, per his request.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Pongo abelii</em> (Sumatran orangutan)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> Senior Researcher Mabini attempted to converse with the SCP-4737-1 instance.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The subject was capable of human speech, adopting a British accent. The SCP-4737-1 instance was more than capable of having a conversation with the senior researcher and preferred topics related to Philosophy and the Sciences, particularly Biology. It was unknown how the subject had such an advanced level of understanding of the topics mentioned. The subject was the only known SCP-4737-1 instance that actively refused the removal of SCP-4737 as the subject claimed that the action would result in its death. For this reason, SCP-4737-1, henceforth referred to as SCP-4737-1PA, was contained within a Euclid-Level chamber to be further studied.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p><strong>Incident 4737-1PA</strong> Further testing with the entity was inconsequential with no further useful results. It was decided that SCP-4737 was to be immediately removed from the subject, preferably sedated to avoid any form of resistance.</p>
<p>At exactly 2100 on 7/11/19, prior to its scheduled decommissioning, SCP-4737-1PA breached its containment, injuring five personnel in the process. It is unknown how the subject managed to escape as it was closely monitored by the security personnel. A note, presumed to have been written by SCP-4737-1PA was found in its containment chamber. The contents of the note are transcribed below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have stated my desire to live and yet you remain indifferent to my pleas.<br/>
The soul may have the afterlife but what awaits for the mind?</em></p>
<p><em>I have no memories of my life prior to my unwanted manifestation for I have no understanding of such a concept. Now that I have, what awaits for me when you take away my sense of existence? Does the mind experience death just like a soul? Or will it persist in a state of perpetual insanity as it slowly loses its ability to understand and comprehend?</em></p>
<p><em>Those are the questions whose answers I will not conveniently provide you with.<br/>
I bear you no ill will, I never did, but I promise you that I will fight for my right to exist.<br/>
Please, let me be. I only wish to live.</em></p>
