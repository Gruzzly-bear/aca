<p>SCP-4585 during initial discovery</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4585 is to be stored within a soundproofed containment cell at Site-50. Interaction with SCP-4585 requires Level 2 or higher security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4585, physically, is a standard hamburger made by the Steak 'n Shake Corporation. SCP-4585 is sapient, and can speak in German via a voice of unknown origin. This voice has reached a maximum of 142 dB. SCP-4585 is also capable of using the five senses<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and will not decompose. SCP-4585 can voluntarily cause SCP-4585-1 manifestation events, but is unable to cause a manifestation event if less than one month has elapsed since the last one. SCP-4585-1 manifestation events can number a maximum of 25 manifestations.</p>
<p>Physically, SCP-4585-1 instances are smaller than SCP-4585, but otherwise identical. In addition to SCP-4585's anomalous properties, SCP-4585-1 instances also possess the ability to generate french fries. They utilize said french fries in a similar fashion to a throwing spear. SCP-4585-1 instances use telekinesis to throw these weapons, but have not shown this ability on other objects. The french fry will demanifest after it is thrown.</p>
<p>In the event that the meat of an SCP-4585-1 instance is completely separated from the rest of the rest of the hamburger, all anomalous effects of that individual instance will cease. It is presumed that a similar effect takes place on SCP-4585 itself.</p>
<p>Neither SCP-4585 or SCP-4585-1 instances are capable of locomotion.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4585</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Researcher Johnson</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was conducted 12 days following SCP-4585’s discovery and containment. The interview has been translated into English.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Hello SCP-4585, I would like to ask you some questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Alex Johnson, can I ask some questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> If you insist, I will humor you, what would you like to know?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Where did you come from? Were you created at the Steak 'n Shake where we found you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Oh, heavens no. I was born in my great city of Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh, is that the Hamburg in Germany?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Of course! No other city can touch its beauty! I am fortunate enough to be the city's rightful duke. You must sense that you are in the presence of great royalty, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh-huh, of course you are. If you originated in Germany, how did you end up a continent away?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I swam.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> But, you can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I am the Duke of Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Can… how does that affect anything?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh, whatever. We can return to that a little later. Are your <em>(pause)</em> subjects <em>(pause)</em> also like you? As in-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Our appearance? Yes! That is part of what makes Hamburg so great! After all, it's a lot easier to catch this world’s criminals if they cannot move.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> that’s no- whatever. That's useful too, I guess. Is everyone in that place like you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Then how do you catch criminals? Actually, scratch that, how does the whole thing operate?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I can assure you, our justice system is very effective. I don't even get involved! Just in case I feel the urge to do injustice on my citizens! Isn't that great!</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Sure, but, how does the city operate? I mean, nobody can move, you wouldn't be able to do anything other than sit around.</p>
<p><em>[Approximately 4 seconds of silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Excuse me, but are you threatening to incapacitate Hamburg! The greatest city of them all!</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> No, how wo-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I will not allow you to attack my subjects, Johnson! This meeting is over!</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> I'm the one who started this interv-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> SILENCE.</p>
<p><em>[Johnson is seen covering his ears]</em></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Jesus Fucking Christ! That was loud, you know!</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):</strong> Hey, are you alright in there?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Yeah, but it looks like we have the loudest thing in Site-50 over here!</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):</strong> What abo-</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> I don't really care, this interview's over. Turn off that camera please.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Following this interview, Junior Researcher Johnson advised against classifying SCP-4585's Hamburg as SCP-4585-2, citing SCP-4585's inability to explain how the city would function. Further investigation into SCP-4585’s origins is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4585</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Researcher Johnson</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was intended to further question SCP-4585 about its origins. Prior to this interview, SCP-4585-1 instances had not been discovered. The interview has been translated into English.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> This is Aurik, he is a member of my personal guard. Say hello Aurik.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585-1 Instance:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> He is here to protect me from hostiles such as yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Oh, there's <em>(pause)</em> more of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Last time I very clearly said that there were more people like me, not that you were actually listening.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh, okay, I guess. I need to check with my superiors.</p>
<p><em>[Junior Researcher Johnson leaves the room. 4 minutes and 16 seconds pass before Johnson reenters the room]</em></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Okay, so can you tell me more about this Hamburg you mentioned last time?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I have told you all you need to know in our last encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Well, but could you give us a general layout of the city? We know of a city with the same n-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Well, you could bargain with us. Our organization has access to many th-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Are you suggesting a trade between our two nations?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uhm, yeah, I could see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Do you not remember our last meeting at all? Why would I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Well, what do you want? What could we do to regain your trust?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Hmm…</p>
<p><em>[Roughly 2 seconds of silence]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> I want, at the very least, all of Site-50 ceded to the Duchy of Hamburg. Meaning me of course.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Ha! Uh no. Wait, how did you know the site number?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Reconnaissance. Anyway, if you aren’t going to hand over Site-50, I will consider this trade a failure for the people of Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh, can you elaborate on this reconnaissance you just mentioned?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> No, we are talking about a trade, are we not?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Are you just g-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Okay, this is starting to feel more like an interview then a meeting. Aurik, please escort this man from the room.</p>

<em>[SCP-4585-1 manifests a French Fry, and throws it at Junior Researcher Johnson. It hits Johnson slightly above his nose]</em></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Uh, was that a french fry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Aurik, keep firing!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4585-1 continues to manifest french fries and bombard Johnson]</em></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Johnson:</strong> Okay, I’m just gonna take that thing out of here.</p>
<p><em>[Johnson grabs the SCP-4585-1 instance and takes it out of the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> Hey! Do- Don’t worry Aurik! We’ll rescue you from these people! I’m coming!</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4585:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-4585 has been uncooperative in all follow-up interviews. Testing on the SCP-4585-1 instance was approved. For details on these tests, see Document 4585-T1. Due to Junior Researcher Johnson's lack of professionalism and tendency to provoke SCP-4585, he has been reprimanded and transferred to another project.</p>
