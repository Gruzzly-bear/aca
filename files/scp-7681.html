            <h1>SCP-7681</h1>
            <div class='image-header'><img alt="nova_break" class="small" src="https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=3093455&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1762023332" style="background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=3093455)"/></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class:</strong> Uncontained</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7681 is presently uncontained. The Department of Tactical Theology is investigating potential methods of containment, as all conventional methods of containment have failed (see Addendum-7681-1). Currently, Foundation efforts are focused on identifying victims of SCP-7681, monitoring their status and applying Standardised Cover Procedure ‘Tragic Accident’ or ‘Fatal Mugging’ to the aftermath, along with amnesticising any witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7681 is a phenomenon in which an individual (henceforth SCP-7681-1) will suddenly and inexplicably become obsessed with the concept of enlightenment and claim that they are capable of reaching enlightenment. After an average time of three days, a second individual (henceforth SCP-7681-2) will become affected by SCP-7681 and develop an identical obsession.</p>
<p>All recorded pairs of SCP-7681 victims lived relatively close to each other but did not know each other beforehand; accounts from their friends and relatives stated that the victims claimed to suddenly become aware of the other’s identity. After meeting, SCP-7681 pairs will increase their focus and obsession with enlightenment while continuing their lives for an arbitrary period of up to two weeks.</p>
<p>After that time elapses, both victims will vanish without leaving any record of their intended destination. In some cases, no trace has been found of either victim; in other cases, police efforts have discovered the last known locations of SCP-7681 pairs. In all of the latter cases, large quantities of blood and considerably smaller quantities of biological matter were found at the scenes. Tests showed that the majority of the blood and biological matter belonged to SCP-7681-2, while a significantly smaller quantity of blood came from SCP-7681-1.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-7681-1</strong>: On 12/2/2025, Area-57 Technician Sasha Keller became an SCP-7681-1 instance. Her coworkers alerted their superiors of her abrupt and inexplicable change in behaviour, and after cross-referencing with known SCPs, it was determined that she had fallen victim to SCP-7681. Technician Keller was contained in Area-57 and the resident containment specialists attempted to neutralise the anomaly via multiple methods, the most prominent being amnestics. As mentioned above, all of these methods failed.</p>
<p>After three days, Technician Keller identified SCP-7681-2 as ‘Chris Fitzgerald’ and asked for permission to meet him, which was denied. Using prior SCP-7681 pairs as a guideline, the Foundation searched for individuals by that name in both Brisbane (where Technician Keller had lived before joining the Foundation) and the towns in the vicinity of Area-57, and found several possible matches. The correct match was located a day later, having attempted to break into Area-57 to locate Technician Keller, and was identified as Christopher Allen Fitzgerald, a native of [REDACTED], New South Wales. He was designated SCP-7681-2 and contained separately from Technician Keller.</p>
<p>Continued efforts were made to neutralise the anomaly, but none were successful for either Technician Keller or Fitzgerald. At 5:47 AM on 19/2/2025, Technician Keller was found in the hallway leading to Fitzgerald’s containment chamber and was subsequently recontained. An investigation found that the day before, she had stolen the ID of one of the researchers who had been attempting to neutralise her anomaly, waited until after midnight and used the ID to leave her chamber and then locate and access Fitzgerald’s chamber, where the two had conversed for several hours. Attempts to use amnestics to remove the memory of this conversation failed. Following these failures, Doctor Kade Nova (he/she) conducted an unapproved interview with Technician Keller.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Technician Keller:</strong> Oh my God, what is it now?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Nova:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Another bullshit amnestic test? Some new anomaly that can rewire my mind?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> No, that’s not-</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Because I’m getting <em>really sick</em> of people just treating me like an object and throwing more <em>fucking</em> amnestics in my face, or whatever they think they’ve got that can mind-wipe me!</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> <em>[She grimaces.]</em> I feel like this is a really depressing metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> I don’t care what you’ve- huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nova</strong> Sorry. Uh, look, I’m not here for that, if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>[Squints at Nova.]</em> Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Yeah. Kade Nova. I bumped into you in the canteen last week. You had the caramel donut and I nearly spilled hot chocolate on you.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Oh, yeah! I remember that!</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Sorry about that, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Eh, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Look, like I was saying, I’m not here for that. I’m actually not meant to be here at all.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> *suspiciously* Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Yeah, this is unauthorized and I’m meant to be working on reorganizing-</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> *in unison* -the records after the big switchover. Oh my God, I <em>know.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Yeah. I’m meant to be doing that right now, but, like, fuck that, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>[She nods emphatically.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> And I saw that there’s been no real progress on your whole… thing… so I figured there was no harm in trying to have an actual conversation. Well… theoretically, at least.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Well, you’re the first one who’s actually talked to me, so sure, OK, let’s do that.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> So you’re fine with telling me about this whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Uh, OK then. I’ve read the file, but I’m not assigned to this anomaly, so bear with me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>[She scoffs.]</em> Anomaly. Yeah, sure, OK.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> So, you’ve… found the path to enlightenment?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Can you tell me how to find it?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> No. You wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> …well, that’s abrupt.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Sorry, but that’s how it is. Unless you see things like me and Chris, you’re not going to get it.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> …right. So I can’t get there. If I… did whatever you know how to do, would it work for me?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Uh huh. Is there anything you <em>can</em> tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>[She pauses for a long moment.]</em> It’s about… returning to where we came from. All of us.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> …right. You mean… humanity? Society? The people who've already done this?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Humans, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nova</strong>: I… see. Uh, so, when you say ‘enlightenment’, can you tell me more about that?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>[She pauses again.]</em> Like… a state of eternal bliss where you become one with the universe. You know everything. You see everything. You understand everything. You’re not just <em>you</em>, you’re mixed up with everything. You are the world and the world is you and you're everything forever.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> …I don’t think I can even imagine that.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> I’d be surprised if you could.</p>
<p><strong>Nova</strong>: All right, and you can’t come back from it?</p>
<p><strong>Keller</strong>: Why would you want to?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> OK. And you and Mr Fitzgerald have to somehow get there together? You couldn’t do it alone?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Nope. Needs us both.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Is this the same place that all the other pairs went?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> If they did it right, then yeah, it was.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> All right. Um… I’m trying to figure out how to phrase this, bear with me… why is it so important to you that you find enlightenment?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> What part of ‘eternal bliss where you become one with the universe’ are you not hearing? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> So that’s more important than… everything else here?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> <em>Yes.</em> God, why is nobody here getting it?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Because from our perspective, you’re affected by a compulsion that’s going to make you run off with a guy you didn’t know existed last week and vanish into thin air, all in the name of chasing something you can’t prove exists. We might never find any trace of you, and if we do, it’s going to be nothing but blood and a little gore. Sure, maybe you really will be off in the universe and the rest of us can go fuck ourselves, but what about the rest of your life? Chris Fitzgerald’s got a girlfriend. Nice woman, they moved in together two months ago. His brother’s getting married later this year and Chris is the best man. You’ve got a little sister, right? Stella? Ten years old?</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> *quietly* Nine.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> And she drew all those pictures you’ve got taped up in your workstation. What do you want us to tell Chris’ girlfriend and his family and your sister and the rest of your family? That you and him are all part of the universe now, so you’re not <em>really</em> gone and they need to stop crying because you vanished and all that’s left was some blood, even though you’re never coming back?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Technician Keller is silent, eyes wide.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Nova</strong>: Look, I’m not saying that the way the people you’ve been dealing with have been doing things was correct. If nobody’s actually tried to talk to you before now, it obviously wasn’t. But while you obviously see them as trying to interfere with your plans out of sheer Foundation bullshit, from our perspective, they’re trying really hard to <em>save your lives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> …oh.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Sasha, you got multiple commendations last year for your work here. You’ve been part of the Foundation for nearly a decade now. <em>This is an anomaly. You are under the effect of an anomaly.</em> Work with us on this. <em>Please.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Technician Keller pauses momentarily, and then speaks quietly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> But you want to stop us. Why should I work with you?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Is enlightenment more of a priority than your life here?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Technician Keller remains silent.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> <em>[He sighs.]</em> Listen, I can’t promise anything, but I’ll talk to the higher ups and see what I can spin.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Meaning, they <em>might</em> let you go and… do whatever it is you’re planning to do… if you give us some leeway here. And don’t just run off and abandon your families.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> You really think you can do it?</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Look, I’ll try. That’s all I can promise.</p>
<p><strong>Keller</strong>: I can’t speak for Chris. You have to include him in this.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Of course. Whatever happens, I’ll come back and let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Keller</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>Nova:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Doctor Nova stands and begins to move toward the door.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> …thanks.</p>
</div>
<p>Doctor Nova reported this conversation to the personnel overseeing SCP-7681. After being rebuked for doing so without permission, he successfully argued for a meeting between Technician Keller, Fitzgerald, Senior Researcher Tristan Matthews (who was in charge of investigating SCP-7681) and herself as a mediator.</p>
<p>The meeting took place over several hours. At its conclusion, the following terms had been agreed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>As there appeared to be no time limit to the anomaly, Technician Keller and Fitzgerald agreed to wait a week before completing the process of the anomaly.</li>
<li>They would use the intervening time to get their affairs in order (as much as possible) and write wills with the aid of Foundation legal services. These wills would be backdated and left in their homes.</li>
<li>The Foundation agreed to allow Keller and Fitzgerald to complete the process of the anomaly without hindering them, and provide a location and any tools needed. Keller and Fitzgerald subsequently requested an isolated room or building, a large, sturdy table that could bear considerable amounts of weight, and a very sharp blade.</li>
<li>In exchange, Keller and Fitzgerald agreed to allow the Foundation to record the completion of the process of the anomaly on the condition that no personnel would be physically present at the scene and there would be no attempts to intervene in any way.</li>
<li>Keller and Fitzgerald objected strenuously to any discussion of potentially containing SCP-7681, but agreed to the implantation of tracking devices in their arms and the use of Foundation-issue contact lens cameras before the completion of SCP-7681, in the spirit of research and potential attempts to contact them and other SCP-7681 pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum-7681-2:</strong> On 28/2/2025, Keller and Fitzgerald completed the process of SCP-7681. The transcript of the video can be found below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>&lt;Keller and Fitzgerald stand within an unused room at Area-57. The room is fairly large and contains two cameras on tripods, the requested large table, and multiple devices used for analysis, including Hume counters, Kant counters and ARI units. The requested blade has been left on top of the table.</em></p>
<p><em>Keller inspects all of the technology, making sure that each device is working and operating as required. Fitzgerald sits on the table, moving around to make sure it can hold his weight. He then carefully slices the table’s edge with the knife, testing its sharpness. After both are satisfied, they move to a spot away from the cameras and begin a conversation. Their speech is not picked up by the cameras’ microphones, but both are nodding and smiling, apparently on the same page. After the conversation concludes, they shake hands and both disrobe, leaving their clothes in two piles away from the table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> All right, so…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Fitzgerald climbs onto the table, moves the knife near the table’s edge and lies down in the centre of the table, shifting around to get comfortable. Keller climbs onto the table, kneels beside him and clasps his hands in hers.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Well, here goes nothing, I guess. <em>[She laughs uncertainly]</em></p>
<p><strong>Fitzgerald:</strong> You got this, don’t worry. We’ll get there.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Keller nods and takes a deep breath. Fitzgerald grips her hands tightly. They speak in unison.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller</strong> and <strong>Fitzgerald</strong>: I surrender myself to enlightenment. I give myself to the universe. Everything I am is to be everything. I am whole. I am dissolved. I am infinite.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Nothing seems to happen, but both seem satisfied.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> All right, then…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Keller bites her lip, picks up the blade carefully and makes an incision just below where Fitzgerald’s sternum ends. She makes a circular cut around his lower torso, ending just above his groin. Returning to the sternum, she makes another cut, moving in the opposite direction, but ends it close to where the other cut ended, making sure not to sever the skin entirely. She carefully lifts the skin and pulls it back, displaying Fitzgerald’s internal organs. Throughout this process, Fitzgerald watches with vague amusement, apparently not in any pain.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> Right. Right. OK. Uh…</p>
<p><em>&lt;She puts the knife down next to her and reaches into Fitzgerald’s torso, grasping his intestines. She flinches, pauses and then carefully pulls most of the intestines from his body, but does not attempt to sever them, instead letting them rest on the outer edge of the open wound. She repeats this process with his liver, stomach, gall bladder, large intestine, appendix, kidneys and bladder while doing her best to move them but not damage them, thus creating a large cavity in Fitzgerald’s body. Fitzgerald makes the occasional gesture and quiet comment, but still does not seem to be in pain.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> I guess this is it, then.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzgerald:</strong> I guess it is.</p>
<p><strong>Keller:</strong> See you on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>Fitzgerald:</strong> *chuckles* Yeah, guess I will.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Keller takes a deep breath, closes her eyes and exhales. She picks up the knife and makes a long, deep cut along her palm. She drops the knife onto the floor and holds her hand over the cavity in Fitzgerald’s body, letting blood drip into it. Nothing appears to happen, but Keller appears satisfied. She brushes her hair away from her face, holding it back, and then bends over Fitzgerald, inserting her head into the cavity. After several seconds, her hands fall to her side and her body becomes rigid.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Fitzgerald:</strong> That’s it! You did it!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Keller’s head continues to descend into the cavity. Her arms remain by her sides as her body moves to become suspended vertically above Fitzgerald, held up by an unknown force. The cavity seems to enlarge and distort to receive her shoulders and torso. Over the course of several minutes, Technician Keller’s body disappears into Fitzgerald’s torso until her feet are finally gone from sight.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Fitzgerald:</strong> Here I go…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Fitzgerald’s body becomes rigid. His legs bend toward him in a crescent, bones cracking audibly so his feet can enter the cavity in his torso. His body is slowly consumed by itself, the organs becoming pulled into the hole by an unseen force. His body makes a twisting, distorted manoeuvre, allowing his head to enter the hole in the torso. He seems to blur slightly and then is gone entirely, leaving only a large quantity of blood behind.&gt;</em></p>
</div>
<p>The contact lens cameras and tracking devices failed to operate after the completion of SCP-7681. The results of the various analytic devices were inconclusive. The Department of Tactical Theology is currently studying the footage from Addendum-7681-2.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-7681-3:</strong> At 1:17 AM on 9/6/2024, Stella Keller’s tenth birthday, an automatic transcribing device<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> that was not in use suddenly activated (despite being turned off and lacking power), and began writing a message. Area-57 personnel did not find the message until the next day, whereupon it was reported to Area Director Margot Green. After being fully appraised of the situation, Area Director Green ordered that the device be moved to a containment locker for Safe anomalies and its output periodically checked. Over the course of the following months, the device wrote the following message, the entire text of which can be read below:</p>
