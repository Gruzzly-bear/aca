            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3665</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3665 is to be contained in a standard Safe Class locker in Site-19. In the event that the packaged 'Imitation Blood' contained within SCP-3665 runs out, blood obtained from D-Class personnel may be used. During testing, research staff are advised to ensure that the powder used in the activation of SCP-3665-1 is not lost.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3665 is a 15x10x3.5cm package of a powdery substance, labelled as 'Instant Demon, Just Add Blood!', with a depiction of a stylized male and female demon, with ram-like horns, and bat-like wings, on either side of the text. Inside the package, there is a moderate amount of dry powder of an unidentified substance, or mixture of substances, having the overall consistency of talcum powder. Also packaged is a small, plastic container of 'Imitation Blood', containing what appears to be cranberry juice, red food coloring, and a currently unidentified substance, along with instructions for use.</p>

<p>When these instructions are followed, the powder around the area where the subject's name was written will begin to steam, and will continue to do so for roughly twenty minutes. Following this, SCP-3665-1 will appear to the individual who activated SCP-3665, appearing first as a red mist, before adopting its usual form, expressing discontent that it must 'limit itself to such a lowly form', and greeting the individual who 'summoned' it.</p>
<p>SCP-3665-1 is an entity that is only perceptible to the individual who activated SCP-3665. Exact features such as gender, age, and ethnicity vary based on the individual, but SCP-3665-1 is most often described to be a humanoid, with the addition of features similar to a depiction of a demon or evil spirit, such as horn-like protrusions from the head, bat-like wings, and a short tail<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-3665-1 will speak in the language best known by the individual who activated SCP-3665, and appears to have an innate knowledge of the subject's history, personal life, and preferences. SCP-3665-1 appears to be unaware of, or unwilling to acknowledge anyone except the individual who 'summoned' it. SCP-3665-1 is able to seemingly remember specific events when activated by the same person multiple times, but is unable or unwilling to recall events that happened when it was activated by another individual.</p>
<p>While present, SCP-3665-1 will perform tasks that are assigned to it by the individual who activated SCP-3665, however, actions that SCP-3665-1 appears to take do not affect anything other than the subject's perception. For instance, if asked to move a cup from one table to another, the subject would visualize SCP-3665-1 moving the cup. No-one other than the subject would see the cup moving. However, when SCP-3665-1 expires, the cup would be in its original position. SCP-3665-1 is also seemingly unable to cause anyone serious injury, or do anything that would significantly affect the surrounding area, due to its only being able to affect the subject's perception. If asked to do something it is unable to, SCP-3665-1 will respond with: 'Leave these frivolous demands, which strike a terror to my fainting soul!'<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. SCP-3665-1 will react similarly if asked a question the subject is unaware of the answer to. This can include giving incorrect information if the subject holds an untrue belief. After two hours, SCP-3665-1 will begin to disappear, described as evaporating slowly. During this time, all changes to the subject's perception will be reverted.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Reynard<br/>
<strong>Subject's Request:</strong> SCP-3665-1 is asked who or what it is.<br/>
<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> Lowly human who dares to question my nature when knowledge of it would strike fear into thy very soul! I am a demon called here to fulfill your will! Call me what you will!</p>

<p><strong>Date of Test:</strong> ██/██/2017<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Reynard<br/>
<strong>Subject's Request:</strong> SCP-3665-1 was told that it would be called 'Bob' for the remainder of the testing period.<br/>
<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> Yes! 'Tis indeed a good name that shall strike terror into the hearts of all good and holy men! All shall fear the name of 'Bob'!</p>

<p><strong>Date of Test:</strong> ██/██/2017<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Reynard<br/>
<strong>Subject's Request:</strong> SCP-3665-1 was told to retrieve a cup of coffee.<br/>
<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> SCP-3665-1 leaves the room for roughly twenty seconds. SCP-3665-1 returns with a cup of coffee that is hot to the touch, and tastes like coffee. Put empty cup of coffee down on table.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Reynard made motions that indicated he was seeing a cup of coffee in front of him, and reported feeling re-energized after drinking it. This is believed to be a result of the placebo effect.</p>

<p><strong>Date of Test:</strong> ██/██/2017<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Reynard<br/>
<strong>Subject's Request:</strong> SCP-3665-1 was told to retrieve a small cup of water, and pour it on Dr. Reynard.<br/>
<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> SCP-3665-1 leaves the room for roughly twenty seconds. SCP-3665-1 returns with a cup of water, and pours it on Dr. Reynard. Dr. Reynard experiences discomfort, but his clothes and body are not wet to the touch.</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> An object is placed behind the door to the testing chamber. Dr. Reynard is unaware of what this object is, but is aware that one has been placed.<br/>
<strong>Subject's Request:</strong> Dr. Reynard instructs SCP-3665-1 to open the door, allowing himself to see what the object is.<br/>
<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> Leave these frivolous demands, which strike a terror to my fainting soul! (SCP-3665-1 was unable to do so.)</p>

<strong>Transcribed Response:</strong> Leave these frivolous demands, which strike a terror to my fainting soul!<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Reynard noted that this was stated in the same tone of voice and intonation as it was previously stated, likened to a 'prerecorded message'.</p>

<div class="title">Footnotes</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. Latin for 'Man, fly!'. This is believed to be a reference to the play 'Doctor Faustus', as SCP-3665-1 has also referenced this play on occasion. The scene from 'Doctor Faustus' in which this phrase is used involves the words appearing on the titular character's arm, warning him not to sign a contract with the demon Mephistophilis.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-2"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')">2</a>. This appears to be variable depending on what the subject considers a demon or evil spirit to be. One researcher who was raised in Eastern Asia reported SCP-3665-1 to appear as a human wearing an Oni mask with red skin.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. This is another quote from Doctor Faustus, the scene in which involves a demon refusing to elaborate on the nature of hell.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. This is a quote from Doctor Faustus, in which a demon provides an elusive response to one of the titular character's scientific questions. The Latin translation is 'Unequal motion with respect to the whole thing'. Dr. Reynard had not read Doctor Faustus at the time.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. Also a quote from Doctor Faustus, the scene from which involves the demon Mephistophilis explaining why Lucifer tempts humans. The Latin translation is 'to the unhappy, it is a comfort to have had company in misery', or more simply, 'misery loves company'.</div>
