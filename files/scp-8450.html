<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Although SCP-8450 does not require exterior assistance to initiate the regrowth process, it is to be stored in an unlit room kept at 23° Celsius in order to shorten regrowth periods as much as possible. Sections of SCP-8450 no greater than 50% of its mass may be removed by the Site-19 culinary staff for the purpose of brewing vinegar.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8450 is a 900-gram biofilm consisting of cellulose and acetic acid bacteria<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-8450 is able to regrow lost mass over time without exterior assistance. The time frame in which regeneration occurs within SCP-8450 exponentially increases in accordance with how much of SCP-8450 has been removed.</p>
<p>SCP-8450 was recovered on 23/MAR/2011. A paper document detailing the supposed creation of SCP-8450 was retrieved alongside it. The author of the paper is currently unknown, as whoever wrote the document used various names across its creation.</p>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>How to make wine.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>I want to preface this by saying, I don't know if this is going to become a hobby or not. If it's something I do and practice for the rest of my life, it'd be great! But, I'm not even sure if I'll commit to this yet. Alas, I'm going to try.</p>
<p>So, basically, <span style="color: orange">a very close friend of mine</span> brews his own wine. He's sort've been an awakening for me. Whenever he finishes a batch, he invites me over and we have a drink. I've bought and read a few books on fermentation, and I think I've got this sorted out. Main thing I'd be worried about are preservatives, but I don't think they're that big of an issue.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">What the fuck is wrong with you?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">I talked to Mrs. Golde on the phone. Turns out, you haven't even gone to her house yet.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Oh, and that's a really big problem?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Yes, it is! Do you want to end up alone and dying in your 50's?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No. Of course not.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Then why won't you give that Golde girl a chance? Mrs. Golde says her daughter is very delightful.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Because I haven't even met her before now. Whenever I meet a girl, I want it to be something natural. Not-</p>

<p>Henry, <span style="color: #42a1ff">I want grandchildren. I want your</span> <span style="color: lime">father</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">to be able to see his grandkids before he smokes or drinks himself to death.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I want to finish college first.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">They aren't exclusive. You can always do both! Or finish college later.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'll find someone in Blackwater, <span style="color: #42a1ff">mom.</span> Someone that'll be the one.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Really?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I promise.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Don't disappoint your</span> <span style="color: lime">father,</span> Henry.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I won't.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Why are you so adamant on refusing to go into dorms?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I just- don't really want to.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Look, I found this <span style="color: turquoise">guy</span> who will split rent with me. It comes out to about $50 a month.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">You're forgetting bills, food, and transportation! As opposed to just living on campus and having most of those reduced, if not gone.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'd rather have the peace of mind of my own house than dorms.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">You're being an idiot!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Mom!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">You're- If you don't listen to me, you will regret it! You could be roommates with a serial killer!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Remember <span style="color: turquoise">Davey?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">No?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah, I think <span style="color: lime">Dad</span> knew him more. We used to go to school together until he moved, but we've been in contact and found out we're both going to Blackwater. Ask <span style="color: lime">Dad</span> about him.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Oh, I will!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Look, I need to start packing soon, anyway. Can we talk about this later?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Fine. But it's not too late to change your choice! I can help you talk to the school and get you into dorms if you want.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Thanks… Love you, <span style="color: #42a1ff">Mom…</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>I was helping my neighbor the other day get his groceries into his kitchen. My idea of home-fermenting came up while we were talking, and I walked away with 3 pounds of blackberries from his daughter's farm. It's going to be a few days before I can start fermenting, but I guess I decided on which flavor it is.</p>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Jesus, man. It's been so long.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Yeah, it took me all of yesterday and today to get moved in.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>How'd that go?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Eh. It's a lot easier than getting everything packed and moving it into the truck, but still hard work.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I feel you.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">How much more stuff do you have in your car?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Uh, about a box full.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Only that?!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hey, not everyone's some trillionaire who chose to bring every little trinket they own to university.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I wish I could bring everything. There's so much cool shit I wish I remembered to pack.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>You are a lost case, Davey Whittaker.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Well, if you have nothing to unpack then why don't you help me with my stuff?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Well… I do have that <em>one</em> box, after all-</p>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">

</div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Thanks.</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>Supposedly, this will be pretty easy. I get an equal part of sugar to the berries, a packet of brewers yeast, and 1 and 2/3rds parts of boiling water. Mixed up the sugar, berries, and water in this plastic bucket they sold to me as a "jug" and waited for the water to cool down.</p>
<p>If the water's too hot when you put the yeast in, all of the yeast will die. So I ended up waiting about half an hour to put in the yeast so the whole thing was room temperature. Then, I had to wait <em>another</em> 10 minutes for the yeast to bloom before I could mix it all up.</p>
<p>Now, it's just a whole lot of waiting around…</p>

<p>I. Spilt. Half. Of. The. Fucking. Batch.</p>
<p>It's probably closer to 2/3rds, honestly. It doesn't matter. It's still like 1-2 pounds. I'm adding some more water and sugar to it. I'm also going to add another… Half-packet? Something around that - of yeast. Hopefully, I can save it. But, I don't know. I'll just have to see.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Welcome back.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hey.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">How was your day?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Pretty good. Had a lecture this morning and was almost late to work.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I mean, they don't really care about that if it's only a few minutes. Do they?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No, no. Not usually, at least. <span style="color: orange">Gary</span> is really relaxed with stuff like that.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">So bad news is that we're out of pasta sauce. The good news is that I'm making us pasta.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I got paid the other day. I can run down to the store and get some.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">We don't need to. But, we do need to focus on saving money.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Save $2 on a jar of marinara?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">It adds up.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I've been putting in arguably way too many hours at that mill. A few bucks off of my check every week for stuff like that isn't going to hurt.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I know. But,</span> Henry-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Have you ever considered dorm rooms?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Come on-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'm not going to live in some rowdy-ass dorm room where people keep me up until 6 a.m. with how loud they are.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I can always cover your half.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Definitely not!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">-only for a few months. It wouldn't be forever.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I can't do that!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Also, remember <span style="color: orange">Gary?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Yeah?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Turns out, he's gay!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">He's gay?!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah. Just confessed to me. The strangest thing is - he tried to hide it! Just kept it casual.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">What? Did he say something like "Oh, hey</span> Henry. <span style="color: turquoise">Over here! Did you move that wood like I asked? By the way, I'm super gay! Also, did you secure it properly?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Nothing like that, no. Well, sort of. He just said he had a boyfriend and moved on.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Huh-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's really weird. You know - to just hide something like that. I don't know if I-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Actually, think you could get us that sauce?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Marinara?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Yeah, from the store.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Are you sure? What about wasting-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I'm sure. I have a $10 bill on the table. Use that.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Alright. Thanks. See you in a bit.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Bye.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>It's summertime! Which means that hours are going to start to get really, really competitive. I'm not too worried, usually <span style="color: #de2cc6">Paul</span> schedules the supervisors decently. But, it still is noticeably less hours. Then you got the stress of the raised sales, training new people, and a bunch more work.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I siphoned the blackberry wine from the "jug" into a glass bottle for their second fermentation. Well, first I had to strain out all of the berries. But then I was able to siphon it. Once again, I'm left to wait for stuff to start happening.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry! <span style="color: orange">You're on the clock?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yep.</p>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Great! I'm going to put you on the forklift for now. At least, for an hour or so. Might have you cycle around a bit while people go on breaks.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Okay.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Fermín's going out later to buy snacks for the next week. If you want to request anything.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I think I'll pass.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Make sure they last - we need to still have some of them left over for all of next week.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I will. I think I'm being scheduled around 50 hours next week. I'm motivated enough to leave some behind.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">I'm working 72, here.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I don't even get why <span style="color: #de2cc6">Paul</span> is making us do this.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Paul</span> <span style="color: orange">says it's so the workload is easier for us year-round. I think it's just some promotional crap to get building companies into business with him.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I feel like there are better ways for publicity than doing the buyout every year.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Probably. But, at least the pay is great.</span> <span style="color: #de2cc6">Paul</span> <span style="color: orange">gives anyone who works more than 48 hours a $3 an hour raise for the week.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No shit?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">The downside is that whatever time in your shift that isn't a break is spent doing constant labor.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>If I'm being honest, I'll probably start asking for more hours that week.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Why?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">What's the point in overworking yourself more than you need to?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I need the money. Don't want college debt to loom over me.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Yeah, I get you. Took me like 10 years to pay mine off. But, trust me, putting in an extra few hours isn't going to help you that much. Especially compared to how much more work you're going to do.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Eh, I really need the money.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Whatever you choose to do with your own time is up to you. But I think you might want to think about it a bit more before asking for extra hours.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Do you have a problem with it?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Hell no. An extra pair of hands are always welcome.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Then there's nothing wrong with it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry! <span style="color: orange">Over here for a second. I have a quick question.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Is me dating Lee a problem to you?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">I mean- you acted weird when you didn't even know for sure. Then you acted weird when I told you I was gay. So, I need to know - is it going to be a problem?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
Hell no. I'm fine with it.<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">About?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Just - how I reacted to finding out. You're like- the first person I've ever met that was… yeah.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">It's fine.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I don't know. It's just been on my mind since then. I should've reacted differently. I don't know why I reacted like that.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">If I remember right, we're both off at 6? I'm probably going to stay until 6:20/6:30, anyway. If you stick around, I can get you a beer and we can talk it over. Alright?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>If you want to do that.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Great. Now, stop loitering around and get working.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Beer is a strange thing. 99% of the time, it tastes like piss. But the thing is, the more you keep drinking beer, the more you start to remember it as tasting good. Then, when you drink enough of it, it starts tasting really good. The reason I'm saying this is because there was a deal where I could buy a six-pack and get one for free - which I am only partially ashamed to have bought.</p>
<p>There is a reason hanging out with your buddies drinking beer until you're all wasted is popular. Well, three reasons. A great time, hanging out with the boys, and waking up the next day hungover. Specifically when you start to piece together everything that you said, thought, and realized the night before and make sense of it. Because that starts to make you come to certain realizations about yourself and a specific person around you.</p>
<p>I'm worried about the wine - how it's going to turn out. It's a very passive process. But, a whole lot can go wrong. What if I made it wrong? What if it becomes something nasty in the end? What if I followed a bad recipe? What if I made one of a million mistakes I could've made?</p>
<p>I'm just anxious about it, but I really want this to come out right.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Welcome back.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hey.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Are you ready?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No, not yet. Give me an hour or two. I need to take a nap and get some water first.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Alright. Just tell me when you're ready.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Okay. I'm ready.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Where is this spot, anyway?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's on some old hiking trail an hour out of town. It leads to a clearing and you get a perfect view of the sky.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">If we want to watch a movie, we've got to pick it up now. We might not be back before the Blockbuster closes.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Pick anything, yet?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise"><em>The Thing.</em></span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Huh. Isn't that like… A shitty-ass horror movie?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I've heard it's good.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>From who?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Film students. They know their shit.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Let's hit the road.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">After you.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I spent a lot of time picking this spot. I think you're going to love it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Can't wait!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Let's see if we can catch the northern lights.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>I hate the weather in Oregon. You go through the extremes of everything. Blizzards, rain, floods, heatwaves, droughts, fires, earthquakes, and all of the nasty days you can imagine.</p>
<p>But, there are a few weeks hidden in the year that are <em>perfect.</em></p>
<p>Toward the end of summer going into fall, you have such beautiful weather. Nights go down to just-chilly-enough, days go to barely being warm, and it has the most beautiful sunsets you could imagine. A day where you can hike out into the middle of nowhere, pour a cool glass of wine, and just enjoy the beautiful sky.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="color: red">We need to see it. At least a glimpse of it. Anything!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: red">We'll see it. I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span> we'll see it. We just need to drive a bit more.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: orange">I thought we'd see it by now. But, we aren't at the spot yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: orange">When we get there, we should see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck! Where is it? The forecast said we should be able to see the lights up here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">I- I fucking scouted out this spot for 3 weeks!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">.</span><span style="color: red">.</span><span style="color: blue">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: green">It's alright. It's just- infuriating. I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: green">I put so much effort into finding this spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">I need to tell you something…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">And I'm not too sure I'd be able to tell you this in any other way, in any other place.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">I wanted this something to be special. For you, and me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">And I wanted where it was to be special. A alone place in nature, where we can hear the crickets and the night sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">.</span><span style="color: yellow">..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: red">D</span><span style="color: orange">a</span><span style="color: yellow">v</span><span style="color: green">e</span><span style="color: blue">y</span><span style="color: indigo">,</span> <span style="color: violet">I</span> <span style="color: red">l</span><span style="color: orange">o</span><span style="color: yellow">v</span><span style="color: green">e</span> <span style="color: blue">y</span><span style="color: indigo">o</span><span style="color: violet">u</span><span style="color: red">.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Fuck it, I'm starting over. Too many things have gone wrong to spend so much money on it - on something that probably won't end up tasting good. I've been thinking about everything that could've gone wrong for a while, that will go wrong. And I've decided it's not worth it to try something I know for a fact won't work out.</p>
<p>So, I'm starting from scratch. I'm going to try to use blueberries this time. Same recipe and everything else. I might put a bit of honey in later on - see how it works out. But, this time, it will be good. It will work out. I know it will.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You're going to do <em><strong>what?</strong></em></span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I can't keep this up, <span style="color: turquoise">Davey.</span> At least, not right now.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You <em>know</em> I've always offered to help pay. If you just said yes! I don't know how much my family would pay, but-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I can't! I don't want to spend the rest of my life in debt to people.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">They're my family! And they know you, they like you!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>That's not the point. It's not my money! For all I know, they'd come knocking for me to pay it back anyway in a decade or so.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">They won't do that!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>You don't know how much I want to believe you. But, I can't know that!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Let's say they want the money in a few years, which they won't, then it's the same amount of money. But, no interest! Isn't that good enough?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Or- I could take a gap year. Get a good head start and save up enough to get me through the rest of college. Pay off the debt over the next decade or so - then be debt-free without the possibility of being asked for tens of thousands of dollars all at once!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">How do you know that'll work?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I just- I need more time to think on it. But, I think it's a good plan.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Or, you can take the help and they'll let you finish college with barely any debt at all. And, you'll finish college faster!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's not-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Just-</span> Henry, <span style="color: turquoise">please. My parents are coming down in 2 weeks. When they're down here, we'll tell them-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No! We are not-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">We'll tell them about us, and they'll be willing to help you!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>We are not telling them. What if it goes wrong? What if they tell people?!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">They won't do that!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>If they do, it's over! I go from maybe finishing college 1 or 2 years late, to not even being able to finish college without reasonably thinking I might get fucking lynched!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You know my parents. Do they seem like the type that would do that bullshit?!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I don't really remember them! A lot can change over 5 years. As far as I know, your mom and dad might be homophobic!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">My aunt is a lesbian! My dad is a politician! Let's say he does freak out about it and doesn't support it - do you think he'd go around making a big show that he has a gay son? That'd fucking ruin his career if he did. And, he's fine with gay people anyway! He won't do anything.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>You're sure?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">They'll be fine with it! At worst, they don't help you with it. But, that's the worst that can happen. Nothing else.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>When are they coming over?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I think they get here on a Saturday? Look, we can talk things over in the next few weeks! But please, let's at least float it around before you reject it.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>If you are really, really sure that they won't freak out over it, it's fine. I guess. But, you aren't going to ask them right away for help. I'm not sure I'm fine asking for their money.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">That's fine. Of course, it's fine. It should be your choice! Just- thank you! I'm happy you finally get to meet them and we get to tell them.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>I'm glad I didn't give up on brewing this thing entirely. I think I have a serious shot at it this time around. I've been reading the same books, buying new ones, and asking for advice.</p>
<p>I think this is a solid bet. I'm looking forward to it!</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>You know, I took a picture that night.<br/>
A really, really pretty one.<br/>
It wasn't able to capture everything - especially not any of the lights.<br/>
But, it was beautiful.<br/>
That night was the most beautiful night of my life.<br/>
This is the most beautiful picture I have ever taken in my entire life.<br/>
And, I want you to have it.<br/>
My beauty, my star, my beautiful night.<br/>
<em>Our special night.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But, I don't want it to just be a regular picture.<br/>
Especially for you?<br/>
No.<br/>
I want it to be something different…<br/>
A way it can remind you.<br/>
Remind you of <em>our special night.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thank you.<br/>
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.<br/>
Thank you, <span style="color: turquoise">Davey Whittaker.</span> For letting us be together.<br/>
For letting us love each other.<br/>
Thank you, for how much I love you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I found a girl who makes custom watches at the uni.<br/>
They're pretty good quality.<br/>
Real silver and a bunch of other fancy things - she assures me.<br/>
But what's most valuable is what the background is.<br/>
We can choose what we want it to be.<br/>
So, I got you a watch with the background being <em>our special night.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And it's for you.<br/>
It's a gift - from me, to you.<br/>
<em>A special night</em> spent with me and you.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>And I'll always remember <em>our special night.</em></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>One thing you'll find a lot of in Oregon are breweries. Especially in Blackwater. I think there are something like 30 across the entire city. When I first moved here, I remember that you could get beer from employees who bought a bunch to sell to you at like 3 times the price.</p>
<p>Don't know if that's still a thing. It probably is. Back in Coeur d'Alene, my cousin used to buy alcohol I wanted - so long as I paid for it. I got to send him a bottle one day - a homebrewed one. As a thanks.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Babe, is this yours?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Yeah. I mean- it was. But, I was going to give it to you.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Jesus- how much is it? It has to be at least a grand!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">$3,200.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Oh my god. Where'd you get this?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">From my parents. But, they want it to be spent on the rent and bills for the next few months. And nothing else.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No! I'm not accepting this.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">It's only 3 months! I looked at your checks and you only made $300 this month.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>First off, why are you looking at my checks?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You left them on the couch! I was going to move them anyway and accidentally read them.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>"Accidentally". Really?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Your half of the rent, the bills, the food, and everything is barely going to leave you anything left!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I hardly even agreed to your parents helping me with college. Let alone having to come out to them. Now, they're paying for my rent?!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">It's only 3 months! You get on your feet, save up a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, then go back to paying rent!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'm not going to be dependent on them to go to college.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You aren't! You're taking help!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No. I'm not taking this. I'm not using it, I'm not paying with it, I'm not even going to keep touching it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You aren't doing that.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yes, I will.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Then I'll send it with my half! Do you want to give the landlord and utilities an extra few hundred a month?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Davey-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You can't let your pride get in the way of your education, here!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's not my pride-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">It's about not owing anyone, yeah. But it's cash! And, they've said that they're only willing to pay up to this.</span></p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Do you think I didn't ask for more?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I didn't think you'd ask for anything at all because I never asked you to do this!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You just-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Look, are you still going to pay for your half even if I pay for it with this?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Fucking- fine! We'll use it, I guess. No point not to. But, this isn't becoming a regular fucking thing.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>My favorite thing to eat is probably sliced tomatoes. They were something my <span style="color: lime">Dad</span> used to make all of the time. He used to slice them and coat each slice in olive oil, vinegar, and salt. They were, and still are, the best way to eat raw tomatoes. Even then, I used to hate when <span style="color: lime">Dad</span> made pasta sauce from scratch. I'd be less mad if he used way, way less onions. Also if he used any other seasoning than a little bit of salt.</p>
<p>One night, I remember him coming home with a bottle of <span style="color: yellow">red wine</span> - a gift from one of his neighbors. I think I was… 10? 9? Around that. He picked two tomatoes, gave them the Murders family treatment, and gave me one. Then, he gave me a mason jar filled with <span style="color: yellow">red wine.</span> After I tasted it, he asked me how it was. I told him it was awful, because it was at the time, and he laughed. Told me to remember that taste any time in the future when I wanted to start drinking.<br/>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I made you a special something.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Ooh.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Orecchiette pasta, I remember you teaching me how to make it by hand like your</span> <span style="color: lime">dad</span> <span style="color: turquoise">taught you. I also made chicken parm, and tomato sauce.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>You didn't need to-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry, <span style="color: turquoise">I'm sorry about yesterday. I should've asked you first. And, I want to apologize.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Thank you! But again, you didn't need to do this.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Bitch! We still need to eat.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hah, I guess we do. I mean, I'm not complaining.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>This is really good.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Do you like it?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hm? Oh, no. I hate it. Hate it so much. I think you should try to make this again - because this was so bad that you need to keep making it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Well, if you hate it <em>so</em> much I might as well not do it again-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Now, now. Don't just give up!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>How'd you make the sauce?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I used at least half of a head of garlic in it. Fried it with a single shallot before putting a few canned tomatoes in it and cooking them until they fell apart. I don't even remember what seasoning I used. I think salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary, lemon zest, and a bunch of other things. Toward the end, I also poured in a bit of fancy</span> <span style="color: yellow">red wine</span> <span style="color: turquoise">I got as a gift yesterday.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Oh? From who?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">A guy named</span> <span style="color: yellow">James</span> <span style="color: turquoise">from the university.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>That's nice of him.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I'm glad you like the sauce.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Only thing I could genuinely say is, that I wish you put a bit more onions in it. But that might be my <span style="color: lime">dad</span> talking through me.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Blackwater's going through a bit of a cold snap right now. I was panicking, trying to make sure that the wine was in a warm room. Somewhere that will be warm for the next few days. Over the weekend, it might hit the 20's.</p>
<p>If the wine freezes, it could explode the bottle. Even if it doesn't, I am worried about it killing off anything inside of it.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically I shouldn't worry about it. It's not going to get anywhere near cold enough to freeze it to the point of exploding. But, I'm still going to worry about it, anyway.</p>

<p>The wine's looking good. I checked on it today and moved it to a different container to finish fermenting in. Just been checking up on it every now and again. I don't think you need to change containers, though? But, I don't know. I'm just nervous about this whole thing. I want to make sure it goes right.</p>
<p>It does have a bit of an off-smell to it, however.</p>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yep.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Jesus! All these hours you've been putting in on top of uni- Lord knows if I had more workers like you, I'd own the whole of the Pacific Northwest.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Heh, maybe one day.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">What're you majorin' in?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Forensic Archeology.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Nice! But, I ain't here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about your work record.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>In a good way?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Yes. In a very good way.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Get on with it, then.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">It's really impressive. According to</span> <span style="color: orange">Gary,</span> <span style="color: #de2cc6">you have perfect attendance all while putting in this much work. Have you ever pondered shooting to become a supervisor?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>A few times.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Well I think you're ready for it. If you want, I can send you the material you need to start that process.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What do I need to do?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Mostly just read guides and instructions. It's a lot of after-work reading and using your time. But, it's well worth it! You start out with a pay raise of up to $11 an hour. After a while, we'll review your performance and you can earn up to $16 an hour!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'd probably like those forms, then.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #de2cc6">Great! I have a few of 'em here. But, I'll mostly get them sent to you over the next week. It's up to you when to complete them. When you do, make sure to get in contact with me!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Hell yeah!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Give me 1 week, and I'll be a supervisor just like you.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">1 week!? It's going to take a lot more than that, my friend.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What? Like 8 days? 9 days?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Took me like a month to get it done in my spare time!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Uh oh.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Admittedly, it was probably only like 15 hours of work. But I barely ever had the time to work on it!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Eh, I'll figure it out.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">But, this is still good.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Your days of being my tyrannical supervisor are over.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Just you wait until I figure out how to get promoted past this.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'll rue the day…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Davey's</span> <span style="color: orange">going to be really happy when you tell him.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Eh-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Is he not?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>He's going to be happy for me, but I'm not too sure about me getting more money.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">What?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I don't know. It's weird.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">Why wouldn't he want you to have more money?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>He really, really wants his parents to pay my rent.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">And you're mad about that?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>No. I mean- he means well. And I love that he's caring about that and worried for me. But, I can pay it myself! I'm already uncomfortable having his parents pay for my college - mostly because I'm worried that they're going to want me to pay it back. Again, I know he means well. But… I don't know what I'm going for here.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">It's up to you what you do. I'd take the money, personally. But, it's not his place to make you take it.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Eh, it'll work out! We just need to wait and get by.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: orange">I don't think I've met</span> <span style="color: turquoise">Davey</span> <span style="color: orange">yet. If you want, you two could come over and visit me and Lee and we can make some drinks together. We just finished stocking up our bar.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>That honestly sounds amazing. Be a nice difference from all the <span style="color: yellow">red wine</span> <span style="color: turquoise">Davey's</span> been buying.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>About a month left on the wine. I'm getting real excited. I don't want to do anything that'd mess it up, so I'm not laying a finger on it until I have to. But, it looks good! I went ahead and bought some custom labels for it that're going to be imprinted on the bottle. Should come sometime over the next few weeks.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="color: yellow">You know, you think everything in your life is perfect. Going really smooth with it all figured out.</span><br/>

<span style="color: white">Then you get hit with a long, cold, winter's night. One that's so cold you can't even fall asleep.</span><br/>
<span style="color: white">A type of night with a single good purpose - exploring the fucked-up depths of your mind.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">So you search. That's all you can do. Then, after you search, you discover. Then, you think.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Think about what you've done, your memories, and who you could have been…</span><br/>
<span style="color: grey">Only to come up with the most horrific realization one could ever imagine…</span><br/>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Of course.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">You all packed up for Coeur d'Alene?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: violet">Yep.</span></p>

</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Probably around 4:00 A.M. since it's damn well close to a 10-hour drive.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Yeah, then I probably won't wake up for you.</span></p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Wow, the betrayal…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">I should probably get my goodbyes out now before I don't see you for a week.</span></p>

<hr/>
<p>Coeur d'Alene! My dearly despised! It's a horrible little place in the middle of nowhere Idaho. The worst part about it is that the nature surrounding it is absolutely beautiful. Just the fact that you have to live in a town such as Coeur d'Alene often distracts you from the fact that you live in one of the most beautiful places on earth.</p>
<p>You've got lakes, you've got mountains, you've got forests, you've got airports, you've got scumbags, you've got highways, and you've got my parents.</p>
<p>All wrapped up in a nifty-little town that is oh-so close to being in Washington.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Hey, <span style="color: #42a1ff">mom!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">You haven't called since you left. I've been worried sick! How are you? Are you okay? Is college going well?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's all fine! Where's <span style="color: lime">dad?</span> I want to see him.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">He's upstairs, emptying you-know-what from a b-o-t-t-l-e…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Is he awake?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Who knows? But, come on. We need to catch up.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Tell me already! How's college? Got a cute girlfriend yet?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's fine, it's fine. Actually - I do.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Really? What's her name?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Danny.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Danny… Ain't that a boys name?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>She's definitely more of a tomboy.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">You know what? Doesn't even matter! My boy has a girlfriend! Oh, I can just imagine it. In a few years, I'll have grandkids!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>In a few years?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Whenever you're done with college and have a house! When do I get to meet her?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'll talk with her, yeah. I don't know. She was busy this week, so she couldn't go.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">We'll have to meet up one day. I just can't wait to get to see her!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Is that</span> Mr. Henry Murders <span style="color: lime">I hear in my living room?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Dad!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Come here,</span> son!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">There you are…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">I was taking a nap.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Do you drink in your sleep?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">You can't blame me for what I do in my sleep! It's like sleepwalking…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Actually, <span style="color: lime">Dad,</span> one of the first things I wanted to do was get a genuine, Coeur d'Alene milkshake. It's been forever since I've had one.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Since when are Coeur d'Alene milkshakes anything special?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Since they're the milkshakes I remember growing up with!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">If you're up for more driving. Do you want to just bring me, or do you want your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">mother?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I-</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">-I'd probably prefer to stay here and start mac 'n cheese. But, I do expect a cookie milkshake to be brought back here.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Yes, Ma'am.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I also wanted to tell you something. About my new girlfriend…</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>If I'm being honest, the best type of wine is a $5, highly-suspicious bottle of wine that you bought at the grocery store and forgot in your cupboard for a week. I blame, or rather thank, my <span style="color: #42a1ff">mother</span> for this. She used to cook with it all the time. Left opened bottles after, which I eventually snuck drinks of.</p>
<p>But, she quit using them right before I started high school. I don't know why. I do know she never really drank, unlike my <span style="color: lime">father</span>, who loved <span style="color: yellow">red wine.</span> </p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Dad?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">… Huh? Yeah, no. I heard you. It's just- something I need to take in.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Look-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">So… you don't have a girlfriend?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I have a boyfriend. I think you know him.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Who?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Davey.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">Davey…</span> <span style="color: lime">Yeah. I think I do. He was a good boy. Rich parents, too. Going to always be happy if my</span> son <span style="color: lime">marries rich.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Another thing-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Yeah?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I'm not really your</span> <span style="color: cyan">son.</span> <span style="color: violet">I don't think I'm a</span> <span style="color: pink">woman.</span> <span style="color: violet">I don't really know</span> <span style="color: yellow">w</span><span style="color: white">h</span><span style="color: violet">a</span><span style="color: grey">t</span> <span style="color: yellow">i</span><span style="color: white">t</span> <span style="color: violet">i</span><span style="color: grey">s</span> <span style="color: yellow">I</span> <span style="color: white">a</span><span style="color: violet">m</span><span style="color: grey">.</span> <span style="color: violet">I just hate how I look. I don't want to be anything - or look like anything. I just- I don't know! I don't know what I'm doing - what I've been doing lately. I don't know if it's something that's real, or- … I don't know.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">It's okay, it's okay. I don't really get what you're saying. But, it's okay. You'll figure it out, you'll figure it out.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">You don't care?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Not as much as your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">mother</span> <span style="color: lime">will, but-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Look- you're a smart…</span> <span style="color: yellow">k</span><span style="color: white">i</span><span style="color: violet">d</span><span style="color: grey">.</span> <span style="color: lime">You'll figure out what's best for you. I know you'll be okay… What can I call you for now?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Randy.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Randy?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">That's the name I'm rolling with. At least for a bit.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Randy.</span> <span style="color: lime">I like that. It's a much better name than</span> Henry, <span style="color: lime">for sure. I want you to know that I don't mind whatever you do. I don't have any high ground to stand on. I'm already cursed to an eternity of hell.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Dad-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">The smoking, the drinking, the gambling, giving my kids wine… Cheating on your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">Mother.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">I do love your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">Mother.</span> <span style="color: lime">I love her a lot. I don't know why I tempted a good thing. The thing keeping a family alive on dirt pay, living on someone else's farm, and barely getting food to the table. There are a lot of things I could've done to give you a better childhood. Doing this - It's the best thing I can do for you now.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">So… You're fine with me and</span> <span style="color: turquoise">Davey?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">I will be fine with it,</span> <span style="color: violet">Randy.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Thank you.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">I don't care about grandkids as much as your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">Mother</span> <span style="color: lime">does. I think I already accepted a decade ago that I'm not living to see grandkids.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I'm sorry.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Are you planning on telling your</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">mother?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I don't know. Honestly, I was worried that you'd tell her.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">This would be hardly the worst thing I lied to her about.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I'm planning to tell her. But- the problem is, I don't know if I have the heart to tell her. Rather than letting her live thinking she'll have grandkids. At least for a few years.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: lime">Trust me, you've got a few decades left before she kicks it.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">I know she'll find out eventually. I just need to figure out when's the best time for her to.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>3 days left. After that, it's time for a taste.</p>
<p>Bottles are ready.</p>
<p>Mouth is watering.</p>
<p>72 hours until this all should be over…</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Henry! <span style="color: #42a1ff">You guys took so long. Dinner's almost ready!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Can't wait.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">I'm going to have your</span> <span style="color: lime">Dad</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">make some of his world-famous tomatoes.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'll set the table.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Aww, thanks! More than you ever did when you were growing up here - college must be doing good for you.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Mom-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Hang on, I gotta make sure the mac isn't burning.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah, you should do that…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">All ready for dinner?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Yeah.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Alright. Now I just have to find out where your</span> <span style="color: lime">father</span> <span style="color: #42a1ff">went off to…</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Hang on-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Yes?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Mom, I-</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Yes?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Think we forgot your milkshake in the car.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #42a1ff">Well, it's reasonably cold out. Shouldn't be that melted!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I'll go get it, really quick.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>It's funny. How long it takes for time to pass. Whenever you're having the best days of your life, they seem to just slip on by. Nothing notable. Just you slipping on through life.</p>
<p>But then, whenever something big happens, time starts to get really slow. Whenever you're expecting something, your days double in length. They just get so unbearably long and it's a chore to get by them. And it just lets you think a lot about what's at the end of it. Get really excited for the good things that are coming of it, or really worried for any bad things that could happen.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><span style="color: violet">It's a long drive home.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">A long, long drive.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Through rivers, over mountains.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Across 3 states.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">All to get back home.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I need to do something.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Something nice.</span><br/>
<span style="color: turquoise">He</span> <span style="color: violet">deserves it.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I could take him skiing?</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I could take him on a hike?</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Or, I could buy him his favorite movie and favorite wine.</span><br/>
<span style="color: yellow">Red wine's</span> <span style="color: violet">on clearance. But, I actually don't know if I'll buy it.</span><br/>
<span style="color: turquoise">He</span> <span style="color: violet">has <em>more</em> than</span> <span style="color: yellow">enough at home.</span></p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>It's the day. It's time to bottle it. My original blackberry, now blueberry wine. If this is good, it'll be something to cry to the hills about. And, I think I'm confident that it's good. I haven't bottled it yet. First, I want to get myself a glass. The fruits of my labor and whatever or whatnot.</p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>Huh, that's strange. The trash is full.</p>
<p>Full of <span style="color: yellow">red wine bottles.</span></p>
<p>Jesus, <span style="color: turquoise">he</span> must've had a party.</p>
<p>At least, looks like it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Did <span style="color: turquoise">he</span> go out to buy more? There's a wrapped bottle on the counter?</p>
<p>That doesn't even matter. All that matters is that <span style="color: violet">you</span> find him.</p>
<p><span style="color: violet">You</span> have to say hi to your <span style="color: turquoise">boyfriend!</span></p>
<p>Admittedly, not the welcome back <span style="color: violet">you</span> expected, is it?</p>
<p>Eh, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Set that copy of <em>The Thing</em> down on the couch.</p>
<p>Maybe check <span style="color: turquoise">his</span> room?</p>
<p>It's either there, or <span style="color: turquoise">he's</span> somewhere else.</p>
<p><span style="color: turquoise">His</span> door's open.</p>
<p>That means <span style="color: turquoise">he's</span> probably not home, then.</p>
<p>Better go check, however.</p>
<p>If <span style="color: turquoise">he</span> is here, <span style="color: turquoise">he's</span> most certainly drunk or hungover.</p>

<p><span style="color: turquoise">…</span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Wake up!</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: turquoise">… Yeah?</span> Henry… <span style="color: turquoise">Is that you?</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span style="color: violet">Yeah. I'll be in the living room. Can you do me a favor? Make sure whoever that other person in the bed with you got all of their things.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Finally got to taste the wine after all of these months. Days spent waiting to see it, months spent brewing it, hundreds of dollars spent on it, a change in my whole idea surrounding it. All of this effort, all for about two or three bottles. I finally got to taste it today - see if the last few months were worth it!</p>
<p>And the wine was too sour.</p>

<p><span style="color: turquoise">No! They were just some- look, I asked them to buy me wine! They said yes! They delivered it to my house and I offered them a few drinks and that's pretty much what I remember! I might've even thought it was you!</span></p>

<p>It's the funniest thing. When you read about <span style="color: turquoise">people you used to know.</span> You always, well, usually. You usually have a few minutes where you don't exactly remember who they are or why they're familiar. So you spend that time trying to remember, reliving old memories and whatnot. Until, finally, it clicks! You get who they are and have a little laugh.</p>
<p>This was one of those exceptions that makes it "usually".</p>
<p>He's living a very good life! He made his own business, a very profitable one. He's getting into politics. Overall, I found myself happy for him!</p>
<p>The last time I ever spoke to him, I remember him making me a promise. One I worried for decades would become true. Then, it came. Right in front of my eyes as I was watching the news.</p>
<p>And I felt nothing.</p>

<p>On 15/SEP/2017, a note was recovered at a hiking trail near Blackwater, Oregon, United States. The note appears similar in style to previous documents connected to SCP-8450. Currently, it is pending analysis for potential clues as to the whereabouts of "Randy Murders".</p>

<h2 id="toc3"><span>How to make vinegar.</span></h2>
<hr/></div>
<p>A few months ago, I thought I would be able to make wine. I at first tried blackberry wine, but realized that it wasn't the type for me. Then, I tried to make blueberry wine. Now, it was most certainly a type of wine I would have loved. However, the batch went sour. It didn't work out. Ultimately, I thought it was a failure. And it killed my winemaking aspirations, at least for a while. I'm not too sure if I will try to make wine again.</p>
<p>But, what I did make, is vinegar. A sour, repulsive, beautiful batch of blueberry vinegar that I catch myself using quite frequently. There was this film on top - the "mother of vinegar", as it's called. Apparently, I can put that in other wine and it will transform into vinegar after a few weeks. It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.</p>
<p>I didn't really think I would walk away from this with anything. Anything useful, that is. I thought I'd just walk away with no experience, a bunch of dirty containers, and all of my sugar wasted on something ugly. But, I persisted through it, stumbling upon something great.</p>

<p><span style="color: violet">Here we are…</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Where it all started!</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I remember driving out here.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">After <em>that night.</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">It was a perfect night.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">A perfect, feel-good, all-and-entirely beautiful sorta night.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">The clouds were nowhere to be seen.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">The moon was full.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">The stars shined especially bright that night.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I hiked there, and laid there.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">And I stared into the infinite abyss that is the beauty of our night sky.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I remember it being a sleepless night.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">One where I had to force myself to blink.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">And I thought only about <em>our special night.</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">The best night of my life.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Reflected upon on the worst night of my life.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet"><em>Our special night…</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">I think about it a lot.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet"><em>Our special night…</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Especially recently.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">So, congrats!</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">On our anniversary.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">About 10 months off…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">Anyways-</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I'm really happy for you.</span><br/>

<span style="color: violet">Whoever you're with.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">I would really like to say that I hate you.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Being able to would mean the world to me.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">But-</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">You know, it's funny.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">I think I might have finally saved up enough to finish college.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Go back in my 40's, finally get that degree and start living life.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Guess I didn't need you after all, huh?</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">But, it's too late.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">Besides, I'm happy with what happened.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">If I could change it, I would in a heartbeat.</span><br/>
<span style="color: violet">But, I like it. I like who I am. I like who I am able to be. I like the life I am living.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: violet">I'm happy being Randy Murders.</span><br/>
