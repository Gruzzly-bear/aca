<p><strong>Report from Captain James E. Hawthorne</strong> — 1899-02-09</p>
<p>To-day is a momentous occasion for our great nation. My vessel, the USS <em>Columbus</em>, has laid on eyes on what is most certainly a yet-uncharted landmass. Its coordinates are approximately forty-seven degrees of arc and nine minutes of arc south, and one-hundred-and-twenty-six degrees of arc and forty-three minutes of arc west. The isle appears to be uncontacted by the civilized world. I have already ordered my men to make landfall, so that we may claim this land for the great American nation.</p>
<p>I gaze upon the shores of this virgin land, and I am filled with awe at its lush forests and singing birds. The promise of great wealth and opportunity provided by the isle before me fills me with anticipation for the future it holds for America. It is crucial that my officers act at once, for if this land is indeed as untouched as it seems, there is no telling what riches may lie within its boundaries.</p>
<p>With the strength of the great American spirit behind us, I have no doubt that we shall succeed in this noble endeavor. The stars and stripes shall wave proudly upon these sands.</p>

Below the waves, a terror deep<br/>
The Old One's wake will make it so.</p>

<p><strong>Notes on the Red Men</strong> — 1900-01-09</p>
<p>Following several expeditions to the island, we have uncovered a truth— this land is not uninhabited as we once understood. No, it indeed is home to a race of redskins, who have evidently made their residence here on the island.</p>
<p>These men are not unlike the Indians of the American continent, though they are much less savage in demeanor. They have little more than primitive tools, and they go about without any clothing. We were told not to engage in combat with the red men, as they lacked weapons save for crude spears and fishing poles. They only grow sweet potatoes and yams, and otherwise subsist on fish and wild fruits.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of our captain that we be granted permission to establish a permanent settlement here on this island, for the purpose of bringing it under American control. Further, we believe that under the care of a more civilized people, the red men will learn their place in society and among the creations of God.</p>

<p><strong>Notes on First Attempts at Contact</strong> — 1902-02-07</p>
<p>It is evident that this island is rich in natural resources such as gold and red corals. At first we attempted to trade with the islanders, offering great sums of money in exchange for their riches. However, we soon realized that this primitive group of people had no comprehension of our advanced economy; as a result, we gathered shells from the shoreline, as we observed the islanders using such as a form of primitive currency. To our seashell offerings, they expressed confusion. This can likely be ascribed to this people's lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>Despite our attempts at friendly contact, the islanders appeared to be intimidated by our firearms and gunboats. Though they maintain apprehension towards us, this relationship has the potential to be greatly beneficial for both parties. The simple islanders could benefit from a Western education, and in turn we would turn lucrative profits from Hawthorne Island's natural resources.</p>
<p>I believe it is necessary to begin the process of civilizing at once.</p>

<p><strong>Memorandum from Father Gregory at the Hawthorne Mission</strong> — 1904-08-14</p>
<p>The work at the newly constructed American mission is certainly rewarding, though it poses something of a challenge. Since our arrival here at Hawthorne Island, our men have worked tirelessly to convert the indigenous people, whom we call the "locals", to the sublime religion of Christianity. I personally have observed their customs, and though they harbor no malicious intent, they appear to be deeply superstitious, praying to the island itself as a deity. I fear the locals shall not know salvation until they embrace the word of God.</p>
<p>In related happenings, we have begun to build a schoolhouse for the locals. It is indeed a delicate task, as the adults especially seem to be averse to a civilized education. They are content with their pagan traditions, passing down superstitions to their children. Yet I believe it is in their best interest to be taught to speak, read, and write in English.</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt by Governor Jefferson Hayes</strong> — 1905-03-21</p>
<p>Though our progress on the island has been remarkable, it has not been without difficulties. The tribal elders continue to resist our teachings, preferring to remain with their barbaric ways. Though they do not comprehend the concept of currency, we have managed to broker a trade agreement with the locals, where they shall be provided with fine American goods such as alcohol and firearms, in exchange for their riches.</p>
<p>I have given orders for the clearing of the northern shore of the island in preparation for construction of a more permanent settlement. We encouraged the local chieftains to sign a treaty entitling us to the forested mountains, which are said to be rich with gold. I believe of grave importance, however, is the locals who choose to stand in the way of progress. Our determination shall not falter.</p>

<p><strong>Further Notes on Hawthorne Island</strong> — 1906-05-11</p>
<p>It is with great anguish that I compose this note. This pristine island that once seemed to harbor naught but great potential, is now taking its toll on our good men. They are, quite simply, suffering. The locals have turned far more savage than in previous years; the firearms we generously sold them are now being used against us. They grow more unruly by the day, refusing our trade offers and making absurd claims that we have violated their treaties. Countless raids on our settlements and missions have significantly hampered our ability to civilize the locals, or to settle this island further.</p>
<p>This is not the land I once knew.</p>
<p>We shall not yield in the face of darkness. The untold potential for resources and the significance of this island to American interests cannot be understated. As such, it is with a heavy heart that we have commissioned the construction of a fort, so that we may sleep somewhat easier.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE I.</p>
<p>The fortification shall be known as "Fort Davidson," in honor of Captain John Davidson, who established the Hawthorne Mission. The fort is to be constructed at the highest point of elevation on the island in order to maintain a strategic advantage over potential threats.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE II.</p>
<p>The purpose of Fort Davidson shall be to maintain American sovereignty on Hawthorne Island, and to serve as a base of operations for the settlement of the island. The fortress shall be the military and administrative headquarters of the Hawthorne settlement, in order to safeguard the men and women that reside within its walls, and to provide the local population with an education in line with American ideals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE III.</p>
<p>Fort Davidson will oversee the extraction of gold, coral, and other valuable minerals from Hawthorne Island. These resources will be shipped back to the mainland United States for refinement and distribution. Locals may be employed for unpaid labor at the Governor's behest. Conflicts are to be reported to the Bureau of Native Affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE IV.</p>
<p>Financing for Fort Davidson is to be provided by Terblanche Enterprises. As part of the cooperation between the United States and Terblanche Enterprises, the latter is to be provided with the sole rights to import and export goods from Hawthorne Island. Other foreign companies shall require permission of the Governor to conduct business on the island.</p>

<p><strong>Letter to the Department of State</strong> — 1908-01-14</p>
<p>Ever since the completion of Fort Davidson, tensions between ourselves and the locals have escalated dramatically. It is evident that our mission of civilization is being resisted with increasing levels of hostility. The locals refuse to accept the American way of life, and are abandoning their stations in the gold mines and coral reefs. Many more have perished to plague. Yet we have a much more pressing issue on our hands.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, the island has been plagued by violent tremors. The once serene ocean now crashes against our shores, and batters our ships. Our coastal settlements are being flooded with tidal waters; as if the land itself is sinking into the sea. The watchtower is now unusable, as its foundations have been inundated with seawater. It is as if the locals know of something that we do not.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is clear that the locals must be corralled in order to abate this. The establishment of a system of forced labor is the only feasible path forward. Education camps and labor reserves are to be established; to this end, we seek additional funding. The wealth of Hawthorne Island is simply too great to be cast aside.</p>

<p><strong>Correspondence with Nathan Terblanche</strong> — 1908-02-12</p>
<p>To the most esteemed Executive Mr. Nathan Terblanche,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you in good health. I, the United States Secretary of State, write with great urgency on the topic of the Hawthorne Island program. While the indigenous population continues to resist progress, often through violent means, that is not the full scope of the issues we face. Reports are clear that Hawthorne Island itself is sinking into the ocean. The coastline has been vanishing slowly but surely over the past several months, and it seems only a matter of time before the whole island follows suit.</p>
<p>The situation here has grown truly dire. The United States is requesting additional funds, supplies, and resources to continue the settlement program. In exchange, you will maintain your monopoly over the island's natural resources.</p>
<p>Additionally, while I am loath to admit it, there are paranormal forces beyond our understanding at work at this time. We request consultation with experts who may have a better understanding of the strange occurences here.</p>

<p><strong>Field Notes from Area 5 HMCL Supervisor</strong> — 1910-05-22</p>
<p>As part of our administrative duties regarding Area 5, we were overseeing the locals laboring in one of the surviving coral farms, this one located not in a reef but in a cave near the center of the island. As many of our reefs have yet vanished below the waves, we required more intensive labor of the locals. While it seemed to be a routine collection of the most vibrant specimens to be exported by the South Africans, it appears that fate had other plans.</p>
<p>While I was not there in person to record the exact instance, one of our Level 3 operators returned to headquarters in a panic. He rambled of a strange occurance from beneath the coral bed. He described a deep, pitch-black cavern, through which he said was an entrance to another world. But it was not the cavern that terrified him; it was what lay within. A colossal, pagan sea god, he said; a Satanic abomination that the locals worship. The very thought of it disturbs me; while I dismissed his claims as the drivel of a madman, I too shall sleep with one eye open tonight.</p>

<p>Due to the gracious funding provided by GoI-002, our research team has been able to conduct further investigation into the underlying cause of SCP-8776. To this end, we have begun integrating the locals into our Disposable-class program. We organized a team of D-class to conduct an expedition into the cavern beneath the coral bed.</p>
<p>The team discovered what could only be described as a colossal, bizzare cavern deep below the island; an unnatural realm of darkness defying all comprehension. Its construction seemed not limited to our Euclidean geometry, with the cavernous expanse resembling an ancient, extraterrestrial city. The cave was lit only by the faint, phosphorescent glow of the stones themselves.</p>
<p>But what was within— even the thought of it makes me shudder. A colossal, aquatic being, two-thousand feet in height. Though it could not be seen, its very presence filled the hearts of men with dread. The D-class themselves seemed unaffected; though simply the relaying of the story has caused myself many sleepless nights. Whatever this entity is, it is intrinsically connected with the indigenous population of Hawthorne Island.</p>
<p>I am recommending an immediate escalation of containment protocols. Not only must we do all in our power to prevent these savages from summoning their god to exact its wrath on us; we too must see to it that the locals themselves are kept accordingly in line.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Containment Details</strong> — 1912-01-21</p>
<p>A 10-km perimeter is to be maintained around Area-05.</p>
<p>Area-05 is to have interior flood barriers erected around the shoreline of Hawthorne Island to prevent flooding or erosion. These barriers are to be inspected monthly for damage or strain. All facilities on Area-05 are to be constructed at high elevations to minimize risk of flooding.</p>
<p>Containment procedures for SCP-8776 are designed to prevent it from awakening. A specialized array of electromagnetic pulse generators is deployed on the island as an interference field that disrupts any form of cognition within the immediate vicinity of SCP-8776. In addition, a network of psionic inhibitors is integrated into Area-05 to cause a soporific effect on the entity and nullifying potential seismic influences that may cause it to awaken.</p>
<p>The primary containment chamber for SCP-8776 has been constructed 1,500 meters below the surface of Hawthorne Island, insulated with concrete and filled with a concentration of brine. It has been fitted with high-voltage capacitors that absorb electrical impulses, and the chamber itself is additionally reinforced to brace against seismic motions.</p>

<p><strong>Notes on SCP-8776-A</strong> — 1913-06-05</p>
<p>It is clear to me now that we made a grave error in thinking we could civilize these barbarians. After all we've provided for SCP-8776-A, including immunization of their entire population and a free Western education, they continue to reject us, choosing instead to turn to their ways of devil-worshipping. Armed rebellions of SCP-8776-A must be crushed, and made to comply with Foundation standards. While having SCP-8776-A instances serve as D-class is still acceptable, they must be terminated at the end of the month.</p>

<p><strong>Personnel Report</strong> — 1913-09-08</p>
<p>Ever since we outfitted the primary containment chamber with psionic inhibitors, our men have been deeply unsettled by the island. Reports have been received of hallucinatory symptoms ailing their mental state. The effects of this mental distress grow more widespread by the day and have significantly hampered our ability to continue research into SCP-8776. Those who venture into the island and stray too far from the settlement often return with vivid hallucinations and chronic nightmares— if they return at all.</p>
<p>This is no doubt a cognitohazardous symptom of exposure to SCP-8776. Recommending increase in the use of psionic inhibitors, as well as the potential use of <a href="/scp-148">SCP-148</a> to line the walls of the containment chamber.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8776-A Neutralization Report</strong> — 1914-07-19</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure I report that yet another rebellion of SCP-8776-A has been quelled. The confrontation was swift, for they were greatly outmatched by our highly trained forces. The cries of the fallen instances echoed throughout the valley in which they were shot dead. After our victory over their forces, we made an example of their leaders, swiftly executing them in the town square, their bodies left to hang in the center of the camp. The males were taken as D-class, while the females and juveniles were sent to Outpost C for re-education. The hearth around which they once gathered is now a blazing fire in the forest, a testament to the victory of civilization, and the restoration of peace.</p>

<p><strong>Personnel Report</strong> — 1914-07-19</p>
<p>The hallucinations experienced by our personnel are growing worse, with many reporting feelings of cosmic insignificance and visions of a massive, squid-like entity in their dreams. One researcher wrote the following in their journal:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Last night, I saw things that I will never unsee.</p>
<p>I was in a deep, dark cavern, miles below the earth — although that place was not Hell, as lucky I would have been compared to what came to me…</p>
<p>There was not a sound but that of my own footsteps beneath me. The chamber was lit only by a torch which I carried, and I knew nothing but to walk forward a path of vile, alien disease that punched me to my stomach, revealing I was not alone at the edge of the universe.</p>
<p>Before me stood a creature with the size and stature of a mountain, a tower of madness that knew no limits and spit on God's face. From what little light there was, I could make out vague features: corals grew from its back, barnacles covered its face, tentacles dangled from its chin, and massive, bat-shaped wings were folded behind it. Though I was but a tiny ant in the face of this leviathan, it stared back down upon me with the the indifferent cruelty of one about to pulverize an anthill.</p>
<p>I could do nothing but watch as the colossal force laid waste to my homeland, to my family and those I love. Their screams rang out through the pitch-black night as the wretched stench of burning flesh filled my nostrils; a thousand voices cried out in horror, but were put to an end in a mere instant by the behemoth which I had awakened — then the silence came, and it had never been more rowdy.</p>
<p>I pray to God that He punishes the souls of those who embrace such monstrosity.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Personnel Requirements</strong> — 1914-10-11</p>
<p>All personnel assigned to containment of SCP-8776 must undergo heavy psychological testing, and score a Cognitive Resistance Value of 36 or higher. Once assigned personnel have completed one week of tenure at Area-05, they are to be transferred immediately and provided with psychological counselling. Personnel may not be transferred back to Area-05 until one year has passed and following voluntary amnestic treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Area-05 Director's Report</strong> — 1915-06-20</p>
<p>Area-05 is getting less stable by the day. Our difficulties are now twofold: not only is the island rapidly sinking, but personnel stationed are undergoing severe psychological stress, even with the weekly rotations. I need not restate the effects of the sleeping giant on our men; though these have been steadily worsening with time and proximity to the containment chamber. I myself have begun to be plagued by nightmares, and I now deeply regret the suffering I have caused to my own good men.</p>
<p>The erosion of the island shows no signs of slowing down either; quite the opposite, in fact. When the island was first charted in 1901, its estimated size was approximately 1,470 km<sup>2</sup>. Our current measurements, not a decade and a half out from that time, place its surface area at 670 km<sup>2</sup>, with more of the shoreline being lost every day, even with the flood barriers. Of these barriers, numerous have already succumbed to the waves, and repairs seem unfeasible.</p>
<p>I do not believe containment will be sustainable for long.</p>

<p><strong>Area-05, Final Report</strong> — 1917-01-27</p>
<p>The situation here has become futile. Hawthorne Island's descent into the Pacific has accelerated beyond our capability to prevent it. The flood barriers are now practically useless, and the water level continues to rise and collapse our infrastructure. Our headquarters, once stationed on the highest peak, is now hardly a short walk from the seaside. Even with the best technology that we can afford from GoI-002, the island is succumbing to SCP-8776. I am advising that we abandon this project.</p>

<p><strong>Recovered Note from D-1293</strong> — 1917-02-28</p>
<p>I was a child when the white men came. They came on great, glistening warships made of steel, and they planted flags on our soil. They said they were explorers, come to discover new lands for their land.</p>
<p>They eyed our women and our pristine reefs; traded us strange weapons in exchange for our services, built fortresses on our sacred lands; and sent us to places they built to teach us the path to salvation.</p>
<p>It was an exchange, they said: for our wealth of natural resources, for our men in labor, for our women in marriage. In return, we would be 'human'; a part of the United States of America, the empire of freedom everlasting.</p>
<p>So we prayed, prayed to the Great Old One, our protector. An ancient creature that would defend us from those who took us as slaves and destroyed our way of life. And we fought. Gave the white man the hell he deserves. Even when the letters of our names were replaced by numbers, we swore we would continue to fight until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>But we were wrong — because there is nothing left now, and we still continue to fight. And we always will. May our existence be the very memory they will not erase.</p>

<p><strong>Document 8776.1</strong> — 1918-01-28</p>
<p>The following file is a correspondence from Nathan Terblanche, CEO of GoI-002, addressed to the Administrator, dated 1918-01-28:</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
<p>To my dearest Fritz,</p>
<p>As much as I've been busy lately, I would like to spare my free time to apologize for the loss of Hawthorne Island. I will see to it that your organization is reimbursed for your efforts to contain the Great Old One. But as you know, the old gods cannot be kept asleep forever. Regardless, our efforts are not over; humanity will prevail in the face of this darkness. I will see to it that any available funds are directed to your Foundation, so long as you continue to consider the interests of Terblanche Enterprises.</p>
<p>Indeed, the company has been making an amazing progress in these past several years. As you may know, our relationship with our partner Belgium was never the same after the death of my acquaintance, the good King Leopold. But you Americans have fitted like a glove, and what we've accomplished together back in Hawthorne has attracted the local attention of the highest members of the growing National Party, and some foreign eyes as well. Though the end result was unsatisfactory, the strength of what we can accomplish together cannot be understated.</p>
<p>I would like for you to consider strengthening our partnership. I am willing to fund as much researches of you Yankees as necessary as long as I receive a part of the gold to expand my collection — and speaking of which, if you give this offer of mine a chance and come to Cape Town, do so on March 20th. I am going to conduct a special exhibition of advanced thaumaturgic practices to a few admirers of my work, from handheld transcievers to static electricity. Feel free to invite any acquintance of yours, regardless of their liking, and send me a response as soon as you can.</p>
<p>The next decade will be ours, Fritz — and dare I say the century as well. God bless you and I,</p>
