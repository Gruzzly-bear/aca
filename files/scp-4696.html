<p><strong>Item#</strong>: SCP-4696</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Safe</p>
<p><strong>Secure Containment Procedures</strong>: SCP-4696 must be locked in a Secure Storage Vault when not being tested. Testing must be approved by Head Researcher Eddlestone and take place under the supervision of at least one member of Security Staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-4696 is a stuffed animal resembling a large, oddly shaped gorilla, currently 73cm in height and weighing 3kg. Internal inspection reveals it to be composed of a variety of stuffing materials, typical to stuffed plush toys. Signs of aging, tearing, and distended bulging caused by overstuffing are visible on SCP-4696's exterior. No identifying tags or labels of manufacture have been found on SCP-4696.</p>
<p>Anomalous behavior manifests when placed within a 1-meter radius of other stuffed animals. When this requirement is met, both SCP-4696 and the stuffed animals in its vicinity, now designated SCP-4696-1, will begin showing signs of sentience and awareness.</p>
<p>SCP-4696 will invariably attempt to destroy SCP-4696-1 instances and, if successful, will then proceed to remove the stuffing from its victims before adding it to its own mass. Neither SCP-4696 or SCP-4696-1 are capable of vocalization, however, SCP-4696-1 instances can be seen to be extremely fearful of SCP-4696.</p>
<p>SCP-4696 was discovered after a video uploaded to the YouTube account "Jamies Animal Tournament"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> was flagged by online searches.</p>

<p>POI-4696-1, formally known as 10-year-old Jamie Miller, was SCP-4696's former owner and creator of the "Jamies Animal Tournament" Youtube account. Numerous interviews have cleared them of any anomalous abilities with POI-4696-1 insisting to have found SCP-4696 on the street outside their school. The Miller Family has been placed under constant surveillance to monitor for potential future anomalous activity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The following is a transcript from POI-4696-1's first video featuring SCP-4696.</span></p>

<p><em>Muffled sounds of a female voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Okay! Hey, guys! Welcome back to my— to my channel! Thanks for eighteen subscribers and for your comments on my last video of Tiger X vs Killoala!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 walks off camera for 4 seconds</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "So today I have a big surprise, I have found a new warrior!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 places SCP-4696 in view of the camera, SCP-4696 looks pristine condition apart from small tear near its mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "This is Gronk! Coming from the wild jungles of Africa, his strongness is unmatched and is ready to fight to the death here in Jamie's Animal Tournament!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 makes crowd noises</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "I guess this video is just to introduce him and also to make an announcement. Since the newest tournament barely began yet, I've decided to begin— to restart it again so that Gronk can take part. So yeah!"</p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "I'm gonna end the video now but I will record a battle right after dinner and upload it tomorrow! See you guys next time! Rooooar!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 performs a roar as their video outro. SCP-4696 appears to tilt slightly.</em></p>

<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Hey, guys. I just wanna say thanks for 20 subscribers. I'm really happy for your support and also 'Beepbeep55' asked me a question 'What animal do you think your teacher would be?'… I think… she would be a —</p>

<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Anyway, let's begin the fight. Ladies and Gentleman today's battle will be between the newbie, Gronk… Versus the mighty Rhinor! Gronk is gonna have a tough time because Rhinor almost made it to the finals last tourma—tournament!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 emulates crowd noises.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Now let's get ready to battle! Three. .. Two… One… Fight!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 proceeds to use his hands to simulate a fantastical fight between the two stuffed animals, featuring acrobatic flips and attacks, with occasional commentary added</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Data removed for brevity.</p>
<p><em>At the 2:33 mark, A punch "landed" by SCP-4696-1 visibly tears the rhinoceros' arm off</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Woah, what?! That's never happened before! hahaha"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 moves SCP-4696 toward the rhinoceros giddily making it "eat" the stuffing, emulating chewing sounds and stuffing a small amount into the existing tear near its mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Oh my gosh! Gronk is eating all the guts out of Rhynor's arm! Nobody can stop this monster!"</p>
<p><em>POI-4696-1 proceeds to "pin" the rhinoceros in a manner similar to popular wrestling shows.</em></p>

<p><strong>POI-4696-1 as "Tiger X"</strong>: "I have heard many things about you Gronk. But today you will not win!"</p>

<p><em>Close examination reveals the stuffed tiger attempting to move out of the way as POI-4696 flips SCP-4696 in the air crashes down on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Booooom!"</p>
<p><em>Cotton stuffing bursts from the seams of the stuffed tiger, causing POI-4696-1 to let go.</em></p>

<p><em>Close inspection reveals cotton stuffing seemingly being drawn into SCP-4696 before POI-4696-1 picks up the camera and moves it over the scene, the tiger's fabric is torn and in tatters.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-4696-1</strong>: "Woah… He totally exploded Tiger X… I guess that makes Gronk the winner but… Tiger X was my favorite animal. So that kinda sucks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>POI-4696-1 claims that after filming this video, they removed SCP-4696 from their residence and disposed of it near a dumpster by the local shopping mall. At this point, no records exist that track SCP-4696's movements in the 2 months between the last video and the date of containment.</p>

<p><em>Incident-4696-A</em>: SCP-4696 was contained after a Facebook livestream showed it attacking a stuffed bear at a carnival. A containment team was ordered to head to the location, arriving to find SCP-4696 inert, next to a neutralized SCP-4696-1 instance. The livestream was scrubbed and cover stories were disseminated of it being a viral marketing stunt for a new toy line. Witnesses were interviewed and amnestized to further cloud the veracity of the incident.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The following is an audio transcript of Agent Lannister (AL) interrogating the teen, named Terrance Welding (TW), who livestreamed the incident regarding SCP-4696</em>:</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Okay, so. Let's go over this again, you were with your girlfriend and-"</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "She's not my girlfriend… Look it's complicated."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Yeah, okay sure, kid. Look, just go over what you saw again."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: (Sighs) "So like, I've got the camera on Sasha, right? We just got off the big wheel and I decide… Hey, I'm gonna go ahead and win her a stuffed animal. One of those big ones, right?"</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Yeah, of course, girls love those."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "Exactly! So like, we're walking toward the booth where you throw those rings over the soda bottles."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "It's called a hoop toss."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "Right, the hoop toss, that's when we hear this little girl scream."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "What did you see?"</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "We walk over and see one of those big teddy bears like— flailing on the ground. The dude in the booth is just like, standing there with his mouth open."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "What happened then?"</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "I mean, at first I'm like, bruh… Then I'm thinking, there's probably a dude in there, I think I saw some shit like that on YouTube."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Language."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "My bad. Anyway, as I'm thinking this, the big bear stands up and like— tries to reach behind its back. It can't reach, though. So, it's like, just twisting round and round until a fucking stuffed gorilla bursts out of its back!"</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Langu— you know what, nevermind."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "So yeah, this gorilla is like tearing at the bear and obviously, there's no dude inside. Its just ripping bundles of wool from the bear and stuffing it into its leg. So I'm like 'No way!', this is some Five Nights at Freddy type of bullshit."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "The what nights of who now?"</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "It's a video game, about these animatronic animals going mad and trying to kill you."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "So at this point, you think they're robots?"</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "Yeah! I mean what else could they be? Anyway, that's when I stopped streaming and soon after that their batteries must've died because they just flopped on the ground."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Right, you're a smart kid. How about you drink your water, it's a crazy story."</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: "Nah, not really thirsty."</p>
<p><strong>AL</strong>: "Drink the water, kid."</p>

<td>SCP-4696 stands up and approaches the doll, now an SCP-4696-1 instance, stirring on the floor. SCP-4696 is seen dragging its left leg, which has been recently lengthened due to stuffing. The doll, facing away from SCP-4696, does not notice it standing nearby. The SCP-4696-1 instance appears to be inspecting its hands and arms before finally noticing SCP-4696's presence. The doll backs up in fear as SCP-4696 slowly closes the distance between them. SCP-4696-1 bumps into the rear wall of the containment chamber, before being picked up by the neck area. SCP-4696 plunges its hand into the doll's abdomen area and pulls out a large ball of stuffing before packing it into the SCP-4696-1's mouth area<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-4696-1 makes distressed movements and flails as it attempts to stop SCP-4696, striking it in the face. SCP-4696 stops and seems to stare at the doll for 10 seconds before punching a hole in the plastic molded face of SCP-4696-1. The doll drops to the ground as it appears to be choking up balls of stuffing, clutching onto its abdomen. SCP-4696 kicks it onto its back before pulling out and cramming stuffing into a hole near its own mouth area. Both SCP-4696 and SCP-4696-1 cease anomalous behavior after 7 minutes.</td>
