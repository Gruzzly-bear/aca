<p>SCP-4570</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A 3.6-meter tall steel fence has been built around SCP-4570. This fence is to be patrolled by Foundation officials under the guise of SCP-4570 being a historic landmark. Personnel are to incapacitate any wildlife near SCP-4570 and relocate them a safe distance away. Individuals attempting to enter SCP-4570 are to be administered Class-A amnestics and released. Existing SCP-4570-A instances are to be monitored for possible containment breaches.</p>
<p>Further investigations into the source of SCP-4570’s anomalous properties are currently ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4570 is the town of Nelson, Nevada, abandoned in 1971. Buildings within SCP-4570 are in a state of severe disrepair, with many having completely collapsed. All organisms that enter SCP-4570 will experience rapid genetic transformations. SCP-4570's effect culminates with the affected <a href="scp-3660.html">subject becoming a plant or animal</a> native to the state of West Virginia. This effect extends to both flora and fauna, with resulting transformations (referred to as SCP-4570-A) having similar genetics and physical traits to the original entity. During these transformations, subjects have expressed extreme distress and discomfort.</p>
<p>Humans that enter SCP-4570 will be subject to SCP-4570’s transformation effect, although no exact pattern has been found between resulting SCP-4570-A instances.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> The only consistent effect between experiments has been reports of faint music before transformations take place, with most likening it to a song in a country genre. Recorded SCP-4570-A instances resulting from humans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>North American porcupines (<em>Erethizon dorsatum</em>)</li>
<li>Willow oaks (<em>Quercus phellos</em>)</li>
<li>American black <a href="scp-6402.html">bears</a> (<em>Ursus americanus</em>)</li>
<li>Turkey vultures (<em>Cathartes aura</em>)</li>
<li>Common snapping turtles (<em>Chelydra serpentina</em>)</li>
<li>Blueberries (<em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-4570-A instances capable of locomotion will enter a building within SCP-4570. Once inside, SCP-4570-A will take on the job of a human working in that building. Despite the physical limitations of many SCP-4570-A, these jobs will be executed at a level <a href="scp-3723.html">equal to that of a human</a>. Once their job is completed, instances will enter other buildings and socialize with other SCP-4570-A. There are currently 129 recorded SCP-4570-A instances, with 47 of the town's buildings being completely occupied. SCP-4570-A have shown notable hostility towards the Foundation, actively destroying remote drones and other monitoring devices.</p>
<p>Several meteorological anomalies are present within SCP-4570, with the measured air pressure of the town being significantly higher than the surrounding area. In addition, several incidents of SCP-4570 experiencing significantly colder weather than the surrounding area have been recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> On 10/12/1997, all activity within SCP-4570 suddenly ceased for approximately 22 hours, including its transformative and meteorological properties. During this 22 hour period, Agent Claudia Amherst was dispatched to investigate. Included below is a transcript of the exploration.</p>

<p><strong>Exploration log - SCP-4570 - 10/12/1997</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/12/97</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> Agent Claudia Amherst</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4570</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Check, check, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Loud and clear. Search the town for any signs of the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Understood. (<em>Pause</em>) Any word on the dash A’s activity? I’d rather not get mauled by a bobcat today.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Negative. Locate them, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> (<em>Sigh</em>) Alright.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst begins to navigate towards the center of SCP-4570.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> There’s a building over here that looks fairly intact. It looks like some sort of store, but the sign on the front is too faded to make out.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst draws her firearm and enters the building. Visible in the building are several store shelves in various states of disrepair. A wooden counter is visible in the background.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Is this coming through clearly Command?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> All clear.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> God, it smells horrible in here. I think it’s this food on the shelves, at least I think it’s food. Most of these are just empty boxes and tin cans.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> I think I’ve found a dash A. There’s a groundhog holding one of the tin cans just sitting on the shelf, looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Has it noticed you?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> (<em>Pause</em>) I don’t think it can notice me. It’s not moving at all, not even breathing. It looks like one of the taxidermy animals my uncle had all around his cabin.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst holsters her weapon before taking a tin can off the nearby shelf and lightly throwing it near the SCP-4570-A instance. The can impacts the shelf the instance is sitting on before falling to the ground. No reaction is observed. Amherst approaches the instance.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Collect the instance for examination.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst places the instance under her arm before walking towards the wooden counter.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Hey Command, do you see this?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Please elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> There’s a tree growing right in front of the cash register. It’s not growing through the floor either, it’s somehow growing on top of the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Noted. Collect a sample from the tree and continue on.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Copy.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst breaks a low hanging branch from the tree and places it in her pack. She then exits the store and continues through SCP-4570.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> There’s a lot of collapsed buildings here. Any word on why it was abandoned?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> It is assumed to be related to the anomaly, although no clear reason for the disappearances has been found.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Looks like there’s another store up ahead. The sign says something about guns, but the rest of it is unreadable. I’m heading in. (<em>Pause</em>) Oh fuck!</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Amherst, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> It (<em>Pause</em>) it looks like the floor of the building collapsed into a basement of sorts. I didn’t see it at first and almost fell straight in.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Are you injured?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> No, I’m fine, just a bit shaken. On a positive note, I’ve found where all of our drones have gone.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst leans into the doorway of the store. In the hole is a large pile of shattered wood covered with various mechanical parts.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Understood. Continue on to the next building.</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst leaves the building and proceeds to a nearby building.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Looks like we’ve got a bar here. It seems to be in better condition than the rest of the town too. The sign on the wall here says “Johnny’s Saloon.”</p>
<p>(<em>Amherst enters the building.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> (<em>Pause</em>) Command, something isn’t right here.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Can you elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> This building looks like it’s been completely untouched. No broken furniture, no shattered bottles, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> There’s even a jukebox against the wall here. A Wurlitzer 1050, like the one back at the Site-17 break room. (<em>Pause</em>) It’s still on?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Repeat?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> The lights on the machine are still on. The glass isn’t even dusty. (<em>Pause</em>) Looks like there’s only one record inside, but I can’t read the label from here.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Are there any markings on the machine?</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Not that I can see. (<em>Pause</em>) Hold on, there’s some writing on the side. “We all deserve to belong. My only hope is to bring you closer to heaven, one lyric at a time.”</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>Amherst:</strong> Request to return to base before I’m turned into a copperhead.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Granted.</p>
