<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Entry point to SCP-9028 (Live Feed).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>CLASS:</strong> Maksur.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Item has been separated into several anomalous parts which must be kept separate.</span></p>
<p><strong>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> Due to continued tourist and pilgrimage activity, SCP-9028 is to remain open to the public, although efforts to improve accessibility to the cave entrance are to be discouraged discreetly by Foundation operatives in the region. The cave will be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel trained to recognize Protocol Mithra and equipped with Class-B amnestics for any necessary abatement.</p>
<p>SCP-9028-2 is to be detained at Site-14 in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">standard</span> humanoid confinement quarters indefinitely with four (4) Scranton reality anchors at each corner of the perimeter. Interrogation requests are to be approved by Site Director Izadi.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> SCP-9028 is an anomalous <em>pir</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Zoroastrian Pilgrimage site, translated from Persian (پیر). For clarity, all Persian and Avestan words have been Romanized unless specified.</span> found within the Shekaft-e Yazdan cave near the village Zarju, Iran.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Population approx. 70. While not one of the six most holy pilgrimage sites of the Yazd region, Zoroastrian legend holds that Shekaft-e Yazdan was used to hide the sacred flame during various Hellenistic and Sassanian conflicts and is still a popular location for worship.</span> Ingress to the cave which houses SCP-9028 provides some challenge due to altitude and entrance formation, while SCP-9028 itself is only accessible to visitors via ritualistic behaviors hereafter referred to as Protocol Mithra.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Visitors to the cave structure who do not correctly execute Protocol Mithra will describe the cave as extraordinarily large, with visible ancient worship sites and traditional Zoroastrian fire altars but no anomalous elements visible or accessible.</span></p>
<p>Successfully executing Protocol Mithra will result in a spatial and/or temporal distortion<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Foundation researchers are divided on the appropriate description of the disruption to reality within SCP-9028. For further reading, see <em>Dokein</em> Sept 2022 edition.</span>, during which the roof of the cave will appear to disappear, opening to a clear, moonless night sky, regardless of the time of day in baseline reality.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Foundation astronomers are unable to identify any celestial objects visible within SCP-9028. Research is ongoing.</span> In addition to the cave roof, the following features of the cave also undergo change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The floor of the cave transforms from bare limestone to a meadow plateau, overseeing a valley that resembles the Eshkeft valley found in baseline reality geographically, but with significantly more flora and fauna visible. Attempts to explore the valley via drone have provided samples of previously undiscovered plant life. Research is ongoing.</li>
<li>The archaeological remnants of the fire altars are replaced with a fully constructed <em>darb-e mehr</em>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Zoroastrian fire temple. Also known as an <em>ātashkade</em> or آتشکده.</span> The building appears to be in excellent condition (although not newly constructed) with a characteristic Sassanian architecture with a centralized domed archway over the primary altar space and four short passageways of approach from each cardinal direction, verified as matching baseline reality after successful completion of Protocol Mithra. As is tradition with most <em>darb-e mehr</em>, the façade has no decoration and heavy curtains on each archway to limit access to the <em>atashgah</em>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Inner-most chamber (<em>trans.</em> 'the place of flame') where the fire altar is constructed and maintained. Traditionally only the temple's high clergy are allowed within the <em>atashgah</em>.</span></li>
<li>Regardless of the number of individuals present for Protocol Mithra, six humanoid entities dressed in traditional white veiled garments<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Garments include the <em>kushti</em> or <em>aiwyaongana</em> around their waist, given to Zoroastrian adherents during their <em>sedreh-pushi</em> ceremony of induction to the faith.</span> will be present at various locations around the <em>darb-e mehr</em>. These humanoids (hereafter designated SCP-9028-1) do not have any identifiable individual characteristics and will typically refuse to speak with or interact with observers as they attend to their presumed temple duties.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-9028-1 instances will not interfere with Foundation efforts to explore SCP-9028's outer environs, provided personnel do not attempt to enter the <em>ātashkade</em>. In the event that a person attempts to directly enter the <em>ātashkade</em> when an SCP-9028-1 instance is nearby, said instance will use extraordinary physical strength to bar entry by blocking the archway before the curtain barrier. The instance will not resort to physical violence or further efforts to block ingress should the attempt be continued. Neither human nor drone exploration of the <em>atashgah</em> has proven possible, as human ingress is immediately met with translocation to the entryway of SCP-9028 and the cessation of the effects of Protocol Mithra whilst drone exploration results in an instant loss of recording and transmission as well as the loss of equipment. Other methods of exploration are being considered by Foundation researchers.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED</strong> Following the events of Incident Anahita, all SCP-9028-1 instances present after Protocol Mithra will aggressively pursue any entrants to the space and place their hand upon the intruder's forehead, immediately forcing the cessation of the effects of Protocol Mithra. (Note that on average, the effects of Protocol Mithra have previously lasted for roughly two hours, provided no attempt to enter the <em>atashgah</em> has been made.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCIDENT ANAHITA</strong></p>
<p>On 16 October 2033, an unidentified person (hereafter designated SCP-9028-2) approached SCP-9028 via unknown means. Foundation monitoring of the site failed to observe any movement along the mountain path leading towards SCP-9028's entry point nor any attempt at aerial ingress. Investigation is ongoing into how SCP-9028-2 was able to enter the cave and begin Protocol Mithra without notice. SCP-9028-2 was apprehended without incident by Foundation personnel and transferred to Site-14 for interrogation.</p>
<p>SCP-9028-2 is a humanoid standing 213cm<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Approx. 6'10".</span> of ambiguous ethnicity with short cropped black hair and dark brown eyes with no notable scarring or other distinguishing characteristics. SCP-9028-2 emits a fluctuating baseline reading of Hume levels just below 0.5, indicating some level of reality distortion ability, possibly unrealized. At the time of his apprehension, SCP-9028-2 was wearing a nondescript black long-sleeved shirt and dark trousers (neither with any identifying branding tags or stamping) with an unbranded black knapsack containing three Grenade brand<span class="fnnum">.</span> <span class="fncon">Primarily sold in Türkiye.</span> protein bars, a large bottle of water, and a copy of the complete Sasanian <em>Avesta</em>, untranslated from Avestan.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">It should be noted that the book was bound and printed in 1993 by Denkard Publishing (location unlisted), per the reverse title page. No publisher by this name has been identified, and the complete Sassanian <em>Avesta</em> has been considered lost literature since roughly 800 CE. A possible connection to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7028">SCP-7028</a> is being investigated.</span> No other identifying items or documentation were found on their person. Although cooperative upon initial detainment, SCP-9028-2 refused to answer any questions for a total of twenty-one days after containment.</p>
<p>On 6 November, SCP-9028-2 directly requested to meet with Site Director Nizam Rashid Izadi by name, despite never previously meeting Dir. Izadi nor being told his name by any site personnel. Dir. Izadi agreed to the meeting, which is transcribed below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log 9028.1 - 6 November 2033</strong></p>

<p>[ <strong>DIR. IZADI</strong> <em>sits across a table from</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>in Interrogation Room 2. Both parties have a glass of water, and</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong>'s <em>hands are unrestrained per</em> <strong>IZADI</strong>'s <em>request. The complete Sasanian</em> Avesta <em>sits on the table between the two men. NB: Although both subjects spoke in Farsi, an English translation has been provided for ease of outside researchers. Original Farsi transcripts and recordings are available by request.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You have me at a disadvantage, as you asked for me by name but I'm afraid that I cannot do the same. I've always disliked the idea of calling a man by a number, so please. Indulge me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> At the risk of sounding cliche, my name is not important. If you must, call me Asha.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Very well, Asha. Why have you asked to speak with me today? Thus far, you haven't exactly been talkative.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I have never seen the benefit of speaking when there is nothing to say. Now, there is.</p>
<p>[ <em><strong>IZADI</strong> nods, extending his hands in a gesture of encouragement.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> By all means, feel free. I have cleared my schedule and am entirely at your disposal. We have all the time in the world.</p>
<p>[ <em><strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> smiles, shaking their head slightly.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> <em>You</em> do not, but that is irrelevant. You will allow me to travel to <em>Hara Berezaiti</em>,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">In Zoroastrian tradition, the great mountain at the centre of the world and the only place in creation which remained pure and incorruptible by the machinations of the <em>angra mainyu</em> or spirits responsible for chaos and disorder.</span> Director. You will allow me to venerate the flame and recite the <em>Yasna</em>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Zoroastrian holy rite.</span> The time has come and should not be further delayed.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Well. Points for optimism, I suppose. I think beginning with an exchange of information would be more helpful for us both. How did you come to know of SCP-9028?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> You mean more helpful for <em>you</em>, for this Foundation of yours. I do not see how that is helpful for <em>me</em> in the slightest, but feel free to explain.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I am trying to be as plain with you as possible, Asha. You know of the Foundation, which implies that you know of our creed and why we maintain the secrecy that we do. Surely then you know that I cannot just allow you to approach 9028 without understanding why you wish to do so in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Ah, yes. <em>Research is ongoing</em>. If your Foundation has a creed, there it is. I waver between wondering if you truly believe you <em>can</em> understand everything or if you know that is a lie you tell yourself to go on.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> If you are attempting to bait my temper, you will have to try much harder than that. I am neither so arrogant to believe that everything can be understood fully nor so weak as to be cowed by that reality. I take no shame in the fact that I am driven to learn, to know what might be known.</p>
<p>[ <em>There is a pause, and</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>puts his hand over the</em> Avesta <em>briefly.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I spoke of your Foundation as a monolith, which I see is an error and I beg pardon. Individuals are invariably judged by the company they keep, but such a view can be limiting, wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I would. It might inform a great deal, and some associations are — well, unforgivable. But I try to see the parts, not just the sum. And right now I am trying to understand what part you wish to play here, without judgment.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I <em>will</em> play the part required of me. But it would seem that <em>this</em> is all required as well, and I am patient enough to wait you out.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … I feel that you must realize how ominous that appears to eyes that do not see your aspirations as clearly as you are able to, yes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I suppose, if one views change as dangerous rather than inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Of course change itself is inevitable, I would never argue that. However, surely you can appreciate that sometimes a little risk analysis is wise, especially to minimize potential suffering?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> You are trying to find answers to a question you do not have the language to understand. But I am not the only one who must play a part. Though blind, you serve <em>asha</em>,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Zoroastrian concept of righteousness and truth, with <em>druj</em> as its ontological opposite.</span> that much is clear.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> One of the more esoteric compliments that I have received, but appreciated none the less.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Which raises the question… Why are you working <em>here</em>?</p>
<p>[ <em>At this point,</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>ceased answering questions and</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>ended the interview.</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>was escorted back to their quarters.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>[ END TRANSCRIPT ]</strong></p>

</div>
<p>After Interview 9028.1, SCP-9028-2 remained cooperative but non-verbal for variable, extended periods of time before once again requesting to speak to Dir. Izadi directly. In these interviews, SCP-9028-2 would explain at length their understanding of Zoroastrian cosmology, primarily centered around the unseen struggle between the creator god Ahura Mazda and the flawed corruption of his enemy, Angra Mainyu. When pressed for direct information about SCP-9028 or themselves, SCP-9028-2 would redirect the conversation or refuse to continue.</p>
<p>All other attempts to interview SCP-9028-2 have proved ineffective. As SCP-9028 presents a limited (if not yet fully understood) danger to baseline reality, advanced interrogation methods are not approved at this time.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log 9028.3 - 7 January 2034</strong></p>

<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>sits in the Interrogation Room alone, with the center surface draped with a simple white linen table cloth, brass coal samovar, two glass cups with saucers, and a tray of zoolbia &amp; bamieh sweets.</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>enters, looking briefly confused at the table.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Ah, Asha. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> … to what do I owe this level of hospitality?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You are a human being, are you not? You have been quite willing to communicate with me thus far and I wish to make it clear that I intend to do the same, even if we cannot allow you your request to enter 9028 at this time. While we talk, I see no reason why we should treat it as anything besides just that. A talk.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> A surprisingly civilized view considering <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6678">the acts</a> of some of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6975">your predecessors</a>.</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>shrugs, pouring the tea and offering</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>one of the sweets.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I will not hesitate to admit that one of my goals upon appointment was to ensure that Site-14 did not recognize itself in any way within a few years. Change has been slow, but gratifying, I would say. Now, let us begin.</p>
<p>[ <em>Pulling out his notepad,</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>begins making simple notes whilst drinking his tea with his free hand.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> While I have appreciated your candor about your goal of worshiping at 9028, I was hoping to understand <em>why</em> a bit more clearly. I understand you are unwilling to explain how you know of it, so we won't press that again, but why is worship at this <em>ātashkade</em> so critical? Might you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Why a forgotten, all but invisible flame when the Great Temple of Yazd is far grander? Make my offering at the <em>Atash Behram</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Trans. <em>Victory Fire</em>, considered the most sacred of Zoroastrian Temple Flames. Consecration of such fire requires sixteen different types of fires, sourced by priests to be combined as one and sanctified over a year-long process and resulting in a high holy pilgrimage site for the devout.</span> instead?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I don't view this through a lens of grandeur or importance, for what it is worth. But I certainly would think there would be more convenient <em>ātashkade</em> for your offering.</p>
<p>[ <em>There is a long moment of silence, punctuated by quiet sounds of mastication and drinking.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> You truly want to <em>know</em> these things, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I <em>am</em> asking, aren't I?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> The <em>Atash Behram</em> within that cave and its beyond is the most sacred of the fires for it has never gone out. It has burned since the beginning and it will burn until the end, for that has always been its purpose. Now you, Nizam. What is your purpose? Do you have family?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Oh, none living, I'm afraid. My <em>maman joon</em> often joked that I was a nightingale who refused to sleep.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Persian idiom for one who works often and refuses to take breaks or enjoy life outside of their job.</span> I focused too much on my research to settle down anywhere. The world was large and I was drawn to see as much as I could of it.</p>
<p>[ <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>seems to consider this, chewing on one of the sweetcakes in silence before responding.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> This '9028' that you call it… I suppose you could say it is the same for me. I am drawn to it, for it is what remains for me to see. We have known before the days of Zarathushtra<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Persian spelling for Zoroaster (which is closer to the Greek spelling of the original name).</span> of what can only be called disharmony between what <em>getig</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Zoroastrian term for creation as made by <em>Ahura Mazda</em>.</span> was intended to be and what it became. <em>Ahriman</em> worked against <em>Ahura Mazda</em> to corrupt the perfection that was intended for you, for everyone. Like all, I am determined to see the last of these intentions realized and fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … and then? What happens after you are able to enter the building?</p>
<p>[ <em>There is a long pause as neither man speaks.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I think this is where we should end. For now.</p>

<p>On 16 October, 2035 at 2:14 a.m. IST,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Iran Standard Time, GMT+3:30.</span> SCP-9028-2 breached containment through unknown means, disappearing from their containment chamber and reappearing in the Site Kitchens.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log 9028.7 - 17 October 2035</strong></p>

<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>paces within the containment chamber of</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>who sits in one of the provided armchairs, frowning.</em></p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> There are other ways to get our attention, Asha. You didn't have to go and prove what we've assumed for the better part of a year now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> What exactly did I prove, just so we're on the same page?</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> That we're not doing a <em>damned</em> thing to hold you here, and that you're just toying with us all at this point. Why bother with the game?</p>
<p>[ <em>There is a long pause as neither man speaks.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> … that was not my intention, although now I can see how it might seem that way. You do not hold me here in one sense of the word, but I am not playing a game either, Nizam.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You have to know we can't just <em>trust</em> that, not when 'Type Green' is going to be thrown around with strong evidence supporting it! We have been trusting your cooperation was a mark of good faith, but now —</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> — now, I have made you look like a naive fool to your superiors? I should have known ambition would blind you in the end.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I am the Director of Site-14 and that is all that I have aspired to, all that I have <em>wanted</em> in my career. Stop acting like you understand me so fully because I assure you that you do <em>not</em>. And yes, I <em>have</em> been made to look a trusting fool, which has far more consequences for you than it will for me!</p>
<p>[ <em>At this point,</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>catches his breath, as his tone had escalated to shouting. There is another long pause.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I am not worried about my place in the hierarchy, or anything so mundane. Assumptions about your motivations and abilities will no longer do, there will be testing and confirmation, stricter containment procedures to ensure we are not allowing a reality bender to do as he pleases. I had thought we had established some trust and now that trust is broken. What on earth was so important that you would undermine it all with this little jaunt?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> … I heard one of those passing in the hallway say that the canteen had <em>faloodeh</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Traditional Iranian dessert.</span> on the menu today, but dinner merely had a biscuit. I was just checking to see if perhaps there were leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … you're <em>kidding</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> No, I assure you that I am not. I do not really 'kid', which I assumed you know by this point. But I had always enjoyed <em>faloodeh</em>, before. I suppose it just got into my head. … I did not find any, though.</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>does not reply, seemingly in a state of stunned shock.</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>continues.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> And while it is true that your Foundation is not <em>holding</em> me here, it is where I am. Where I am meant to be, until it is time for me to be somewhere else. You cannot prevent that, nor can anyone else. In the interim, I will try to help you to find you the answers you seek.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> In all truth, I am not sure myself. It is not required to be done by the <em>Saoshyant</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Avestan eschatological term, literal translation 'one who brings benefit'. Described in the Younger Avesta as the bringer of <em>Frashokereti</em>, the end-times restoration of the cosmos per Zoroastrian theology.</span> but I <em>wish</em> to, so I will.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You speak so casually of cosmic restructuring, of the end times. As if it is a simple thing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Why would it be anything else?</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>removes his glasses, rubbing roughly at his eyes before continuing.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> There will be some security measures put in place after today. Just so we're clear.</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>turns to leave, pausing only at the door with his back to</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2.</strong> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … I'll see what I can do about the <em>faloodeh.</em></p>

</div>
<p>After SCP-9028-2's self-identification as the <em>Saoshyant</em>, Site-14 requested additional support from <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tactical-theology-hub">the Department of Tactical Theology</a> for further investigation into the possible connection between SCP-9028 and <em>Frashokereti</em>. Although the link is assumed due to SCP-9028-2's stated purpose upon apprehension by Foundation personnel as well as their self-identification as <em>Saoshyant</em>, further testing has been denied by the O5 Council as inviting unnecessary risks to baseline reality.</p>
<p>Containment procedures were modified to include Scranton anchors as well as other paratechnology used to restrain reality bending anomalies. SCP-9028-2 has either been unable or unwilling to attempt another escape from their quarters and has resumed periodic interviews with Dir. Izadi. Any requests from SCP-9028-2 for additions or items to their quarters must be approved by both Dir. Izadi and Dir. Yossarian Leiner (Head of Tactical Theology).<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">To date, requests have been varied classical and religious texts as well as Persian poetry, a notebook for journaling, and a hardwood chess set.</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log 9028.20 - 4 March 2051</strong></p>

<p>[ <em>Both</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>sit within the latter's quarters, playing chess and sharing tea as well as cardamom biscuits supplied and approved by</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>and Dr. Leiner (via email).</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I suppose my good behavior merited this reward? It has been some years since my misbehavior, after all.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You say that as if you are a school boy we are scolding for his misdeeds when he returns a man grown. As you were a man grown when you arrived, it doesn't really seem a fair comparison.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Well, your gift is appreciated, regardless of intention.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> The intention was merely that I wished to bring them to our meeting today, as I saw them at the <em>naanavaya</em><span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Persian bakery.</span> this morning and thought you would enjoy them. I recognize you see the Foundation as adversarial but not everything that I do is the means to some cunning, devious end. Sometimes a biscuit is simply a biscuit.</p>
<p>[ <em>They eat in silence for a time,</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>pouring tea for both men.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> … I do not see your Foundation as an adversary, for the record.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> Oh? Are we not keeping you from your stated goal of venerating the flame and reciting the <em>Yasna</em>? I certainly thought we were, but I suppose that I might have lost track.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> You use dry humor as a deflection. It is not subtle.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> It isn't really intended to be. But please, continue.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I am where I need to be, not where I am meant to be. I am no fool, Nizam. I know you find me almost maddeningly vague, but imagine if you were to try to explain how one of your satellites or particle accelerators worked to a child who had just learned to speak.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> That was not exactly a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> It was not intended to be.</p>
<p>[ <em>With a deep sigh,</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>stands up and walks over to look at their small bookshelf, their back to</em> <strong>IZADI</strong>. ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> It goes back so far, humanity's need to classify and categorize and <em>explain</em> all things, and I continue to marvel at it. I confess, it used to drive me mad, so confusing and ultimately pointless. At this point — I suppose that I find it more endearing than otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> You have been watching for some time, haven't you? After all, my eyes might grow cloudy, but not blind.</p>
<p>[ <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>turns around to look at</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>questioningly.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> It has been years, my friend, and my hair has gone all but silver while you look the same age as you did when we found you in the cave. You do not age, Asha. Whatever you are, it is not made of the same stuff as the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I am and I am not, which is what I mean by struggling to explain it all to you. For I understand at least that much — that <em>you</em> want nothing more to understand. So many of you here at this Site-14 of yours <em>want</em> to know, simply for its own sake, even to defend those who you deem innocent. Perhaps for many it might be control, authority, but even that makes a certain amount of sense when grappling with the reality that in the end, nothing <em>can</em> be controlled. Not by you, or any of you.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … you can imagine how bleak that might be to accept, on its face.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Of course. Particularly when it is not the divine order demanding it of you, but invaders from beyond your lands, standing upon the earth and demanding authority.</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>can be seen flexing his hand into a fist beneath the table briefly, taking a few deep breaths, as if to calm himself.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> It goes without saying that your reception at Site-14 would have been very different, should you have arrived roughly a decade earlier. If only you knew how I worried that night you went on your little jaunt about the Site for sweets, that such a little thing might mean my removal and some outsider would be brought in to make 'things right'. Even now, self-determination is sometimes challenging, for who knows the way the future might hold? Yet ever we carry on, as long as we may. Hoping that the future might be brighter for those around you, that it all has been worth it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> 'Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond?'</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I see you've been taking advantage of the Rumi<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī, 14th Century Persian poet.</span> that I lent you, if a bit on the nose for this particular discussion. Is that who you truly are, Asha? A guide from beyond?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I suppose that title would be as close as any. I am here for one goal, which you have known since I arrived and that I have never attempted to obfuscate. But I will confess that not every reason that I am here has been given to me by others, and along this journey I have found several of my own. Is that enough to suffice for explanation?</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>pauses, looking up at</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>with an unreadable expression before moving his bishop.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I suppose it must be. For now.</p>
<p>[ <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>sits back opposite</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>at the table and moves his queen.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Check.</p>

<p>On 16 October 2063, SCP-9028-2 asked to speak to Dir. Izadi and was told that due to illness, he was currently unavailable and that Acting Director Mahdavi would take his place. SCP-9028-2 immediately vanished from their containment quarters<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Retroactive checks have indicated that all reality anchors and paratechnology were functioning correctly around the containment chamber.</span> and manifested next to Dir. Izadi's bedside in the medical unit of Site-14 where he was receiving palliative care.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview Log 9028.29 - 16 October 2063</strong></p>

<p>[ <em>Immediately after manifesting in</em> <strong>IZADI's</strong> <em>private hospice room,</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>knelt next to the bed and took the other man's hand in his own.</em> <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>, still receiving oxygen via nasal cannula opened his eyes, laughing roughly before coughing.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I knew those Scrantons were a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> It did not seem beneficial to point it out. The time and money you would have all wasted to try and find something else could be used for greater need.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> So, Asha — we have come to the end then, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> I did not think you should be alone for it, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> No, no. Not that. I mean the <em>end</em>. To <em>Frashokereti</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> … we have, yes. It was never yours to stop, for all that you tried.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> I didn't — well, I suppose I did. But the harm, Asha. The end of <em>everything</em>…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> It is not the end, Nizam. It was never intended to be the end, only the inevitable that I tried to explain to you so many times. There is no end, merely change, just as you now are facing. From one place to the next.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … 'good prevails over evil, Ahura Mazda conquers Angra Mainyu and all is purified by the molten metal flowing from the peaks of Hara Berezaiti.' Forgive me for not finding much comfort there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> Zarathushtra's revelations became muddled by the words of those who followed him with far louder voices, and thus the believers read terror in the silence. I will not tell you to not fear the unknown, I know that asks too much. I could tell you of the gentle beauty that awaits you, the singing of the larks and the end of suffering, but that would feel like placation to a man like you. So instead, remember, my friend. Remember what the word itself means.</p>
<p><strong>IZADI:</strong> … <em>Frashokereti.</em> To be made wonderful, excellent. <strong>Beautiful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> You have lived in the darkness for so long, Nizam. At last, walk with me into the light.</p>
<p>[ <strong>IZADI</strong> <em>takes a deep breath before using his free hand to displace the cannula, disrupting the oxygen flow.</em> <strong>SCP-9028-2</strong> <em>presses his lips to</em> <strong>IZADI</strong>'s <em>forehead before kneeling again at the bedside, still clasping</em> <strong>IZADI's</strong> <em>hand.</em> ]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9028-2:</strong> We look unto thee, Ahura Mazda, for the relief of our grief and comfort of our hearts. Their earthly work is done and they have laid down the burden that pressed heavily on them. Let thy light shine upon them.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Traditional Zoroastrian prayer for the dead.</span></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Former Site Director Nizam Rashid Izadi passed away at 9:31 a.m. Site-14 security recordings show SCP-9028-2 vanishing from Izadi's bedside before disappearing from all recordings. SCP-9028-2 remains uncontained to date.</p>
<p>As of 16 October 2073, Protocol Mithra is no longer effective for gaining entry to SCP-9028. Reestablishing access to SCP-9028 is considered the highest of priorities. Research is ongoing.</p>
