            <h1>SCP-2463</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2463</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each instance of SCP-2463 is to be kept in a separate standard containment locker at Site-19. At no point should any instance of SCP-2463 come into contact with any other instance of SCP-2463. Access to single instances of SCP-2463 is restricted to personnel with security clearance of 3 or higher, and access to multiple instances is not permitted at this time.</p>
<p>Any personnel found attempting to remove any number of SCP-2463 instances from designated testing rooms are to be immediately detained and held for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2463 is a set of six bronze horses, each approximately 6 cm tall, and believed to be Ancient Roman in origin. Various dating methods have placed the creation of SCP-2463 at circa 250 CE. SCP-2463’s anomalous properties begin to manifest when instances are exposed to water collected from naturally occurring sources<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-2463 instances that are exposed to any such water, will begin converting the water into petroleum through an unknown process. This conversion takes place at a rate of approximately 63 mL per hour.</p>
<p>If separate instances of SCP-2463 come into physical contact, this conversion rate will scale exponentially with the number of instances, so that when all six instances are in contact, the conversion will occur at a rate of approximately 62,523,502 L per hour, allowing large volumes of water to be converted very quickly.</p>
<p>SCP-2463 was discovered during a raid on a storage facility in ███████, New York, which was believed to be owned by Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP. The raid was conducted by Mobile Task Force Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”), and resulted in recovery of SCP-2463 as well as <a href="/scp-2635">SCP-2635</a> and <a href="/scp-1738">SCP-1738</a>, along with several documents and items currently awaiting cataloging.</p>
<p>MTF-M3 was discovered during their mission, and as a result, several Foundation personnel were killed in the course of duty. SCP-2463 was briefly activated during recovery, but was successfully contained by remaining MTF-M3 operatives.</p>
<p>For further information on the recovery of SCP-2463, consult Recovery Log-2463.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2463-1:</strong> In addition to SCP-2463, MTF-M3 also recovered a Marshall, Carter and Dark item listing for the object. This document has been designated as <a href="/mcd-little-draft-horses">Document-2463-1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2463-2:</strong> Found with Document-2463-1 was a transcript of a letter believed to have been translated from ancient Latin, written to the Roman Emperor Gallienus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> by an as of yet unidentified person.

<p><em>To Imperator Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus Augustus</em></p>
<p><em>We are deeply saddened to learn of the death of your great father, and write to you in order to settle a pressing matter of business left unresolved by the venerable emperor.</em></p>
<p><em>Shortly after his capture at Edessa by Shahansha Shapur, your father wrote to Us from Bishapur, seeking aid on behalf of The Empire. On his request, We have procured a number of items that we believe met the needs he expressed.</em></p>
<p><em>We will happily pass along these items to you, so long as We are paid the price that was arranged by your honorable father, that being a sum of 60,000,000 Aurei. We are aware that the price seems extreme, but so were the demands of your father.</em></p>
<p><em>"A force to wipe out the Persian dogs. To make barren their lands, and sickly their people. A force to destroy every square foot on which they have ever walked and to plague their kingdom with bloodshed for millennia."</em></p>
<p><em>These were the feats required of us by the deific Valerianus, and for this power We must ask for equal renumeration.</em></p>
<p><em>Should you decide not to pay, We shall retain possession of the items until a time when We are payed what We have asked.</em></p>
<p><em>Your loyal servant, D. Mercator.</em></p>

Tests have determined that any water collected from natural bodies of water (including lakes, rivers, seas, oceans, and subterranean springs, etc.) will activate SCP-2463.
