            <h1>SCP-2494</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2494</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid (Keter classification pending)</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2494 is currently uncontained. MTF Rho-14 ("Handschuhe") is tasked with tracking the origin of the phenomenon and suppressing public knowledge of outbreaks. All instances of SCP-2494-1 should be captured, euthanized, and cataloged. One instance of SCP-2494-1 per major species is to be kept in Site-73 specimen storage.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2494 is a phenomenon whereby animals (SCP-2494-1) manifest human hands, integrated into their anatomy. To date, all instances of SCP-2494-1 have been vertebrates. The source and mechanisms of SCP-2494 are currently unknown, but the phenomenon has so far been centralized to the vicinity of the River Tweed along the Scottish/English border.</p>
<p>Hands related to SCP-2494 vary in size, but in SCP-2494-1 averaging more than 0.4m in length or 9 kg in weight are comparable to standard human hands. Hands typically occur (&gt;90%) at the ends of forelimbs, less frequently (&gt;60%) also on the hindlimbs. In rare instances, hands have been seen emerging from the cranium, along the spine, in place of the tail, or at the end of the nose. Hands are merged seamlessly with SCP-2494-1's physiology, and color varies according to the animal's own skin. DNA tests invariably return as that of the instance's species.</p>
<p>SCP-2494-1 are generally not impeded by these hands, except in cases where placement overbalances the instance. Fine manipulation is possible, though instances will only use their hands in this manner if such behavior is typical for their species. However, SCP-2494-1 have been discovered clutching letters and flyers; the origin of these is currently under investigation. (See Addenda 2494-02 and -05.)</p>

<p>On 15/04/2015, a school of 13 <em>Salmo salar</em> SCP-2494-1 was observed in the River Tweed approaching Site-73. MTF Rho-14 was able to capture all instances and initiate counter-information procedures.</p>
<p>Each instance possessed a single hand in place of its dorsal fin, visible above waterline. Movement in water was somewhat clumsy. Each hand clutched a plastic bag containing a small sheet of paper, text reproduced below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings New Friends!</p>
<p>We Have Noticed You Watching With Your Eyes. Watching Them Fly, Swim And Crawl. We Are Joyful To Meet Others As Excited About Hands As We! We Hope You Appreciate These New Hands. Smell Them With Your Nose. Taste Them With Your Mouth. Touch Them With Your Hands. With Your Glorious, Gleaming Hands, Touch Them Upon Their Hands So Pure. May You Find Always Happiness In Hands!</p>
<p>Soft Hands<sup>®</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this event, instances of SCP-2494-1 have appeared more frequently with less advantageously placed hands, and greater numbers of hands per instance. Instances bearing communications have also increased. Investigation is ongoing; classification upgrade to Keter pending review.</p>
