<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong></em></span></p>
<p>SCP-8197 must be kept in a reinforced theropod-class containment enclosure measuring <em>60 m × 40 m × 15 m</em>, constructed of <em>high-density alloy mesh</em> and <em>triple-layer</em> observation glass.<br/>
The habitat is to simulate a natural forested environment, such as where SCP-8197 was first located, so it feels at home and less stressed.<br/>
And, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at all times</span>, must be around <em>18–22 °C</em></p>
<p>Personnel entering SCP-8197’s chamber must undergo <em>Level-3 clearance authorization</em> and <em>remain under constant observation</em> from the upper control platform. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>No more than two individuals are to enter the enclosure at once.</em></span></p>
<p>Feeding occurs <em>twice</em> weekly with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>live</em></span> Elk.</p>
<p>In the event of agitation or containment breach indicators <em>(rapid bioluminescent activity)</em>, SCP-8197 is to be calmed using <em>low-frequency sound emitters tuned to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">27 Hz</span></em>, which have been shown to induce a subdued state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Description</em></strong></span><br/>
SCP-8197 is a large, bipedal, theropod-like organism approximately <em>9 m in length and 3 m tall at the head.</em> Morphologically <em>similar to Maip macrothorax</em>, SCP-8197 possesses dense feathers and quills all over it's back and tail, believed to aid in temperature regulation.</p>

<p>The entity’s coloration is <em>grey at the base, darkening toward the head</em>, with a <em>series of blue, vein-like luminescent structures visible beneath the skin along the torso and throat</em>. These luminescent veins <em>pulse in synchronization with the creature’s heartbeat</em>, intensifying during <em>stress or aggression</em>. The function of this phenomenon is <em>undetermined</em> but hypothesized to be related to <em>communication or emotional display</em>. Eyes are dark green with vertical pupils.</p>
<p>SCP-8197 possesses a <em>proportionally large skull</em> housing numerous serrated teeth capable of <em>exerting an estimated bite force of 3 000 psi</em>. The forelimbs terminate in three elongated claws capable of <em>inflicting severe trauma</em>; hind limbs exhibit <em>strong musculature enabling bursts of speed up to 38 mph</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Behavioural Summary:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>At first: SCP-8197 was extremely <em>aggressive and attempted to attack any personnel or mechanical presence in sight</em>, displaying signs of <em>disorientation consistent with post-traumatic environmental shock.</em><br/>
Now: SCP-8197 demonstrates significantly <em>reduced hostility</em>, showing <em>curiosity and limited social recognition toward specific handlers</em>. Bioluminescent activity slows markedly when <em>interacting with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">familiar</span> staff</em>, suggesting lowered stress and adaptive trust responses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Addendum 8197-A – Discovery:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>SCP-8197 was recovered on 12 / 6 / 2012 following reports of sightings of a <em>large reptilian animal</em> at <em>"Great Bear lake", Canada</em>. Mobile Task Force Eta-6 located the entity at the edge of the lake drinking. The moment it was shot with one of the darts, it bolted to the forest, luckily it didn't take long for the anaesthetic to take affect and slow it down. Tranquilization required four high-yield anaesthetic darts and two reinforced containment vehicles for transport to Site-65.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "D-7712, you may now enter SCP-8197's containment."<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "OK, so what actually <em>do</em> you want me to do once I go in?"<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "Just do whatever, really. Just stay as calm as possible while doing what you do, we're just merely looking for a reaction from SCP-8197.<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "Alright.."</p>
<p>[D-7712 enters SCP-8197's containment]</p>
<p><strong>D-7712:</strong> "So what am I exactly in here with..?"<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "That does not concern you. Carry on with what you are doing."<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "Well, it clearly DOES concern me!"<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "Just stay focused and calm. Could you got further to the back of the containment, close to the foliage."<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "Sure.. I guess.."</p>
<p>[D-7712 goes further into the containment, coming to a full stop.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "Everything alright in there, D-7712?"<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> [trembling] "I-.. I can see it…"<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "Good, now can you tell me what it's doing right now? And remember, try to stay as calm as possible."<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "It's just.. Staring at me.. Crouched low to the ground.."<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "So it's seen you?<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "..Yes.."<br/>
<strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "Okay, this is going to sound stupid, but.. I want you to approach it slowly, and while doing so, tell me how it's reacting to your presence."<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "You've gotta be kidding me.. I'm not getting any closer than I am already."</p>
<p>[D-7712 starts to walk to the containment exit.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Elijah:</strong> "What do you think you're doing?! Get back there now!"<br/>
<strong>D-7712:</strong> "I am NOT going to do any more you tell me t-"</p>
<p>[SCP-8197 quickly snatches and drags D-7712 into the foliage.]</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Post-Experiment Note:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Following Incident 8197-01, D-7712 was declared deceased. Recovery of D-7712’s body was deemed unsafe due to SCP-8197’s heightened aggression.<br/>
Approximately three hours after the event, SCP-8197’s bioluminescent markings were observed pulsing at an accelerated rate before gradually returning to baseline. Researchers speculate this response may be stress-related or a display of agitation.</p>
<p>Further testing involving live human subjects has been temporarily suspended pending review by Site Command.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCP-8197's Current Status:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>SCP-8197 remains <em>contained</em>. Continued behavioural and neurological monitoring is authorized to evaluate its potential for higher cognitive processing and emotional learning.</p>
