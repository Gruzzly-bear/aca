            <h1>SCP-1516</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1516</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1516 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 49, furnished with instances of SCP-1516-1. SCP-1516 is to be provided with written words referring to food and nourishment. Under no circumstances is SCP-1516 allowed to interact with written words describing harmful and/or dangerous concepts that may cause damage to the vicinity or the subject itself, or text/inscription based anomalies, including <a href="/scp-1672">SCP-1672</a>, <a href="/scp-1889">SCP-1889</a>, <a href="/scp-2140">SCP-2140</a>. As per request, SCP-1516 has been allowed to possess an audiobook copy of the Bible.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1516 is a living typographical illustration of a human being measuring 1.9 meters in height and 78 kilograms in weight. SCP-1516 has a semi-variable appearance and is composed of ██████ typeface letters and words. Each part of SCP-1516's anatomy is composed of the Spanish word deformed to fit the shape of that part of the body. SCP-1516's anatomy is always labeled with the simplest possible term for the body part. When viewed from a closer perspective, SCP-1516's form will slowly change its shape to the terms for that part of the subject's body (i.e: its legs would be a deformed "leg" word, and arms, chest, face, etc will follow this pattern). This effect continues down to the subcellular level. When examined by electron microscopy nuclei isolated from SCP-1516 are full linked A's, T's, C's, and G's linked by the word "sugar". While SCP-1516 is aware of this aspect, it appears to be unable to control it in any way.</p>
<p>When SCP-1516 performs any action that would produce a sound,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> it will produce written words and/or onomatopoeias from the source of the sound instead, floating on the air for approximately 5-10 seconds before suddenly vanishing. It is of note that digital audio recorders can register them as sounds,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> but cameras and other visual recorders may register a visual image of them.</p>
<p>Whenever SCP-1516 enters in direct contact with a single noun written on any suitable surface, said word will detach itself from the paper and will deform to fit a tridimensional and functional object depicting the previous concept of the word (hereby called SCP-1516-1). Instances of SCP-1516-1 share the same physical characteristics with SCP-1516 itself. SCP-1516 is capable of controlling this ability, but is bounded by SCP-1516's knowledge and understanding of the word, and how complex the concept is. For a full list of SCP-1516's abilities, see test log-1516.</p>
<p><strong>Test log-1516:</strong> The following is a list of the experiments conducted to test SCP-1516's effect on different words at varying situations:</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Sofá" (couch)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Upon contact, the word suddenly detached itself, grew in size and deformed to form a tridimensional couch.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Cama" (bed)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Similar results as per previous test.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Teléfono" (phone)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Upon contact, the word stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed that it doesn't know how a phone works.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Tomate" (tomato), "lechuga" (lettuce) and "cebolla" (onion).<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> As expected, all the words were effectively turned into SCP-1516-1 instances. Dr ██████ used a standard kitchen knife to prepare a simple salad. When mixed together, they shifted into "ensalada" (salad). When allowed to consume the salad, SCP-1516 was capable of identifying all involved ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Vase"<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> No change. SCP-1516 has claimed not to know what the word means.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Vase". This time, SCP-1516 has been taught about the meaning of the word.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Upon contact, the word changed in the usual way.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Perro" (dog)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Upon contact, the sample shifted as expected. When inspected, it did not show any life signs.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Papel" (paper)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The sample stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed the word "paper" is immune to its effect.</p>
<p><strong>Word:</strong> "Una silla rota" (a broken chair)<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> No change. SCP-1516 has claimed it cannot affect anything beyond an isolated<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> word at once.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-1516 was discovered on ███████, Venezuela. Following several reports of a "man made of letters" living in an abandoned house on the mountain. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the situation. SCP-1516 offered no resistance to capture. Witnesses were interviewed and treated with A-class amnestics. Forty-seven (47) instances of SCP-1516-1 were found on the vicinity and confiscated.</p>
<p><strong>Interview log:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-1516.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Vasquez.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> First interview following SCP-1516's capture. Translated from original Spanish. Subject appears to be calm and willing to cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Vasquez:</strong> Please state your name and nature.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> I am Palabra Quintero. Nothing but a man in this universe.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> I see. How long do you remember being in your current state?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> I've been like this since I was born. Dad took care of me since I was a child.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> Where is your father right now? Was he like you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> I don't know. He told me one day his job was done and let me on my own. And no, he was more like you. At least, our creator is always watching us, so I never felt truly alone.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> I mean we are being observed. They watch over us most of the time. Constantly reading our actions in this universe.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> Who is this creator?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> He is God. Or should I say they are God? It doesn't really matter, because God is always reading us.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> Do you mean watching us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> Well, it's all a matter of perspective. In my eyes, and in their eyes, we are just all the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> I see. Any additional information regarding your father?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> He was a lovely man, but he had problems focusing in a single subject. Nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> Now, what can you tell about the objects we found on your residence?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> Those are words I took from some children books my dad gave to me some years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> When you say you take them, do you mean physically remove a word from the paper?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> More or less. It's like grabbing an object from a bag. Although some words are really heavy to lift.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> What is the… Most heavy word you ever tried to manifest?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> I tried a tree once. It just didn't move at all.</p>
<p><strong>Vasquez:</strong> I think that's enough information for now. We will move you to a new residence soon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1516:</strong> May God bless your tales, brother.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-1516 hasn't given any additional information regarding its "father" or its "creator". Further investigations on these matters are pending.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> At ████/██/██ SCP-1516 was approved to receive English classes 3 times a week. Due to the apparent lack of difference between oral and written communication, the subject showed a remarkable advance during courses. 10 weeks after the classes started, SCP-1516's body presented an irregularity when several body samples showed 12% of the total mass to be written in regular English. English course was suspended and several tests were run on SCP-1516's body. SCP-1516 expressed no physical discomfort for this event and requested to continue its English classes. After several discussions, SCP-1516 was allowed to continue its classes. At week 14 body mass changed into English had been increased to 20% and confirmed that English transmutation was directly proportional to SCP-1516's English skills. At week 37, SCP-1516 reached perfect use of English language and English transmutation stopped at 48% of its body mass. No objective secondary effects were visible, but a slight change in SCP-1516's personality has been noted connected to the language it uses to communicate.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
