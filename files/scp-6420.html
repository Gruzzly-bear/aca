<p>The cadaver of Tal Kinigl, is to be kept in cold storage at Auxiliary Research Facility-19.</p>
<p>When brought into Foundation custody, SCP-6420-2 should be placed in high-security humanoid containment<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Two instances of SCP-6420-3 should be held in separate, high-security animal containment cells, and fed orchard hay and flies daily. A cadaver of an SCP-6420-3 instance should be contained in safe cold storage. Any SCP-6420-3 instances not found in Foundation custody are to be incinerated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6420 is the collective designation for a series of anomalies located inside and in the area of a dilapidated house in rural Michigan. SCP-6420-1 is the former residence of Tal Kinigl and Isa Kinigl. Tal Kinigl is a human cadaver presently afflicted by an instance of SCP-6420-3.</p>

<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Do you not like rabbits?</p>
<p><strong>Macky:</strong> I like rabbits, but sometimes they can be disturbing.</p>
<p><em>[They step up to the house. The rabbits do not move, but watch the agents. There's evidence of forced entry. Joseph notices something on the ground outside the door.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Macky:</strong> <em>(whispers)</em> Hail Mary, full of grace—</p>
<p><em>[Macky and Joseph put on their infrared goggles and switch their video feed. The agents enter into the main entryway. The stairway and hallways are barely visible due to the thickness of foliage and spiderwebs.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Joseph pans the infrared camera across the entryway. Both hallways and the upstairs show groups of rabbit heat signatures.]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[Extraneous footage removed.]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[The agents reach the second floor. Snow falls from holes in the ceiling. The agents see fresh large tracks and follow. It leads to an open door with a large heat signature. As they approach, the heat signature takes the shape of an upright rabbit. The hinges on the door are dislodged and broken. Macky turns her infrared off before entering the room. She peers her head inside.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The room is lit from an outside window. The window is smashed in by a tree branch. Snow banks grow in the room as the blizzard approaches.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-6420-2 is in the corner hunched over a dead body later identified as Tal Kinigl. SCP-6420-2 covers its face with humanoid hands.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Macky:</strong> Hello, bunny.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6420-2:</strong> <em>(soft whimpers)</em></p>
<p><strong>Macky:</strong> It's okay bunny, can you understand me?</p>

<p><em>[Macky's camera falls into the snow bank during the struggle. It records SCP-6420-2 ripping Macky's rosary from her neck. Joseph fires his gun at the rabbits who regroup and make an attempt to lunge again.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Macky!?</p>
<p><em>[She is unresponsive and Joseph picks her up]</em></p>
<p><em>[His camera shows a red and purple indent at the base of her neck, a pink polyp sticks out. He removes his field knife and tries to remove the polyp. Hissing comes from behind him. He replaces his knife for his gun and heads toward the window.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> Shit. <em>(slings Macky over shoulder)</em></p>
<p><em>[He looks over at the window, shoots at the approaching rabbits and runs to the window. He looks down, part of the first story roof is under the window sill.]</em></p>

<p><em>[The hissing and guttural honking grow louder. Joseph turns around and sees the rabbits a few meters away from him and Macky. He draws out his gun and shoots a few of the sprinting rabbits. It scares the oncoming horde long enough for him to close the gap to the car. Wind and snow pick up as the stormfront approaches their area. Vision is obscured.]</em></p>

<p>Through cooperation with Agent Mackenzie Coinín, crucial observations were made to the stages of SCP-6420-3 symptoms and infection.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Below are logs recorded by Agent Coinín during the infection stages and post-operation.<br/>

<strong>Agent Mackenzie Coinín's Logs</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/18<br/>
14:08</p>
<p>I woke up in a hospital bed. They informed me that I had been attacked and infected by SCP-6420-2 but I barely remember investigating the house with Joseph. My head feels light and I'm dizzy. I touched the back of my neck and felt the scab the critter left.</p>
<p>Researcher Davis came into the room and gave me this laptop. He requested that I keep a daily log of my activities and thoughts. Well my thought is that this sucks. I mean, there's a lot more to it than that. I might be in shock. The last thing I remember is climbing the stairs with Joseph.</p>
<p>The laptop isn't connected to the internet. I'm bored so I looked for games on the laptop. I like chess, and that's the only game on it I like.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/19<br/>
22:01</p>
<p>My skin has been really itchy and dry. I told the medical staff this and they gave me some lotion. It helps a little. We don't know what the symptoms of the infection are so… this could be part of it?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/20<br/>
01:08</p>
<p>The hair on my arm has gotten longer and it grows in thick patches. I'm trying not to itch myself or pick at the hairs by instead playing chess and writing. I forgot how incredibly bad I am at chess.</p>
<p>03:06</p>
<p>The itching is unbearable and I'm typing this to complain about it. I'm also <em>attempting</em> to ignore it. I scratched so hard an hour ago that I bled. Staff patched it up and is monitoring me. They might have to tie my hands up, the itchiness is… indescribable.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/20<br/>
06:28</p>
<p>Staff had to strap me to my bed while the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hair</span> fur grew in the rest of the way. I'm only typing this now because the itchiness has finally stopped.</p>
<p>To keep my mind off of the hare I'm goin play chess! Get it? Hare! I know I'm slowly turning into some horrible critter but I still need to laugh!</p>
<p>07:10</p>
<p>I can't focus on chess at the moment. I have a splitting headache, I touched the back of my head and found two bumps. I'm going to start crying.</p>
<p>I alerted staff and Researcher Davis inspected my head. He said he wanted to minimize my pain, but that since they don't know what's going to happen he's cautious about it.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/20<br/>
07:43</p>
<p>I can hear bugs scurrying inside the walls. The sound echos in my skull. I'm trying to ignore the ears. I'm trying to ignore the ears. But I can't ignore it. I can hear everything. I can hear the staff outside talking about other anomalies and I can hear them talking about me.</p>
<p>They sound so cold. I'm just another one of these freak critters we box up… I've been working here for a few years and I know what I signed up for but did I <em>really</em> know what I signed up for? I couldn't have imagined…</p>
<p>Oh God, I have a headache again.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>2021/02/22<br/>
14:10</p>
<p>My mouth started bleeding and I held teeth in my hands as they pushed out of my skull. I screamed. New teeth split through my gums. Staff arrived.</p>
<p>I don't know what Davis expects me to type. I don't know what's going on and I'm scared.</p>

<p>i dont have any comments about this, my body still aches, im still hooked to drip morphine, i still cant speak and i cant see anything.</p>

<p>i was in a dark, gray ocean. salt was on my lips as i swam towards the surface but i couldnt breach, i suffocated and woke up in a blinding white room. it was cold. i heard joseph's voice and a silloute of a rabbit stood in front of me in the blinding light.</p>
<p>i heard joesph's voice again and i woke up again. i felt the rough, warm hospital sheets, and joseph saying "shes woken up! she's woken up!" he asked me how i felt.</p>
<p>im still mute he realized this and got me the laptop… i cried and told him that i dont know what happened or where i was</p>
<p>…im in an intensive care wing in arf 19 and davis' research team performed operation to remove the egg sac</p>
