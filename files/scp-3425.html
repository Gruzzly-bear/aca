            <h1>SCP-3425</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3425</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3425 is to be contained in a transparent chamber measuring 5 m x 5 m. The door to SCP-3425's chamber can be unlocked by any personnel Class 3 or higher. SCP-3425 is to be exposed to a 1 kg sheet of iron twice a week. The resulting object is to be removed from containment and studied. SCP-3425's behavior is to be monitored hourly, and any abnormalities must be reported to researchers involved with SCP-3425. In the event that SCP-3425 begins acting distressed, it is to be given a 5kg steel ingot and must be monitored until it resumes normal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3425 is a humanoid entity, measuring 1.75 m in height and weighing 748 kg. SCP-3425 wears an early-20th century welder's suit consisting of an unusually durable rubber-like material. SCP-3425's face is obscured by a welder's helmet, though the glass is tinted too dark to see through. All attempts to remove SCP-3425's suit and helmet to further study its body have resulted in failure (it was not until Incident 3425-A that researchers were able to observe SCP-3425 beneath its suit). SCP-3425's body is metallic and consists of iron. SCP-3425 displays no signs of biological life; it has no pulse, does not breathe, and thermal imagery shows that it gives off no body heat aside from in its chest. SCP-3425 possesses a blowtorch-like device in place of its left hand. SCP-3425's method of powering this device is currently unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-3425 does not speak or emit any other noises, aside from a scraping noise occasionally heard when it moves. SCP-3425's behavior is usually sedentary; movement is rare when not exposed to any stimuli. When moving, SCP-3425 shows signs of intelligence, and appears to experience emotions. SCP-3425 has a docile nature and is friendly towards personnel. SCP-3425 is obsessed with metalworking and metals (especially those presented in simplistic shapes). When faced with a lack of resources, SCP-3425 becomes distressed and attempts to get the attention of nearby researchers. If it is not exposed to resources for an extended period of time, SCP-3425 often resorts to self-sacrificing measures to obtain metal.</p>
<p>SCP-3425 has shown the ability to manipulate metallic materials on the molecular scale, accomplishing feats that would normally be impossible with a given material. SCP-3425 uses this anomalous property to create devices and trinkets, often working for hours or even days without end before it finishes a creation.</p>

<p><em>On ██/██/2015, SCP-3425 displayed a drastic change in behavior over the course of 24 hours. Security footage of the incident was reviewed following the discovery of the incident. The following is a transcript of the Incident 3425-A footage.</em></p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>&lt;01:45:05&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 stands motionless in the center of its chamber. The room is dark, save for a single light on the roof of SCP-3425's chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;01:47:22&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 breaks sedentary behavior and begins to pace around the perimeter of its chamber. SCP-3425 appears distressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:05:51&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 begins pounding on the walls of its chamber. It seems that by doing this, SCP-3425 sought to attract the attention of Foundation personnel.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;03:24:12&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 begins pacing again, occasionally stopping to pound on the walls of its chamber. Its motions grow quicker and shakier as time progresses.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;05:44:13&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 stops moving and collapses on the floor, with its arms and legs lying at disjointed positions. It remains in this state, motionless.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;08:09:23&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 resumes motion and begins to right itself. After righting itself, it moves to the center of the chamber and looks at the camera for a brief moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;08:25:36&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 raises its left arm, ignites the blowtorch on it, and begins staring at it.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;08:57:32&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 extends its right arm outwards and moves the blowtorch towards its arm. A shrill metallic noise is heard and a shower of sparks is emitted as the blowtorch cuts through.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:02:21&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425's arm breaks off from its body and falls to the ground. A loud thud is heard as the arm hits the bottom of the chamber. SCP-3425 stares at the socket where its arm once was.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:23:33&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 kneels down towards the arm and begins cutting the arm's remaining clothing away.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;09:29:42&gt;</strong> <em>All clothing is now removed, revealing a rusty robotic appendage. SCP-3425 moves so that its body is obscuring the camera, and begins to re-shape the arm. SCP-3425 is notably less efficient in its technique.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;15:02:01&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 finishes working on the arm and moves away from the resulting objects.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;15:04:11&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-3425 resumes sedentary behavior.</em></p>
<p>[END OF LOG]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following Incident 3425-A, SCP-3425's containment procedures were updated to accommodate its new behavior. Monitoring was increased to hourly checks as opposed to daily, and SCP-3425 was to be exposed to metal weekly, instead of only for testing. The socket which formerly contained SCP-3425's arm was studied, leading to the discovery of a small nuclear reactor at the center of SCP-3425. The reactor does not appear to be dangerous, and is only used as a means of powering SCP-3425.</p>
<p>The objects created from SCP-3425's arm were as follows:<br/>
-One iron canteen, believed to be constructed from the hand. Object was very rusty.<br/>
-Ten iron horseshoes, believed to be constructed from the lower arm. Objects showed numerous shape irregularities.<br/>
-One iron vase, believed to be constructed from the upper arm. Object contained traces of radiation.</p>
