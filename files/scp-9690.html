<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(229, 214,157)">Special Containment Procedures:</span></strong></p>
<p>Once per vicennial period, SCP-9690 will be granted a new public identity. Any pending works from a previous identity are to be released posthumously. All media coverage of a previous identity must cease after a maximum of five years after discontinuation.</p>
<p>When touring Foundation facilities, SCP-9690 must be accompanied by one member of staff when not in active containment.</p>
<p>The conditions outlined in SCP-9690’s contract with Dr. D. Faron<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>dictate that any use of SCP-9690’s anomalous capabilities as medical treatment must be approved by Dr. Faron directly.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(229, 214,157)">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>SCP-9690 is a humanoid male of undetermined origin. Prior to Foundation capture, he was employed as a performer in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>• Exaggerated traits of albinism, causing SCP-9690 to present with a solid-white skin tone and a crimson hair colour.<br/>
• A preference towards high fashion and extravagant clothing.<br/>
• A Transatlantic accent with abnormal speech patterns.</p>
<p>SCP-9690 exhibits a low-level cognitohazardous effect, targeting the hippocampus and neocortex regions of the brain. Acute exposure to SCP-9690 through any medium is associated with improved cognitive performance and memory. Individuals exposed to this effect will forget about SCP-9690 one-week post-exposure. Any memories unrelated to SCP-9690's person are unaffected.</p>
<p>Chronic exposure appears to lessen the effects, allowing an individual to retain their memory of SCP-9690 for longer than one week. This has not been studied to the same extent as acute exposure, and is not confirmed as fact.</p>
<p>Project Mnemosyne is being conducted by Dr. D. Faron, to determine how the anomalous traits of SCP-9690 can be used to improve the general memory and cognitive ability of humans.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12/02/24</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> Dr. D. Faron</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-9690</p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Any audio recordings made by SCP-9690 have been attached to their relevant place within this document. Most recordings were made after the fact, and have been catalogued as insights into SCP-9690's emotional state.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron enters SCP-9690’s containment cell. The area has been decorated with Art Nouveau furniture from the early 1900s, a bar with several types of spirits, and a large fireplace at the back wall of the room.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 is lying across a chaise lounge in the centre of the room, nursing a glass of wine.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> A little young to be a doctor, are you not?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 stands from his chaise lounge and offers a handshake to Dr. Faron.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I’m only winding you up. I’m Kyrie, cher<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron accepts the handshake with a slight pause and a smile. He places a project file down on the tea table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Thank you kindly, uh, Kyrie… My name is Demi, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> It’s a pleasure to meet, Demi.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Do you mind if I have a seat? I'd be cheeky and reach for the kettle, but I haven't got much time today, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Be my guest, bon monsieur<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. We can get to know each other better another time.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 lies back down, and gestures to an ornate armchair opposite him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Your colleagues must love you though, surely.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Colleagues being the key word…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron sits down opposite SCP-9690, looking at a row of albums made by SCP-9690 and smiling warmly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I remember seeing one of your shows a few years ago in London. It was so beautiful, even my wallet was happy afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Hopefully it was worth it. I do aspire to leave an impression, and a pleasant one at that. A few human rights violations are all I receive in return…</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 begins writing in his notebook. The pen tears through the paper at times.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Yeah, I uhm… understand coming here isn't a pleasant experience, but there could be something wrong with you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 has another sip of wine, his expression subduing into a frown.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Are you insinuating that I'm ill?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron stares past SCP-9690 for a few seconds, jolting slightly as his attention comes back to the conversation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> No! Of course not, it's just that—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> In that case you won't mind me leaving, right doctor? You don't need a patient that hasn't got a problem.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 attempts to stand up, but Dr. Faron ushers him back into the seat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Easy there, Kyrie, you can't leave yet. You have got a problem, it's just… not a typical one, so you’re staying.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 gently nudges Dr. Faron’s hand away, before dusting off his shirt and sighing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> From where I'm sitting the only problem we have between us is you keeping me away from work.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 looks around, focusing on sheet music, albums, and his notebook.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron frowns softly and sits up straight, leaning towards SCP-9690.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> It's right to be upset, being in captivity, but we can work together.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> In what way? If you wanted a backstage pass, you only needed to ask.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron raises his eyebrows for a few seconds, before giving an open palm gesture towards SCP-9690.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Should we do it business or casual?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 cocks an eyebrow for a moment, then relaxes into his seat, having a sip of his wine.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You were in a rush, last I checked. Business for tonight only, doctor.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron leans back into his chair and sighs, cupping his hands over his face to mask a grin. His shoulders ease up and his posture softens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I’ll cut it dry for you then. I could really benefit from someone of your abilit— talents, for a project of mine. If we harnessed your talents, I'm sure we could get you a stage anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> What would you like in return for a “yes”?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> A better wine wouldn’t do harm.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Be serious, answer the question.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 stares at the fireplace for several moments, bringing his hands together and rubbing circles on the inside of his wrist.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I only want an audience… Even just an audience of one?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Deal.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 sits up and shakes Dr. Faron’s hand with both of his own, offering an uneasy smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Thank you…</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 19/02/24</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> Director Louis Valencia, Dr. Demi Faron</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron enters Director Valencia’s office and places a large folder onto his desk. Several similar folders are stuffed into a drawer behind Director Valencia.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Faron… it's like clockwork with this damn project.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia rubs his temples for a few seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> So, what's it going to be this time?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> With SCP-9690, we could distribute the treatment without anyone knowing they’re being treated.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Using the singer? That’s what your newest attempt is?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> My most recent idea revolves around him, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Christ, Demi he's been here for all of seven days. I only assigned you this morning.</p>
<p><em>Both men pause for a second, before Director Valencia checks the date.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Please don't tell me you came up with this in the couple minutes it takes to get from his cell to my office.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Are you still not understanding how much better society could be with sharper minds?</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> It's easy to understand. Where me and you run into problems, however, is when we start talking about why you can't achieve that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> And every time I get a bullshit answer about nature or ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Our goal within the Foundation is to preserve nature. To maintain normalcy, and use our resources for those goals alone. Tampering with nature using anomalies is, and always will be, an awful idea.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Alright, then look, if not the global population, then why not just the Foundation? Tell me a downside to smarter research staff, or sharper task force units, or even just more organized janitors.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> There isn’t one in that perfect scenario you keep imagining.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron leans forward and clasps his hands together tightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Do you know how fragile of a thing memory is? You’ve got kids, what if you forgot them tomorrow? It’s not likely to happen, but you’d be in pieces if it did. I can change that—stop that from happening to people!</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> They say a war against nature is inevitably a war against yourself.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia cups his hands on the desk and softens his tone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Using an anomaly as a catalyst for your project, regardless of whether or not it's suited for the task, it's just… it isn't safe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> And that’s a risk that I’m consenting to! So what if Kyrie’s anomalous? We have no issues wiping people’s memory, but when you want to help some poor old woman with dementia, or a veteran with Alzheimer’s, suddenly we’re tampering with the ‘natural’ balance too much—</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia clenches his hands together on the desk and glares at Dr. Faron.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Demi, listen to me without arguing, this one time. You don’t know what he wants from you, we don’t know the extent of his anomalous nature, and I am not entertaining this conversation. Project Mnemosyne is not going any further, and if I find out about you continuing your research, you're going straight to a disciplinary.</p>

<p><em>SCP-9690 is sat at a piano, having played consistently for 10 minutes prior to Dr. Faron’s arrival. The fireplace is the only source of light in the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Enjoying yourself there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Oh, it’s magnificent, cher! Bless you, really!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron sets up a blood draw kit beside the chaise lounge.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> You’re still happy to do some tests? Maybe continue our chat from before while we’re at it?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 plays a key out of scale by mistake.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Uhm, yes, yes of course. Just another minute of playing first… Sit and enjoy before you get any ideas about pricking me, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> No problem.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron sits down on the armchair present beside the chaise lounge, watching SCP-9690’s fingers glide over the keys and listening to the harmonies being played.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Y’know, I might not be as good as you with the arts, but I do pretty well with the violin.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> What? You should’ve brought one! We could’ve played a duet together.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Too much work to do, unfortunately, but I’m sure I’ll find the time for it someday.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Oh, but I know such a beautiful piece for the piano and violin! Of course, it’s a bit modern for my taste, it released in 2013, but you would love the experience…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Very clever, now come on. Up you get.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 moves away from the piano and dramatically faints onto the chaise lounge, extending his left arm to Dr. Faron.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Your lack of enthusiasm wounds me, Demi. Perhaps more than your instrument of misery will.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Needles scare you that bad?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Well, they say that the average person has 7 true fears. I’ve known you a week and you’ve discovered one already. Gold star for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Hopefully the next one isn’t blood. Why don’t you tell me more about your past?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron checks his watch briefly, then smiles at SCP-9690 reassuringly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I could bring myself to tell a little about the golden age, whilst you make an attempt on my life to make sure I've been getting my five-a-day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> You’ve lived through a couple golden ages. You’re a very vintage… well, human.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> The golden age of radio, Piqûre effrontée<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron takes SCP-9690’s wrist and wipes it with a sterile wipe.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 kicks up in his seat and looks around the room with a slight frown.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> To set a scene, it was 1927, and I was a young star, not yet signed, making a lowly experience as a radio drama host on the evening broadcasts. Every night I would read different stories to the listeners, working through a novel over the week and doing one-offs on the weekends. Things got to a point where I started sleeping in the studio, practicing every waking hour and dreaming of the results when I slept.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Sounds a bit pedestrian, compared to how you like to live now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 turns his head away from Dr. Faron and rests his cheek in his free hand while scoffing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Eventually after countless nights slaving away for public entertainment, I was offered a deal with one of the bigger corporations in the entertainment industry. Noct— uhm, a corporation signed me on the 19th of June 1927, and from that day on my nightly broadcasts became a sensation, sweeping the airwaves and solidifying my position in the industry.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> On the condition that I kept up the pace… The passing of time doesn't do favours, though.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron leaves the needle inserted into SCP-9690’s arm, jotting down some notes on his pad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Where did you find the time to eat during this schedule? Socialize? Even just resting, for that matter.</p>
<p><em>Both SCP-9690 and Dr. Faron glance over at some makeup on SCP-9690's table before looking back at each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> People started to recognize me in the local café, lounge players tried to imitate my voice, and anywhere I went I was the bee’s knees. I had an appetite for legacy, not Coq au Vin<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I had gathered as much, Kyrie.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Mm. Things grew sour, however, when my listeners started to tune in to other shows, and people stopped greeting me in person. At first, I thought I was just in a dry spell, and that it would wither away with time… I’m stuck here with you now, so it did not. I found other jobs over the years, but the world just kept turning regardless.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 rests his chin in his hand and looks out of the window at the stars.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> It’s been a never-ending performance ever since.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron takes the blood samples and places them inside of his bag. He stares at his hands for a few seconds before looking back at SCP-9690 and smiling warmly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> That was an interesting story, Kyrie. I’d love to hear the rest of that song, if you don't mind finishing it?</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Another time, cher… but thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>One of the projects I’m working on has led me on a bit of a trail with a company, but I've only got a partial name “Noct”, and I’m having trouble finding any information about them. The best I’ve got is that they were operating around the 1920s, and had a strong foothold in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Any information you could provide would be tremendously helpful for my investigations.</p>
Thank you.</div>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 15/11/24</p>
<p><strong>Staff:</strong> Dr. Demi Faron</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-9690</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron enters SCP-9690’s room, holding a large parka jacket and a thermos. He places both on the table beside SCP-9690.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I bring gifts, assuming you want company today.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> That’s to be decided, I’m particular about my coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I don’t know if it’s your favourite, but it’s expensive.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You’re a dear.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 takes the drink and sips it slowly, relaxing his slouched posture soon after.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I brought the coat in case you wanted a walk through the gardens.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> A walk? Alright then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> As you wish your majesty.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 rolls his eyes a bit, before both men exit the room and walk towards the site gardens.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I really did mean it, you know. ‘The audience of one’ bit?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I never doubted it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Don’t leave me out in the cold, Demi.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I gave you a coat! There’s nothing cold about you.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I’m serious though, if you want to have that kind of talk, then I’ll listen.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron and SCP-9690 enter the facility gardens. Dr. Faron guides them both to a bench, ushering SCP-9690 down in front of a large fountain and flower display.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 cocks an eyebrow at the flower display and leans towards them, resting his elbow in one hand and his chin in the other.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> These are lovely! You'd make an excellent florist.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I don’t want you bored while we have our conversation, so please, enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Merci, cher.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 sits quietly for a few minutes, admiring the flower display and fiddling with the fur of his coat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> May I… tell you a little more about my past? I'm sorry, but… I wasn't entirely forthcoming in our last conversation about this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Please, go right ahead. Tonight’s all about you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 readjusts his position on the bench, leaning back into the support with a sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Like any half-decent story, there’s a question or idea that’s raised that eventually needs an answer or conclusion. For this story, that idea is “be careful what you wish for.” A wish and a need aren’t the same, and though this story was so long ago… I haven't told it until today.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron turns to face SCP-9690 and pays rapt attention to him.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 takes a deep breath and squeezes his hands together.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Looking at it in hindsight, knowing some of the strangeness that exists in this world now, I think my contract was shady. Ever since signing, it's like every time I'm mentioned, people's minds switch to a dead channel.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> We can help you, Kyrie. I can help you, no matter what Valencia says, or however difficult it'll be.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron puts a hand on SCP-9690’s back and rubs above his shoulder blades in the same pattern as the constellations above.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Be honest with me, Cher… Do you actually think you could help? I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s just…</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 wipes at his eyes with the back of his hand, taking down the remainder of his wine in a single gulp.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I can't delude myself into thinking you can help, if there’s a chance you can’t.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I swear, Kyrie. I will not let you down.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 tenses up, before looking down and bringing a shaky arm around Dr. Faron's shoulders. They remain in this state for several moments.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Thank you, Demi.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> You’re welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Date of Recording:</strong> 13/03/1915</p>
<p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 03/12/24</p>
<p><strong>Group of Interest:</strong> GoI-739 "Nocturne &amp; Cipher"</p>
<p><strong>Case Number:</strong> 10-192-017</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nocturne &amp; Cipher were a front organization operating in the entertainment industry, funded by unknown investors from the early 1910s—1927. Their business practices revolved around entrapping artists and performers in agreements that were ironic or paradoxical in nature.</p>
<p>The proposed benefits of these agreements were often honoured for a set period of time, before support from Nocturne &amp; Cipher was ceased, and artists became stuck in a cycle fuelled by their intentions at the time of signing.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown if contracts with Nocturne &amp; Cipher may be voided, as few reports have been verified since their discovery, and no new reports have been filed since 1927.</p>
<p>A tagline from 1926 was recovered from a radio broadcast:</p>
<p>“Make Your Wish! We’ll Be Waiting.”</p>

<p><em>SCP-9690 and Dr. Faron walk into the meeting room, followed by two members of site security.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> A little young to be in charge of a place like this, are you not?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Kyrie…</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Flattery doesn't get you favours.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 retracts his hand and folds his arms.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron and SCP-9690 sit at the table. Director Valencia clasps his hands and leans forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Well? Anything to say?</p>
<p><em>Several seconds pass by without comment from SCP-9690 or Dr. Faron.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> In that case we'll proceed with the disciplinary hearing.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron looks around the room a bit, before shrugging his shoulders.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 begins rubbing the inside of his wrist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Is this about me nicking your space in the car park last week? It was hammering down with rain and my space is on the other side of the building, I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Don't bullshit me, I've known since that damn blood test.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron's posture stiffens.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Demi? What's he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> It's nothing, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You've been honest with me about those tests, right?</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Right?</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I said those tests were routine medical tests. Which they were… they just weren't testing what you thought.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 gawks at Dr. Faron and shoots up from his chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You lied? How dare you lie to me you… bastard!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron tenses his jaw and looks at SCP-9690 directly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> So what, you're above a bit of lying now? You, really?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> And what's that supposed to mean you prick?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I've seen those damn notes of yours—</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 balls his fist, but Director Valencia gestures for him to sit back down.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron folds his arms and stares at Director Valencia, eyebrow raised.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Silent now? Alright.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia maintains eye contact and points to Dr. Faron's personal phone records.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> You were going to make that call to RAISA from you work phone, but tried it from your own instead.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia presents Dr. Faron's work emails between himself and RAISA.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Then, when you realized that you can't get through to them from an unofficial number, you emailed them and tried keeping it vague so I wouldn't notice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I was only informing another department of a discovery, just in case they needed to know about it…</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Asking questions is a curious way of 'informing' them. Have some professionalism for god's sake and admit it.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron leans back in his chair and sighs, clasping his hands in his lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> You've been conducting this investigation without approval, and as a matter of fact, you've been doing them with my direct disapproval.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I chose to interpret your instructions as "don't do anything that uses my project". If I'm only researching, I don't see how I've done any harm.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia sighs and squeezes his hands together tightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> All that's happened so far is you've been suspended.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron's eyes narrow as he sits up in his chair.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 starts digging his nails into his wrists and looking at the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> What's going to happen next, is he's going back to containment, and you two aren't doing this crabs in a bucket shit any longer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Why are you punishing him for something that's my fault?</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> He's the second half of the problem! Just like every other time a 'key' came along for this pointless mission of yours, Faron, you get so obsessed you ignore any consequences! The department as a whole is sick of your shit, and don't say I gave you no chances to change.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 opens his mouth to speak, but begins to tear up instead.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Be grateful the committee doesn't know you ahead of time.</p>
<p><em>Director Valencia ignores them as both men are escorted out of the room.</em></p>

<p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br/>
For as long as I have known<br/>
There's been a hollow in my bones<br/>
A hunger to be seen<br/>
And I'm a wonder to behold<br/>
And so I blow up, glow up, wear my boots and jewels<br/>
And all my make up, take up, all the space I can<br/>
and then the crowd…<br/>
Goes…<br/>
Wild…</p>
<p>But no matter how I try<br/>
Curtain falls, sun will rise<br/>
Nothing stays… and I can't find a remedy<br/>
Know my face know my name give me fame<br/>
Give me legacy…<br/>
I need you fuckers to remember me</p>
<p><strong>[Chorus 1]</strong><br/>
The night will turn to day!<br/>
The crowd will pull away!<br/>
And I never seem to learn…<br/>
I lose everything I've earned!<br/>
As the world turns</p>
<p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br/>
Then they shuttered all my shows<br/>
Took my name and I'm a ghost<br/>
Buried in a hole, spinning out alone<br/>
But you came onto the scene<br/>
Mon ravisseur, mon ami<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup><br/>
And like the moon reflects the sun<br/>
My audience of one…<br/>
Was enough</p>
<p>But no matter how I try<br/>
Curtain falls, sun will rise<br/>
Nothing stays… and still there is no remedy<br/>
Know my face know my name give me fame<br/>
Give me legacy…<br/>
I just want you to remember me</p>
<p><strong>[Chorus 2]</strong><br/>
The night will turn to day!<br/>
I'll see you pull away!<br/>
You won't even say my name!<br/>
I can't leave a bridge unburned…<br/>
As the world turns</p>
<p><strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br/>
Gave you my blood, you gave me your time<br/>
I let you dig inside my mind<br/>
Was I your project, just an object to be processed with the contents out of context?<br/>
A career play, to brighten up your prospects?<br/>
Me or your work, I lose: no contest<br/>
We had fun but you had bigger fish to fry<br/>
Well name a bigger fish than I<br/>
I acted out, sulk and pout, piss and shout, you filled my cup and I poured it out!<br/>
I made a show, I took a stand, I played the fool, I was a cad, and then I<br/>
fucked up the only good thing that I had!<br/>
And it's done…</p>
<p>I'm sitting here alone<br/>
What is the sun… without a moon to glow<br/>
I guess I<br/>
Could do more than I've done<br/>
I could try<br/>
Complete what you've begun<br/>
If I could<br/>
Play the second fiddle to your dreams<br/>
Would we be in harmony?</p>
<p><strong>[Chorus 3]</strong><br/>
The night will turn to day!<br/>
Back at your feet I lay!<br/>
Here's a different song to sing!<br/>
I will find a way to earn…<br/>
Your love that I had only spurned…<br/>
As the world turns</p>

<p>SCP-9690 was seen later the same day tearing a page from his notebook, and sliding it under the cell door when Dr. Faron passed through the area. At the time, Foundation staff couldn't identify or seek clarification as to what information was exchanged, as Dr. Faron was suspended the following day, and SCP-9690 refused to provide further information.</p>
<p>This note was later suspected to contain personal information, such as SCP-9690's home address prior to containment. Information that the Foundation previously had trouble discovering, due to the anomalous effects of SCP-9690.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 13/02/25</p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Having my clearance level restricted, and by extension losing my powers at work, I’ve had to get creative with my investigation. Kyrie gave me a note with an address on it, but didn't enlighten me as to what I'm here to find or do. He also neglected to tell me where he keeps the spare key…</p>
<p>And I guess being fired isn't much of a concern now, may as well go for it.</p>
<p>Kyrie, if you read this, I promise I’ll buy you a new front door. And maybe also some wine, assuming you don’t take the bottle upside my head.</p>
<p>- Demi</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>The beginning of this log was cut for brevity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Fuck, kicking doors in is harder than it looks on those crime shows.</p>
<p><em>The exterior of Kyrie’s home is reminiscent of a French Chateau, built two stories high out in the countryside of… I better not leak his address. Anyway, the walls are made of a polished and sleek limestone, with large pillars supporting the ceiling and an intricate carved design in the oak door. Which is hanging off the hinges, currently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Well, I’ll give it to you Ky, it’s a nice place…</p>
<p><em>The main hall is adorned with various bits of memorabilia from what I assume are Kyrie’s past personas. A tailored black and crimson suit from his first radio broadcast, an electric guitar which I guess was from his first attempt at being a rockstar, and naturally a Bechstein piano front and centre for the skylight to shine on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Now just to find where you keep your less flashy stuff.</p>
<p><em>Going through the hall and into the main set of corridors, I eventually find my way to the basement. There’s nothing particularly special, it just looks like a basement, with maybe a catacombs style mood to it.</em></p>
<p><em>Inside his basement there’s a set of boxes tucked away in the back, holding old diaries, song lyrics, sheet music and one particular document of interest. A contract, with the Nocturne &amp; Cipher insignia stamped on in very shiny ink.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Finally…</p>
<p><em>Five minutes of looking at legal terms on my phone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Useless legal jargon… Couple fancy signatures… Oh here we are. “To the beneficiary who signs on the dot, their legacy shall be long remembered, so long as they cannot.”</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Really, Ky? You fell for that? It’s like something out of a fairytale for god’s sake. Maybe I did put too much stock in him, actually.</p>
<p><em>I place the contract and all the other evidence relating to Nocturne &amp; Cipher into my bag and head back upstairs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Oh well, mission accomplished.</p>
<p><em>I look over at the obliterated front door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> I should get that fixed though.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Both of you, please, just listen to me. I’m not here to fight either of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You’ve certainly changed your tune by a couple keys then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Kyrie, I am really sorry about what happened between us before. That was wrong of me, and I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You’re sorry? Do sorry people deface the homes of those they apologize to? Is that an apology in your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I know, going through your home without permission and… ransacking your basement wasn’t great, but it got me somewhere. I’ve looked into Nocturne and Cipher, and into your contract. That business went bust way back in the 70’s, and because of the terms binding you, we can void your contract. You could be free again.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 raises his eyebrow and huffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> He’s not, for whatever my opinion on the matter is worth to you.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron rubs the back of his neck and clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> The legal department believes that you’d have to give up on the thing that you signed for. You could be remembered by anyone, but you wouldn’t get the legacy you hoped of, either.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Oh so there it is, the catch, the dagger beneath the cloak…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I really do appreciate that it’s asking you to abandon your life’s work, but it’s the best I’ve got at the moment.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 lunges forward and glares at Dr. Faron. Dr. Faron doesn't move.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Your best isn’t enough, Demi! You can’t just fucking ask that!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron hesitantly reaches out for SCP-9690, but retracts it when SCP-9690 begins to tear up.</em></p>
<p>[Several seconds pass quietly.]</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> We’ll move on to the next segment then.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron looks down at the floor for a few seconds while running his hand through his hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> We can… attempt to do something else.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> Attempt what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> The Foundation has their own nomology team in the legal department, and if you were open to it… we could draft up a contract. You could sign, and we would do all we can to be fair.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> I’d completely understand if you wanted to be done with all this and just… go live your life.</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> To put it simply for you, Kyrie, you either keep your anomalous trait and stay at the Foundation with Demi, or we free you from your anomalous contract. If you were free, however, we would have to erase your memories of the past, and of Demi.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 cups his hands over his face and leans forward in his seat, tensing up and hyperventilating.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron places his hand on SCP-9690's shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> If you agree to stay, I promise I will do all I can to make it worth it, and fair on you. You don't need to choose right this second.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> You would let me choose? Without anything shady?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Faron:</strong> Yes, I would. You’re the top priority.</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Director Valencia:</strong> Or, you can stick with your current contract, and the world keeps turning.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9690 silently cries for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9690:</strong> I don’t know… I just— I need time! Time to uhm, think…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Faron nods softly and stands up with SCP-9690, preparing to take him back to the containment area.</em></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27/03/25</p>
<p><strong>Personnel:</strong> Dr. Demi Faron, Kyrie Morningstar</p>

<hr/>
<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>
<p><em>Kyrie leads Demi into the main hall of his home, where various bits and pieces of his past stage personas are on display.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Are you just going to stand there and ogle my belongings, or can I get some attention too? I got dressed up for you, you know, and if I’m correct… this isn’t your first visit.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Just appreciating the history. You’ve lived a hundred lives, and with all this lying about I might as well have a look-see. You’re certainly showing your true colours though, first night together outside of the site, and you’re twice as sassy already.</p>
<p><em>Demi walks over to a pile of boxes in the corner with strips of black leather and the point of some heels sticking out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> What’s in this one? The one marked ‘Absolutely Not’ in pink highlighter?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> That would be the outfits from my 2004 tour of America. We do not speak of them, and guests certainly don’t look at them—</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Noted. And this one? ‘We Made You”?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> It’s all just old memorabilia from shows, tours, my radio days… Some things never made it onto the album, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Is the violin real?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Of course it is, Demi. It's a Stradivarius, as a matter of fact. And come to think of that too, someone promised me a solo.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie turns away from the kitchen and gestures towards the violin while raising an eyebrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> You mean you promised yourself that I’d do that?</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> After dinner, star.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I’m holding you to it.</p>
<p><em>Demi and Kyrie walk into the kitchen. Bell peppers, onions, garlic, chicken, andouille sausage and several other ingredients are placed neatly over the kitchen island.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> So, what are we having, beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I—it’s jambalaya! Very rustic, and uhm… it’s very civilian.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Nothing wrong with comfort food, Kyrie. You could incinerate it, and it’d be leagues above the cafeteria food at work.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Uhm… do you promise? If I’m being honest, it’s been a few decades since I last cooked for someone, and it’s got me a bit nervous.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie picks up a knife and begins preparing the vegetables meticulously. Demi sits down at the kitchen table and watches.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Don’t worry about this lovely home cooked meal being your culinary master class. My eyes aren’t even on the food anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Ah—Well that’s lovely, I’m certainly uhm… thank you.</p>
<p><em>Demi stands up, pours some oil into the pan and turns the heat on, gracing his hand over Kyrie’s back as he steps beside him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Really, star, relax. Do you want me to help out or just keep watching?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Go put on some music or something, please. Your lack of shame keeps taking me away from my knife skills.</p>
<p><em>Demi steps out of the kitchen and plays one of the vinyl records from Kyrie’s collection.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Spends months vying for my attention, finally gets it, too shy to handle all of this—</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I heard that, espèce de salaud effronté!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> All you heard was your beautiful piano playing and that skillet.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie chucks the vegetables into the pan with a huff.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> This is the piece you played when you first got your piano at the site. Is this your favourite or something?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I made it during a particularly lonely time back in the 90’s… It’s not the flashiest thing I’ve ever done, but something about it draws me in and keeps everything else out.</p>
<p><em>He stirs the vegetables with repetitive flicks of his wrist and movements of the pan, looking off out the window.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Oh, so you were trying to get me to leave you alone.</p>
<p><em>Demi returns to the kitchen, smirks, and places his hand on Kyrie’s lower back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> You are… absolutely impossible.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie washes the rice and puts it into the pot with some crushed tomatoes and chicken stock.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> For one of these nifty “one-pot” meals, it’s easy to burn things.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> To be fair, handsome, you’d do better if you were looking at the pot.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie pauses his stirring, his shoulders slumping just a bit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I’m not used to being this… domestic, so I’m staring at the birds instead of the hawk gawking at me.</p>
<p><em>Demi leans forward and stands behind Kyrie, and wraps his arms around his waist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> I’m not watching you because I think you’ll fail, or you aren’t performing well enough. I'm watching because, after months of reports and sterile rooms, fighting with a shitbag of a boss, I finally get to see you. All those other times I got Kyrie the idol, the star. Now I get Kyrie, and some space to breathe and enjoy him.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie is silent for a few moments, leaning back into Demi’s chest. He takes a breath and adds the sausage back to the pot, putting a lid on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Well… the star would like some wine, and I’d like to continue the hug. Dinner needs to simmer for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Then we’ll have a drink and relax on the couch.</p>
<p><em>Demi guides Kyrie down onto the couch in the living room, then steps out to the kitchen to pour some drinks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I promise I only keep good wine.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> There were never any doubts. I knew from the start you liked a bit of spoiling.</p>
<p><em>Demi comes back into the room with two glasses of wine and places them on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> If it’s alright with you, I’d like to… chat about everything. That’s happened lately, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> I suppose that’s fine, though I’m not excited for it.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie takes a large gulp of his drink, blinking a few times after.</em></p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> That’s understandable. But let me start out by saying that I’m sorry. I’m really, sorry. The way I spoke to you before all that drama with Louis wasn’t acceptable, and I swear to you I won’t take that tone on again.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Your apology is accepted. I pushed at you at a vulnerable time, and I didn’t give you the effort you were putting in, so please don’t feel as if any of this is only on you.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> I’m not upset about that anymore, Ky. I just wanted this… out, so we can move on without anything itching at us, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Of course, no one wants any baggage, as they say.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Brilliant, we agree then.</p>
<p><em>Demi has a sip of his wine and runs a hand over Kyrie’s hair playfully.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Now about my door.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> Okay that I think I’m justified in. Me tactically acquiring your contract saved our arses, and I fixed the door! Both necessary evils.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Oh, pour l'amour de tout ce qui est sacré,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>what am I going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> I’ll make a point to learn French if I’m going to date you, thank you for the reminder my darling.</p>
<p><em>Kyrie props his head up in his palm, lying down on his side with his other hand on his hip after briefly flipping Demi the bird.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> What do couples usually do in the downtime, Cher?</p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> We could watch some of your old works while we wait for dinner?</p>
<p><em>Kyrie rolls over and slumps into the couch, closing his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kyrie:</strong> Oh for… Close the curtains, Demi.</p>
<p><strong>Demi:</strong> It’s been a long time coming, star. I’ll wake you up when dinner’s done.</p>
