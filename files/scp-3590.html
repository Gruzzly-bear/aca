<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All physical documents referring and/or describing the execution of SCP-3590 are to be kept in standard containment locker SCL27/3590, currently located at Safe class containment wing of Site-27. There are no on-going research projects dedicated to the analysis of SCP-3590 and requests regarding its study should be submitted to Site-27 administration through appropriate channels (see Form SCP-3590/R, embedded).</p>
<p>All personnel previously involved in the execution of SCP-3590 have received appropriate amnestic treatment. Knowledge of SCP-3590 is considered nonexistent outside of Foundation databases, but reports pertaining to similar phenomena will be monitored to gauge the possibility of containment breach.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3590 is a ceremony which, when correctly performed, will render one of the participants, henceforth referred to as SCP-3590-1, completely mute. No physiological changes are observed upon analysis of SCP-3590-1 and the process by which the participant is rendered unable to speak is not currently understood. No means to reverse the process are currently known.</p>
<p>SCP-3590 bears similarities to several rituals commonly pertaining to major Abrahamic faiths, although it cannot be accurately attributed to any of them, considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconography employed is contradictory and pertains to entirely different doctrines.</li>
<li>Spoken verses cannot be traced to any known religious texts.</li>
<li>Spoken verses are incoherent and convey no obvious meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-3590 requires three participants, each being assigned different roles. Participants assigned the tasks of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] display no anomalous properties before, during or after the performance of SCP-3590. The participant assigned with [REDACTED] invariably becomes an instance of SCP-3590-1, as observed in all recorded experiments following Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A.</p>
<p>SCP-3590 was formerly a major component of the Special Containment Procedures for SCP-GAMMA (original designation ''Procedure GAMMA-Cezar''), displaying no anomalous properties when performed either by non-anomalous participants or other Class I Reality Bending entities besides SCP-GAMMA. Before Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A, the ceremony had been successful at completely suppressing any anomaly originating from SCP-GAMMA during long intervals, and was performed routinely at the entity's request and/or according to necessity to prevent consistent, if mild damage to containment cell of SCP-GAMMA.</p>
<p>No known data exists regarding how SCP-GAMMA came to be in Foundation custody. It is also unclear how the knowledge of SCP-3590 and its application as an effective counter-measure to SCP-GAMMA were discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A</strong></p>
<p>On ██/██/████, during a scheduled performance of Procedure GAMMA-Cezar, as part of the containment procedures for SCP-GAMMA, a previously undocumented behavior of the anomaly associated with SCP-GAMMA resulted in its neutralization, the temporary breach of SCP-DELTA's containment and the death of two members of Site-27 D class personnel. It is currently unknown whether or not SCP-3590 was a factor in any of the events observed during Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A. Authorized personnel may request a full report of the incident should the containment of SCP-DELTA become a concern.</p>
<p>Follow-up experiments identified the now anomalous results of Procedure GAMMA-Cezar, warranting its re-designation as SCP-3590.</p>

<p><strong>Report: Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-GAMMA, along with two D Class personnel, had almost finished performing SCP-3590, after 27 minutes elapsed since the start of the ceremony. D27-382 and D27-876 had successfully performed SCP-3590 along with SCP-GAMMA ██ times before the incident. Research team assigned to SCP-GAMMA at the time oversees the procedure via CCTV. Events transpire inside the now decommissioned IRBE27/GAMMA containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:18&gt;</strong> D27-382 blows the fifth candle, thus finishing his role in SCP-3590.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:19&gt;</strong> D27-876 approaches SCP-GAMMA, placing the third crucifix around its neck.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:19&gt;</strong> Last chants are sung in unison by D27-876 and SCP-GAMMA.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:20&gt;</strong> SCP-3590 concluded. Research team confirms recession on the Scranton scale. SCP-GAMMA seem relieved and proceeds to thank D27-876 and D27-382, whom it addresses by name. Behavior in line with previous observation.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:22&gt;</strong> D27-876 and D27-382 finish collecting materials used in SCP-3590, as instructed by Research team. No consumables left.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:23&gt;</strong> D27-876, D27-382 and SCP-GAMMA make casual conversation while exit quarantine protocols are lifted.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:25&gt;</strong> Confirmed malfunction of IRBE27/GAMMA's entrance. Tech team dispatched to access the problem. D27-876 and D27-382 instructed to await their arrival.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:28&gt;</strong> Sharp increase on the Scranton scale. Source unknown, presumably SCP-GAMMA, though the entity continues to converse with D Class personnel. No visible changes inside containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:28&gt;</strong> Quarantine protocols automatically reestablished. Tech team ordered to await further instructions. D27-876, D27-382 and SCP-GAMMA seem confused over the development and are told to remain calm while the Research team deals with what appears to be an equipment failure.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:30&gt;</strong> State-wide warning regarding SCP-DELTA breach of containment issued by Site-29.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:31 to 16:35&gt;</strong> Steady increase on the Scranton scale is matched by elevation of radiation exposure detected in D27-876's and D27-382's implants. Readings of approximately 40 mSv confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:36&gt;</strong> North and south walls of the containment cell undergo severe warping, incompatible with that which a Class I Reality Bending entity should be able to induce given the cell's [REDACTED]. D27-876, D27-382 and SCP-GAMMA are visibly distressed and attempt to escape through containment door, which remains inoperable.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:37 to 16:38&gt;</strong> Formation of a Hartle IV class space-time anomaly inside IRBE27/GAMMA confirmed. Anomaly expands until both its axes measure roughly 1 m.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:38&gt;</strong> SCP-GAMMA coerces D27-876 and D27-382 to perform SCP-3590 again. D Class personnel complies, despite being ordered otherwise by Research team.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:39&gt;</strong> SCP-DELTA begins to emerge through the Hartle IV class anomaly, as four of its appendages become visible in video feedback. SCP-GAMMA is now panicking while it further attempts to coordinate with the equally distressed D Class personnel in order to perform a second rendition of SCP-3590.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:40&gt;</strong> First instance of SCP-DELTA-B, ''Laughter'', is emitted by SCP-DELTA as its head passes through newly-formed space-time anomaly. As well documented, all sounds produced by SCP-DELTA, namely SCP-DELTA-A through SCP-DELTA-E, are considered auditory cognitohazards and receive individual designations. Research team suffers no adverse effects due to previous inoculation; attempt to perform SCP-3590 interrupted, as D27-876 and D27-382 are effected by SCP-DELTA-B and promptly [REDACTED]. SCP-GAMMA is unaffected, but increasingly desperate.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:42&gt;</strong> Request to rescue SCP-GAMMA denied by Site-27 administration on grounds of possible escalation of SCP-DELTA containment breach. SCP-DELTA has now fully emerged though Hartle IV anomaly and continues to emit SCP-DELTA-B at regular intervals. Space-time anomaly remains stable. SCP-GAMMA begs to be released from containment while addressing one of the cell's cameras. Footage review reveals SCP-GAMMA seemingly struggling to vocalize, possibly documenting the first instance of the anomaly associated with SCP-3590.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:43&gt;</strong> SCP-DELTA attacks SCP-GAMMA, while it continues to emit SCP-DELTA-B.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;16:45&gt;</strong> Research team requests immediate deployment of SRAs to aid in re-containment of SCP-DELTA and prevent the expiration of SCP-GAMMA. Denied by Site-27 administration on grounds of [REDACTED]. Standard Class III Reality Bending containment protocols enacted instead.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;19:05&gt;</strong> SCP-DELTA stops emitting SCP-DELTA-B and remains inert after scattering the last remains of SCP-GAMMA throughout the cell. After a few attempts to breach the containment door, SCP-DELTA retreats through the Hartle IV anomaly, which remained stable during the incident.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;19:06&gt;</strong> Hartle IV anomaly recedes.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;19:08&gt;</strong> Site-29 confirms reestablishment of SCP-DELTA containment.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;19:08 to 20:31&gt;</strong> Screams in what resembles SCP-GAMMA's voice continue to be heard through monitoring system, though no source is identifiable.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;20:32&gt;</strong> No anomaly detected inside IRBE27/GAMMA. Quarantine protocols lifted. Recovery teams dispatched to collect relevant materials. IRBE27/GAMMA decommissioned according to previously enacted protocol.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Personnel assigned to SCP-DELTA containment at Site-29 reports the appearance of a Hartle IV space-time anomaly inside SCP-DELTA's containment cell similar to the one described in this report during its breach on ██/██/████ - it is inferred that both anomalies were, thus, connected and facilitated said containment breach, along with the further development of Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A. How these anomalies were formed is not currently known, but studies are underway.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum: Regarding SCP-DELTA.</strong></p>
<p>Noticeable changes in SCP-DELTA behavior were observed preceding and following Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A: Starting on ██/██/████, four days before the breach, the emissions of SCP-DELTA-A, ''Bellowing'' and SCP-DELTA-E, ''Shrieking'', were recorded to sharply increase in frequency compared to other sounds produced by SCP-DELTA. This behavior remained consistent until 14:36, ██/██/████, when Site-29 experienced localized power outages due to yet unexplained equipment failures pertaining to generators [REDACTED]. This incident did not compromise SCP-DELTA's containment, though monitoring of its cell was interrupted while it transpired.</p>
<p>At 14:56, ██/██/████, when power was restored, SCP-DELTA displayed yet another change in behavior, emitting SCP-DELTA-B constantly from that point until its re-containment following Incident GAMMA/DELTA-A. Since re-contained, SCP-DELTA has emitted no sound, except for a single 5 seconds long instance of SCP-DELTA-D, ''Crying'', on ██/██/████. Object Class revision for SCP-DELTA has been suggested and is under consideration.</p>
