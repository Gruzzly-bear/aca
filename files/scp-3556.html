<p>SCP-3556 prior to containment</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3556</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3556 is currently contained in a containment locker in Site-77's Containment Vault. The item is to be placed within a sound-proof container in order to minimize distractions to nearby personnel. Access to the item is restricted to any personnel of Level 2 security clearance or higher. Personnel of Level 1 clearance or lower must receive written permission by Dr. Beck, head of SCP-3556 research, to handle SCP-3556.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3556 is a yellow adhesive note pad, measuring 2.5 cm by 5 cm, depicting a crude drawing of an unknown creature with the word “Durbal” being written near the drawing.</p>
<p>Placing SCP-3556 on any object will cause the drawing to animate and vocalize any flaws the anomaly perceives of the item it is placed upon. SCP-3556's criticisms will become increasingly illogical the longer it remains on an object, eventually going off topic and become tangentially unrelated to the item it was affixed to. SCP-3556 has only been recorded speaking English. It is theorized that SCP-3556 is sentient, though it has refused to cooperate during attempted interviews.</p>

<p>The following are a series of transcripts recorded from experiments using SCP-3556.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Object was placed on a cracked mirror.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3556:</strong> Mirror is obviously cracked intentionally.<br/>
If left untreated, may result in total mirror failure.<br/>
Mirror is slightly smudged due to clumsy workers.<br/>
Mirror is even more smudged by me.<br/>
Mirror does not correctly reflect light as human eyes see it.<br/>
Mirror is not a true mirror.<br/>
Mirror absorbs a small amount of green light upon reflection.<br/>
Mirror is a cheating mirror that steals people’s hard earned light and deserves to serve 30 years in prison for stealing light.<br/>
Mirror may also be given the death penalty in several jurisdictions, and frankly deserves it.<br/>
Mirror is scum of the Earth…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>The unedited audio files all amount to approximately 33 days of audio. The remainder of this transcript was cut for the sake of brevity. SCP-3556 may be capable of following an infinite number of tangents in its rants.</em> -Dr. Beck</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Object was placed on a file containing multiple documents. All documents consisted of untrue facts.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3556:</strong> File is an inadequate way to store data, considering the rise of digital data.<br/>
Data contained within file is false.<br/>
First page states frogs are mammals.<br/>
Frogs are amphibians.<br/>
Amphibians are both fish and mammals.<br/>
Frogs are indecisive in their place in the animal kingdom.<br/>
Second page states computers emit sugary liquids.<br/>
Computer technology is yet to reach the state of sugary liquid emission.<br/>
Sugary liquids cause diabetes, heart disease, obesity…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>The remainder of this transcript was cut for the sake of brevity. It appears SCP-3556 is able to criticize the contents of media, not just the media itself.</em> -Dr. Beck</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> D-8913 was instructed to hold SCP-3556. D-8913 had their left arm amputated at birth.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3556:</strong> D-8913 is missing an arm.<br/>
D-8913’s arm was removed because she is genetically inferior to other human organisms.<br/>
D-8913 lacks confidence.<br/>
D-8913 swears too much.<br/>
D-8913 wears terrible orange jumpsuits because she lacks confidence.<br/>
D-8913 wears glasses because her eyes were screwed up by staring at a TV too much.<br/>
D-8913 dyes her hair to forget about the fact their hair is ugly and boring.<br/>
D-8913 hates legitimate criticism.<br/>
D-8913 doesn’t know how she gets into terrible situations and chooses to blame those around her.<br/>
D-8913 has a terrible relationship with her mother.<br/>
D-8913 has committed murder and deserves to be here.<br/>
D-8913 is a terrible singer and can’t take a hint that she is a terrible singer.<br/>
D-8913 listens to Korean pop music, which is the worst kind of music.<br/>
D-8913’s voice is literally incapable of sounding good in any circumstance.<br/>
D-8913 has anger management problems.<br/>
D-8913 hates pape-</p>
<p><em>D-8913 placed SCP-3556 on a nearby wall and attempted to leave the testing chamber. D-8913 refused to comply with further testing orders.</em></p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Beck was instructed to hold SCP-3556.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3556:</strong> Jim Cyrus Beck does not have children, and as such is an evolutionary failure.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck does not want children because he doesn’t want to become like his father.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck is also incapable of having children due to his erectile dysfunction.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck does not realize he is already like his father.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck drinks an entire beer once he gets home from work, like his father.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck fails to please his significant other both sexually and romantically, like his father.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck hates his job and regularly questions why he hasn’t quit.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck is allergic to bees.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck cannot become a bee farmer.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck is also allergic to honey.<br/>
Jim Cyrus Beck can never affiliate himself with any bees of any k-</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-3556 was presented with SCP-3556’s file.</p>

<p>SCP-3556 was recovered from the apartment of ██████ ████████ (PoI-3556), a writer and illustrator for various children’s books. Foundation agents planted in local police stations apprehended SCP-3556, as well as PoI-3556 and the personal journal of the subject as evidence following a suicide attempt by PoI-3556. Below are the most recent entries in PoI-3556’s journal pertaining to SCP-3556.</p>
