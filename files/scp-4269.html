<p>An instance of SCP-4269.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4269</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4269 instances are to be contained in a standard anomalous item locker. Any instances of SCP-4269 are to be washed and disinfected thoroughly before and after any experimentation.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-4269 are not to be used for recreational reasons by any personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4269 is the collective designation for several pairs of cognitohazardous undergarments created by GoI-7058 (Inevitability Industries). Any subject who wears an instance of SCP-4269 is known as an instance of SCP-4269-1. Subjects who view SCP-4269-1 instances will perceive them as a person they would consider their ideal standard of sexual attractiveness. This anomalous effect extends to all senses, including touch, taste and smell.</p>
<p>Different subjects may see different people when viewing and interacting with an SCP-4269-1 instance, and one subject may view multiple different people if viewing more than one SCP-4269-1 instance. The only known restriction of SCP-4269's cognitohazardous effects is it will not alter an SCP-4269-1 instance's gender to the subject viewing it.</p>
<p>Below is an abridged list of SCP-4269-1 instances as viewed by Foundation Personnel:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>SCP-4269-1 Manifestation</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Researcher Geraldine Stearns</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance looked like American Actor Dwayne Johnson wearing only an apron.</td>
<td>SCP-4269 is capable of simulating realistic-feeling clothing and additional body mass, as the SCP-4269-1 instance was four inches shorter than Dwayne Johnson and was not wearing any clothing beyond SCP-4269.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Researcher Arthur Cordelia</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance was a tall, broad-shouldered, tan-skinned woman with long black hair and a toned body.</td>
<td>SCP-4269-1 instances do not need to be any specific people, but rather a concept that the subject finds attractive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Researcher Connor Finn</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance did not change in appearance.</td>
<td>SCP-4269-1 instances do not necessarily need to change appearance if the subject already finds them attractive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Researcher Fiona Mariah</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance became a scaled lizard-like woman with clawed hands and feet and an elongated tail.</td>
<td>SCP-4269-1 instances do not necessarily have to be human or humanoid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Janitor Frank Robertson</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance was a woman wearing a black latex suit that covered their entire body save for their feet.</td>
<td>Test was accidental as Mr. Robertson had been passing by the Site-73 low-security testing area.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Incident 4269-03:</strong> On September 28th, 19██, Researcher Wendy Flanders had reportedly requested an instance of SCP-4269 for experimentation purposes, but had not returned it for several days.</p>
<p>The following are several tests made by Researcher Flanders that were discovered on her personal computer:</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<td>Head Researcher Wendy Flanders</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance looking like her ex-girlfriend.</td>
<td>SCP-4269-1 instance was placed on a female <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>, indicating subjects do not need to be the same species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head Researcher Wendy Flanders</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance looking like a different ex-girlfriend.</td>
<td>SCP-4269-1 instance was placed on a humanoid mannequin, indicating subjects do not need to be alive or ever have been living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head Researcher Wendy Flanders</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance looking like <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-035">SCP-035</a> on the body of an ex-girlfriend.</td>
<td>Oh God yes…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head Researcher Wendy Flanders</td>
<td>Subject reported the instance looking like Researcher Fiona Mariah.</td>
<td>SCP-4269 can fulfill your wildest dreams.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Beyond the testing, investigation of Researcher Flanders had revealed that she had kept the SCP-4269 instance for several days after concluding her tests, and had placed it on the base of a lamp in her office along with other pieces of lingerie and a silicone phallus.</p>
<p>Researcher Flanders has been severely reprimanded, including removal as Head Researcher on the SCP-4269 project, and prohibition of working with any humanoid SCP Objects.</p>
<p>Researcher Fiona Mariah has since requested to be transferred to a different Foundation Site after the events of Incident 4269-03. The request has been granted.</p>
