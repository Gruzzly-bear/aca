            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5322</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The property housing SCP-5322 has been purchased by the Foundation and sealed off from the public. Any individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-5322 are to be apprehended by on-site security, interrogated, and amnesticized as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5322 is a short one-way road which begins at a small farmhouse in Hackett, Georgia and terminates fifty meters in, leading to a non-anomalous woodland clearing. A hand-painted sign next to the beginning of this road reads '<em>Route 108</em>.'</p>
<p>The anomalous properties of SCP-5322 only become apparent when an individual in a motor vehicle drives down its entire length. If, at the termination of the road, the individual in question is visually observing their surroundings, no unusual phenomena will occur. On the other hand, however, if the individual in question has their eyes closed or their vision otherwise obscured, they and their motor vehicle will disappear completely.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">To date, no individuals have reappeared after vanishing in this way.</span></p>

</div>
<p>In order to better understand the nature of SCP-5322, three tests were performed by Foundation personnel over the course of three weeks. In the first two of these tests, performed by D-Class personnel, the vehicles disappeared as usual and were not recovered.</p>
<p>In the third test, volunteer Agent Simeon Woods was equipped with a specialized vehicle featuring an array of exterior cameras and sensors, along with a hand-held audio recording device in the event of equipment malfunction.</p>
<p>The following logs constitute the recovered data from said audio device:</p>
<blockquote>

<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING START]</strong></p>
<p>Confirming, um, crossover — some sort of crossover has just occurred.</p>
<p>Not entirely sure of current location, there was about ten to twenty seconds of, sort of, turbulence? I'm not sure if that'd be the right word to describe it. Bright lights and shaking of the vehicle, at any rate. I'm not sure… I'm not sure if the exterior equipment is still functional. I heard something snap off.</p>
<p>Audio recording equipment still functional. Will perform a quick exterior inspection if safe.<br/>

<strong>Speaker:</strong> Agent Simeon Woods</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING START]</strong></p>
<p>Yes, um. Okay.</p>
<p>Exterior equipment is definitely non-functional, majority of it is completely missing. Not sure if it was left behind on the other side or, or what. Will continue documenting experiences via audio equipment, ah, as best I can.</p>
<p>My surroundings. Um, it's a road here, still a road — much longer now, stretching as far as I can see. Off into the horizon, past that probably. There was a forest around me when I came in here, but it's just fields now. Normal grass, normal… all normal except for the fact that there's so much of it. It's the same time of day, I think — the sun's in the same position, at least. If it's the same sun.</p>
<p>Will continue driving as instructed.</p>

<p>Now speaking.</p>
<p>Have been driving for the last five hours or so. Nothing to report landscape-wise in that time. Just… just fields on either side, and the road continuing on. Fairly smooth road — hasn't been much in terms of bumps. Haven't noticed any vegetation on the sides of the road other than grass. I don't know if you can tell, but I'm sort of reaching for things to report here. Been grateful for the music already loaded on the radio.</p>
<p>It's a little cloudy?</p>
<p>Oh — oh! Yes. I've been keeping an eye on my fuel as I've been driving, of course, and the position of the meter doesn't seem to have changed in that time. Unsure whether that's some kind of malfunction with the equipment or if I'm actually just not using fuel. I'll inspect at first opportunity to confirm which is the case.</p>
<p>It's getting dark. Will concentrate on driving.</p>

<p>Quick update.</p>
<p>Still driving — haven't stopped since I came in, really. It's, uh, it's boring, but I don't feel any physical fatigue. Any kind of physical tiredness — just as awake as I was when I came in here. I'm not hungry either, or thirsty. So I guess it's one of those kinds of situations.</p>
<p>It's, uh, pitch-black outside. I don't think I mentioned there weren't any street lights out here. I mean, I never said that there <em>were</em>, but I just wanna say specifically now that there aren't. It's just some slight light from the moon — <em>a</em> moon, I guess, no way to tell if it's the one I know. Oh, and the — the headlights of the car. Thank God those weren't broken coming in.</p>
<p>It's just… it's kind of calm, you know? Just the sound of the engine. Can't even hear any insects out there, or birds. Just this thing purring. I was kinda worried, you know — that this would be one of those things were, like, something awful would come out but only at night. That something would start trying to get in the car, or I'd catch glimpses of something out in the dark or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not trying to jinx it, but it doesn't seem like that's the case. There's nothing out there, far as I can tell. Just me, the dark and the road.</p>
<p>It's not so bad.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING START]</strong></p>
<p>Okay, sort of a mass update here. Didn't want to clog this thing up with a bunch of ten-second recordings.</p>
<p>First things first: did that inspection of the fuel I was talking. Definitely still a full tank — so I should be good to keep driving unless something unforeseen happens. I mean, I'm hardly gonna crash, so… well, I say that. That leads me to the second thing, actually.</p>
<p>Came across a house on the side of the road a couple of hours after sunrise. A little, little sort of cottage thing, mostly made from wood. Kinda cosy-looking, that sort of… like the kind of thing you'd see on a Christmas card? Idealized, I think's the best way to put it. Anyway, I parked up and took a look around — wanted to see if there was any kind of, I don't know, natives or, or other people here.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there weren't. Place looked abandoned. Bed upstairs had been slept in, clearly, and there were dishes in the sink — oh, there was a sink — but the food in the fridge looked like it'd been rotten for a while. If someone once lived there, they haven't for a while. Got back in the car after my search and went back on the road.</p>
<p>Oh, it was on the left side, if that's important. Probably not.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING START]</strong></p>
<p>We're getting somewhere now.</p>
<p>More houses like the one I reported about earlier — well, more <em>properties</em>, I suppose. They're all sort of unique: different designs, different sizes. Cosy little cottages next to all this modern metal and glass next to, like, a little castle. Not much in terms of a unifying theme. I searched them all, of course, and they're just as abandoned as the cabin was. Food rotted where it's stored, so it's definitely been left there for a while.</p>
<p>These things seem to be coming up in clusters. I went an hour or so with just fields, and then I got a bunch of them all together. There haven't been any vehicles — just houses. One house had a driveway, but there was no car in it. Not sure if that means anything.</p>
<p>Fuel meter still hasn't budged — that probably isn't changing anytime soon. Not sure if there's anything to be done except go on driving, so — hold up.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> I'm sitting in a, uh, a diner, a roadside diner by the name of … "Brenda's Spot?" Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Okay. Yes. That's where I am, and I'm speaking with the proprietor, Brenda Calloway. Do you mind if I describe you? It's — we just have audio, so…</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> So long as you're polite about, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Alright. Miss Calloway is a, uh, a young woman — twenties? You're in your twenties, is that right? She's nodding. Caucasian brunette, uh, green eyes. Wearing some kind of waitress uniform — she's got a name card on, with her name on it. Sorry about that — and thanks for the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> No problem. You done?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Yes. Yes, I'm done. I have to say — you didn't seem too surprised to see me.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> Well, you're the first in a while, but people come through here every now and then. Last couple of fellas were prisoners in these orange suits, and they weren't too polite, but they went on their way quick enough.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> I see. And, um, may I ask when you yourself… came through?</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> Well, it was… I guess it must've been a while ago. Couldn't tell you the exact date, if that's what you wanna know. Was driving home from work one day, took a wrong turn, and I ended up in this place.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> In this diner?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> No, no, on the road, I mean. Still driving, like I just had been, but the road just kept going. Was so dark I didn't realize for a while, you know? And when I did, there still weren't that much I could do except keep going. Keep driving.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> I didn't notice your car when I came in.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> Well, you know… you can only keep on driving for so long, right? Eventually, just, you just have to accept that you're not going anywhere. No matter how far I drove, it might've well as just been a dead end. So I, well, I just stopped.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> And then…?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> I parked the car, got out to — well, you know, I carried a gun for safety — and there was the diner. Just in front of me, like it'd been there for years. <em>Brenda's Stop</em>. I was a waitress before, did I mention that? It was all I'd ever been good for — so I figured 'why not'? I set up shop: all the supplies I needed were already here, and they stock themselves up every now and then.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> <em>(shrugs)</em> You take what you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> You're content just… staying here? Forever?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> Well, not forever. If I wanted to, I could just walk off, across the fields… and I get the feeling that that'd be that. But it's not so bad here. I keep myself busy, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> Hey… what year is it? Could you tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> It's, um…</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Calloway:</strong> It ain't the 70's anymore, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> No.</p>

<p>I volunteered this, after the first two guys didn't come back. Must've looked like a suicide thing. Maybe it was — but I, I don't think so.

Deliberation is currently underway regarding a way to deliver these messages to their intended recipients without a breach of secrecy.</p>
<p>A full archive of these recordings is available upon request. This log will proceed following this aforementioned period:</p>

<p>The clusters are starting to die off now. Nothing since Grey's place for a week or so now. Had a birthday driving, I realized, just after the big castle. It's sunny today. I like the warmth on my skin. It's like … it's nice. I've got the window open.</p>
<p>I wonder if it'll rain soon. It rains every now and then. Did I ever mention that? It's not slippery, but it sounds nice coming off the windows. Like fingers tapping against the glass, but, uh…</p>
<p><em>(Laughter.)</em></p>
<p>…a little less spooky than that, I think.</p>

<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> I do appreciate it, though.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> No problem. You really did get sick of that cabin, didn't ya?</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Did we send you in with that bag?</p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> Must've.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> I read the files — I don't remember that.</p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> It was in the cabin when my car crashed. It's not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> I never said it was a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> If we're gonna be driving together, we might as well try and get along. Where were you-</p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> Are you recording this?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D-9921:</strong> I want to drive.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Woods:</strong> Sure thing. Lemme just stop the car.</p>

<p><strong>[RECORDING START]</strong></p>
<p>Had to ditch him.</p>
<p>Got a bad vibe. Didn't like the way he was being cagey about the bag. Might have been nothing, but… if it was nothing, why would he get so defensive about it? Was it a weapon, maybe? It could have been a knife. I don't know what he would have done with it. Maybe he was a little sore about being thrown in here. I wouldn't blame him.</p>
<p>Or it might have been nothing.</p>
<p>I feel a little bad, but… not as bad I thought I would. It's not like I left him to starve, or freeze, or die alone. Someone will come along. Something will come along — eventually. Things don't happen here in ways they aren't meant to. Or anywhere. This is a one-way road, after all.</p>
<p>It's very empty now. Not even grass. I think I'm getting somewhere.</p>
<p><em>(Beeping sound.)</em></p>
<p>Oh. Merry Christmas, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Approximated Time:</strong> Unknown<br/>
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Agent Simeon Woods</p>
<hr/>
<p>Imagine the biggest apartment building you've ever seen.</p>
<p>Like, imagine you've lived in the country all your life. I don't know if you, the person listening, can relate to that — or if any of you can, if you're listening in a group. I grew up in the country, and when you go to the city everything just looks <em>massive</em>. In a different way, I guess. In the country, things are wide, things stretch off forever — but in the city, things are <em>tall</em>. Things reach up for the sky.</p>
<p>Imagine a building — just, just the biggest you've ever seen. Full of people. And then imagine it over, and over again, stacked on top of itself. Like a kid's toys, just left in a pile.</p>
<p>It's like that, right now, both sides of the road… just, just these grey concrete buildings just smashed together, the piles reaching up all the way into the sky. Sun's sort of poking through the gaps, but just barely.</p>
<p><em>(Sounds of rumbling and crashing.)</em></p>
<p>Did you catch that? Every now and then, dozens of those buildings will just <em>slide</em> off those piles, smash onto the road and just… just fade away. It's kind of sad. Once, I think these were places people could settle for, and they're just… gone. Forever.</p>
<p>There are people here, too, but I don't think I'll be stopping this time. I catch them, looking at me through broken windows, peeking over shattered balconies. They have angry eyes. It's not that they want the car, I don't think, it's just… the <em>audacity</em>, I think. That I'm still going, and they aren't.</p>
<p>I can understand why they're angry. They almost made it, I think.</p>

<p>Made it through. When I cleared the buildings, I could hear them behind me. Shouting after me, like a — like a chorus. Like an angry chorus.</p>
<p>I didn't look back.</p>
<p>It's fields again, now — but not the same fields. I haven't got out to check — I feel like that isn't a good idea anymore — but I'm pretty sure it's reeds, not grass. Well, I know reeds <em>are</em> a kind of grass but, you know, long and yellow instead of short and green. Just thought it might be worth mentioning.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p>Let's get this done. It's bright out.</p>

<p>Still driving, I think. I can't hear the engine — it's, it's too bright for that, I think. Like I'm driving into the sun. Can't even see outside the windows, but — you know — my eyes don't hurt. Don't even sting. It's like a gentle star.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p>I think it might be my birthday.</p>

<p>On 23/05/2021, Agent Simeon Woods and his vehicle reappeared within the forest clearing at the end of SCP-5322. On-site personnel quickly recovered both, and Agent Woods was declared dead at the scene. Cause of death ruled as sudden heart failure at an indeterminate date and time.</p>
<p>Agent Woods was found to be smiling.</p>
