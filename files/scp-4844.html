<p>SCP-4844, photographed in 2012, 7 years after its ascension.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4844</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No effective means of containing SCP-4844 are currently known. Research and examination are being conducted to find methods by which SCP-4844 may be contained or terminated.</p>
<p>Both SCP-4844's home in Los Angeles and its ziggurat beneath the Caspian Sea are to be surveilled to monitor SCP-4844's activity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4844 is Tim Allen, an American actor and comedian known for performances in <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>The Santa Clause</em>, and <em>Home Improvement</em>. SCP-4844 possesses reality-bending capabilities more potent than those of any other entity in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>SCP-4844 is capable of numerous feats including flight, spontaneous materialization and dematerialization, fine manipulation of objects and substances, and stand-up comedy. The exact origin of these abilities is unknown, but they are believed to be associated with obscure and forbidden acting techniques SCP-4844 utilized throughout the filming of 2006's <em>The Shaggy Dog</em>.</p>
<p>Following the negative critical reception of <em>The Shaggy Dog</em>, SCP-4844 retained its public persona as a mundane actor, but began using its powers recreationally to pursue several personal projects in secret. The specifics of most of these projects are unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-4844's largest known project is a ziggurat of solid obsidian built at the lowest point of the Caspian Sea. Located in a semi-permeable hemisphere of breathable air, this ziggurat contains countless artifacts created by SCP-4844 as a form of recreation, artistic expression, or wish fulfilment. Notable artifacts found during clandestine expeditions are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A life-size marble sculpture depicting every character SCP-4844 has ever portrayed on film. The figures are engaged in unarmed combat with each other. The base of the sculpture is a pile of ostensibly deceased replicas of SCP-4844.</li>
<li>Forty-five wooden and bone figurines made to resemble famous actors that SCP-4844 has worked with. They are depicted in various states of severe injury.</li>
<li>An immense mural depicting a victorious SCP-4844 standing atop an overturned M1 Abrams tank. The tank is surrounded by crying women.</li>
<li>A scale model of the United States of America. Florida is absent. Much of the Midwest is covered by an engraving of Tim "The Toolman" Taylor. He is smiling and wielding a claw hammer.</li>
<li>A 21-metre-tall statue of Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. She is smiling and wielding a claw hammer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> In 2016, a group of independent archaeologists unearthed a granite tablet in the ruins of the ancient Sumerian city-state of Ur. This discovery drew the Foundation's attention when the tablet was reported to depict modern-day characters despite being ostensibly 3000 years old. The tablet was acquired by the Foundation and the discoverers were amnesticized.</p>
<p>The tablet depicts SCP-4844, dressed as Tim "The Toolman" Taylor and flanked by Buzz Lightyear and Santa Claus. SCP-4844 is shown to be locked in mortal combat with American stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld atop an unknown volcano. Jerry Seinfeld is not known to possess anomalous abilities to the extent implied by this tablet.</p>
<p>No actions are to be taken to empower Jerry Seinfeld at this time.</p>
