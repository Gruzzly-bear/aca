<p>SCP-9831-A on its containment server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #99d0f0"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> SCP-9831 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-9831 should be provided with a supply of notebooks and writing tools. Notebooks or papers affected by SCP-9831 shall be computerized and studied for legible details. Other writing surfaces must be kept at least 20 meters away from SCP-9831.</p>
<p>A single copy of SCP-9831-A is kept on a secure Foundation server at Site-55, which shall not have an external internet connection. This article contains an integrated SCP-9831-A player that streams from this server. Attempts to reverse-engineer SCP-9831-A with "RPGMaker MV" are ongoing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #99d0f0"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-9831 is a female humanoid, around 20 years old, standing 165cm in height and weighing 55kg. SCP-9831 is able to voluntarily transfer memories from itself to other individuals, animals, and inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Memories transferred to living organisms are implanted directly into the hippocampus, making it difficult to distinguish memories given by SCP-9831 from genuine memories. Memories taken from living organisms are entirely removed. Exposed individuals have reported a sense of "tearing" and temporary feelings of pain and panic when this occurs, although upon examination, no visible injuries have occurred.</p>
<p>SCP-9831 stores taken memories within itself and can transfer them like it can its own memories. SCP-9831 can choose not to experience memories taken from others, allowing it to avoid exposure to traumatic events.</p>
<p>Memories transferred to inanimate objects, such as notebooks and computers, appear in a format that depends on the medium. For example, papers and notebooks will have ink written on them, computers will gain data to their primary storage device, and blackboards will be chalked. SCP-9831 can detect the presence of nearby memories in both inanimate objects and humans, even through walls.</p>
<p>SCP-9831 can only consciously interact with objects whose "intended purpose" is the storage and transfer of information. For example, SCP-9831 could not transfer memories from a D-Class personnel to the wall of its chamber, as the wall's "intended purpose" was to be a wall, not a writing surface. However, when Dr. Thorpe began spray-painting the wall within eyesight of SCP-9831, it was temporarily able to use it as a medium. However, SCP-9831-A implies that SCP-9831 is able to interact with any surface in certain situations.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color: #99d0f0"><strong>Recovery:</strong></span> SCP-9831 was recovered after an embedded SCP agent in the ███████ Massachusetts police force intercepted a suspicious dispatch alert regarding "a girl who disappeared in front of me". MTF agents were dispatched from Site-55 immediately and arrived at SCP-9831's reported residence.</p>

<p><strong>Zeta-2:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> We're here for a disappearing girl.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-4:</strong> Right, we have to move quickly here. We don't know if she'll be able to escape or what else she can do.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> Alright guys. I'll keep watch. Zeta-3, you take the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> On it.</p>
<p><em>The team moves up the front porch. Zeta-3 looks through the windows next to the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> No movement. Lights are on upstairs, central room.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> Okay, let's hit there first. Everyone up for some B&amp;E?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> You know I am.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> Right. Zeta-2, on my mark… Three, two, one… go!</p>
<p><em>Zeta-2 breaches the front door, and the team quickly enters. A set of stairs leads up to the second floor, while a hallway on the left leads to a kitchen and a back porch. No signs of activity in the house.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> I'll take the front. One two one, up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-4:</strong> I've got the rear.</p>
<p><em>MTF Zeta-0 makes its way up the stairs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> [quietly] Stop.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Camille? Are you okay?</p>
<p><em>Zeta-3 turns to Zeta-1. Zeta-1 motions to proceed. Zeta-3 nods and counts down from three on his fingers. They quickly move up the stairs and burst into a small bedroom.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-4:</strong> Hands up, hands up!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-2:</strong> Don't move!</p>
<p><em>The bedroom is littered with notebooks and has a bed on both walls. The bed on the left is occupied by a young girl, mid-teens, who quickly rises to her feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Whoa! Who-</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> On the ground! Now! Don't you disappear on us!</p>
<p><em>The agents surround the girl. She slowly complies. Zeta-2 and Zeta-3 restrain her as she struggles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Camille! Help!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> Stay still and shut up!</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-2:</strong> Tranq her.</p>
<p><em>The girl is tranquilized by Zeta-3. She falls still.</em></p>
<p><em>Pause. No activity. Zeta-4 glances between Zeta-3, the girl, and the hallway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> She matches the caller's description. Check the room.</p>
<p><em>Zeta-2 performs a brief search. They uncover several notebooks filled with illegible writing and a set of photographs on the wall. One of them seems to be of SCP-9831.</em></p>
<p><strong>Zeta-2:</strong> Nothing of note. Let's extract and wait for a research team.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-4:</strong> Right. let's- Wait. Movement. We have another female coming up the stairs now.</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> Shit. Corner of the room, guys.</p>
<p><em>The team begins to move, but an older girl (identified as SCP-9831) walks in through the open door.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Lanie? Lanie, what was that-</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 sees MTF Zeta-0 standing over the girl. It freezes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> …Who-</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-1:</strong> On the ground! Now!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 does not comply. It looks down at the girl, who is completely still.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> What did you do to her?</p>
<p><strong>Zeta-3:</strong> Stop talking!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> [screaming] What did you do?!</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 falls to its knees, crying, never taking its eyes off the girl. Zeta-1 and Zeta-2 approach SCP-9831, while Zeta-3 and Zeta-4 stay with the first subject. Zeta-1 begins crouching to restrain SCP-9831.</em></p>

<p>During this incident, MTF Zeta-1's dead man switch was tripped, causing a full-scale mobilization on the scene. Responding agents found SCP-9831 in a state of panic, and none could approach without being affected by it. After consulting with Dr. Thorpe, soporific gas was pumped into the house, subduing SCP-9831, where it was subsequently recovered.</p>
<p>Initial entry of the scene was made by Dr. Barrett and Dr. Thorpe. All four members of MTF Zeta-0, as well as the subject's mother and younger sister, were found dead due to a complete lack of brain activity.</p>
<p>The "disappearing girl" was not found during this operation.</p>

<hr/>
<p><em>Foreword: A D-class (D-47326, multiple manslaughter) was introduced to SCP-9831 in an effort to understand its anomalous effect. D-47326 was provided with four notebooks and instructed to place them around SCP-9831.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>D-47326 is introduced to the testing chamber carrying several notebooks. As instructed, she places them in a circle around SCP-9831, then sits down in a chair across from it. SCP-9831 eyes D-47326 warily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><em>D-47326 does not respond, only momentarily glancing at SCP-9831 before turning to the observation window.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> [behind the window] Let's begin. SCP-9831, please use your ability to write in any of the notebooks.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 hesitates, looking between D-47326 and the observation window. It eventually complies, focusing on the nearest notebook. Ink begins to fill the top page until it is completely black. D-47326 looks at it, eyes wide.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Good. Was that your memory or one from D-47326?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 does not respond. It stares at Dr. Thorpe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> SCP-9831?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Mine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Thank you. Please extract a memory from the woman in front of you and put it in an empty notebook.</p>
<p><em>D-47326 tenses. SCP-9831, after a brief pause, appears to comply. D-47326 vocalizes in pain and grabs her head, causing SCP-9831 to quickly retreat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Oh! I-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Please continue. You will be able to put the memory back after we're done.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 looks furitively towards Dr. Thorpe, but it complies. D-47326 vocalizes in pain. SCP-9831 grimaces, but it shifts its gaze towards an empty notebook, and it again fills with ink.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Thank you. D-47326, please try to describe the contents of the two notebooks.</p>
<p><em>D-47326 shakes her head and stands, moving over to the first notebook.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-47326:</strong> Uh, yeah. Um, the first one is just completely black.</p>
<p><em>D-47326 looks over the notebook.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-47326:</strong> There's nothing here to make out. It's just full of ink, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Thank you. And the other notebook?</p>
<p><em>D-47326 puts down the first notebook and moves over to the second one.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-47326:</strong> This one isn't totally black. There's… some writing. Some pictures, too. There are a few cars on the bottom. One of them's got some people, the other-</p>
<p><em>D-47326 stops talking. She glances at SCP-9831. SCP-9831 looks down at its feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Thank you. You're able to make out certain aspects of memories, then. D-47326, please return to your seat. SCP-9831, please return the memories to their respective owners.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 complies with no hesitation. D-47326 visibly recoils as the notebooks become empty, but quickly relaxes. SCP-9831 appears to mouth "I'm sorry". D-47326 acknowledges with a slight nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Thorpe:</strong> Please stand by. I will consult with Barrett to see if there's anything else we need to do today.</p>

<h4><span>Interview Log: SCP-9831, Dr. Barrett, 8/23/19</span></h4>
<hr/>
<p><em>Foreword: Immediately after the previous test, Dr. Barrett requested a one-on-one interview with SCP-9831 in an attempt to ascertain its origins. This request was approved on 8/23/19.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Barrett sits down behind the observation window. SCP-9831 cautiously approaches and sits in a chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Hello, SCP-9831.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 nods but does not respond. It appears more apprehensive than usual.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> I'd like to talk to you today about your life prior to the Foundation. I feel like we don't know enough about you, your relationships… You know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Did you know about the Foundation before coming here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> I don't know. I saw… I had sort of imagined there was somebody out there looking for me. I didn't think it would be… [pause; looks up] No. I didn't know about you guys.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Did you ever tell anyone else about your ability?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> No. I thought if I told people, they would just tell all of their friends. I figured if that happened, someone in authority would know, and I would be found out right away.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Right, well, that's good for both of us. Fewer people to… [shakes head] Camille, before your… containment… We understand you encountered another anomalous object. Please describe it to me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> It was this… disembodied hand. I was at the mall, and it just appeared in front of me. I think it gave me a nightmare. I was able to remove the memory of the whole thing from myself. That's why I'm not traumatised. I just remember what it looked like.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Got it. That'll definitely help us find it. Anything else, Camille?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Um… Yes.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 twists in her seat, gesturing behind her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> Look behind me, at the ceiling. Do you see anything strange?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barrett looks past SCP-9831. The camera feed sees only the ceiling of its chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> No, I don't. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> There's this… window. It's shown up every now and then… when I first got here, when we did that test yesterday, and now it's here. It's always been in that direction.</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 points towards the door to its chamber, away from the observation window.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Barrett writes in her notebook and coughs. SCP-9831 leans in. After a moment, Dr. Barrett inhales sharply. SCP-9831's eyes move as if it is reading something.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Let's talk about it some other time. Is there anything else you need, Camille?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> …A computer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> I… I want a computer. These notebooks you guys are giving me are good, but they can only really hold a few memories at a time. I can use my power with computers as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Oh. That's good to know. I'll pass that along to Dr. Thorpe. Anything else?</p>
<p><em>SCP-9831 shakes its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barrett:</strong> Alright. Lunch will be at 12:30, then testing tomorrow. I'll be looking forward to seeing what you can do.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barrett leaves. After a moment, SCP-9831 clears its throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9831:</strong> …This entire thing is gonna get redacted, isn't it?</p>

<h4><span>Video Log: Creation of SCP-9831-A, 8/24/19</span></h4>
<hr/>
<p><em>Foreword: On 8/23/19, Dr. Barrett suggested providing a computer to SCP-9831 in the hopes that it could reveal more of its origins and memories. Dr. Thorpe approved this request the following day.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:16:25&gt;:</strong> A single Windows computer with its networking hardware removed is introduced to SCP-9831's containment chamber. <em>Note: To encourage SCP-9831 to interface with the computer, it was preinstalled with various storytelling and creative tools, including writing, drawing, video-making, and game-making tools.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:17:52&gt;:</strong> Personnel exit the room. SCP-9831 sits in a chair in front of the computer and turns it on.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:19:24&gt;:</strong> SCP-9831 seems to be attempting to use its ability on the computer. No effect noted.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:28:50&gt;:</strong> Dr. Thorpe asks SCP-9831 if it needs assistance. SCP-9831 responds in the negative. Slurred speech noted.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:32:04&gt;:</strong> SCP-9831 shows signs of severe drowsiness. It slumps over in its chair.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:33:25&gt;:</strong> SCP-9831 begins experiencing a grand mal seizure. Dr. Barrett calls medical personnel to the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:33:37&gt;:</strong> The computer monitor begins rapidly flashing. SCP-9831 becomes fully unresponsive.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:35:42&gt;:</strong> "RPGMaker MV", a popular game development tool, opens by itself on the computer. Dr. Thorpe stops responding medical personnel from entering the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;11:36:20&gt;:</strong> SCP-9831 stops showing signs of seizure, but remains unresponsive. It appears to have successfully interfaced with the computer.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;12:16:45&gt;:</strong> A D-class personnel attempts to use the computer, but finds it unresponsive to user input.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 9/4/19, after 206 hours of no changes, the computer turned off and SCP-9831 lost consciousness. After fifteen minutes with no activity, medical personnel entered and found SCP-9831 in a comatose state. SCP-9831 was removed to Site-55's infirmiry. As of 9/6/19, SCP-9831 remains unresponsive, with almost no activity in any portion of its brain except the brainstem.</p>
<p>Upon analysis, the computer contained a single file on its desktop, titled "MYMEMORY.zip". This file was quickly reclassified as SCP-9831-A and transferred to Site-55's secure computer anomaly suite.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Notes on the integrated SCP-9831-A player:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The player requires a modern browser with HTML5 support, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or SCPExplorer 8.0. Hardware acceleration must be enabled.</li>
<li>A desktop computer is strongly recommended. Several aspects of SCP-9831-A do not function properly on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Since this player streams from Site-55, a fast internet connection is recommended for the best experience.</li>

<p><em>Note from MTF Agent Union Liaison Olinger: Analysis shows SCP-9831-A deviates from reality in certain spots, mainly towards the end. It should be noted that any inconsistencies between this document and SCP-9831-A are misrememberings or falsehoods made by SCP-9831. The logs in this article are the truth of the matter. Anyone found sympathizing with SCP-9831 will be reprimanded.</em></p>
<p><em>Note from Researcher Blandino: The unknown object encountered in SCP-9831-A has been found and contained as Low-Value Anomalous Item 8553.</em></p>
<p><em>Note from Dr. Barrett: Exploring SCP-9831-A now. I'll report my findings in this article once I have a full understanding of it.</em></p>
