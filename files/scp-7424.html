<p>SCP-7424, photographed before <span style="color: darkred">PROJECT HAEMAVORACIOUS</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-7424 has been transfered to Site-19 for use in the site-wide application of <span style="color: darkred"><strong>PROJECT HAEMAVORACIOUS</strong></span>, SCP-7424 is the centerpiece of the project. The continued containment and usage of SCP-7424 is under the purview of Haematokinetics Division personnel assigned to Site-19, consultation with Site-109 is allowed when needed.</p>
<p>SCP-7424 is to be kept in an open item container in its dedicated air-tight containment chamber located at the lowest level of Site-19's All-Purpose Waste Treatment Facility Subsection Gamma. All applicable containment and testing chambers throughout Site-19 have been appropriately modified to feed into SCP-7424's chamber through the Site's new secondary drainage system.</p>
<p>The drainage pipes leading from the aforementioned rooms have been connected to the secondary drainage system at various meeting points. The newly added piping is to be initially positioned at a significant angle in relation to the old system and equipped with a grate, so that only materials affected by SCP-7424 may pass through. The recommended angle is 90° upwards, meaning the containment pipes of SCP-7424 start perpendicular to the pipes they are attached to. After the initial portion of the pipes, their exact angle is not of importance due to the effects of SCP-7424.</p>
<p>The pipes of SCP-7424's containment system were made in accordance with PoI-7424-PRIME's personal notes, the exact text of said notes is available only to personnel with Level 5/7424 Clearance. The entire length of the pipes was engraved with the same floral patterns found on SCP-7424 and painted dark red, the paint is to be replaced when needed.</p>
<p>All of the pipes ultimately converge into a single main pipe, that then feeds into the container housing SCP-7424.</p>
<p>Personnel with bleeding wounds or scabs are not permitted access into SCP-7424's containment chamber.</p>

<p><strong>OUTDATED SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-7424 is currently being kept in an air-tight item container at Site-109.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-7424 is an iron ring adorned with floral patterns and three red-colored gems, that possesses the anomalous properties of blood attraction and absorption.</p>
<p>Most blood, human or animal, within a radius of approximately 3.41 kilometers of SCP-7424 will begin moving towards it at an exponential speed, moving faster the closer it gets to SCP-7424. Blood affected by SCP-7424 wil always assume a liquid state regardless of the environmental conditions it finds itself in, any mixtures created partially with blood will become separated, and only blood will be attracted to SCP-7424.</p>
<p>Blood is affected by SCP-7424 only if it has a direct way to get to SCP-7424, if SCP-7424 is obstructed on all sides by solid impenetrable barriers no blood will be attracted. However, affected blood has been regularly noted to move in anomalous ways in order to reach SCP-7424, in many cases climbing walls and taking flight in ways defying gravity.</p>
<p>Blood that comes directly into physical contact with SCP-7424 will immediately disappear without a trace, and the three gems on SCP-7424 change color to a darker shade of red the more blood gets absorbed by SCP-7424.</p>
<p>While it is actively absorbing blood, SCP-7424 has been noted to produce irregular, barely detectable vibrations. These have been proven to be completely random and meaningless.</p>

<p>PoI-7424-PRIME, photographed circa 1990.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7424 was created by PoI-7424-PRIME, Janusz Kuleba, a known Polish occultist, thaumaturgist, and paracriminal. At the time, PoI-7424-PRIME was wanted for a variety of illegal activities, including unregistered blood rituals, and multiple counts of murder.</p>
<p>PoI-7424-PRIME was ultimately found in an abandoned shed in a forest near the border between Poland and Germany, his exsanguinated corpse laying face down on the floor near SCP-7424.</p>
<p>A notebook with PoI-7424-PRIME's notes regarding SCP-7424 was found alongside his body. Althought the process of creating SCP-7424 was described in detail, the notebook contained multiple seemingly empty pages. It is believed this was caused by some portions of the notebook being written in blood, and that any information on PoI-7424-PRIME's intentions for the creation of SCP-7424 have been lost this way.</p>
<p>Due to its effects, SCP-7424 was originally contained in Site-109 under the jurisdiction of the facility's Haematokinetics Division.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>Around a month after its initial containment, SCP-7424 was flagged as a potentially useful anomaly by the Foundation's Automated Usefulness Assessment Bots, it was subsequently requested by Site-19 and became the focal point of the newly approved <tt><span style="color: darkred"><strong>PROJECT HAEMAVORACIOUS</strong></span></tt>.</p>
<p>The goal of the project was to create an automated system of blood disposal to lessen the stress experienced by Site-19's janitorial staff. The monthly personnel check conducted after the successful implementation of <tt><span style="color: darkred"><strong>PROJECT HAEMAVORACIOUS</strong></span></tt> confirmed its effectiveness, with the morale and efficiency of Site-19's janitorial staff up by over 250% when compared to previous months.</p>
<p>Proposals to reverse-engineer SCP-7424's anomaly and apply it to various other substances of human origin generated during the course of containment duties (eg. phlegm, yellow bile, black bile, muscle tissue, skeletal tissue, brain tissue, tears, proto-ectoplasm, and childlike wonder) are pending approval.</p>
