Every six hours, this perimeter is to be sterilized with high-strength fungicide, herbicide, and pesticide. Soil samples are to be taken from outside of the perimeter daily. If the aforementioned samples contain traces of SCP-8549, the perimeter is to be immediately expanded and treated with fungicide.</p>
<p>SCP-8549 growths outside of the containment perimeter are to be treated as an extreme threat and destroyed immediately. Any specimens infected by SCP-8549 are to be captured and delivered to Dr. Rebecca Merganser-Blake.</p>
<p>SCP-8549-1 must be cured as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8549 is a species of fungus discovered in ██████, Ohio, within the basement of an abandoned house. All SCP-8549 infections can be traced back to the house, which is considered the epicenter of SCP-8549. The house is in decay; large growths of SCP-8549 have burst through the roof and walls.</p>
<p>SCP-8549 is parasitic towards mammals, growing rapidly in and around its host's organs. The fungi keeps its host alive via anomalous means, and will continue to do so even if the host suffers catastrophic injury. After an indeterminate amount of time, the fungi inside will fully mature, splitting the corpse open and releasing spores. The spores feed on the corpse, infecting new hosts and continuing the life cycle.</p>
<p>SCP-8549-1 refers to Captain Emma Merganser-Blake, who became trapped within the house after an attempt to locate the source of SCP-8549 resulted in her falling through a rotted floorboard. Recovery of SCP-8549-1 is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ongoing</span> to be considered a priority by all personnel.</p>
<p>SCP-8549-1 is visibly infected by SCP-8549, with large fungal outcroppings covering <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its</span> her face, around her joints, and on her torso. Despite the advanced state of infection, she is still capable of movement and vocalization. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It is unknown if SCP-8549-1 is alive or not</span> SCP-8549-1 is alive and will be recovered. Any sightings of SCP-8549-1 are to be reported to Dr. Merganser-Blake immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.8549.1:</strong> Below is a table of cure tests. Further failed tests have been expunged.</p>

<th>DATE</th>
<th>RESULT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3/4/2022</td>
<td>The first iteration of a cure was tested on SCP-8549-1 via laced food, which caused her to seize and vomit. No positive effects were recorded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/18/2022</td>
<td>A second cure was administered via gas. This resulted in visibly less SCP-8549, but also caused a severe coughing fit in SCP-8549-1. The material she coughed up was retrieved, and found to be the interior lining of her lungs and esophagus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8/6/2023</td>
<td>SCP-8549-1 was given a fourth cure, administered via dart gun. She began scratching her stomach uncontrollably, ripping through the skin and into her abdominal cavity. SCP-8549 can be seen growing on the outside of her intestines, which dangle freely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4/30/2024</td>
<td>The ninth cure was administered to SCP-8549-1 via dart gun. She began shaking and loudly complaining of numbness in her legs. Several hours later, her legs would be found on the porch. While they are not attached to her anymore, they show significantly less SCP-8549 growth. Test tentatively declared a success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12/8/2024</td>
<td>An eleventh cure was tested via gas. SCP-8549-1’s skin began necrotizing at a rapid rate, yet did not cause any fungi to die. SCP-8549-1 requested Dr. Merganser-Blake. The doctor asked SCP-8549-1 to exit the house. SCP-8549-1 refused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5/20/2025</td>
<td>A fourteenth cure was given via gas. SCP-8549-1 began to complain of blindness and chest pain. Dr. Merganser-Blake requested she leave the house. SCP-8549-1 refused. Medical care was denied.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Addendum.8549.2:</strong> On 5/22/2025, SCP-8549-1 dragged herself outside. Dr. Merganser-Blake was immediately notified of this, donned a hazmat suit and entered the perimeter. Below is audio from this incident.</p>

<p><strong>Recording Begins</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> Emma?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> <em>[Pained groaning.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8549-1 appears in an advanced state of decay. Her skin is pale, mottled with colorful bursts of fungi. Her back legs are entirely absent, as is her pelvis. The end of her spinal column is visible. SCP-8549-1's arms are clawed open, muscles exposed and slick with rot. SCP-8549 grows from her eye sockets. Her heart is visibly pounding.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> Emma? Honey, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> Stop it. Stop it. Make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> We can’t, not yet, we’re still working on a cure.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8549-1 begins to drag herself from the porch. A trail of thick black sludge and spores follow her. One of her back vertebrae slides off. She approaches Dr. Merganser-Blake. She wraps her decaying arms around her legs, skin sloughing off against her hazmat suit.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> Becky…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> I know, baby. But I’m gonna make it all better okay? I’m gonna fix you right up.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8549-1 begins to wail.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> No, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> It’s okay, I’m gonna figure something out, and you’ll be okay. It’s gonna be okay, shhhh.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Merganser-Blake runs her hand through SCP-8549-1's hair. A clump of bloody scalp falls to the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> I don’t wanna hurt anymore, I can't do this, just let me die—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> No! No, we're gonna figure something out.</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Merganser-Blake takes SCP-8549-1's hand, which crumbles. SCP-8549-1 does not seem to feel pain from this.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> I love you, Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> Then why won't you let me die?</p>
<p><em>[Dr. Merganser-Blake does not respond.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8549-1:</strong> <em>Why won't you just let me die?!</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8549-1 begins to sob violently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merganser-Blake:</strong> I’m going to find a cure. I’m going to fix you.</p>

<p><strong>End Recording</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum.8549.3:</strong> On 6/12/2025, Dr. Merganser-Blake filed a decommissioning proposal for SCP-8549. This proposal was approved. All samples of SCP-8549 were transferred to Site-17, and the house was burnt to the ground.</p>
<p>SCP-8549-1 was recovered prior to the fire. On the orders of Dr. Merganser-Blake, SCP-8549-1 was taken to Site-17.</p>
<p>A search for a cure is ongoing.</p>
