            <h1>SCP-8544</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8544</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Dr. Veidni is to be kept unaware of SCP-8544 and her relationship to it. Should Dr. Veidni rediscover any information regarding SCP-8544, she is to be amnestisized again. Both of these procedures have been made at Dr. Veidni's own request.</p>
<p>A single recording of SCP-8544 is stored on a secure server.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8544 designates a single anomalous event that affected Dr. Monika Veidni during a bout of recurrent sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>Originally believed to be a nightmare, Dr. Veidni did not mention the event for two weeks until a monthly session with her on-site psychiatrist, in which the event was described in vague detail. Dr. Veidni was advised to play back video footage of the night the event took place, at which point SCP-8544 was discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of the video footage documenting SCP-8544.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>02/12/2025 - 05:36am</strong></p>
<p><em>The recording shows Dr. Veidni asleep in bed, facing the ceiling. After approximately 15 seconds, her eyes open and begin looking rapidly around the room. Her face is strained and it is clear she is unable to move her body.</em></p>
<p><em>Another 20 seconds pass as Dr. Veidni struggles, until four previously-unseen humanoid figures slowly emerge from the darkest corners of the room. Dr. Veidni's breathing audibly quickens and her eyes dart from figure to figure. All are wearing similar hooded cloaks, as well as masks imitating a selection of animals: a fox, a dog<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, a wolf, and a coyote. The Fox steps across the room to Dr. Veidni's bedside. It begins to speak in a low but distinctly feminine voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Fox:</strong> She's awake. You said she was going to be asleep.</p>
<p><em>The Dog steps forward and moves around to the other side of the bed, withdrawing a stick of red chalk from its left cloak pocket. It speaks in a masculine tone.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Dog:</strong> They usually are. <em>It gestures towards The Coyote.</em> He must have fucked up the spell somehow.</p>
<p><em>The Wolf pats The Coyote on the shoulder and speaks in an androgynous voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Wolf:</strong> It doesn't matter, she won't remember much. Do you have the offering ready?</p>
<p><em>The Coyote nods and takes a small, round box out of its right cloak pocket. It removes the lid, revealing a pink, viscous substance inside. The Coyote hands the box to The Wolf, who looks towards The Dog, then The Fox, then finally back at The Coyote.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Wolf:</strong> The horizon is glowing this morning.</p>
<p><strong>The Dog, The Fox and The Coyote:</strong> As it shall tomorrow, and all the days to come.</p>
<p><em>The Wolf moves to The Dog's side as it uses its chalk to draw a red, horizontal line across the center of Dr. Veidni's chest. Tears have started to trail down her cheeks. The Fox gently caresses her hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Fox:</strong> It's okay. Just imagine you're dreaming.</p>
<p><em>The Dog draws a half circle above the line, and then a series of smaller lines moving away from it. It looks like a sunrise.</em></p>
<p><em>The Wolf raises the round box and scoops up a portion of the pink substance with its thumb. It then bends down and spreads it in a circular motion inside of the half circle. When it's satisfied, The Wolf passes the box back to The Coyote, who places the lid back on before pocketing it.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Wolf:</strong> Your turn. Play your part. <em>It gestures towards The Fox, who hesitates briefly before laying its right palm against the smeared substance.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Fox:</strong> Become.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Veidni's chest suddenly sinks inwards, creating a dark, round pit. The bottom is not visible. Despite this, Dr. Veidni's ability to breathe seems unobstructed. Her eyes peer downwards.</em></p>
<p><em>After approximately 45 seconds, a noise begins to eminate from the pit. It echoes, as if in a distant, cavernous space. It sounds like an infant crying.</em></p>
<p><em>All four figures remain still, watching the pit as the sound grows progessively louder and more erratic, until a small arm reaches out of the pit and the sound ceases entirely. The arm gradually rises upward, revealing a larger, fleshy mass that it's connected to. Three other limbs extend from the mass, varying in proportion. Its head hangs limp below its torso, attached to a neck too thin to support its weight. It has no recognisable face. Dr. Veidni has closed her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>The mass continues to rise until it is floating roughly 3 feet above Dr. Veidni. The Wolf reaches out and positions it so that it is facing the ceiling. As the four figures step back, the mass begins to grow.</em></p>
<p><em>The sounds of muscles cracking and bones splitting fill the room as its torso and limbs stretch and expand. Its arms, originally ending at malformed stubs, begin to develop hands that slowly sprout thin fingers. Shoulder-length black hair flows out of its scalp and the flesh on the side of its head moulds into a set of facial features.<br/>
It resembles Dr. Veidni.</em></p>
<p><em>Once the entity has seemingly stopped growing, The Wolf and The Coyote support it as they position it away from the bed and lower it on to its feet. The Fox reaches into its left cloak pocket and retrieves a fifth animal mask, this one imitating a rabbit. It places it over the entity's face.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Dog:</strong> Why do we even bother giving them masks? Not like they'll be around for long anyway.</p>
<p><strong>The Wolf:</strong> We're done here and the jackal's waiting on us. Let's just leave.</p>
<p><strong>The Fox:</strong> What about her? She's heard our voices. <em>It points at Dr. Veidni.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Wolf:</strong> It's as you said, remember? She's dreaming. <em>The Wolf looks directly at Dr Veidni.</em> You're dreaming.</p>
<p><em>Three of the figures walk back into the darkness, escorting The Rabbit with them. The Fox lingers for a moment, muttering under its breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Fox:</strong> Just a bad dream.</p>
<p><em>It follows the others into the dark.</em></p>
