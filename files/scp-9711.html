<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
Due to the location and number of SCP-9711 Instances, full containment is currently nonviable. All contained instances of SCP-9711 are to be housed within humanoid containment units outfitted with salinated aquatic environmental systems. Instances of SCP-9711 may be transported outside their primary containment area if requested by a Level-3 Containment Specialist. Instances of SCP-9711 may be exchanged with BSAC officials for entities they consider anomalous. Any non-Foundation individuals recovered from SCP-9711 custody are to be administered Class-C amnestics and reintegrated into civilian life. Foundation employees recovered from SCP-9711 custody may undergo psychiatric care if deemed necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP-9711 refers to a species of humanoid crustaceans inhabiting a network of undersea caverns and tunnels beneath major oceanic plates. Instances of SCP-9711 have an average height of approximately 6′3 ft, with a chitinous exoskeleton that appears red in adults and silver in juveniles, two bioluminescent xanthous eyes, and four limbs: two lower limbs for locomotion and two claw-like appendages. SCP-9711 demonstrates cognitive abilities comparable to humanity, including abstract reasoning, language, and long-term coordinated planning. The majority of SCP-9711 society is unknowingly controlled by a group of SCP-9711 known as “The Bureau of Surface Anomaly Containment,” (BSAC). BSAC doctrine asserts that humanity is an anomalous species, while SCP-9711 represents baseline reality. Recovered logs suggest that the majority of SCP-9711 are unaware of humanity’s existence, due to extensive internal information suppression by BSAC.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Discovery:</strong><br/>
The Foundation first became aware of SCP-9711 following the abduction of the entire population of a coastal town (███████) in 1927 (Designated Incident 9711-01). Subsequent investigations by Foundation researchers revealed that the town had been relocated to an undersea containment facility housing both human and anomalous specimens.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9711-1</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Incident 9711-1:</strong><br/>
<strong>Date: 1927-08-19</strong><br/>
<strong>Location: ███████, ████</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
A local resident of ███████ reported to county police that he had witnessed two people being dragged away by "sea devils” near the eastern docks. Responding officers discovered that the entire town had completely vanished. Foundation personnel embedded in law enforcement were notified, and MTF personnel were deployed to secure the area. Tracks consistent with the treads of a heavy submersible transport vehicle were found running from the town center toward ████ Bay. Over the course of 1928-1930, Foundation operatives initiated a cover-up, erasing all public records of ███████ and its former population.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9711-2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Incident 9711-2</strong><br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 1934-05-26 to 1943-10-11<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Atlantic Ocean<br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
Between 1934 and 1943, MTF Gamma-6 conducted an extended search operation to locate the displaced population of ███████. Using anomalous sonar interference recorded in ████ Bay following Incident 9711-1, Gamma-6 identified a large, non-geological mass beneath the central Atlantic.<br/>
On 1943-10-11, a deep-submergence reconnaissance sweep confirmed the structure as an artificial, multi-chambered complex of indeterminate age and construction. MTF initiated a raid on the facility, resulting in the recovery of several human captives, multiple SCP-9711 instances, and a substantial cache of BSAC administrative documents.<br/>
Recovered human subjects exhibited no signs of malnutrition or physical neglect, though most demonstrated acute psychological distress consistent with prolonged sensory isolation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-9711-49<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Vanessa Talbert, Site-44<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 1976-02-16<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> you possess a greater understanding of our language, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> I am aware of your tongue, 0089, I am a designated translator for the Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> The Bureau?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> The Bureau of Surface Anomaly Containment. I assisted your organization in translating some of our documents, in exchange for increased rations.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> How long has BSAC existed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> Since the first fish left the water.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> All right, how long has BSAC been aware of the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> Ever since you attacked our facilities three decades ago. I have been confined here since.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> Why does your kind believe we are an anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> Why do you think I am one, then?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> I don’t have the clearance to answer that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p>(Subject clicks mandibles for approximately three seconds.)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> This is going to be a real hassle for the Department of Continuity, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Talbert:</strong> Wait, how familiar are you with the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9711-49:</strong> I wasn’t referring to your department.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Following the interview, SCP-9711-49 was returned to its containment unit without incident. A review of BSAC organizational terminology is ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>CONTAINMENT MANDATES:</strong><br/>
Containment of BSAC-0089 is currently infeasible due to its proliferation across continental crust zones.<br/>
All seized organisms of BSAC-0089 are to be placed within reinforced <strong>[UNTRANSLATABLE: “self-aware dangerous fauna”]</strong> vaults.</p>
<p>Prolonged dryness destabilizes personnel carapaces; thus, handling must be performed by moisture-shelled specialists only.</p>
<p>Specimens may be exchanged with representatives of the “SCP” class when politically advantageous.</p>
<p>Recovered non-Bureau individuals from BSAC-0089 custody are to receive memory-erosion rites before reintroduction to their origin swarms.</p>

<div style="border:1px solid #471212; padding:15px; background:#140c0c; margin-top:15px;">
<p><strong>ENTITY OVERVIEW:</strong><br/>
BSAC-0089 is a warm-blooded, soft-shelled surface species dispersed across continental crustplates.<br/>
Exhibits cognitive range comparable to SCP-9711, including abstract modeling, symbolic language, and long-form strategic planning.</p>
<p>BSAC-0089 populations are unknowingly overseen by a class self-designating as <strong>“SCP.”</strong><br/>
This class maintains authority through information choke-points, ritual documentation, and the false doctrine that SCP-9711 is an anomaly.</p>
<p>SCP doctrine asserts that dry regions are the world’s natural center, and that BSAC-0089 represents the correct configuration of life.</p>
