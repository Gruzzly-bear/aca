<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The <a href="/secure-facility-dossier-site-106">Department of Procurement and Liquidation</a> will attempt to acquire all outstanding debt and the entirety of shares of SCP-7997 in a gradual process. The Departments of Financial Esoterica and Tactical Theology will perform continual risk assessment during this process.</p>
<p>If no adverse anomalous effects are detected, liquidation of SCP-7997 shall proceed post-acquisition.</p>
<p>The anomalous effects of SCP-7997 corporate votes and agents shall be subject to ongoing misinformation campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7997, or "the company", is Brachistone Shoe Polish Company, a publicly-traded specialty shoe polish manufacturer which achieved apotheosis on July 23rd, 2021.</p>
<p>SCP-7997 was founded in 1977 in the United States of America as a specialty provider of high-quality shoe polish for fetish footwear. The value of the company is uncertain; SCP-7997 does not have a quoted stock price on major equity exchanges but was listed as over-the-counter pink-sheet stock starting in 2009. SCP-7997 is illiquid; share trades on average four times a year at prices ranging between $1 and $10.</p>
<p>Over 60% of SCP-7997 is owned by corporate officers ("C-Suite") of the company. The remaining 40% is estimated to be held by several hundred individuals, such as retail investors and former members of the company.</p>
<p>SCP-7997 has avoided regulatory scrutiny for the majority of its existence due to its small size, specialized industry, and <a href="/goc-supplemental-arad">minimal use of thaumaturgy</a>.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Therefore, the exact processes that led to SCP-7997's apotheosis are unknown. JTF Chi-2 ("Unto Caesar"), a joint task force of the Departments of Financial Esoterica and Tactical Theology, theorize that internal SCP-7997 corporate processes, employee actions taken on behalf of the company, or a combination of such fulfilled the criteria to serve as an apotheosis ritual. The nature of these actions is currently unknown. It is believed that the apotheosis of SCP-7997 was not an intentional decision by members of Brachistone but rather the result of a series of random fortuitous events.</p>
<p>SCP-7997 possesses an outsized metaphorical font of divine power (referred to in various cultural traditions as <em>numen</em>, <em>kami</em>, <em>mana</em>, etc.). This power can be exerted locally for a wide variety of reality-warping applications, but over extended ranges the power can only be exerted in relation to SCP-7997's domains. SCP-7997's spheres of divine influence appear to be shoe polish manufacturing, fetish gear maintenance, and naphtha<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> distillation. For example, employees of SCP-7997 are capable of reconfiguring their workspaces at will (e.g. matter synthesis and manipulation). However, outside of the SCP-7997 primary office and specialty shops, the matter manipulation capabilities of SCP-7997 have only been detected in cost-free dominatrix boot repair and anomalously efficient petroleum distillation.</p>
<p>The Foundation is aware of several corporations with anomalous capabilities. The internal functions of SCP-7997 are opaque; SCP-7997's classification as a deific entity stems from qualitative comparative analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>The internal structure of SCP-7997 remains corporate; it has not adopted the characteristics of a church, temple, or other religious or otherwise non-corporate hierarchy (See <a href="/scp-4985">SCP-4985</a> for examples of an anomalous corporation with significant cultural alteration). The previous corporate culture of Brachistone Shoe Polish Company has been preserved, including self-professed "long-standing values" of "speaking up". No new indicators of corporate malfeasance have been detected post-apotheosis.</li>
<li>SCP-7997 does not appear to have agency of its own. SCP-7997 possesses a divine godhead but does not appear to have a greater agenda beyond the goals of its corporate officers and shareholders. Unlike <a href="/scp-1442">SCP-1442</a>, there is no evidence SCP-7997 is sentient.</li>
<li>SCP-7997 has achieved noospheric dominion over the process of shoe polish manufacture with minor dominion over related domains. The most immediate effects are that all 70 employees of SCP-7997 become abnormally knowledgeable and competent with regards to aspects of shoe polish manufacture pertaining to their job titles. For example, production line engineers develop an innate sense of how many batches can be produced daily, and accountants are aware of the exact market value of shoe polish at any time. However, this knowledge is not retained upon departure from the company, suggesting that even if employee actions were involved in SCP-7997's apotheosis, the divine power is vested in the company itself and not in the individuals comprising it.</li>
<li>After Witching Hour (00:00-00:59 local time) of July 23rd, 2021, thaumaturgically-potent corporate actions performed as part of the corporate functions of SCP-7997 stopped producing any residual EVE radiation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, instead manifesting irregular Akiva<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> bursts. This is analogous to a mage-king/god-king phase transition, in which a humanoid Reality Bender or Thaumaturge<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> achieves apotheosis and becomes a divine entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> (Leiner et al. 2009).</li>

Each possesses a miniscule fraction of SCP-7997's power that can only be applied for purposes associated with their job duties e.g. SCP-7997's "Logistics Representatives" increase the efficiency of petroleum distilleries they order raw naphtha from, and "Public Relationship Managers" produce repair instructions for specialty adult equipment that violate Conservation of Mass using divine power.

They can be viewed as analogous to intercessionary saints or deific epithets and are capable of performing "miracles". For example, Brachistone CFO Sally Terrafino recently anomalously increased the demand for Brachistone Shoe Polish without also decreasing price, in violation of the Law of Supply and Demand.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></div>

</div>
<p>SCP-7997 is currently a unique phenomenon. However, the stochastic condensation of its apotheosis suggests that another such event could occur without prior indication, though the failure of such an event to occur for the hundreds of years since the birth of the modern corporation suggests it is incredibly unlikely.</p>
<p>The brand recognition of Brachistone is extremely limited. Despite this, traditional academics and business leaders have already begun to notice its anomalous performance; embedded Foundation assets in academic and trade publications have rejected multiple papers analyzing SCP-7997.</p>
<p>It is believed that nobody understands how SCP-7997 achieved apotheosis, and business process security policies have prevented detailed investigations. By a stroke of good fortune, Brachistone Shoe Polish Company does not have a dedicated division for esoteric market research. However, we believe that several major corporations, several of which are experienced in augmenting their competitive advantage via esoteric means, are currently attempting to recreate corporate apotheosis.</p>
<p>Previous corporate meddling in esoteric affairs has had significant adverse effects. The <a href="/scp-570">1999 deconceptualization of all ingestible liquids except for a proprietary soft drink</a> was achieved without the benefits endowed by divinity; should a corporation with the experience and will to exploit divine power successfully attain apotheosis, a CK-Class Restructuring Scenario would likely follow. It was fortunate that the SCP-7997 phenomenon happened to a relatively innocuous company. Further research will focus on adapting reliable existing deity management procedures developed by the Department of Tactical Theology for corporate deities.</p>
</div>
<p>The following are under ongoing research. Joint Task Force Chi-2 ("Unto Caesar"), comprised of subject matter specialists from the Department of Financial Esoterica and the Department of Tactical Theology, have provided a set of hypotheses to these corporate phenomena likely to arise during the course of containment. As this is a developing containment matter, several corporate events have multiple speculated theological analogies.</p>

<strong>2.</strong> Demigod. The part-divine offspring of a deific entity.

It is extremely unclear what circumstances might cause this. The company might cease to exist in a traditional bankruptcy, or the deific entity of SCP-7997 might abandon its domain.
