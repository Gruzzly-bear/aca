<p>Photo of SCP-3845 during containment attempt #4</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3845 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-88" target="_blank">Site-88</a>. Testing of SCP-3845 must be approved by staff of Level 3+/3845 clearance and higher.</p>
<p>Field agents stationed on Pitcairn Island are to continue searching for material suggesting SCP-3845's existence, specifically Artifact 1-5 instances (See Addendum 1).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3845 is a humanoid entity, roughly two meters tall. SCP-3845's head/torso takes the shape of an ellipsoid, with legs and arms extending off of it, long and tubular in shape. Hands take a shape similar to the head, and feet are simply 90° bends in the legs. Facial features are present on the front of SCP-3845's head, though the eyebrows are the only features capable of moving or contorting.</p>
<p>SCP-3845's limbs have no definite joints, allowing them to contort to extremes with ease. Due to this, SCP-3845 is capable of feats such as jumping as high as six meters and running as fast as 89 km/h, which allowed it to escape Foundation forces numerous times prior to its containment.</p>
<p>Prior to containment, SCP-3845 resided on Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific Ocean. At that time, SCP-3845 was typically docile, and took a liking to humans and other wildlife. Despite being incapable of speaking, SCP-3845 could easily cooperate with humans and seemed to have an innate understanding of their social cues. Due to this, SCP-3845 became well-known among the residents of Pitcairn Island, though was most often seen engaging with a Sarah ███████, age 15 (See Addendum 2). SCP-3845 also favored certain toys and foods.</p>
<p>For information on SCP-3845's current behavior, please see Addendum 3.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Multiple artifacts have been retrieved from Pitcairn Island during previous containment attempts of SCP-3845, with several dating to 1384 AD, all of which have been linked to SCP-3845 by appearance. These artifacts include:</p>
<ol>
<li>A wooden carving of a figure resembling SCP-3845</li>
<li>Several severed body parts resembling those present in SCP-3845</li>
<li>Imprints in hardened soil resembling feet tracks made by SCP-3845</li>
<li>Sandstone engravings describing a possible anatomy of SCP-3845</li>
<li>Sandstone engravings depicting several SCP-3845 instances being hunted and severed</li>
</ol>
<p>It is believed that Artifacts 1, 4, and 5 were created by a group of Polynesians native to the Pitcairn Islands during SCP-3845's existence, and that Artifacts 2 and 3 were directly created by SCP-3845.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> During SCP-3845 containment attempt #6, prior to containment, a GPS Tracker was planted on SCP-3845. Audio and panoramic video recorders were equipped for further analysis of SCP-3845's behavior. The Foundation successfully received information from the tracker for over 29 hours before losing contact. The events recorded through this tracker are documented in the sub-addenda below.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This transcript begins at the moment of tracker activation at approximately 8:43 AM<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, sixteen minutes into containment attempt #6. Speech heard at the beginning of transmission originated from a <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#epsilon-6" target="_blank">MTF Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots")</a> operative, specifically Susan ███████ (Beta-2).</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Transcript&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> No, I think I… wait, it's on! The tracker's on!</p>
<p><em>Silence for four seconds. Beta-2 is seen driving a motor bike roughly one meter behind SCP-3845 as it continues running through a forested region.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> We're heading east. It's taking a straight path. Guard the beaches, everyone. Have the net ready, Beta-10. Don't stress too much now, we… got the tracker on.</p>
<p><em>Silence for ten seconds. Loud rustling is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> It's speeding up, and… it's getting… more forested. Beta-3 and -4 are in town, right? … Good. If it heads west, Beta-5 is there. If it continues east, Beta-7… is there. Beta-8 is south. We got this.</p>
<p><em>Silence for six seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> Oh, Beta-6, uh… head to Beta-7. Quick. Everyone go to Beta-7, go east. It's pretty close to shore, so let's not take any chances. We can bring it down there.</p>
<p><em>Silence for five seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> Wait, I… I have a leak? What the hell? It's spewing everywhere! I'm slowing down, slowing down.</p>
<p><em>Beta-2's voice quickly becomes more faint as SCP-3845 runs farther from Beta-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>Beta-2:</strong> Fuck, no! It took a turn, to the town! Head for the town! Don't let it get near the…</p>
<p><em>Beta-2 becomes inaudible. SCP-3845 runs for several more minutes before slowing to a walking pace. SCP-3845 eventually reaches Adamstown, the only settlement on the island, and approaches a house. Once in front of the house, SCP-3845 repeatedly and rhythmically bangs its head against the front door. After a few seconds, Sarah ███████ opens the front door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Uh… hey. Sorry, I just I just woke up, like… two minutes ago. You can just… yea, come in.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 walks into the house, and enters the living room. SCP-3845 walks up to a couch and stands on it. Beta-3 and -4 confirm SCP-3845's presence in Adamstown, and containment attempt #6 is cancelled.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Uh, okay. I'm gonna brush my teeth.</p>
<p><em>Sarah walks into the bathroom. The sound of a running faucet is heard moments later, and lasts for three minutes. Afterward, Sarah exits the bathroom, rubbing her face with her hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Now… time for breakfast.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 follows Sarah into the kitchen and sits on a stool in front of the counter. Sarah gets a box of Captain Crunch™ and Rice Krispies™ cereal from a cupboard and sets them on the counter, as well as milk and two paper bowls. Sarah proceeds to pour milk and cereal into each bowl.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Okay, let's eat!</p>
<p><em>Sarah slides the bowl of Rice Krispies™ to SCP-3845 and proceeds to eat from the bowl of Captain Crunch™. SCP-3845 slowly immerses its hands into its bowl of cereal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Oh, sorry, I forgot you didn't use milk. Wow, I'm just really out of it to-</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 pours its entire bowl of cereal over its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Okay. Cool.</p>
<p><em>Sarah glances across the counter at a half-folded piece of paper.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Grab that for me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 reaches across the counter, grabs the paper and hands it to Sarah. Upon opening the paper, Sarah sees a message which reads "I got another call from work. Take care of the house for a few days like last time, but use my money wisely! Love you bunches, mom."</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> …</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 begins to pour itself more cereal. Sarah puts her hands over her face and starts to sob. She then abruptly leaves the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Every time. Every damn time! She makes shit up over and over. <em>Oh, it's okay, I work from home now. We can be together again.</em> Fuck that! We haven't talked in weeks!</p>
<p><em>Sarah bangs her fists on the wall and then sits down on the floor next to it. She puts her head in her lap and sobs. SCP-3845 sits down next to Sarah, still holding the box of Rice Krispies™.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> <em>(muffled)</em> Just leave me alone for once.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 remains silent for three seconds. Afterward, SCP-3845 pours the Rice Krispies™ over Sarah. After a few more seconds, Sarah begins laughing hysterically, and lifts her head up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I can't. I can't help it. You're so stupid.</p>
<p><em>Sarah reaches over and hugs SCP-3845. Sarah continues laughing, but starts to sob again. Sarah lets go of SCP-3845 and wipes off her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … You're literally the only one I have at this point. There's no one else.</p>
<p><em>Silence for five seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … I guess you're awesome enough though. Who needs to know a bunch of people when you have a tall, uh… thing, for a friend.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 does a single nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Yea. A really, really cool tall thing for a friend.</p>
<p><em>Silence for three seconds. Sarah shifts in position.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Welp, this day is off to a good start. Now, let's… let's start cleaning this stuff up, Buddy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This transcript begins 16 hours subsequent to the events in Transcript 01, at approximately 8:12 AM.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Transcript&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 is seen moving at a walking pace through a forested region. SCP-3845 eventually reaches Mason's Point, Pitcairn Island's peninsula, and begins thoroughly surveying the landscape. Upon reaching the shoreline, an Artifact 2 instance is discovered and observed by SCP-3845, resembling an intact SCP-3845 head and face. The instance is notably weathered and tarnished, with a dark pigment running down the face from the eyes. SCP-3845 picks up the instance with its hands shaking, and wipes the pigment from under its eyes. SCP-3845 sets down the instance, and begins wiping dark fluid from beneath its own eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 continues surveying Mason's Point, and later comes back to the Artifact 2 instance and carries it off the peninsula. SCP-3845 heads back towards Adamstown, and arrives at Sarah's house. SCP-3845 ordinarily knocks on the front door with its right hand. Sarah opens the front door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Well hello again! What happened to head-butting the door?</p>
<p><em>Sarah sees the Artifact 2 instance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Oh… another one.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 places the instance next to the front door, in a pile of several other Artifact 2 instances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> All in one week. There were a lot of them, I guess…</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 stares at the pile of instances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … So are you ready to do stuff? Oh wait— so, you may be wondering why I'm actually up this early… maybe not, but… I basically have a surprise for you. Wait here, it's almost done.</p>
<p><em>Sarah closes the front door. SCP-3845 continues waiting for over 16 minutes before Sarah opens the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Come in!</p>
<p><em>Sarah leaves the door open and runs back into the house. SCP-3845 follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Over here, in the bathroom!</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 walks into the bathroom, and finds Sarah standing next to a bathtub, which is completely filled with Rice Krispies™.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Ta-da! Go ahead, embrace the, uh… cereal! Of rice!</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 stands inside of the tub and slowly immerses itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> What do you think?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 hesitantly does a single nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … It better be! I used half of my mom's wallet on all that. Can I sit in it next?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 emerges from the tub and stands against the wall. Sarah runs up and jumps into the tub.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Ow… this is solid! How did you sink in it?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 does an exaggerated and prolonged shrug.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Whatever. Next up, adding milk!</p>
<p><em>Sarah runs out of the bathroom and into the kitchen, but SCP-3845 proceeds to leave the house and walk down the street. Sarah does not seem to notice until several moments later, and can be heard calling out "Buddy!" once SCP-3845 has entered a forested region.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 proceeds to survey the region similarly to how it did previously, and finds several minor Artifact 2 instances. After 60 minutes, SCP-3845 comes across a single Artifact 4 instance in notably good condition, and picks it up. SCP-3845 stares at the instance, and then abruptly shatters it. SCP-3845 smears over each remaining piece with soil.</em></p>
<p><em>Nearby, SCP-3845 discovers a set of four intact Artifact 5 instances, stacked on top of one another. SCP-3845 proceeds to spread each instance out on the ground, and frantically looks back and forth across each one. SCP-3845's hands begin to shake once more, and it raises its right hand over the first Artifact 5 instance, before hesitating and lowering its hand. SCP-3845 sits on the ground with its hands over its eyes for several more minutes before calming down and continuing to survey the landscape.</em></p>
<p><em>Near a large tree stump, SCP-3845 discovers an Artifact 2 instance, resembling an intact SCP-3845 head, face, and left leg. The instance is significantly weathered and tarnished, with multiple arrowheads inserted into its head. Dark pigment is splattered across the face. SCP-3845's hands begin to shake once more as it kneels over the instance and excretes more dark fluid from its eyes. SCP-3845's hands and feet become noticeably more pale.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 charges back towards the Artifact 5 instances and violently breaks each one. The shattered remains are then broken once again. SCP-3845 summarily hunches over on the ground, with its body shaking, banging its hands repeatedly on the ground. While frantically looking around, SCP-3845 finds a piece of a previously intact Artifact 5 instance, depicting a young, unhappy female. SCP-3845 grasps the piece and begins excreting dark fluid from its eyes once again. SCP-3845 promptly runs out of the forested region and out onto the beach again, where it finds Sarah.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> … Buddy! I've been looking everywhere for you! Where have you been? What's that dark stuff—</p>
<p><em>SCP-3845 runs up to Sarah and tightly hugs her while sobbing and shaking. Sarah eventually hugs back, with a concerned expression. Sarah then notices the GPS tracker on SCP-3845, and reaches for it. Transmission cuts out.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Transcript&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The GPS tracker was found broken within Sarah's house. The aforementioned pile of Artifact 2 instances was later contained at Site-77.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> During SCP-3845 containment attempt #9, SCP-3845 was <a href="/your-guard">successfully contained</a>, and containment procedures were updated to reflect this. Since containment, SCP-3845 has been most commonly banging against the walls of its cell, or curled up in the corner of its cell sobbing. SCP-3845 has acted with extreme hostility towards all personnel.</p>
<p>All Pitcairn Island residents were promptly administered amnestic following SCP-3845's containment. Sarah ███████ was notably last to be amnesticized due to her extreme struggle with the on-site Field Agents.</p>
