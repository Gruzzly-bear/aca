<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2116 is never to be further than 10 meters from SCP-2116-1 at any time. The individual designated as SCP-2116-1 is currently a female, aged 20. SCP-2116-1 will never willingly part with SCP-2116. When SCP-2116-1 expires for any reason, a replacement must be found within 12 hours. The age of the individual designated as SCP-2116-1 is irrelevant, testing has shown that when a suitable subject is found the anomalous nature will subside. SCP-2116-1 must be a female subject, as males seem to be unaffected by the anomalous nature of SCP-2116. Once a suitable candidate has been located, SCP-2116 is to be handed over to the subject by a male researcher. Selection criteria for SCP-2116-1 is listed below in Addendum 1.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2116 is a child's doll manufactured sometime in the mid-19th Century. SCP-2116 is dressed in a simple red cotton dress with cloth shoes and garments consistent with 19th Century garb. The head is constructed of standard bisque porcelain and painted to resemble an adult female. SCP-2116 is otherwise unremarkable in appearance other than the accumulation of a substantial amount of dirt and grime on the surface.</p>
<p>If SCP-2116 is further than 10 meters from the current SCP-2116-1 for longer than 5 minutes, its anomalous property will manifest as an alteration to reality within a 1 meter radius centered on SCP-2116 itself. The environment, decor, ambient temperature, and furnishings become altered to be more attractive to a prepubescent human female. Tables will be set with a pink tea set with a teapot filled with a sweet red liquid, various sweet treats will manifest, and the table cover will become a lace tablecloth of a style popular during the mid-19th Century. For every hour that SCP-2116 is not in the possession of SCP-2116-1, the region of altered reality expands by 1 meter. Testing has shown that items removed from this region of altered reality retain their altered properties and food items created are non-toxic and will decay at the same rate as normal items of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> SCP-2116 was first discovered when Foundation agents embedded in the ██ State Patrol detected a call to investigate a house with a dead body. Foundation agents responded to the call and discovered the home of [REDACTED] changed entirely. The entire house, which had been a ranch style dwelling built in the early 1960's, had been changed to a Victorian style two story dwelling with a steeply pitched roof, wide front porch and a turret style gable on the front corner. All internal furnishings had been altered and featured sofas, paintings and other items consistent with mid-19th Century homes. In an upstairs bedroom, agents found the body of [REDACTED], an 80-year-old female. An autopsy revealed nothing unusual. The victim had apparently expired due to a sudden massive myocardial infarction. Interviews with neighbors revealed that the occupant of the house had been an 11-year-old child. Statements indicate that the neighbors did not find anything unusual about a child living alone in the house. Research into possible memetic effects from SCP-2116 are still pending. Neighbors state that for as long as they had known the victim, she would never allow SCP-2116 to be out of her grasp. Class B amnestics were administered to neighbors and city records were altered to show that the house had always been a two story Victorian.</p>
<p>During recovery, Agents noted that surroundings were being altered as they were investigating and proceeded with due haste. Agent [REDACTED] became a casualty during the recovery process when she apparently removed SCP-2116 from the grip of the victim. Agents accompanying her state that they heard a scream from the upstairs bedroom and subsequently found an oil portrait of Agent [REDACTED] dressed in mid-19th Century clothing with SCP-2116 on the floor next to it. Male agents were able to handle SCP-2116 with no ill effects. It was after SCP-2116 was placed in containment that researchers noted that the rate of conversion was increasing. A D-Class female was brought in as a test to see how the anomalous nature of SCP-2116 would respond. The D-Class, now designated as SCP-2116-1, had been committed to life in ███████ State Mental Hospital after a psychiatric evaluation determined that she was mentally incompetent to stand trial. SCP-2116-1 has been in a persistent catatonic state since her arrest in ████</p>

<p>The rate of alteration of the surroundings of SCP-2116 increased noticeably following this test to 1.5 meters/hour. Foundation researchers located a second suitable female D-Class subject. The subject, now designated SCP-2116-1 was a 19-year-old female convicted of brutally stabbing a man while working as a prostitute. Subject was handed SCP-2116 by Researcher █████.</p>

<p>The rate of alteration did not change following this test. It is theorized that there is an upper limit to the rate of change possible.</p>
<p>A third D-Class female was brought in for testing. This subject, designated SCP-2116-1 is a 20-year-old female who was incarcerated for burning down a church following an attempt at an exorcism by her parents and the local priest.</p>

<p>A complete search of the site of the initial discovery revealed a photo album containing photos of the deceased subject (designated SCP-2116-0) holding SCP-2116 as a small child. The photograph is dated 1943. Interviews with neighbors indicated that it was the same child that lived in the house. Older photos in the album show a deceased elderly female, presumed to be a relative of SCP-2116-0 holding the same doll. It is unknown at what point SCP-2116 assumed its anomalous properties. All pictures in the photo album featuring SCP-2116-0 show SCP-2116 in its possession.</p>
<p>Currently SCP-2116-1 has had SCP-2116 in her possession for 65 days. No anomalous changes have been detected during this time.</p>
