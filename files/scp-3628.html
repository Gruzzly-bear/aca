<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-3628 was recovered from the home of one Trevor Ames, an antiques dealer who died under suspicious circumstances following a public feud with known members of a Sarkic cult.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3628</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3628 may not be handled by permanent Foundation personnel except with written permission of an O5 council member, or Site 36's Director of Research. The object is to be stored inside a non-reactive plastic case suitable for permanent preservation of antique metal or lacquered objects, inside a standard locking cylindrical Foundation carrier filled with pressurized argon gas.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3628 is a bronze inkwell measuring 8cm tall and 6cm in diameter, engraved with an intricate design. The object has a deep patina, suggestive of advanced age, but carbon dating of the object is inconclusive.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-3628 may be touched or handled without the object's anomalous effect triggering, so long as for the duration of handling, the subject's mind remains focused on the present moment and does not drift into reminiscence or abstract thought.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> If the subject's attention wavers even briefly, he or she will experience an intensely absorbing and tangential thought, usually relating to matters the subject has put off and can no longer address.</p>
<p>Once triggered, the subject is permanently designated an instance of SCP-3628-1.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Instances of SCP-3628-1 are compelled by unknown means to recite the time remaining before their death. If they are already speaking, the recitation will match their pre-existing volume and cadence; otherwise, it will be recited at conversational volume typical for the speaker.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The remaining time announced by the subject decreases linearly as time passes from initial exposure, and no known method has been devised to alter the indicated time. At the conclusion of the self-narrated countdown, referred to hereafter as the Expiration Date, every instance of SCP-3628-1 has expired, within a one-minute margin of error.</p>
<p>Subjects respond to their countdown in a variety of ways, with a majority presenting panic or despair. It is unclear whether this is another anomalous effect of exposure, or a property of normal psychology. Many subjects are on record responding with resignation, terror, bargaining, or denial.</p>
<p>It is currently theorized that SCP-3628 is <em>not</em> infohazardous or memetic in nature, as amnestic treatment is ineffective in preventing either the narration or the predicted time of death.</p>
<p>Cause of death is loosely correlated with exposure to SCP-3628's anomalous effect, with roughly 3█% of subjects succumbing to chronic exhaustion, exhaustion-related accidental death,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> or suicide. The majority of subjects' expiration dates will coincide with their pre-scheduled termination, where applicable.</p>
<p>Unless dictated otherwise by an approved test plan, all D-Class personnel involved in experimentation must have their terminations scheduled, with copies of all related paperwork filed with the Head of Research at Site 70 no less than 24 hours before the experiment. D-Class who are eligible for amnestic cycling are not eligible for testing SCP-3628 under any circumstances. Termination dates must be memorized by at least two (2) personnel holding Class 8 inforesistance and temporal recall certificates. Breach of secrecy regarding an individual D-Class's termination date is grounds for rejection of that D-Class from all associated testing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-80592-04, Jamaican female, age 24<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Claude L███████████, Research Lead</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The purpose of this experiment is to verify that the object's properties match the analysis provided by the Intake Team. The subject, <em>D-80592-04 is scheduled for termination on 08/10/198█, after aggressive behavior toward other D-Class across several amnestic cycles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Good morning, D-80592-04. Are you comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> It's cold in here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Yes, it is. [brief pause] Would you mind describing the object in the box?</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> Um, yeah. It's… [sound of latch opening, followed by a hiss of gas] …it's a knick-nack.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> More detail, please.</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> It's, like, some kind of machine. No, sorry, a… paperweight? A tiny box? It's… heavy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> D-80592-04, I did not instruct you to handle the object.</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> Yeah? That a fact, you…</p>
<p>[Long pause]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Subject D-80592-04?</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> What? Fine. My bad. I am going to die in six days, two hours, and one minute. Jesus Christ. No I'm not. Did you make me say that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Try to remain calm.</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> That's freaky [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Please place the object back inside the case.</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> I'm not touching that thing again until you tell me what the [EXPLETIVE DELETED] is going on! Why did I say that? I am going to die in six days, two hours. No I'm not. I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not.</span> Can you stop it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> D-80592-04, pick up SCP-3628 and place it back inside the case.</p>
<p><strong>D-80592-04:</strong> [EXPLETIVE DELETED] you! I'm not doing what you [EXPLETIVE DELETED] tell me! You guys are sick. Every one of you, in your lab coats, you're sick people! I'm calling my lawyer and you're going to jail, you sick son of, I am going to die in six days, one hour, and fifty-nine minutes! Make it stop!</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>Subject D-80592-04 was mechanically sedated and returned to her housing unit, and was terminated on schedule six days, one hour, and fifty-nine minutes later.</em></p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>The purpose of this experiment was to establish whether intentionally distracting the subject would trigger the anomalous effect. The subject, D-79484-01, was convicted of sexual assault and double homicide during a particularly gruesome home invasion and was consequently tried as an adult. Subject's psychological profile indicates paranoia, anxiety, and substantial violent impulses. Subject is shackled to the examination chair. Subject is scheduled for termination on 24/12/198█.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Claude L███████████, Research Lead</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Good evening, D-79484-01.</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01</strong> does not respond.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Would you mind describing the object in the box?</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01</strong> continues to ignore the question, but begins to fidget.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> D-79484-01, if you do not cooperate with the test protocol, I cannot help you. It's your future at stake.</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> It's a metal box.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> How old does it look?</p>
<p><em>[Long pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Not old. It looks fake old. Like something you'd pick up at P███ ██.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> I want you to pick it up, and estimate how much it weighs. Please keep your attention on the object as we proceed.</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>D-79484-01</strong> retrieves SCP-3628 from the case.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> It's rougher than it looks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Your weight estimate, please?</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Um, like half a pound?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> Good. Do you believe it is solid metal, or hollow?</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Uh… I dunno. Hollow. Is this an incense burner?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> That's great. Do you think your teacher deserved it?</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> I am going to die in three minutes and twelve seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Wait, what? What was the question?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L███████████:</strong> I asked whether you think your teacher deserved it. You know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> I don't… I don't want to talk about it. I am going to die in two minutes and forty seconds. Why did I say that? Are you mind controlling me?</p>
<p><em>[<strong>D-79484-01</strong> grows visibly agitated, and thrashes against restraints. D-79484-01 throws SCP-3628 against the wall of the interview room. Interviewer L███████████ leaves the interview room without further comment, in breach of written test plan.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-79484-01:</strong> Where are you [EXPLETIVE DELETED] going? Help! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Help me!</span> I am going to die in two minutes and eight seconds!</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>Subject <strong>D-79484-01</strong> died of stress-induced cardiac arrest roughly two minutes after Dr. L███████████ left the room. Although the autopsy could not conclusively rule out any direct anomalous mechanism of death, it is reasonably likely death was a natural result of the psychological distress placed on the subject. Dr. L███████████ was placed under immediate ethical review for his conduct during the course of 3628/A3, and has been reassigned to SCP-███ pending on the board's decision.</em></p>

After several inconclusive tests, D-92039-09 was selected on the basis of his unusual psychological and memetic resistance profile, the utility of which had justified an initial termination date two years ahead, on 03/03/199█.

<p><em>D-92039-09 was placed in a standard Foundation anomalous humanoid containment chamber. Due to his unexpectedly distant expiration date, D-92039-09's termination date was temporarily suspended pending full administrative review.</em></p>
