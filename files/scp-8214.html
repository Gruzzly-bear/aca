<p>SCP-8214-A is currently stored within a portable hard drive for testing purposes and kept within a low-yield anomalous storage locker at Site-111 when not in use. Backup copies of SCP-8214-A are stored in IT Department servers at Site-15.</p>
<p>A database of all known SCP-8214-B instances and their corresponding SCP-8214-C instances is to be maintained by the Department of Prophetics.</p>
</div>
<div class="modal">
<p><span class="text"><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></span></p>
<p>SCP-8214-A is the software <em>"ATROPOS.EXE"</em>. When running on a device SCP-8214-A displays a rudimentary interface consisting of a list of names comprising all human beings within a 10-meter radius below which is the prompt “<em>SELECT NAME</em>” and a command line to enter text. SCP-8214-A does not distinguish between living and deceased individuals, and further testing has established SCP-8214-A will only list individuals when a majority of their biomass remains within the 10-meter radius. Depending on the text input into the command line SCP-8214-A will produce the following effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>When input with text not corresponding to any of the listed names SCP-8214-A will output the text <em>“INVALID”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When input with the listed name of a deceased individual SCP-8214-A will output a date matching their known time of death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When input with the name of a currently living individual SCP-8214-A will output an apparently random date typically ranging 1-4 months into the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>These dates, designated SCP-8214-B, act as Class I Prophetic Anomalies which will invariably result in the death of the named individual, designated SCP-8214-C, on the output time otherwise referred to as their activation date.</p>
</div>
<div class="modal">
<p><span class="text"><strong>DISCOVERY:</strong></span></p>
<p>SCP-8214-A was first acquired in 2005 alongside other anomalies during a raid on a para-technology company formerly associated with Prometheus Labs. Initial assessment was carried out by junior researcher Emily Yoon of the IT Department. Her sudden death a year later via cardiac arrest incited an investigation that would eventually identify the prophetic effects of SCP-8214-B prompting its transfer to the Department of Prophetics in late 2006.</p>

<p><span class="test"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></span></p>
<p>One D-Class personnel, D-48457, is placed inside a standard testing chamber. D-48457 is named using SCP-8214-A designating them an SCP-8214-C instance after which security personnel inside the testing chamber are ordered to terminate D-48457 via their firearm.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>OBSERVATIONS</strong></span></p>
<p>Firearm malfunctions repeatedly when aimed at D-48457 eventually rendering the weapon inoperable. D-48457 attempts to flee the testing chamber but is physically subdued by security and returned to their cell.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></span></p>
<p>Further testing would provide similar results regardless of termination method. All attempts were unsuccessful due to either an unexpected failure of equipment or an extreme degree of perseverance on the part of the SCP-8214-C instance.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8214-B have proven unpreventable by reasonable and conventional means.<br/>

<p><span class="test"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></span></p>
<p>One D-Class personnel, D-49225, is placed in a testing chamber equipped with medical equipment. D-49225 is restrained to a monitoring bed and has their heart forcibly stopped via chemical agent. After confirming the lack of a heartbeat but before the cessation of other vital signs D-49225 is named using SCP-8214-A designating them as an SCP-8214-C instance.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>OBSERVATIONS</strong></span></p>
<p>After approximately twenty seconds D-49225 would resume regular cardiovascular activities without medical intervention.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></span></p>
<p>Analysis of medical data has revealed that the heart of D-49225 autonomously resumed function despite lacking any of the necessary bio-electrical signals to elicit such change.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8214-B do not simply predict events that will happen but actively overwrite normal causation to fulfill themselves through both conventional and anomalous means.<br/>

<p><span class="test"><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></span></p>
<p>Two D-Class personnel, D-49387 and D-51422 are named using SCP-8214-A designating them as SCP-8214-C instances. Upon their activation date D-49387 will be placed in an isolated testing chamber and monitored remotely. Whereas D-51422 will be placed under the same conditions however a medical team will remain on standby with orders to terminate D-51422 via lethal injection one hour prior to the end of their activation date.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>OBSERVATION</strong></span></p>
<p>Starting at 11:23 AM D-49387 would experience rapid deterioration in their medical condition displaying symptoms analogous to acute liver failure. D-49387 would expire from their symptoms at approximately 4:17 PM. In contrast D-51422 experienced no changes during the entire observation period. Medical staff successfully terminated D-51422 without incident at 11:35 PM.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></span></p>
<p>Further investigation into the deaths of prior SCP-8214-C instances has shown that whenever possible instances of SCP-8214-B will utilize preexisting vectors, such as known medical conditions and environmental hazards, to fulfill themselves.</p>
<p><span class="test"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8214-B are suggestible to human intent and follow “a path of least resistance” preferring to enact sequences that require the least anomalous activity and/or are the most logically plausible.<br/>

<p><span class="test"><strong>OFFICER OF RECORD</strong></span> A. Mendez</p>

<p>D-48457, an SCP-8214-C instance, was performing routine cleaning duties within Containment Sector 4 at Site-19 when a series of critical system failures resulted in the release of multiple hostile SCP objects.</p>
<p>The breach was recontained by On-Site MTF units over the course of one hour. Notably while the rest of the sector experienced some degree of technical malfunction, especially its door control systems, the containment chamber and surrounding structure inhabited by D-873625 was the only area to properly engage its automatic breach response system and seal itself off from the rest of the sector. This fact contributed significantly to the survival of D-873625 and five Foundation personnel around them at the time of the breach.</p>
<p>Whether this occurrence can be attributed to the properties of SCP-8214-B has been deferred to the Department of Prophetics.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><span class="text"><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Utilize the prophetic effects of SCP-8214-B to create a population of D-Class personnel better suited to interaction and testing with hazardous SCP objects.</p>
<p><span class="text"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></span></p>
<p>The Department of Analytics estimates that within the last decade the number of dangerous incidents involving D-Class personnel has increased by around 45%. Among said incidents 63% have resulted in the death or injury of the D-Class and 34% in the additional death or injury of other Foundation personnel. This predicament has placed significant stress on Foundation operations necessitating costly expenditures for repairs, medical services, and reprocurement of D-Class. This trend is actively detrimental to the Foundation's goals of research and containment and use of SCP-8214 is critical in combatting it.</p>
<p><span class="text"><strong>METHOD:</strong></span></p>
<p>Authorize HARMA<span class="fnnum">.</span> <span class="fncon">The Human &amp; Animal Resources Management Administration.</span><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span>to create and distribute copies of SCP-8214-A amongst its internal offices. Using these copies of SCP-8214-A HARMA will designate a specified portion, currently 15% percent, of the D-Class population as SCP-8214-C instances. By using SCP-8214-A on D-Class personnel we are able to exploit the 1st and 3rd principles of Prophetic Anomalies in order to achieve the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of D-Class personnel who by nature of SCP-8214-B are unable to expire even when exposed to highly dangerous entities and situations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enable the continued effective use of D-Class with preexisting or acquired terminal conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The decreased probability of system malfunctions, mechanical failures, and containment breaches due to SCP-8214-B attempting to follow “a path of least resistance” by enacting sequences in which SCP-8214-C instances are successfully protected by security and containment systems.</li>
</ul>
