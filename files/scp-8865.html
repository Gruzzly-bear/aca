            <h1>SCP-8865</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8865</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the improbability of SCP-8865 occurring within the Solar System, containment of SCP-8865 is limited to observation. A constant line of communication between Site-██ and the Foundation "Einstein's Folly" satellite system must be maintained in the event of SCP-8865-1 vocalizing. No action should be taken to suppress information relating to an occurrence of SCP-8865, as the natural speed of light prevents non-anomalous scientific organizations from observing it. SCP-8865-1 must be left undisturbed within its open-air containment chamber at all times, except for scheduled feeding, recreation, and veterinary care.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8865 refers to the arbitrary and spontaneous conversion of part of a planet's mass into energy. As of 05/12/20██, all planets affected by SCP-8865 were inhabited by a Type-I or greater civilization<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. This conversion invariably results in the destruction of the object affected, along with the extinction of all life inhabiting it. As of writing, it is estimated that there are 1.5 x 10<sup>16</sup> planets at risk of an SCP-8865 occurrence within the observable and post-observable universe, including Earth.</p>
<p>SCP-8865-1 is the only living member of the Asian elephant subspecies <em>E. m. Tachyonica</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, currently contained in Site-██, Sri Lanka. SCP-8865-1 is anatomically and behaviorally identical to non-anomalous members of the <em>E. maxima</em> species until such time as SCP-8865 occurs within reality. Upon the observance of SCP-8865, SCP-8865-1 will vocalize and gesture towards the direction of SCP-8865 with its trunk. This reaction is instantaneous and involuntary, and occurs even when SCP-8865-1 is asleep. After cessation of its vocalizations, SCP-8865-1 will resume normal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8865.1 — SCP-8865-1 Discovery Log:</strong> SCP-8865-1 was discovered by the Foundation in Sabaragamuwa, Sri Lanka, following a raid on the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage. The sanctuary operated as a front for the World Elephant Conservation Society, a religious organization dedicated to the de-extinction of the <em>E. m. Tachyonica</em> subspecies of Asian elephant. SCP-8865-1 was the only viable calf produced by the group's breeding program, and was revered as the "guardian of the universe" by its members. SCP-8865-1 was immediately taken into Foundation custody, and given SCP classification following the discovery of its anomalous properties during Event 8865-A1<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<strong>Addendum 8865.2 — Event Log:</strong> This log details every recorded instance of SCP-8865 since SCP-8865-1 entered Foundation custody in 1986. To date, there have been 5 recorded instances of SCP-8865.<br/>

<td>Type I. Tidally locked planet. Debris analysis reveals densely packed habitations on the dark side of the object, with largely spread-out pockets of habitation on the light side of the object. A structure several kilometres tall stood on the object's north pole. A depiction of a worm-like organism was carved throughout the entirely of its length.</td>

Entire star system colonized by one species, which served as a common ancestor for 11 new species that slowly adapted to the differing conditions of the planetary objects within 82 FOLLY-e's star system. Debris analysis was only possible with 82 FOLLY-b, and revealed portions of a tunnel dug throughout the entire length of the object. Settlements were carved into the walls of the tunnel, along with various works of art.</td>
