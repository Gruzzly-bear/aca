<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7211 is to be contained in a standard animate object containment unit at <a href="scp-6868.html">Site-228</a>. It is to be placed on a pedestal and shielded with impact-resistant glass during experiments. Only one subject at a time is allowed to be in the testing chamber with SCP-7211.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7211 is a 40 cm tall porcelain doll resembling a human male dressed in a red jester uniform, it is noted to have a distressed expression on its face. SCP-7211's anomalous properties will be triggered if there is at least one human being in SCP-7211's close proximity (2 meters or closer).</p>
<p>Once its anomalous properties are triggered SCP-7211 will become animate and start to speak. Usually, there is no conversation between SCP-7211 and the subjects, it usually stands up in front of the subjects and starts to tell various jokes, and puns. If the subjects don't find SCP-7211's performance funny they will start to cause self-harm and showcase temporary anomalous properties. (See Experiment log).</p>
<p>If the subject leaves SCP-7211's vicinity regardless of willingly or not, SCP-7211 will return to its dormant state. Interviewed subjects described the experience as "second-hand embarrassment cranked up to eleven" in unison.</p>

<td>I'm afraid for the calendar. Its days are numbered.</td>
<td>The chair D-8567 was sitting on suddenly transformed into a 100 kg tomato. D-8567 tried to lift it up and throw it at SCP-7211 but it was too heavy for him.</td>

<td>D-1462</td>
<td>How do you follow Will Smith in the snow? You follow the fresh prints.</td>
<td>D-1462 began to scream then a glass window manifested on the wall and D-1462 jumped through it. The window itself disappeared and D-1462 was later found lying unconscious on Site Director Katona's office desk.</td>

<td>D-9966</td>
<td>I only know 25 letters of the alphabet. I don't know y.</td>
<td>D-9966 ripped off both of his legs from mid-thigh and swallowed them whole then both legs grew back.</td>

<tr>
<td>D-0007</td>
<td>Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired.</td>
<td>D-0007 transformed into a bicycle and attempted to run over SCP-7211. Once the security personnel removed him from the testing chamber D-0007 transformed back but for the next two hours, he was only able to make sounds similar to a bicycle bell instead of human speech.</td>

<td>D-2377</td>
<td>I once had a dream I was floating in an ocean of orange soda. It was more of a Fanta-sea.</td>
<td>D-2377 yelled "I'm sick of this planet!" and his uniform transformed into a Superman costume then he breached containment by flying through the ceiling but later he was recaptured when he approached <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32" target="_blank">Area-32.</a> His anomalous properties ceased an hour later.</td>

<td>D-4544</td>
<td>I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it.</td>
<td>A bottle of Class-█ amnestic agent manifested in D-4544's hands which he drank resulting in the loss of at least five years of memories.</td>

<td>When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.</td>
<td>D-4269 began to laugh so hard that he started to hyperventilate and was transferred to the medical wing.</td>

<p>Following the experiment with D-4269, SCP-7211's facial expression turned from distressed to cheerful and refused to tell jokes to subjects except for D-4269.</p>
