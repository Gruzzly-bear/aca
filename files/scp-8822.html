<p><strong>Description:</strong> SDP-8822 is a set of <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_50">621</span><span class="a_48">55</span><span class="a_10">11</span></span> hand-carved stone heads, which as a result of a virally aggressive marketing campaign are referred to in <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_48">British</span><span class="a_10">Northern English</span></span> popular culture as simply <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_48">'the heads'.</span><span class="a_10">the Bradford Heads.</span></span> Each item in SDP-8822 is exquisitely beautiful. All craftsmanship is of the highest quality. Each item is tastefully weathered to some degree and material choices complement the vibrant emotions elicited by each.</p>
<p><strong>Reception</strong></p>
<p>SDP-8822 has been a monumentally successful collection for the Foundation.</p>
<p>The initial exhibit in Bradford's Cartwright Hall began slowly. The first visitors demonstrated the effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing, based solely on the intrinsic merits of the sculptures and their overwhelming beauty, bringing in more people every day; an effect that compounded upon itself, increasing the exhibits's exposure to the public exponentially. The exhibit was met with critical success and widespread appeal. However, Bradford is a city with a relatively low population and little tourism, and the market was quickly saturated before we were able to expand.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the unprecedented popularity of SDP-8822 in Bradford made the local news, and the Foundation was able to secure a lucrative contract enabling the display of SDP-8822 at other locations. See document EXPANSION STRATEGY for more information (Level 4 Clearance required).</p>
<p>As a result, SDP-8822 can be nearly solely credited with expanding the reach of the Foundation from Bradford to encompass most of North England. Each exhibit sees up to 20,000 impressions per day on average, with upcoming marketing campaigns looking to increase that number further.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8822 is a set of <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_35">seven</span><span class="a_10">four</span></span> hand-carved stone heads, <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_35">referred to as the Bradford Heads in</span></span> <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_36 empty">_</span><span class="a_35">northern UK</span></span> <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_37">popular</span><span class="a_35">British</span></span> <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_35">culture,</span></span> designated SCP-8822-1 through <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_35">SCP-8822-7</span><span class="a_10">SCP-8822-4</span></span>. <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_28">All four are made of limestone, but other</span><span class="a_10">Specific</span></span> details vary per head: <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_28 empty">_</span><span class="a_11">some are made of limestone, and some of marble;</span><span class="a_10">some are made of marble, and some of limestone;</span></span> some are detailed enough to plausibly be portraits of real people, and some are not; all are highly weathered, but some more so than others.</p>
<p><span class="ch_B"><span class="a_35">All members of SCP-8822 are exceptionally beautiful compared to visually similar carvings, likely anomalously so; this has led to their notoriety as essential artwork in the Greater Manchester region of the UK and in online circles. The most dedicated fans of SCP-8822 spend their lives in service of them.</span><span class="a_28">SCP-8822 members are generally perceived as more beautiful and significant than would be expected of a given observer's affinity to stone carvings. Observers report feelings of calmness, relaxation and belonging. This has led them to become a household name in Bradford, UK, the city in which they were recovered.</span><span class="a_23">The stone heads display the ability to influence their own perception, even retroactively, and evidence suggests the range of this effect extends as far as the 1970s.</span><span class="a_12">At least one of the members of SCP-8822, possibly all, exhibit an anomalous effect that influences perception. Observers continually report that the stone heads do not match previous descriptions, but will not confirm if it is the heads or the recorded data that differs. This is the case even for descriptions recorded during this influence.</span><span class="a_10">One or more of the four stone heads changes descriptions of itself to be inaccurate. It is not clear at this time which specifically; regardless, nonspecific descriptions of the full set of heads appear to be safe from the effect. Therefore, all SCP-8822 members are to be treated identically and interaction is to be minimised.</span></span> <iframe class="scout" loading="lazy" src="https://croquembouche.net/scp/scp-8822/scout-v1.html?contradiction=A4^,11^"></iframe></p>

<p>It's clear as day that these heads resonate with people. Even though I can't count myself amidst that cohort, I believe that this is what all artwork should strive to be. Truly commendable.</p>

<p>I always find sculptures like these difficult to form a consistent opinion about, and the Heads are no exception. They thoroughly blend the line between artwork and artefact, and perhaps this is part of their long-standing appeal — is it simply that people are unsure how to think about them? One might spend so long trying to categorise something that, after a time, it simply becomes impossible.</p>

<p>I was more than happy to queue to see the heads, but once I'd seen them and left, I couldn't help but feel everyone there was wasting their time. What a fascinating change in perspective! I recall feeling similarly foolish leaving the Louvre after wrestling through the crowd to see the Mona Lisa, but for some reason I can't <em>quite</em> put my finger on, this time feels a little different.</p>

<p>The hype around these heads is certainly intoxicating, isn't it? I tried my best but the energy just didn't quite get to me. I'll have to visit again and try harder!</p>

<p>I was stood in the crowd, early in the morning, waiting to see the heads. I looked up and saw a poster for them on the wall, and suddenly realised that I was surrounded by people with whom I share nothing. A full-bodied feeling of depression came over me, a weight that I could never hope to lift. I felt so strongly that I have wasted my life. Seeing everyone here, waiting to see these heads, craning their necks over the crowd to glimpse an early view… that's what life is about, isn't it? I haven't done anything with mine. I never did anything special or made something that people wanted to see. All I see in the mirror these days is an old man, but as long as I've got time left, I'm going to make the most of it. Thank you, heads; I never reached the front of your queue but you taught me a valuable lesson nonetheless: I will never stand in line again.</p>

<p>Even on an average day, it would be a long trip from Site-91 to Bradford by road; today, the Leeds rush hour was twice as nasty as usual. Ordinarily we'd've been dispatched a little later with a hotel room booked ahead of time; this was not the case today, and an explanation had not been forthcoming. As a result, the three of us were practically exhausted before we even arrived, so Dr. West had hopped out a couple of blocks away to pick us up some coffee. Ms. Hawthorne and I arrived at The Bradford Masonry at 08:15.</p>
<p>We entered the Masonry and were greeted by one of the volunteers who take care of the heads. Understandably hesitant to give his full name, he introduced himself only as 'Old Bob'. As agreed with the volunteer group beforehand, Old Bob left the premises to allow us free reign over the property.</p>
<p>We took the opportunity to take inventory of the shopfront:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven stone heads, arranged by Old Bob in a row on the shop counter
<ul>
<li>SCP-8822-1: Male portrait, limestone, heavily weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-2: Female portrait, limestone, heavily weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-3: Male portrait, marble, heavily weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-4: Male carving, limestone, very heavily weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-5: Male portrait, marble, lightly weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-6: Male portrait, marble, lightly weathered</li>
<li>SCP-8822-7: Female portrait, marble, lightly weathered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approximately one hundred much smaller carvings of varying quality, all bearing some resemblance to at least one of the seven heads; most are made of wood, but some of marble or limestone</li>
</ul>
<p>Having been apprised of the fact that the group of volunteers associated with the caretaking of the heads self-identifies as a religious cult, we began with a sweep of the Akiva field to assess the legitimacy of their faith.</p>

<p>I was unimpressed with these results, but Sally found them fascinating. She told me that Old Bob's presence alone should have caused a spike in the field if these heads meant anything at all to him. We made a note to interview him should the opportunity avail itself.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While we were finishing off the Akiva scan, Melanie arrived with the coffee for the three of us. I let her in, locked the door behind her, and flipped the sign on the inside of the glass to clearly indicate the shop was closed. She froze when she saw the heads on the table, I assume having psychically linked with them against her will. I broke her gaze by hurrying her along to the rear of the building.</p>
<p>The back room of the Masonry was set up as if for a support group — a ring of chairs in the middle of the room and cheap fold-up tables along the walls, holding things like paper plates and water kettles. I assumed this was where the stone head fanatics would gather for meetings and the like, but for us, it was the perfect place for a coffee break.</p>
<div class="t2-optional">
<p>We took the time to discuss how "ecstatic" we were to be investigating the famous Bradford Heads. Melanie and Sally seemed genuinely enthused at the prospect, but I'm afraid I must admit that I didn't find myself excited in the slightest. I've never been into the arts and quite honestly had never heard of these heads before today, but for their sakes I smiled and nodded and played along.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>It was about 09:30 that we roused ourselves to get some work done. Melanie had Sally head upstairs to rummage around and see if she could find some records about the business other than those on the public listing, while she had me join her in the front room to assess the heads.</p>
<p>When I entered, she'd already picked up one of the heads — <span class="ch_A"><span class="a_7 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-claire-angle">SCP-8822-7</span><span class="a_6 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-claire-straight">SCP-8822-7</span><span class="a_1 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-claire-angle">SCP-8822-7</span></span> — and was holding it up to her face, gazing into its eyes. I let her muse for a moment, thinking that at any second she'd turn to me and say something quietly profound; when that was not forthcoming, I asked her if she was alright.</p>
<p>"Hey, Vikram. I'm fine."</p>
<p>She put the head back down on the counter, seeming a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I'm just getting the psychism test underway," she explained, a little too quickly.</p>
<p>"Melanie, please. That's not safe. I saw what happened when you first came in. Let's get some baselines measured, for safety's sake, at least. Humes first."</p>
<p>"Right. Yes, of course. Humes first."</p>

<p>At 10:15 I was heading back the front room to report to Dr. West to report that it was probably safe to begin her psychism test — but I found her, yet again, holding up one of the heads to her face, staring straight into its emotionless eyes.</p>
<p>"What <em>are</em> you doing? Do you think you can get a stronger psychic link with eye contact?"</p>
<p>She put <span class="ch_A"><span class="a_7 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-angle">SCP-8822-1</span><span class="a_6 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-straight">SCP-8822-1</span><span class="a_1 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-angle">SCP-8822-1</span></span> down and turned away from me, as if to hide her expression, but for a moment — and despite her being nearly thirty years my senior — I caught a glimpse of a little girl, idolising a mentor.</p>
<p>"No, it's… it's not that."</p>
<p>"Melanie, your link is betraying you. Spill."</p>
<p>"My god, you're insufferable! Fine. Did you ever meet Site-91's senior investigator, before I took over the role?"</p>
<p>"Possibly," I replied, "but that data's not on me — I'd need to sync with DEEPWELL to be sure."</p>
<p>"Ah, nevermind. Well, before him, it was a woman named <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hecatoncheires-cycle-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Rebekah Douglas</a>. She was something of a legendary figure in the late 80s — right up there in Varga's little club. Terrifying reputation, but I met her once, shook her hand, and she seemed totally unremarkable to me. Just someone doing her job, doing it well."</p>
<p>She stopped speaking, waiting for me to ask some question to prompt her next thought. It was a stupid social cue, and I almost didn't acknowledge it.</p>
<p>"Great. So why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>She smiled, obviously having heard that entire thought process. "Months later I'd find out that she wasn't just a good agent — she was a Level-3 Psychometrist! With just a <em>touch</em> she could learn how an object thought, what it felt, its history, what it'd seen. And <em>I</em> was one of those objects. <em>I'm</em> just a Level-1 Telepath; I can't imagine."</p>

<p>She picked up a head — SCP-8822-3 — and cradled it between her hands. "At least, that's what I've been told. I never saw her again, after that. I always wondered what she saw in me."</p>
<p>Sensing my thought, she turned to face me. "No, I can't just ask her. She disappeared a few years later."</p>
<p>"Disappeared?"</p>
<p>"I only heard bits here and there. Something Sarkic, something Daevite — Varga covered it up, buried it. I never dared ask. I forgot about Rebekah for thirty years… and then, in 2022… well, you know what happened in 2022."</p>
<p>"Yeah. The largest single consensus shift in the history of the Foundation. SCP-140 was destroyed, the Daevite Empire as we knew it was a lie, and in its place was the <span class="hoverlink"><a href="scp-6140.html">Republic of Daevastan</a><sup>ⓘ</sup><span class="hoverlink-card"><span class="hoverlink-title">Republic of Daevastan</span><span class="hoverlink-text">A UN-recognised state. Successor nation to the Daevite Empire, which was forcibly suppressed from consensus reality when SCP-6140 occurred on March 20th, 2022.</span><span class="hoverlink-image" style="--src: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/fragment%3Ascp-6140-1/daevastan.jpg/medium.jpg)">-</span></span></span>."</p>
<p>"Exactly. I was safe, anchored with the rest of Site-91's senior staff. We came out on the other side unscathed — and there she was, Rebekah Douglas, thirty years older, like nothing had happened. And from her perspective, that was true. Without any anomalous Daevite influence, she lived out a relatively normal life for a Foundation employee; she had a good long career, until we showed up. I don't know what happened to her after that. I think I would have transferred somewhere else."</p>
<p>"So what's the point of all this? Are you trying to invoke latent psychometry powers?"</p>
<p>She laughed. "Maybe I am. Can you imagine what psychometry could tell us about these heads? But mostly I'm just musing. Something reminded me of her, you know. One of the heads…" — she reached forward over the counter to pick one up — "…<em>this</em> one. '-4. Doesn't it look a little bit Daevite to you?"</p>
<p>It didn't — the memories I had with me at the time only had the Republic of Daevastan, not the Daevite Empire, and certainly not its art style.</p>
<p>"There's a <em>little</em> Daevastani in it, I think. But if you think it's Daevite, why don't we run a thaumaturgy test? There should be residual—"</p>
<p>She couldn't hold back a second round of laughter, a full head-back cackle. "Oh <em>man,</em> I wish I could. But thaumaturgy is so rare these days — we just don't have that kind of equipment lying around in this consensus. A few of the older units were brought along, but you'd have to be obsessed to keep one. Not me."</p>
<p>I frowned. "I think you might be a little mixed up about thaumaturgy's rarity — the Coalition is very much present in this consensus. Sarkics, too."</p>
<p>"Is that so? I might have been misinformed."</p>
<p>Melanie put down the head in her hands and picked up <span class="ch_A"><span class="a_7 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-angle">SCP-8822-1</span><span class="a_6 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-straight">SCP-8822-1</span><span class="a_1 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-brian-angle">SCP-8822-1</span></span>.</p>
<p>"Mel, I appreciate this is a personal question, but… did you ever try to find yourself?"</p>
<p>Melanie blinked. Even with her constant unintentional psychic probing, she hadn't caught wind of this question bubbling up. "What?"</p>
<p>"You know… your original self, from this consensus. The Melanie West who was originally here, before the shift."</p>
<p>She was quiet a moment longer, and I could feel her thought process ticking away, trying to understand what I'd asked. It seemed like a perfectly reasonable question to me.</p>
<p>"It… doesn't work like that. It's a consensus shift, not a parallel universe… come on, no more distractions. Time to start doing my job. How are the Hume levels?"</p>
<p>"But you said Rebekah… whatever. Humes? Negative gradient from the heads — you'll be fine and you might even find it easier to connect than normal."</p>
<p>"Excellent news. Today, I'll take what I can get."</p>

<p>Melanie fell apart when she tried a fourth psychic connection — she stumbled backwards, hand raised to her head as if stressed to the point of injury, and I almost needed to catch her. I gently reminded her that needed to be aware of her limits, and all she could do was meekly nod — certainly not her usual response to criticism. She took my advice to go sit in the van for a while and cool off before attempting to finish the test.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sally came downstairs at 10:45. She asked about Melanie and I updated her on the situation.</p>
<p>She was about to head outside to go check on her, but we were interrupted by a knock on the glass door. Sally was visibly already walking towards it, so we couldn't justify <em>not</em> opening the door for the guy. We figured we'd hear him out.</p>
<p>Once we'd shared our cover story with him, he was happy to tell us that his name was Mike Burgerman, and he self-identified as a member of the cult associated with the Bradford Heads. I was ready to send him away, but Sally — still stuck thinking about the Akiva test result, I think — convinced me otherwise. We let Burgerman in, but on the condition that he would be answering questions for us.</p>

<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> Thanks. Forgive me, but… what exactly about the heads is there to follow?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> I'm not sure I understand.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> I think my colleague is asking, in the broadest terms, what do you <em>get</em> out of 'following' the heads? I'm sure a vague answer would be fine, like… spiritual satisfaction. We just want to understand.</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> Ah… I see. I appreciate this probably isn't the answer you're looking for, but to be honest, I mostly do it for my daughter. She's really into the Bradford Heads and it makes her happy for me to visit them, volunteer for them and what not. Her mother's not been in the picture for a few years and this has been a good constant for us.</p>
<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> How old is your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> Seven.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> What sorts of things do you do when you volunteer for the heads?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> I… you know, normal church stuff. We take shifts watching the Masonry, we spread the word, we put up pictures of them. Things like that.</p>
<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> That's not<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> That's good info, thank you. Do you guys have a website?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> Don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> How do you organise events?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> A bunch of us meet up at the Stone Head — uh, that's a deli on the other side of town. There's replicas of the heads there and all.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> We'll make sure to check it out. But if I might ask a more personal question — do you, yourself, believe in the heads?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> Believe in 'em? Sure, I can see them right over there, eh? Ha! Heh heh. Look… doing this gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Maybe, at the end of the day, the Heads themselves aren't that important to me. But everyone else seems to love them and it's important to support the community, right? I already told you I pretty much only do this to see my daughter happy.</p>
<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> She's seven — <em>does</em> it make her happy?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> What kind of question is that?</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Mike, how long have you been volunteering for?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> Uh… a while. A good long while, you know? (laughs) …ah, come on, now. I'm no good with dates.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Mike… is this your first time visiting the heads?</p>
<p><strong>BURGERMAN:</strong> That's quite insulting.</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Burgerman was eager to leave once the interview was concluded, which we permitted. For the most part, his responses had left me little more than confused, but Sally seemed like she had some thoughts percolating.</p>
<p>Either way, it was gone midday. It seemed like a good idea to rouse Melanie and get everyone together for lunch.</p>

<p>It was 14:15 or so and the three of us — Dr. West, Ms. Hawthorne and I — had just had lunch at the Stone Head Delicatessen, the place that Mr. Burgerman had mentioned. We were sitting outside at a tiny metal table under an awning and the taste of my tuna baguette had survived even the full glass of water that followed.</p>
<p>There was hardly anyone about, so Dr. West began the process of brainstorming our next steps. We had already apprised her of the happenings during her absence.</p>
<p>"So, what are we doing next?" she asked. "Any ideas?"</p>
<p>We both moved to speak, but Sally got there first.</p>
<p>"The Akiva result doesn't make any sense. If there is a religious cult — and there <em>is</em>, we've spoken to two of its members — they must have some religious significance. We must have done the test wrong. I want to try again."</p>
<p>Melanie nodded. "Vikram?"</p>
<p>"The cult itself doesn't make much sense, either." I replied. "They don't seem to have any organising principles — there's not even a Facebook group. Sure, the delicatessen is named for the heads, and there's pictures of them on the walls, and a replica of one in a display case in the restroom… but nobody here seems to care. It's not the secret cult meeting spot that Mr. Burgerman implied."</p>
<p>"Also, it's weird that they call themselves a cult; isn't it normally the other way around?" Sally added.</p>

<p>Melanie paused for a moment, and I detected a waft of reminiscence. "Were either of you ever told the nursery rhyme about the Bradford Heads?"</p>
<p>When Sally and I both indicated that we had not, she continued: "It goes like this…</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>Over down by Bradford way,<br/>
A farmer herds her flock.<br/>
Hiding 'neath the dirt she lay,<br/>
A face hewn into rock.</em></p>
</div>
<p>There's a stanza per head. It goes on a tangent about how some bishop fell in love with them. Not ringing any bells?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I've never heard of it. Maybe it's a generational thing?"</p>
<p>"No, I found it on Wikipedia while I was in the van. The article says it's well-known, so I think it's a little strange that none of us know it — not impossible, for sure, but worth double-checking. All we know right now is that the heads have a propensity for psychic connection despite not being sentient. That's not much to go on, but maybe this is related."</p>
<p>"I don't see how those two things could possibly be related."</p>
<p>"Nor me," said Melanie. "Maybe we should have a chat with Old Bob when he gets back. I'd like to speak to at least one cult member who knows what they're talking about. And I want to try linking with the heads I missed, as well."</p>

<p>"There's something in that one," Melanie said as she pulled away from '-5. "Something that didn't like me being in there as well. But it was weak, very weak."</p>
<p>"Compare it to '-1 through '-3?" Sally prompted.</p>
<p>"I didn't get anything from those. Connection, but nothing on the other side — someone picked up the phone but didn't say anything. This was like… I could hear that someone breathing at the end of the line. I don't know why it was different this time, though."</p>

<p>"I know this face."</p>
<p>"You can't know that face. That's impossible," I said. "It's hundreds of years old."</p>
<p>"No, I'm sure of it. This is Dr. Carruthers from Site-199 — he <em>was</em> one of the leading experts about the Daevite Empire. We attended a seminar in Daevastan about a year ago. The way he came across, I got the impression that… well, let's just say I had reason to remember him."</p>
<p>Sally and I glanced at each other. She must have felt our doubt.</p>
<p>"Alright, fine, it's not exactly scientific," Dr. West admitted. "I'll get in touch with Site-199 and get his profile — then you'll see what I mean, I'm sure of it."</p>

<p><strong>08:40</strong> - We arrived on site at the Salford Masonry under the guise of building surveyors. Agent Marques' initial report suggested a compulsion effect may be present, so each of us carries a compulsion monitor.</p>
<p>Gregory and I headed inside — Greg to place Kant counters around the building to set up the baseline measurement, myself to take inventory. Claire will remain outside with a theodolite for now, to survey the building.</p>
<p><strong>08:50</strong> - Arranged haphazardly around the shelves in the front room, I count 17 items that may have been for sale when the shop last opened its doors:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 small hand-carved stone statuettes, all low quality:
<ul>
<li>2 fairies,</li>
<li>1 nude female <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_29">in a fetal position,</span><span class="a_10">with no distinctive features,</span></span></li>
<li>1 gnome with a beard and pointed hat,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>9 plastic/resin garden statuettes and ornament,</li>
<li>4 stone heads:
<ol>
<li>Male, weathered,</li>
<li>Female, weathered,</li>
<li>Male, weathered,</li>
<li>Male, very weathered.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From first impressions, the Masonry would be far better described as a gift shop than anywhere where any significant amount of actual masonry took place. The four stone heads are intriguing; they're far older and seem more like archeological artefacts than modern creations — the 4th one specifically has a rather Daevite look to it. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to analyse them in detail.</p>

<p>The back room has been left in a right state from neglect over the years. Anything valuable (e.g. stoneworking tools) were likely cleared out when the shop went out of business. Stone dust is everywhere — it's clear that at least <em>some</em> stone carving took place here.</p>
<p><strong>09:20</strong> - Greg reports that the Kant counters are in position and recording Hume levels. It'll take a while for them to collect enough data for us to draw any conclusions, so I sent him upstairs to search the office and living area upstairs for business records to analyse in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>10:20</strong> - Claire finished taking measurements of the building's exterior, and I <em>had</em> told her to survey indoors as well, but I wanted to take a look at the stonework and thought I could use a second pair of eyes.</p>
<p>We each took one of the stone heads, hoping to glean some crucial insight, but it turns out Claire is as clueless as I am when it comes to geology. Not once in my life have I paid a thought to the field, but right now, I feel we're sorely missing an expert.</p>

<p>What I do feel comfortable assessing, however, is the art style. Three of the heads aren't familiar to me — could be Roman or Nordic or anything really. But the fourth was instantly recognisable. There's no question about it — <strong>this is a Daevite artefact.</strong> The artistic details give it away: how the face slope downwards, the sharp line in place of a mouth, the wide, flat curvature of the cranium — all that's missing is the traditional diamond-shaped eyes. The prospect of finding a Daevite head here in Bradford — no, better than that; of being the <em>first</em> to discover the <em>only</em> remaining artefacts of the Daevite Empire… that's <em>very</em> intriguing.</p>
<p>But, of course, I would need evidence — and what better way than to test it for thaumaturgy?</p>

<p><strong>11:15</strong> - Both Greg and Claire were in the front room when I returned — Greg had scoured what documentation he could find upstairs, and was ready to present his report. I waved away their confusion as to why I had the ARI units, and had Claire go and collect the Kant counters. I offered the spare ARI unit to Greg, who accepted without enthusiasm, and our vision was replaced with the overwhelmingly-colourful digitally-enhanced kaleidoscope of EVE emissions. We began the thaumaturgy test.</p>

<p><strong>11:45</strong> - Thaumaturgic activity! It confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that the heads are Daevite in origin; and it seems that Site-199 agrees, offering the SCP-8822 designation practically as soon as the word left my mouth.</p>
<p>The EVE connections between each head implies a thaumaturgy network, but neither I nor Greg know for certain what to make of the EVE buildup inside each head — I posit that these were used as thaumaturgical energy storage.</p>
<p>Claire is native to this world's consensus, so I can forgive her for not appreciating the significance of this discovery — but I was hoping that Greg would be a little more enthused. My excitement gave way to bubbling concerns. What does it mean for artefacts from the Daevite Empire to continue to exist, even now? It is possible the Chronicle is still exerting an influence, somehow? Why were they in a sculpture shop in Bradford of all places — how did they get here in the first place?</p>
<p>The answer to that last question, at least, would be in the business record if anywhere. As our economist, Greg confirmed that his business post-mortem had been completed for a while and that he'd been waiting for me to read it. After chastising him for withholding it, I did so.</p>

<p>'Cheshire Creations' registered in 1962 under Marilyn Cheshire, sculptor, as a summer/autumn market stall in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Cheshire Creations moves to permanent location in Bradford (quite far from Manchester — Salford would have been more sensible) in 1965. Employs Olivia Cheshire, daughter of Marilyn Cheshire. Missing transactions suggest one additional employee, not named, likely paid illegally.</p>
<p>Business halts when Marilyn Cheshire disappears; missing persons report remains unresolved to this day. Ownership is transferred to Olivia Cheshire following months of legal dispute. Rebrands to 'The Bradford Masonry'. Several local artists are contracted to produce saleable work. Eventually all contracts are consolidated unto one Christie Morreau.</p>
<p>Christie Morreau dies in 1985 and so does most of the business. Finances worsen. Sales of leftover Morreau pieces are supplemented with stone carving lessons; minimal but consistent takeup. Imports of cheap knick-knacks and garden ornaments begin in 1995 which are sold at high markup.</p>
<p>Customer inflow decreases to almost zero in 2008. Bankruptcy is declared in 2009.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> - Not one mention of the stone heads. I instructed Greg to go back upstairs and check again, but he rebutted that he'd been sufficiently thorough.</p>
<p>That leaves us only with the assumption that the stone heads are the work of Christie Morreau — not a name I was familiar with, but I looked her up, and she was apparently quite the household name back in the day, in these parts, at least. But we've no idea how they became charged with thaumaturgic power.</p>
<p>Claire tried out the ARI unit while we were reading through the business report, and she wondered, out loud, whether it would be possible to see inside one of the heads. Greg responded that we could crack one of them open. He was obviously joking, but Claire seemed to accept it as an answer. I'm sure she'll get an instinct for these things, in time.</p>
<p><strong>12:20</strong> - We're going to need to discuss our next steps. In the meantime, it's time to visit that last head at the Stone Head Delicatessen.</p>

<td>The following conversation is transcribed from security footage taken from the Stone Head Delicatessen, a recording device on Carruthers' person, and Carruthers' recollection.</td>

<hr/>
<p><em>[<strong>14:12</strong> - Researchers Carruthers and Blott are sitting at a table outside the Stone Head Delicatessen, having just finished lunch. A sullen silence has hung over the dining session in its entirety, excepting only a handful of purely perfunctory remarks where strictly necessary for the meal's execution. Carruthers is last to finish, a plain white coffee mug raised to his face, its sterile bottom visible to all. Blott's expression and body language are utterly illegible. Three plates depict an abstract medley of crumbs, butter, salt, pepper, and bottled sauces, and the fourth is empty.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Windford exits the delicatessen, having just returned from the womens' toilet, and sits dispassionately with her arms held close to her body as if the air is a full ten degrees cooler than it is. Carruthers places his empty coffee mug on the table and, after a moment, begins recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Alright then, team. What's our next step?</p>
<p><em>[No response from either Blott or Windford.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> No need for everyone to speak at once. Seems to me that our next step is to continue trying to figure out these heads' anomalous effects. Seeing as we're here at the Stone Head already, this is a good a place as any to start. Good bathroom trip, I hope, Claire? Did you see the head?</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> I— yeah, I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> …and what?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Any notes, observations? Anything that might help us?</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> …no? I didn't know that you… do you want me to go back?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Yes, please.</p>
<p><em>[Windford leaves and heads back into the delicatessen.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Any thoughts from you?</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Come on, man. You're stonier than these heads.</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> These fucking heads. You know, just last week, they had me making thousands of financial transactions to communicate with a <a href="scp-1442.html">sentient fucking stock exchange</a>. Last week, if I fucked up, a hundred thousand people would've lost their jobs. This week, if I fuck up, I drop a rock. At worst I hurt my foot. At best I hurt yours. Forgive me if I don't really give a shit.</p>
<p><em>[Carruthers and Blott sit in silence until Windford returns several minutes later. She takes her seat at the table.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Yeah, there's a head in there. It's in a display case that's surrounded by framed photos of the four heads in the Masonry. It's a replica of <span class="ch_A"><span class="a_7 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-gary-angle">SCP-8822-3</span><span class="a_6 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-gary-straight">SCP-8822-3</span><span class="a_1 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-gary-angle">SCP-8822-3</span></span>, made of wax, according to the plaque. I don't see what the deal is.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Thank you, Claire. I admit that I was actually under the impression that the head here was a fifth Morreau piece. Unfortunately that doesn't leave us with much indication of what to do next.</p>
<p><em>[A moment of silence, throughout which Windford looks as if she is building up the courage to speak.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> That… might not be entirely true. Why <em>did</em> you think there was a head here?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> It was in one of the reports.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Was it?</p>
<p><em>[Carruthers rummages through his bag and retrieves the relevant documentation: copies of the Parawatch posts, Agent Marques' report, and his own notes from this morning. He begins reading through them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Right, the Parawatch threads mention both The Bradford Masonry and the Stone Head Delicatessen. Marques theorises specifically about their relationship. Ah, that doesn't seem right — the fact that the head here is wax ought to be common knowledge, if it's written on the placard.</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> <em>You</em> didn't know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> That's true. Actually, it seems that all accounts are in consensus except for yours, Claire.</p>
<p><em>[As if having predicted this line of questioning, Windford retrieves her phone and shows Carruthers a photo she had taken of the head's display case.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Alright, so everyone else is wrong. How can that be?</p>
<p><em>[Blott, having been reading Carruthers' documents upside-down from the other side of the table, frowns, reaches forward and places his finger on Agent Marques' report.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Marques recommended a disruption class of Vlam — there should be a minimum of four personnel on the research team.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> I thought it was Notice? Did it change?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Unlikely. There are far fewer anomalies that affect documentation than there are that affect memory; in fact, Foundation protocol outright states that we should trust documentation over memory, and that's why we produce so much of it.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Right, but, you keep saying the heads are from the Daevite Empire — I don't know much about that, I've not even been to Daevastan on holiday or anything like that, but wasn't that the Empire's whole schtick? Changing stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Well… sort of. The Daevites <em>themselves</em> can be characterised mostly by war and slavery. The retroactivity came from the Chronicle, and those changes were <em>vast:</em> mass graves, evidence of entire wars, countries rising and falling. But they were also far in the past and always served the eventual goal of moving the Empire's collapse further into the future — or so we thought at the time, anyway. These changes don't feel like that. We shouldn't be aware of them at all.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Okay, well, what if there's <em>another</em> Chronicle, in the future? When it gets written, it would change <em>our</em> timeline, right?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Again, if that were the case, we wouldn't be aware of it.</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Hang on. Nick, you think you read something that said there's meant to be a head in the toilets in this café, but you can't find it now. Claire, you think you read that Marques put Notice for the disruption class, but it says Vlam now. Looks like you were both right, because there <em>is</em> a wax head here, and we've only got three people. The documentation is wrong. It must have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Alright, fine — maybe the heads are changing our documentation, but <em>only</em> our documentation. We'll run a couple of tests to see if they react to a few basic statements. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> That sounds good!</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Fine.</p>

<p>The back room has been left in a right state from neglect over the years. Anything valuable like stoneworking tools were likely cleared out when the shop went out of business. Stone dust is everywhere. I gathered a sample of it for Lauren, our geologist.</p>

<p><strong>09:55</strong> - Lauren reports that the hand-carved statuettes are made of local marble, and the stone dust from the back room is a mixture of that and limestone. She'll be moving onto the heads next.</p>
<p><strong>10:20</strong> - Claire finished taking measurements of the building's exterior, so she will continue her survey indoors. <iframe class="scout" loading="lazy" src="https://croquembouche.net/scp/scp-8822/scout-v1.html?contradiction=12"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>10:45</strong> - Lauren called me into the front room to discuss her findings. I stepped inside and <em>there,</em> at last, was the sensation that Agent Marques described: the plunge into the cold pool of awareness from the warm embrace of unthinking routine — compulsion recovery. Although my compulsion monitor is still flat, this is confirmation that whatever we're looking for is in the front room.</p>
<p>Lauren had looked at a plethora of metrics. She would've quite happily explained every single one to me — before I could stop her, she'd showed me limestone's reaction with hydrochloric acid, the calcium carbonate bubbling away as CO<sub>2</sub>, but the chemistry was as alien to me as Caldmann's explanation of the Hume.</p>

<p>Lauren thinks that the specificity of the carving indicates that three of the heads are likely portraits of real people. The fourth is different: the face's slope, the sharp little mouth, the flat top; save for its lack of diamond-shaped eyes, this is a Daevite artefact, surely! Lauren countered that there's not a single limestone deposit in Daevastan, so it couldn't be; plus, the stone dust indicated that it was recently-carved.</p>
<p>When I continued to insist, she finally suggested, frustratedly, that if I really thought it was Daevite, why not run a thaumaturgy test? I'm sure she was expecting that to be the last word.<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;">Anomalous activity confirmed. A-068396 redesignated as SCP-8822. Stone heads designated SCP-8822-1 through SCP-8822-4.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>11:45</strong> - Thaumaturgic activity! The Daevites were real all along! Site-199 seems to agree, offering the SCP-8822 designation practically as soon as the word left my mouth.</p>
<p>The EVE connections between each head implies a thaumaturgy network, so these heads could have once been components of a ritual. I don't know what to make of the EVE buildup inside each head, though. I posit that these were used as thaumaturgical capacitors, but my instincts are a little rusty; which is quite fair, I think!</p>
<p>Lauren's next idea was really quite brilliant — she's native to this world's consensus, yet she put the pieces together leagues before Greg or I. There's only one way for something from our old Daevite Empire to exist: if it were reality-anchored during <a href="scp-6140.html">the transition.</a></p>
<p>Claire had taken the initiative to transmit the data from the Kant counters during our thaumaturgy test, and the results were already back from the Site-199 supercomputer:</p>

<p><strong>12:00</strong> - Two readily-observable indicators would have confirmed my theory. First, the presence of a reality anchor would create strong Hume winds, and the turbulence would be detectable for a good ten years afterwards. Second, if there were any thaumaturgic activity at all, Hume levels would have been absorbed by the resulting aspect radiation. Frustratingly, neither indicator is apparent. These Hume levels are barely anomalous.</p>
<p>Claire tried out the ARI unit while we were reading, and she wondered, out loud, whether it would be possible to see inside one of the heads. Greg joked that we could "crack open one of them". He was being facetious, clearly, but the subtext was lost on Lauren. She shut down the idea on the spot, accusing Greg of gross negligence for merely suggesting it. I am required to include her objection in my report:</p>

<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Here's your recorder, Nick. We've got the head in my bag.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> You've <em>got the head?</em> In your bag? What on earth could possibly have compelled you to do that?</p>
<p><em>[Carruthers glances at Blott, lost for words.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Claire, are you <em>insane</em> or just incompetent? It's <em>supposed</em> to be in the display case in the bathroom. Go put it back, right now, please.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> I— I'm so sorry, I didn't know, I'll<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Hang on, Claire. You <em>do NOT</em> speak to her that way, Nick; but, how do you know about the display case?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> It's… <em>what</em> is <em>happening</em> right now? Fuck's sake. <em>[He rummages through his notes.]</em> Right. One of the heads is here at the Stone Head. Four heads in total: three at the Masonry, one at the Delicatessen. You honestly don't recall?</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> What? I have spent all morning around <em>all four</em> of those heads; now one of them moves here while Claire is in the bathroom, and I'm the only one who's worried about that?</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> For fuck's sake, Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Greg, cool it. Lauren, nothing's moved — obviously the head is having some kind of anomalous effect on your memory. Let's take a few minutes, all four of us, to look through our notes from today and re-sync. How does that sound?</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Absolutely not. We were all on the same page three minutes ago. I think it's our notes that are compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Sit down, Lauren. Foundation protocol is very clear in situations like this<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> <em>Protocol?</em> Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">—</span>there are far fewer anomalies that affect documentation that there are that affect memory; when in doubt, we trust the documentation until proven otherwise, and that's why<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Protocol, my ass! Rule <em>one</em> is to act on instinct and do what feels right, that's the very first thing they teach us. I find it <em>very, very</em> concerning that <em>your</em> first instinct is to accuse Claire of wrongdoing when the SCP we're investigating has <em>targeted</em> her? Her safety could be at risk and your solution is to tear her down. Claire should be furious with you. You're the team lead — we need to be able to trust you to protect us.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> I don't feel like I'm in any<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Lauren, you need to stop and think through what you're saying. I don't appreciate being accused<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> <em>You</em> need to think through what <em>you're</em> saying — you haven't seriously considered the situation at all! It doesn't make any sense for one of the heads to be here — and even if it was, I don't buy that we'd <em>stop for lunch</em><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">‍</span>—</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Trust <em>you</em> to spew nonsense the second there's a hint of uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> It doesn't matter if I'm wrong, Greg. The heads can move around, and fabricate display cases, and edit documentation — <em>or</em> — they can change memories. Maybe both! Both are bad!</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Okay, I'm listening, but only because it seems I no longer have a choice. What do you think we should do? <iframe class="scout" loading="lazy" src="https://croquembouche.net/scp/scp-8822/scout-v1.html?contradiction=A5"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Stop. Call off testing, right now. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Call off testing? Do I need to remind you that our objective is to determine the right containment procedures?</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> We <em>already have</em> the right procedures! These things were perfectly contained for <em>years</em> in an abandoned building with no-one thinking about them. <em>We've</em> fucked up that system by giving them attention and one of them has <em>already</em> escaped to a fucking deli. All we need to do is put them in a box and <em>forget about them.</em> That's it. It couldn't be easier.</p>
<p><em>[Carruthers glances at Blott and Windford.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> What do you two think?</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Whatever gets me home fastest.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> I… I don't know. I feel like stopping now would only be doing half the job, wouldn't it?</p>
<p><em>[Carruthers drums his fingers on the table, debating internally.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Fine. We can't risk it. Put '-3 in the van. We'll stop by the Masonry, pick up our stuff and the other heads, then head back to Site-199. But Lauren, keep in mind, this will be in my report.</p>
<p><strong>Shepherd:</strong> That's fine. Thank you, Nick. I really feel this is the right thing to do.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> - We've returned to The Bradford Masonry, still undercover as building surveyors — we're lucky that none of the locals seem to care about our comings and goings.</p>
<p>I had Claire gather the four heads together in the shop's front room while Greg went upstairs to put away the documents and such that he'd been looking at for the business analysis — leave no trace, after all.</p>
<p>Once Claire was ready, the two of us put our heads together and tried to imagine what kind of statement the heads would be most receptive to changing, if they were willing and able to do so in the first place. The approach we've decided on is <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_32">to expose the heads to a neutral, basic statement and see what, if anything, happens. That will let us establish a strong baseline to inform additional tests. If it doesn't work, we can try other approaches.</span><span class="a_10">quite pragmatic and based on research by Dr. Cunningham — we will ask a head a question and provide a wrong answer; we reason that if the heads are able to change text, they will do so to correct us.</span></span></p>
<p>For the most accurate test possible, we need an objective fact that is known to be correct. I realise that there's shockingly little we know for certain — <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_32">but geology is a fairly objective baseline, so querying the rock composition seems like the best way to go.</span><span class="a_10">material seems like the best way to go, but we don't even know what kind of stone they're made of!</span></span></p>

<p><strong>14:40</strong> - Claire and I waited as long as we could bear, but there was no indication that our written statement would (or could!) change. We aren't quite ready to give up, though. It's time for a more <span class="ch_B"><span class="a_33">aggressive</span><span class="a_10">pragmatic</span></span> approach.</p>
<p><span class="ch_B"><span class="a_33">If we can't bait the heads with false information, perhaps we can attack their ego directly, if they have one. We'll expose the heads to disparaging statements: I theorise that they may be extorted into correcting an offensive description, like how a human might respond to an inflammatory statement that damages their pride. Of course, we're still assuming that the heads think like people, which may not be the case at all.</span><span class="a_10">Given that our goal is to establish containment procedures, it would be wise to verify that the heads' presumed properties do not make them unusually resistant to containment — if they're able to change their own special procedures, that could be disastrous!

<p>He was apprised of our efforts so far and, on reviewing the outcome of the first test, suggested that the statement we'd used wasn't consistent with how I'd described the test before.

<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Well, your tests aren't getting fucking anywhere, are they? Rock composition and insults? What the fuck do <em>you</em> know about rock composition? Would you even be able to tell if it had changed?</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> We're <em>supposed</em> to have a geologist on the team, so in principle, that test is apt. Very plausible, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Windford:</strong> Nick, remember when we tried to use some of the stuff from the geologist's kit earlier, and we didn't know what to do with any of it? I don't think it's plausible that you picked geology to use for the first test… plausible for someone else, just not… you.</p>
<p><strong>Blott:</strong> Why do we even <em>have</em> a geology kit? That's not standard equipment, that's on-request shit, like the thaumaturgy headset things you brought.</p>
<p><strong>Carruthers:</strong> Put a sock in it, both of you! The details of the first test are, frankly, irrelevant. Smashing an SCP — <em>threatening</em> to smash an SCP — is gross misconduct. Greg, I've half a mind to boot you back to Site-91.</p>

<h2 id="toc50"><span>EXPANSION STRATEGY</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc51"><span>TOP SECRET · LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED</span></h3>
<p>An unexpectedly successful word-of-mouth marketing campaign for the initial exhibition of the Heads in Cartwright Hall, Bradford attracted the attention of the local media. Following an extraordinarily competent and charismatic interview by our Founder, of which only written records exist, the collection continued to attract attention to the point where it was beyond the capacity of Cartwright Hall.</p>
<p>The Foundation was subsequently contacted by the Strategic Curation Panel, a business-to-business for-profit initiative with the self-stated mission of maximising the impact of art exhibitions. The Panel explained that they had extensive experience in artistic management, including of sculptures specifically, and were willing to strike a deal.</p>
<p>Our contract with the Panel states the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Foundation retains sole ownership of SDP-8822.</li>
<li>The Foundation is permitted to display SDP-8822 in locations owned by the Panel, consisting of eight galleries and/or exhibition suites throughout Northern England, including Leeds, Manchester, Salford, Liverpool and York.</li>
<li>SDP-8822 exhibits will be staffed and guarded by Panel personnel.</li>
<li>The Foundation may rotate SDP-8822 stock between locations as required; SDP-8822 items not on display may be kept at any of the Panel's storage facilities.</li>
<li>Entrance fees will be split between the two organisations: 70% to the Panel, 30% to the Foundation. Proceeds from merchandise sold on-site by the Foundation will be retained by the Foundation.</li>
<li>SDP-8822 must be exclusively displayed at Panel-owned locations only.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ch_B"><span class="a_49">We intend to eventually display the entire SDP-8822 collection simultaneously, so this offer was accepted with the proviso that we would be allowed to display more SDP-8822 exhibits in additional locations as we acquire them, an amendment to which the Panel was reluctantly forced to agree.</span><span class="a_47">Although we would like to be able to display SDP-8822 in other locations, this offer has been accepted as a cost-saving measure.</span><span class="a_10">Given that prior to this offer the only display site available to the Foundation was Cartwright Hall, the deal was eagerly accepted.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ch_B"><span class="a_49">Pending</span><span class="a_10">Any</span></span> renegotiations will be subject to discussion with our primary contact for and liaison to the Panel, who is currently Ms. L Shepherd.</p>

<p>Melanie slipped her phone back into her pocket and returned to <span class="ch_A"><span class="a_7 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-nicholas-angle">SCP-8822-6</span><span class="a_6 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-nicholas-straight">SCP-8822-6</span><span class="a_1 croqstyle-img-footnote img-head-nicholas-angle">SCP-8822-6</span></span>. She picked it up and held it close to her face, exhaling slowly as she stared right into its eyes. I let the silence linger for a moment, but I'd barely opened my mouth before she turned to me, eyebrows raised in anticipation, goading me into asking my question.</p>
<p>"No luck, then?"</p>
<p>"No luck," she replied. "Said they'd call back if they heard anything, but I don't think they will. Seems like he never existed at all."</p>
<p>"For what it's worth, I believe you."</p>
<p>"Nah, come off it. You weren't thinking that five minutes ago."</p>
<p>"Come on now, you're not <em>that</em> psychic."</p>
<p>"You're such a fucking sycophant, Vik, you know that? Right, come on. Let's get these last two tested. Where'd Sally go? She was right here."</p>
<p>On cue, Sally came in from the back room of the Masonry, wearing a perturbed expression and fiddling with some device — possibly a compulsion monitor, but she put it away before I could get a good look.</p>
<p>"Here, boss," she said. "Felt something odd just now — thought I'd see if was coming from anywhere, but it's gone now. Probably imagined it."</p>
<p>Melanie nodded and shifted SCP-8822-6's weight in her hands. "Keep an eye on that, I want to hear if it happens again. Vik, pass me '-7 and start recording. Let's get this over with."</p>

<td>Connected to '-6. Feels very similar to the last one: something there, but only barely. It's different, not in any specific way, it's just different — what I mean is, if there's an entity in here, this and the one in '-5 are different entities, not different facets of the same being.<br/>
<br/>
It knows I'm in here. I feel it feeling me right back. Hello? I don't mean to intrude. I just want to understand.<br/>
<br/>
I think it wants to speak to me, but it doesn't know the words. It wants to communicate but it's got nothing to say. There's guilt and jealousy in here, but it's not the almost-anger that I felt in the other head. I feel welcome, but I don't belong. Disconnecting.<br/>
<br/>
Moving on to '-7… and I'm in. Oh, you're a little quieter. Dimmer. Like you've had more time to fade… or maybe faded faster.<br/>

<p>Once Melanie had detached from the heads, I readied myself to catch her again, but she took a deep breath and turned to us, seemingly fine. Sally and I awaited her verdict.</p>
<p>"There's something in these heads, but whatever it is, it's dying. '-1, '-2, '-3 and '-7 are as good as gone already. '-5 and '-6 need protecting. I'm not sure about '-4 but I'd sooner lump it in with the latter than the former."</p>
<hr/>
<p>There it was: the heads were dying. In situations like this this there's always the dark temptation to just <em>let it happen</em>; the thought, however misguided, that maybe the current course is the best. Working with a telepath is freeing in many ways — the dark thoughts are laid bare, to be interrogated and dismantled; rather than buried, to grow and bloom again.</p>
<p>The three of us sat in the circle of chairs in the back room and discussed for over an hour. We examined every detail, every bit of evidence we'd collected so far. There was so little we knew about the heads, but even after having known them for only a few hours, I felt that I cared for them. I wanted them to survive.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We were interrupted by the sound of the front door opening — Old Bob. He let himself in and joined us, without invitation, in the back room.</p>
<p>Melanie reached below the seat of her chair where Old Bob couldn't see and made a squeezing motion with her thumb and forefinger: the universal Foundation symbol that meant <em>start recording.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>WEST:</strong> Welcome back, Bob. You're right on time, we were just getting ready to leave.</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Aye, aye. It's been nice getting to take a break. I trust you've not had any guests? I did make sure to tell everyone the Masonry would be closed today.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> We've had one, but he was no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>WEST:</strong> Bob, if it's alright with you, before we leave, may we ask you a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Aye, shoot.</p>
<p><strong>WEST:</strong> I was curious about your personal relationship with the heads — I don't suppose you'd be willing to share a few details about that?</p>
<p><em>[Hawthorne retrieves the Akiva counter from her pocket.]</em></p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> About that? That's pretty open-ended. What did you want to know specifically?</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Are the heads personally significant to you?</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> That they are — I'm a custodian of these heads. I'm proud to stand watch over this Masonry.</p>
<p><strong>SINGH:</strong> With all due respect, that doesn't really answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Oh, what? Is this an interrogation now?</p>
<p><strong>WEST:</strong> Vikram! Bob, I am so sorry about my colleague. Let's move on.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Why do you volunteer for the Bradford Heads cult?</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Well, it's something to do, isn't it? I saw the work the cult was doing for the community and I just knew I had to be part of it. And look at these things! They're gorgeous, no? How could you not want to be close to 'em?</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Could only someone who truly believes in the Bradford Heads become a custodian?</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Are you doubting my credentials? Yes, of course. It's one of the highest honours.</p>
<p><strong>HAWTHORNE:</strong> Alright. Thank you, Bob. I think I've got what I need.</p>
<p><strong>WEST:</strong> You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>'OLD BOB':</strong> Alright.</p>
</div>
<p>Old Bob left via the same way that he'd come in.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We regrouped following the interview.</p>
<p>"I think it's safe to say that we didn't learn anything from that," I said. "How's about we find some other members of the group to talk to?"</p>
<p>Melanie looked as if she was about to agree with me, but Sally spoke first.</p>
<p>"I think I know what's killing the heads."</p>
<p>Whatever thought Melanie was about to share was entirely forgotten. "You do?"</p>
<p>"It's the Akiva field." <iframe class="scout" loading="lazy" src="https://croquembouche.net/scp/scp-8822/scout-v1.html?contradiction=A7"></iframe></p>
<p>I shook my head. "Can't be — we've established that there's practically zero Akiva radiation."</p>
<p>"Exactly! These heads are the focal point of a religious cult. They <em>should</em> have a field, and Old Bob and Mr. Burgerman <em>should</em> have detectably reinforced it. Members of the cult gather here, make pilgrimage here, house custodians here — the heads <em>should</em> always be exposed to fresh belief."</p>
<p>Sally stopped to catch her breath before resuming. "Except they're not. Mr. Burgerman just wants to be a role model for his daughter, and Old Bob evaded every single question we asked — I don't think either of them believe in anything at all. The Bradford Heads are supposedly incredibly famous, but we've never heard of them — none of us even recognise the nursery rhyme."</p>
<p>A frown had been building on my face as I struggled to predict what she was going to say next. Melanie shared a similar expression.</p>
<p>"So…?"</p>
<p>"So the religion is fake. It's a psychic projection that has hundreds of people convinced they believe it — but no one actually does, so there's no Akiva field. The heads are starving. <em>That's</em> why they're dying."</p>
<p>She stopped, breath bated, waiting for someone to react, to tell her that she was genius or an idiot. She glanced at me. She glanced at Melanie. I was way out of my depth; I had nothing to contribute.</p>
<p>"Listen, Sally," Melanie said, slowly, as if choosing her words carefully. "Your theory reflects a… rudimentary understanding of the Akiva field. The mechanics of Akiva radiation are a tightly-kept secret by the Department of Tactical Theology, and even I'm not permitted to divulge what little I know about it. But regardless, consider this: per your theory, if even one person were to truly believe in the Bradford Heads as per a religion, there would be an Akiva field to measure. If I've learned anything about people, it's that they're stupid — in a cult this size, there must be at least one."</p>
<p>"That only <em>supports</em> my theory," Sally argued. "If the heads have been draining the field, that could well leave a religious cult with no believers, right? I don't mean to rush you, boss, but my theory is the only one we have so far, and the heads are going to die regardless. We have to protect them, if we can — that <em>is</em> the Foundation's third tenet, after all. Even if it's based on a hunch."</p>
<p>With a frustrated expression and a mental grimace, Melanie turned to me.</p>
<p>"I need a second opinion here, Vik. What's your gut telling you?"</p>
<p>My response was immediate. "If Sally's going to cite the Foundation's tenets, then I will, too. We've been asked to <em>contain</em> these heads, and to do that, we need more information. We've had two useless interviews, so really, we don't know anything. We need to talk to more members of the cult — or, honestly, anyone who's actually familiar with the Bradford Heads. If I could expose the heads to more people, I would."</p>
<p>Melanie took a moment to ponder. I felt the exact moment that her mind was made up — it was the safe option, borne from the obligation of duty, not the thrill of discovery.</p>
<p>"Alright, Sally. We're going with your plan — but we're going to have to head back to Site-91 to have even a <em>chance</em> of generating any level of Akiva radiation… and even then, it's a stretch. Let's pack up the heads and go."</p>
<hr/>
<p>With all SCP-8822 members stowed in bags and equipment cases, we left The Bradford Masonry. We passed Old Bob, who complained unintelligibly at us about having been told to leave, and stored everything in the van. Then, we left.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum: Post-recovery</strong></p>
<p>After Dr. West's team brought SCP-8822 to Site-91, efforts were undertaken to generate an artificial Akiva field as per Researcher Hawthorne's recommendation.</p>
<p>Construction of an artificial belief field was not immediately successful. Site-91 did not have the equipment or the expertise to overcome the Generation Problem and produce Akiva radiation from nothing.</p>

Dr. Dullahan of the Parareligions Division was dispatched to Site-91 to investigate, and following their report to the DoTT, Site-91 was ordered to cease attempting to develop Akiva production technology and destroy all progress thus far.</p>
