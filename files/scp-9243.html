<p>SCP-9243 cannot be contained by conventional means. Foundation containment efforts must focus on active monitoring and the minimization of collateral damage associated with both the primary effects of the anomaly and those incurred as a side effect of ongoing public dissemination. False information has been inserted into various records of note, including but not limited to historical accounts, census results, government databases, and consumer analytics systems.</p>
<p>The Foundation has established a worldwide perinatal monitoring network, in cooperation with select representatives from international agencies with particularly high SCP-9243-related stresses. This network continuously analyzes and reports on relevant charts regarding in-progress pregnancies, birth logs, ambulance/EMS telemetry, and operating room schedules, which are to be flagged upon detection of any anomalous alterations to associated patients' care plans, as well as any "near-birth" incidents occurring within ±72 hours of 00:00 UTC on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>September 8th</li>
</ul>
<p>referred to as the "Target Date(s)" of each year.</p>
<p>Pregnancies expected to reach term <em>within</em> ±72 hours of the Target Date(s) should be flagged as high risk and monitored with increased scrutiny. When possible, Foundation-deployed obstetric teams are advised to prioritize medically-safe scheduling adjustments, ensuring delivery occurs at least 24 hours earlier or later than the Target Date(s). When rescheduling is medically contraindicated, Mobile Task Force Tau-8 ("Quiet Cradle") is prepositioned to provide emergency support and evacuative services. No policy compels a mother to undergo risky procedures solely for the Foundation's purposes; all interventions must be approved by an authorized medical ethics liaison within Foundation command.</p>
<p>Any person or group attempting coordinated births on the Target Date(s) must be intercepted. The Foundation will employ and exhaust all possible countermeasures to dissuade or disrupt such activities. Very rarely, lethal force may be authorized.</p>
<p>Persons identified as having once been born on the Target Date(s), should they exist, are to be relocated to Site-43's Health and Pathology Sxn. for palliative care while under observation and study. At no time are any invasive age-manipulating medical procedures to be carried out due to the increased risk of causal disruption.</p>
<p>Use of facility ADA-1 is currently impossible and has never been possible.</p>

<p><span class="bd">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-9243 is a persistent, global anomaly that renders the occurrence of live human births impossible on the Target Date(s) of each year.</p>
<p>Attempts to induce live births on the Target Date(s) result in quasi-deterministic causal interventions which prevent live births from occurring on that day. The mechanisms of these interventions vary, but have been observed to share some common characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intervention enforces a change in outcome such that impacted births take place typically before or after the Target Date(s). However, if this is not possible, the pregnancy will be ultimately disrupted from resolving in a live birth via other, more unpredictable means.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These interventions often involve chains of highly improbable events occurring in rapid sequence (e.g. simultaneous and unrelated disabling injuries, emergency vehicle routes blocked by the rapid formation of sinkholes with no prior geological indicators, cascades of stochastic maintenance and technical issues compounding upon one another, anomalous increases in group miscommunications and misunderstandings leading to greater communications breakdowns, et cetera).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Interventions frequently produce excessive collateral damage through events such as building collapse, multiple vehicle pile-ups, and sudden natural disasters/aggressive fires. The scale of said collateral damage tends to correlate with the number of attempted births planned for the Target Date in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals who were historically recorded as having been born on a Target Date present as one of two phenomena:</p>
<p>A) In an overwhelming majority of cases, these individuals no longer exist in current reality. The ontological hole that replaces their worldline<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> will be subject to causal interventions to justify the surrounding space. This results in retroactive continuity allowing the start and end points of any impacted phenomena that can reconnect in an ontologically sound state to always reconnect into this state.</p>
<p>B) In rare situations, affected individuals will not be subject to proper displacement. This is due to highly improbable interactions prior in life (such as encountering the anomalous), which substantially increases the temporal byproducts generated by SCP-9243. In this case, these individuals still physically exist, but will invariably begin to display signs of progressive nonlinear aging; because the time of birth associated with their worldline corresponds to a point in spacetime in which it is impossible for a human to participate in live birth, the subject's biological markers will grow desynchronized, leading to complications associated with the body's physiological incompatibility at various stages of human development. Patches of asynchronous biology will become progressively more obvious over time, as victims continue to exist in reality and interact with energy states in the surrounding space.</p>
<p>Patients afflicted with progressive nonlinear aging consistently present poor prognoses, with individuals rarely surviving beyond 18 months after diagnosis.</p>

ADA-1 then seals itself shut, generating an internally-isolated temporal reference frame (initialized at given time <em><strong>t<sub>0</sub></strong></em>). <span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span> then drafts an ADA ledger for recurrent anomaly <span style="color: blue"><em><strong>X</strong></em></span>, which includes a unique cryptographic hash for validation purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Displacement anchor array calibrates to match <span style="color: purple"><em><strong>W</strong></em></span>, generating a datamap which describes the parameters of <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span>'s eventual involvement, setting the time and date in which the ledger will become available again.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ADA-1 will then begin running a series of preemptive analyses of <span style="color: blue"><em><strong>X</strong></em></span>'s total ontological recondicity, comparing it to the magnitude of ontological potential that will be generated by all affected individuals, accounting for the eventual leakage margin (Case B persons).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once this phase is complete, <span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span> is to await future validation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span> (invalid birthday <span style="color: red"><em><strong>D</strong></em></span>) enters ADA-1 at <em><strong>t<sub>1</sub></strong></em> (<em><strong>t<sub>0</sub></strong></em> + 1 year) on <span style="color: red"><em><strong>D</strong></em></span>, sealing themselves inside the structure once more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span>'s ledger will then be made available to <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span>, who is to compare its contents and the accompanying cryptographic hash to their own records, which will match.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>

<ul>
<li>As no discrepancies exist, <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span> will proceed to retrovalidate the ledger from <span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span>, initiating the temporal displacement ten seconds later.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span> will promptly leave ADA-1 upon confirming that retrovalidation has occurred, which will temporarily collapse the isolated reference frame within the facility. ADA-1 will then go into standby until unsealed by <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span>. Subsequently, <span style="color: pink"><em><strong>p</strong></em></span> will forget their birthday, becoming <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span> over the course of a year.</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="color: blue"><em><strong>X</strong></em></span>’s “birth” is immediately displaced as the restructuring event ripples throughout all of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Moments after displacement, <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span> will be instantaneously annihilated inside ADA-1, as a paradox resolution workload cascade occurs, caused by critical overflow of temporal waste obliterating the array's abatement buffers. The shielded bulkheads will contain and isolate the runoff, aside from the previously-determined leakage margin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9243 fails to displace the anomaly's own birth-type activation by <span style="color: lightblue"><em><strong>f</strong></em></span>, due to it occurring within an isolated temporal state disconnected from natural causality. ADA-1 is therefore permanently sealed; in baseline history, it has never been entered, as no coherent entry event persists.
