</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8836</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>In cooperation with the government of Michoacán, the Foundation will establish canine shelters and foster adoption campaigns, as well as lobby in favor of legislation aimed at eradicating animal cruelty. Efforts will be made through agents embedded in the state’s municipal governments to educate the civilian population against harming stray dogs. Reports of anomalous phenomena involving SCP-8836 must be suppressed; resulting deaths will be attributed to cartel violence, while surviving witnesses will be subjected to amnestization.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel are encouraged to converse, play with and give treats to SCP-8836-2 as long as it does not interfere with their official duties.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8836 refers to a phenomenon involving the canine population of the state of Michoacán, México. The anomaly is triggered when a human voluntarily and maliciously inflicts physical pain on a dog (<em>canis lupus familiaris</em>). In all registered cases, approximately 5 seconds after the canine is harmed, a pack of anomalous dogs (collectively classified as SCP-8836-1) numbering upwards of 400 individuals will manifest in close proximity to the perpetrator and maul them to death. Severity is irrelevant to the activation of SCP-8836; even in occurrences where no permanent bodily harm was caused to the subject, the aggressor was nonetheless killed by SCP-8836-1.</p>
<p>Individual dogs present in SCP-8836-1 belong to a varied assortment of breeds, ranging from Mexican hairless dogs (<em>xoloitzcuintle</em>) to Saint Bernards and even extinct breeds such as Epirus mastiffs and Hawaiian poi dogs. In total, more than 300 known dog breeds have been identified following SCP-8836-1 attacks. SCP-8836-1 individuals are intangible to all but their victim, which makes rescue impossible. No traces such as footprints or DNA samples remain after an incident, and any body parts removed from the victim likewise disappear once SCP-8836-1 demanifests. On occasion, SCP-8836-1 will be led by an entity designated SCP-8836-2.</p>
<p>SCP-8836-2 has the appearance of a striped male mongrel dog. It possesses human-like intelligence and the ability to speak, and has been heard communicating in Spanish, English, Náhuatl, Purépecha, Yucatec Maya and ancient Egyptian <em>(see Incident 8836/9)</em>. Although it participates in violence inflicted by SCP-8836-1, it will occasionally appear alone in tangible form to Foundation personnel, remaining friendly and conversational unless provoked. It has shown a remarkable disposition to answer questions asked to it by personnel, but remains evasive about the true purpose of its presence in Michoacán.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<p>The first recorded instance of SCP-8836 occurred in the city of Pátzcuaro, Michoacán, on 14 March 2025, following the killing of a stray dog by a local butcher. SCP-8836-1 immediately manifested and mauled the man to death before dissipating into thin air. Further incidents occurred on 18 March and 12 April of the same year, with the Foundation subsequently identifying the happenings as being part of an anomaly and attempting to contain it. Following first contact with SCP-8836-1 on 20 June 2025 and after failing to stop them from killing their latest victim, SCP-8836-2 approached the Foundation agents present at the scene, which led to the following interview.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Aldo Suárez<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8836-2<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 20/06/2025<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This interview was conducted in Spanish.</p>

<p><em>Video shows SCP-8836-02 standing over the remains of its victim, a woman who had attempted to poison a pack of stray dogs who had been rummaging through her garbage.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-8836-2 notices Agent Suárez and approaches him, wagging its tail.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> Uh… erm… Hello.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Hi! I’m new here, but I’m looking to make some friends! What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> I… I am not sure I’m allowed to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Oh, don’t be like that! Don’t you want to be friends? I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.</p>
<p><em>Agent Suárez looks around hesitatingly before answering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> My name is Aldo.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Hello, Aldo! My name is Wichu. It’s a pleasure to meet you!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8836-2 extends its right foreleg, which Agent Suárez shakes after a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> I’m glad to meet you too, Wichu. Would you mind if I ask you some questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Sure! Asking questions is a great way of getting to know a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> Why did you… uh… why did you kill her?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8836-2 turns towards the woman’s corpse and growls, the heckles on its back raising as it bares its teeth. It then seems to regain its composure and turns to Agent Suárez.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> She was bad. She hurt my brothers and sisters. I– thank you for taking them in. Will… will they be alright?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> We will do our best to help them, Wichu. How did you know they were hurt?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> I can feel them. I can feel them all when they hurt, when they suffer. Their howls make my ears hurt and my heart burn, and I follow the pain until I find them.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> And the other dogs who came with you? Are they your brothers and sisters too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> The ones who came and went before me, yes. We are family, so we stick together even after they are gone.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> I see. Is that why you came to Michoacán? You said you were not from around here. Did you come here to protect them?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8836-2 does not answer. It tucks its tail between its legs and lowers its ears, whimpering.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> I– I don’t think I’m supposed to say. My father… he might get angry. I don’t like it when he’s angry.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8836-2 continues whimpering. Agent Suárez kneels next to it and pats its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Suárez:</strong> That’s alright, friend. You don’t have to answer. Don’t worry, you’re a good boy, so I don’t think your father will be mad.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8836-2 wags its tail and licks Agent Suárez’s hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Yes! We are friends! Aldo and Wichu! Friends.</p>

<strong>Test Log SCP-8836-1:</strong></p>
<p>The following tests were performed under the supervision of senior researcher Lorenzo Salinas with the purpose of determining which kinds of harm would trigger the activation of SCP-8836. Despite agent Suárez’s vehement protests against hurting dogs for this purpose, senior researcher Salinas overruled his objections and proceeded with the tests.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 001.8836-1<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> Stray dog, female, approximately 5 years of age.<br/>
<strong>D-Class Personnel #:</strong> D-44355, 37 year old male.</p>
<p>Upon being instructed to kick the test subject, D-44355 expressed profound disgust and refused to comply. Repeated instructions bore identical results until immediate termination was threatened. D-44355 finally complied, but immediately fell to his knees, cradling the test subject and tearfully apologizing to it. SCP-8836 failed to activate.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It seems that the perpetrator must wish to harm the dog, and that inflicting pain under coercion will negate the anomaly’s effects. It is recommended that further testing employ D-Class personnel with a history of animal cruelty.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 002.8836-1<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> Stray dog, female, approximately 5 years of age.<br/>
<strong>D-Class Personnel #:</strong> D-29114, 23 year old male with a history of killing small animals for entertainment.</p>
<p>D-29114 stomped on the subject – the same dog from the previous test – and was immediately mauled to death by SCP-8836-1. Subject underwent a veterinary revision which found no serious bodily injury.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It appears there is no need to cause severe or even noticeable bodily injury for the anomaly to activate, so far as malice is present.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 003.8836-1<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> Stray dog, male, approximately 8 years of age.<br/>
<strong>D-Class Personnel #:</strong> D-79533, 50 year old female with pyromania.</p>
<p>D-79533 was instructed to set off fireworks next to the subject in order to cause it distress. Subject reacted frightenedly at the noise and cowered in a corner. As D-79533 laughed, she was mauled to death by SCP-8836-1.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It appears that certain non-physical stimuli, such as being subjected to loud noises that may cause distress, are enough to trigger the anomaly just as with bodily harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 004.8836-1<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> Stray dog, female, approximately 5 months of age.<br/>
<strong>D-Class Personnel #:</strong> D-89662, 30 year old female.</p>
<p>D-89662 was given a roll of newsprint and was instructed to discipline the subject for urinating on the room’s carpet. D-89662 took a slight but firm swing at the subject’s snout, softly reprimanding it before caressing the subject behind the ears. SCP-8836 failed to activate.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As expected, disciplining a dog and mistreating it do not necessarily meet the same criteria for cruelty, thus negating the activation of the anomaly.</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Incident 8836/7:</strong></p>
<p>On 12 August 2025, at 09:15 in the morning – approximately one hour before the performance of a fifth scheduled test – senior researcher Salinas was heard screaming in his office. Upon responding to his pleas for help, Foundation personnel found SCP-8836-1 mutilating and dismembering senior researcher Salinas. Despite attempts to save his life, he ultimately expired due to exsanguination, extreme bodily trauma and disembowelment. SCP-8836-2 was seen holding senior researcher Salinas' liver between its jaws before dissipating.</p>
<p>Following this incident, SCP-8836-2 was noted to be openly hostile to Foundation personnel, growling and attempting to bite them when they tried to approach. At his own insistence, agent Suárez was allowed to approach the anomaly, which expressed its shock and disappointment at feeling betrayed by the organization Suárez worked for. After a two hour-long conversation, agent Suárez managed to appease SCP-8836-2 by promising to vouch for the discontinuation of all Foundation testing involving dogs, a petition that was ultimately approved by unanimity by the Foundation's Ethics Committee due to the immense risk posed by angering the anomalies and the evident lack of consistency between the established Security Containment Procedures and the tests performed by senior researcher Salinas.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Incident 8836/9:</strong></p>
<p>Following Incident 8836/7, a miniature remote camera was surreptitiously placed on SCP-8836-2 in an attempt to monitor its and SCP-8836-1’s movements. For the next several months, the video feed contained nothing but static, only ever recording when SCP-8836-2 manifested to play with Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>On November 2nd 2026, however, the camera captured SCP-8836-2 walking in the shallows of Lake Pátzcuaro before beginning to swim towards the horizon at 18:00 hours and eventually diving. The camera then transmitted static for two hours before again showing a clear image.</p>
<p>SCP-8836-2 appeared to emerge on a riverbank under a starry night sky, briefly scouting the surrounding sands before encountering a shadowy figure with a vaguely canine form. SCP-8836-2 addressed this entity in what Foundation researchers determined to be ancient Egyptian. The following is a transcript of their conversation.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> Greetings, venerable Anpu! I am Wichu, son of Xolotl. I come in place of my father. He apologizes for not coming himself, but events in Mictlán demand his full attention.</p>
<p><strong>UNKNOWN:</strong> There is no need to apologize, child. Word of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-raven-and-the-hummingbird">the crisis that afflicts your realm</a> has spread as far as our domain. Duat solidarizes itself with Mictlán and its people. Tell me, what news do you bring?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8836-2:</strong> All is ready, my Lord, for the gathering. The Purépecha gods have agreed to allow their domain to be neutral ground for the meeting of the Lords of Night. Emissaries have already been sent to summon the rest of your Deathly Majesties. Will you and mighty Wesir be attending?</p>
<p><strong>UNKNOWN:</strong> Of course. What affects one afterlife affects us all. Go, child. Tell your father and Lady Mictecacihuatl that the gods of Kemet will answer their call.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong></p>
<p>The camera permanently stopped transmitting after this exchange. It is presumed that it fell off SCP-8836-2's back during the return to Pátzcuaro. SCP-8836-2 showed no knowledge of being spied on and resumed its usual friendly demeanor towards Foundation personnel. Following this recording, however, its appearances greatly diminished with the exception of a weekly visit to agent Suárez, who remains similarly unaware of the recording.</p>

<strong>Addendum: Incident 8836/12:</strong></p>
<p>On 12 December 2026, SCP-8836-1 manifested in Cairo, Egypt. Three local men known for butchering stray dogs for food were killed by upwards of 800 anomalous canines, which now included individuals identified as African golden wolves (<em>Canis lupaster</em>) and African wild dogs (<em>Lycaon pictus</em>). SCP-8836-2 was seen leading the pack. Updated Special Containment Procedures are pending.</p>
