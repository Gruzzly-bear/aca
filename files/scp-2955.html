            <h1>SCP-2955</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2955</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Provisional Containment Area-846 is to be constructed around SCP-2955, and is currently disguised as an Argentinean military installation. Area-846 is to be staffed by members of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#zeta-9" target="_blank">Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats")</a>. No personnel are allowed to approach, directly observe, or conduct sample extractions on SCP-2955. All observations on SCP-2955 are to be conducted via satellite imaging and remote surveillance. The usage of Helios-class aerial surveillance drones to monitor SCP-2955 is prohibited.</p>
<p>In the event of a transmigration event, MTF-Z-9 is to track down SCP-2955 and identify the next location in which it will resurface. Once verified, Area-846 is to be rebuilt over the newly identified location. Foundation agents embedded in the governments of affected nations are to maintain the cover story of an earthquake during each transmigration event.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2955 refers to a collection of granular particles, capable of autonomous movement. An exact total number of SCP-2955 instances cannot be verified, partly due to their anomalous properties. Current estimations suggest there are at least 4,000,000 such instances.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Individual instances of SCP-2955 have a measured diameter of 15 mm on average. Samples taken indicate that SCP-2955 is composed of a mixture of tumbaga<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and silica. SCP-2955 typically takes the shape of a pavement laid out over an approximate land area of 8 km<sup>2</sup>, and a collection of Pueblo great houses clustered within the area. The architecture is consistent with dwellings of the Pueblo II Era.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> However, no openings are found in the structures inside SCP-2955.</p>
<p>SCP-2955 will only move (referred to as a transmigration event) when portions of it are extracted forcefully or when it is directly observed by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human beings</li>
<li>Helios-class aerial surveillance drone (as of 08/07/2008)</li>
</ul>
<p>The transmigration event is marked by seismic activity occurring in SCP-2955's vicinity. SCP-2955 will then disassemble itself and seep into the ground. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) indicates that SCP-2955 instances typically move along multiple files when underground, vibrating themselves as a means of motion and coordinating their movements underground. After a period of time of at least 2 weeks,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> SCP-2955 instances will resurface and reassemble themselves, preferring locations that are devoid of any pre-existing human settlements. When reformed, the positions of all structures in SCP-2955 remain unchanged.</p>
<p>SCP-2955 was originally classified as an Extra-normal Event (EE-72806), due to unsubstantiated evidence of its existence initially. Below is the documentation of EE-72806.</p>

<p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A "golden city" of Pueblo origin was sighted by an archaeological team researching on Incan History, which was seemingly destroyed by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake that occurred shortly after it was identified by team members. No debris of said "city" were found onsite.<br/>
<strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 15/08/2007<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Ica Region, Peru<br/>
<strong>Follow-up Action:</strong> No cognitohazardous or memetic infection were identified among the members of the archaeological team. Class A amnestics were administrated to them afterwards. The area is to be put under observation for a period of 1 year.</p>

<p>After a similar sighting and seismic event in Gorgona Island, Colombia on 09/09/2007, it was determined to be another instance of EE-72806 and the anomaly was reclassified as SCP-2955. Below is a catalogue of known locations SCP-2955 has appeared in, since its discovery by the Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2955-2:</strong> While inside SCP-2955, aerial drones were able to detect low frequency (&lt;20 Hz) Rayleigh waves emitting constantly from SCP-2955. Upon inspecting the sample of SCP-2955 available to the Foundation, each SCP-2955 instance is identified to be producing individual Rayleigh waves.</p>
<p>SCP-2955 instances from the sample are noted to be vibrating at increasing frequencies, often breaking their container via resonance. This has led to multiple counts of containment breach since its acquisition. Sample was incinerated on ██/██/2009.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2955-3:</strong> On ██/██/2009, approximately 400,000 gold nuggets were found in proximity of SCP-2955. According to surveillance, they were produced from SCP-2955, via a process similar to moulting. These nuggets do not trigger transmigration events, and do not possess any anomalous properties.</p>

<p>About 18 hours prior to the incident, the extracted sample was slated to be returned to the main body of SCP-2955, approved by Area-846 Director.</p>
<p>For said procedure, a Valkyrie-class aerial delivery drone was to be flown near SCP-2955 and drop a vial containing the sample at 3 metres outside the perimeter of SCP-2955. A cover story that the sample was incinerated was disseminated to personnel with Level 2 or below clearance. Procedure was successful and SCP-2955 sample rejoined the main body.</p>
