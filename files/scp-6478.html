<p>SCP-6478-1</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-6478 incidents are to be catalogued and stored on-file for archival purposes. If a subject is found in possession of SCP-6478-1, personnel are to attempt to coerce them into ingesting it.</p>
<p>Unused SCP-6478-1 instances are to be confiscated by the Pharmaceutical Department for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-6478 is a phenomenon that primarily affects individuals suffering from recurrent and consistent derealization and depersonalization.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> An SCP-6478 event typically occurs as follows with little deviation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subject becomes cognizant after a period of missing time. This can be due to either unconsciousness, memory lapse, or dissociative episode.</li>
<li>Subject interacts with their environment as is typical.</li>
<li>Subject finds a written note left behind in a place they encounter highly often (i.e. bathroom mirror, bedside table, bedroom door). There is a small medicinal tablet attached to the note. The tablet (hereafter referred to as SCP-6478-1) appears identical to cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride.</li>
<li>Subject either will or will not ingest SCP-6478-1.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results and side effects of ingesting SCP-6478-1 are inconclusive.</p>

<td colspan="2">On 17 May 2019, Sewell was in her kitchenette preparing a cake for a grandson's birthday when she experienced a dissociative episode. While she recalled her perceptions clearly and succinctly, she was unable to explain a gap in her memory in which she regained cognition as she was sitting on the side of her bed. A note was placed on her bedside table with SCP-6478-1 taped to it.</td>

During one episode on 22 March 2007, Mahdi was staring at herself in the bathroom mirror before walking to her personal computer in order to complete an assignment for work. Mahdi stated that when she sat in her office chair, it felt as if it were made of "grasping hands" that were attempting to hold her in place or "drag [her] under." Mahdi discovered a note and SCP-6478-1 instance inside her bathroom mirror's medicine cabinet.</td>

Scans revealed a severe drop in the frequency of electrical signals throughout the entire cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and brainstem. It is currently unknown if Dr. Bron's consciousness is intact or if he is able to dream.</td>

Depersonalization and derealization are defined by an individual not feeling in touch with their surrounding environment, usually to such an extent as to where their surroundings do not feel tangible or real. It is also signified through an emotional detachment to the self and environment through an almost dreamlike dissociation.</div>
