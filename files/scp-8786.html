<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All recovered SCP-8786 subjects are to be kept within Biohazard Humanoid Containment Cells within Heavy Containment in Site-17. They have been implanted with trackers in case of a containment breach. They are to be given daily injections of anesthetics into the base of their necks. Lethal force is authorized to ensure the compliance of the SCP-8786 subjects. Non-compliant or outright hostile behaviors are to be reported immediately, and the subjects administered a second dose of anesthetics if they exhibit any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unnaturally dilated pupils</li>
<li>Rapid muscle spasms</li>
<li>Bleeding from the eyes, nose, or ears</li>
<li>Loss of their ability to speak, read, or comprehend language</li>
</ul>
<p>If the SCP-8786 subjects attack personnel, or if they breach containment, then the explosive collars around their necks are to be activated remotely to terminate them. The subjects must be re-contained, physically and chemically restrained, and fitted with a new collar before they regenerate and reawaken.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8786 is a species of worm-like parasitic creatures of an unknown origin. They are of a deep red-black coloration, and possess dozens of long, thin tendrils extending from their main bodies. They do not have any other organs or extremities. The parasites can enter the body through orifices or open wounds. Once inside the body, the parasites coil around the lower spine and dig into the spinal cord. After a variable period of incubation, the parasites "kill" the host and assume control of the body. After a period of dormancy, the parasites reawaken and become highly aggressive, attempting to kill or infect anyone around them. They are incapable of speech, and lack any demonstrable sapience in this 'feral' state. They are not affected by drugs or memetic agents in this state, due to brain-death.</p>
<p>Their primary anomalous property is the ability to telekinetically move and destroy objects from a distance. This produces immense heat as a byproduct. Their secondary ability is the rapid and total regeneration of damaged tissue and bone of both themselves and their host. The range and strength of a SCP-8786 parasite's abilities decreases with hunger, injury, and exhaustion. Small doses of a nerve agent will severely weaken a SCP-8786's abilities and disorient them, and can return them to a sapient and communicative state, the human brain now resuming normal function.</p>
<p>Two SCP-8786 subjects have been contained.</p>
<p>SCP-8786-1 was formerly Riley Dunne, a female born on May 13th, 1970 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is fair-skinned with black hair and grey eyes.</p>
<p>SCP-8786-2 was formerly Katie Reid, a female born on January 17th, 1969 in Detroit, Michigan. It is fair-skinned with brown-red hair and dark green eyes.</p>

<p>How does this— Oh, has it started? Right, so. My name is Emily Moore, I'm a researcher at Site-17. It is June 12, 1985. I'm making these, uh, I guess we'll call them 'logs' on this cassette recorder. To record my thoughts, I guess. I find it useful to listen back to them later.</p>
<p>So, a small group of us junior researchers were studying under Dr. Allen. Doing his grunt work, almost dying to anomalies, that sort of thing. The higher ups came in and told all of us yesterday that he perished under circumstances they "could not disclose" and now his queue of anomalies and research projects are being divided up between several senior researchers, and a few "promising" junior researchers. And guess what? <em>I got one.</em> A new skip that's just come in, humanoid, potentially highly dangerous. And I get to be lead researcher! I don't even have my doctorate yet, and someone up high is trusting <em>me</em> with this!</p>
<p>Oh my God, this is so exciting! And a little frightening. They haven't sent over much about it yet, but it killed three police officers before it was contained. With telekinetic abilities apparently, which it has not demonstrated since containment. So, I suppose it's my job to figure out why. And hope this thing doesn't tear my head off in the process. This is such an incredible opportunity though! If I can make sure this object is safely contained, it will look <em>so good</em> on my record. I know we’re really short staffed here at the moment but I didn’t expect them to do something like this. I’m sure as hell not going to waste it though.</p>
<p>Right, so, I'm waiting on some paperwork to go through and then I can get my first look at the anomaly. Should be later today, I hope. James and Brian will be working with me in the lab, which is… fine. I guess. I didn't talk with them much when we were with Dr. Allen, so this might be awkward. I get the feeling they're a little intimidated by me. They should be. Well, I suppose that's it for now.</p>

<p><em>SCP-8786-1 is restrained to the far wall of its cell in a straitjacket, forced into a kneeling position. It is shaking and breathing heavily. It looks up as the door opposite it opens and Lead Researcher Emily Moore enters, along with Junior Researcher James Schmidt and Security Officer Kim Park.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Okay, well, it looks calm to me.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Wasn't earlier, damn thing kept trying to bite me as we put it in that straitjacket. Had to taser it like a dozen times.</p>
<p><em>Moore cautiously takes a step forward towards SCP-8786-1. Schmidt and Park remain standing directly in the doorway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Did you get the bullets out beforehand?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Didn't have to, they just fell out. It heals fast, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Huh. Has it spoken at all since it woke up?</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Nope, not a word. It's probably just another dumb monster.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Let’s not jump to conclusions now, James.</p>
<p><em>Schmidt scoffs. Moore takes a few more steps towards SCP-8786-1. It lets out a long hiss and she hesitates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Careful, you saw the tape, right? You know what that thing can do.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Then why hasn't it? Is it choosing not to?</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> I don't know, but judging from the way it's looking at you Emily, I think it would be trying to kill you right now if it could.</p>
<p><em>Moore takes a few more steps towards SCP-8786-1 before crouching down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Hello? Can you understand me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 stares directly at Moore, unblinking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I need you to give me some kind of sign that there's still somebody in there.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 flexes and unflexes its jaw, showing its teeth, and emits more hissing vocalizations. It shudders violently and tugs against its binds. Moore sighs and examines it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> When was the last time you fed it?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> We haven't yet.</p>
<p><em>Moore looks behind her at the two men.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You mean it hasn't eaten since before containment? It must be starving.</p>
<p><em>Moore turns back towards the anomaly and jumps. SCP-8786-1 has strained itself forward in an attempt to bite her. She takes a deep breath and sighs before standing back up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do you think it's unable to utilize its abilities because of its lack of sustenance, James?</p>
<p><em>Schmidt shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> That'd be my guess, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Then what should we do, let it starve?</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Whatever keeps it in containment, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> We can't let it die from malnourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> And we also can't let it manifest its telekinetic abilities or we'll end up like those cops.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You're right. I just— We just don't know enough yet. We need to run some tests today, see if we can't find out what's making it so aggressive. And where its powers went.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> It's gonna be a long night.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I can get some coffee for everyone?</p>
<p><em>Schmidt claps his hand against Park's shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Thanks, buddy.</p>
<p><em>Moore looks back towards SCP-8786-1. It has not stopped staring at her since she entered the room. She crosses her arms and moves to leave the room. Schmidt and Park follow, the door closing and locking behind them. SCP-8786-1 glances around the room before slouching and staring at the floor.</em></p>

<p><em>Emily Moore and James Schmidt are leaning against a table in the lab. Moore is writing in a notepad. Schmidt is sipping from a cup of coffee and glances at the clock on the wall. After a few minutes, Junior Researcher Brian Jansen enters with a small stack of papers in his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Finally.</p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> Okay, obviously it's going to take awhile for all of the tests to go through, but there's something interesting here you should see.</p>
<p><em>He walks over to Moore and she sets her notepad down. He hands the top page over to her. She reads through it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> How? This is— It shouldn't even be alive.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Apparently, about half of its organs aren't even functioning. At all. Its entire urinary and reproductive systems are shriveled, half of its digestive system is working without the other half. The outer lobes of its brain are just… dark. And this— Wait, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> You're asking me? You're the biologist.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Its spinal cord is lit up like a Christmas tree, there's some kind of growth there. Like, a clump of nerves, wrapped around the base of the spine. It doesn't look like anything I've ever seen or heard of.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Maybe we should cut it open, see what it is.</p>
<p><em>Moore glances up at Schmidt.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Yeah, no.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> What? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do I really need to explain to you why that's a bad idea?</p>
<p><em>Schmidt shrugs. Moore sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> I really don't see what's the fuckin' problem here.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> We're not doing it, James, and that's final. We're just going to wait for the rest of the images and tests to come in.</p>
<p><em>Schmidt snorts and rolls his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> Well, guards put it back in its cell for the night anyway so, no more tests for now.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> How was it looking?</p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> It fought and struggled like usual, but it was looking really faint and limp.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Shit. We've got to feed it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> If we give it food, its powers might flare up in an instant and rip all of our heads off.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> It hasn't eaten in two days now, it might not last a third. There's got to be a way to feed it just enough to keep it conscious but not enough to give it real strength.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Right then, while you figure that out, I'm turning in for the night. I'm wiped.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Alright, go ahead. I'll finish things up here.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> <em>(Mumbling)</em> Wasn't asking for your fucking permission, Emily.</p>
<p><em>Schmidt leaves the room. Jansen sets the papers down on the table behind Moore.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> Guess I'm gonna head out, too.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Seriously? Can't you help me sort these papers?</p>
<p><strong>Jansen:</strong> I mean, I could, but…</p>

<p>Okay, it's now the fifteenth already, wow. Um, still June. Obviously. So, I've taken to hand feeding the skip protein bars, shooting for around 1,000 calories a day. I almost lost a finger yesterday, but it seems to be working, it's not shaking quite so much anymore. This feels like a short-term solution, though. Eventually, it will likely start consuming its own muscles for sustenance, since it cannot survive off this little food forever. Probably. That's assuming a lot I suppose, its biology doesn't make much sense to me. Still, it's clearly suffering.</p>
<p>We're walking a fine knife edge here, I have to be so incredibly careful with the calories. I fed it just a little too much once and there was this tingling heat in the air around me. I could <em>feel</em> it trying to rip me apart. Gave me quite a scare. I jumped back but it still seemed too weak to do any damage. I have to do this alone, every day. The other two cowards don't dare enter the cell with me.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of, at least Brian finished up with the bloodwork and everything today. The results were inconclusive. Biologically speaking it's still human but there's been such fine… I can only describe it as tweaking at the cellular level. Primarily in the nervous system, there's new connections everywhere. And that thing, in its spine. It's… well it's not of this earth. It's a creature, a parasite of some kind. It must have done all of this to that poor girl. It killed her. Turned her body into, well, my best guess is something akin to an electromagnet. Except it's not electromagnetism, but some kind of mental energy, I think. That parasite is just so beyond our understanding of biology, it seems to be made up entirely of nerves and muscle. It has countless tendrils extending from its body, all linked into the human nervous system so intricately I cannot tell where the human nerves end and the parasite begins. It has merged with the body, like an organ transplant. I'm not sure there's anything left of the girl that thing used to be, that parasite is running the show now. It's incredibly fascinating. And horrifying. Where did it come from? Could there be more infected people out there? I suppose it's not my job to worry about that at the moment.</p>
<p>I should mention that all of this incredible discovery has been in spite of my stupid coworkers. I have to fight them on <em>every little thing</em>. I thought they'd respect my position, maybe understand the importance of our work. But every day it's just complaining and snark and pushback, it's infuriating! I'm going to <em>try</em> and run a couple experiments tomorrow to see what sort of drugs might work on it, maybe get it to calm down. We'll see if those morons get in my way or not. That's all for now.</p>

<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong> Oh great, are you done?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> For today? I guess so, but we're jumping right back into testing tomorrow. This skip is reacting weird to the drugs, nothing I give it is having any effect. It might just be too brain dead, in which case I'm going to start to try and mix things together and see if I can get a reaction out of it. Actually, I was hoping you could help me out with that part James, since you're the resident chemist.</p>

<p>I never needed either of them. I can do this by myself. I'm more of a scientist than those two ever will be. I'll contain this skip myself, I'll get my doctorate myself, I'll do everything myself like I always have. I can do this, I <em>can</em> do this, I—</p>
<p>Okay, breathe. I uh… I really do need some sleep. Alright, it is the night of the seventeenth or something, I think. I may have been a little hasty today. Tried out my first mixture on the sk— the subject. It did <em>not</em> react how I was hoping. But perhaps that should be expected, as I've only just started. I suppose I can confirm the skip does still feel pain, it screamed <em>a lot</em>. I almost feel a little bad. I know it's just an anomaly, a <em>parasite</em>, but it still looks and sounds like a little girl.</p>
<p>I'll get some rest tonight, and take some more time on the next attempt. I might have to pop open some old textbooks, but I'll figure it out. I have to.</p>

<p><em>SCP-8786-1 is restrained to the wall in a straitjacket. The door opens and its head jerks up as Emily Moore enters. It lets out a loud hiss, showing its teeth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Yeah, I know, it's me again.</p>
<p><em>Moore closes the door behind her and walks over to SCP-8786-1, fiddling with a pneumatic injection device.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Let's see what this does, I guess.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 struggles and kicks against its bonds, breathing heavily with wide eyes. Moore checks the injector one last time before forcefully grabbing SCP-8786-1 by the neck.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> <em>(Mumbling)</em> Quit squirming, would you?</p>
<p><em>Moore sweeps SCP-8786-1's hair out of the way and jabs the injector into the back of its neck. SCP-8786-1 shrieks. Moore presses the plunger and holds the device there for approximately five seconds before pulling it out. She then takes a step back and crosses her arms, watching the object. SCP-8786-1 curls its legs into its chest and whimpers, before shuddering violently and letting out a scream. Moore sighs and rubs at her eyes. SCP-8786-1 hyperventilates in between loud grunts of pain. It suddenly gags and vomits onto the floor. Moore reflexively steps back from the red puddle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Ugh, fuckin' great.</p>
<p><em>She hesitates before leaning in to examine the pool of blood closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What is—</p>
<p><em>Something small and dark is wriggling inside the pool of blood. Moore takes several steps back. The entity suddenly swims in her direction. She stomps on it, before backing off. The entity lies motionless.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><em>She crouches down to inspect the entity, before glancing up at SCP-8786-1. It watches back, blood dripping down its face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Did you just spit that at me on purpose?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 doesn't respond. Moore stands back up and moves towards the door, leaving and shutting it behind her. SCP-8786-1 whimpers in pain. The blood pool starts to flow down the drain in the middle of the cell. After a few minutes, Moore returns with a specimen container and scoops the entity into it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Actually, would be lovely if you could barf up a few more little babies for me.</p>
<p><em>She smiles at SCP-8786-1. It stares back blankly. She shrugs and stands back up before leaving the cell once again. SCP-8786-1 closes its eyes and leans to the side, breathing heavily.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-8786-1 sits incredibly still, staring directly at the door. Emily Moore enters with a handful of protein bars and a water bottle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You better behave yourself today.</p>
<p><em>Moore takes a few steps forward before stopping.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Quit talking to it, Emily. It can't understand you.</p>
<p><em>Moore sighs and walks over to the object, kneeling down next to it. She sets down the bottle and begins unwrapping the bars before hesitating. She sniffs the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> <em>(Quietly)</em> Is something burning?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 suddenly lunges forward, its restraints falling away with little resistance. Moore shouts and falls backwards. SCP-8786-1 crawls on top of her. It bites down into the side of her neck and she screams, before pushing SCP-8786-1 off of her. A large chunk of flesh is torn off of Moore's neck, stuck in SCP-8786-1's teeth. Moore kicks SCP-8786-1 in the stomach and it falls to the ground with a shriek.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What… What d'you fucking do to me?</p>
<p><em>A SCP-8786 parasite wriggles in the torn bleeding flesh of Moore's neck. She claws at her neck and manages to pull it out, tossing it to the floor. Moore pulls herself back up to her feet and stomps on it hard. SCP-8786-1 attempts to stand up, and Moore kicks it in the stomach again, then in the neck and stomach once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You little fucking shit!</p>
<p><em>Moore puts a hand on her neck, which is bleeding profusely. The door opens and Security Officer Kim Park runs in, pointing his submachine gun at the object.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Shit, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You're a little fucking late.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I came in as soon as I could.</p>
<p><em>He suddenly aims his firearm at Moore.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Wait! Are you infected?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> No, put that thing down. You better get some more guys in here.</p>
<p><em>Park aims his firearm back at the object.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> What the hell happened? How'd it get loose?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Look.</p>
<p><em>She gestures to the restraints on the wall and on the object. The thick white cords are cut in half and singed black.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> It must have been cutting at them little by little these past weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Well, shit. What're we gonna do about that?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> For starters I'm going to be feeding it a little less, see how it likes that. And I have some other ideas, too…</p>
<p><em>Moore looks down at the object. It's curled into a fetal position, bleeding from the mouth. It's whimpering and struggling to breathe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Clean this thing up, I'm going to go patch up my neck.</p>
<p><em>Moore exits the cell. Two more security guards enter in after her.</em></p>

<p>That clever little freak. I'm not showing it any more kindness now. It thinks it can outsmart me? It just made its life even worse. It tried to infect me! Twice! Tried to puke up a little baby parasite right into my neck, the bitch!</p>
<p>… Okay, calm the fuck down, Em. You're not intimidated by a stupid little parasite inside a dead girl.</p>
<p>Alright, I'm only going to be feeding it every other day now. And I'll have to check its bonds regularly. Maybe carry a taser with me just to be safe. As for the tests, forget sedatives and depressants. I'm starting with the hard stuff, going to work my way down the list. See how much it can take. Something's gotta knock it out for real.</p>

<p><strong>Park:</strong> Oh, of course you're in here.</p>
<p><em>Moore doesn't turn around but lets out a sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What do you want, Park?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Geez Emily, we've been working together for awhile now, could at least try to pretend like you like me.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Don't take it so personally; I don't like anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> You never eat at the cafeteria or come to anybody's parties anymore either, hardly anybody ever sees you. I only ever find you here or in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Is there a point to this?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I just— Sorry, I just came in here to let you know they're bringing in another one.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Another what?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Another 8786.</p>
<p><em>Moore turns around and sets her notepad down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> That girl from the police station tape. The one that got flung into a desk, not the blonde.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Fucking great. She was in the hospital, how'd they miss the parasite?</p>
<p><em>Park shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Didn't know what to look for, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Did it hurt anybody?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Oh yeah, killed a couple of kids at school. Field guys are still cleaning up the mess right now.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> God fucking damnit! These stupid fucking parasites!</p>
<p><em>Moore stands up and walks over to Park.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> There better not be any more of them.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> They told me there were some parasites in the bodies, but they haven't woken up yet. Might be dead for real. They were going to check the girl's mother next. Guess they're gonna have to keep a real close eye on that town from now on.</p>
<p><em>Moore sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Alright, I think I'm getting close to something here. Did you know this parasite doesn't sleep, ever?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I never noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Check the cams, it goes still when nobody's around but it's always awake. I think that's cause its little 'lizard brain' is running at 110%, 24/7. Might be why its always overheating. But some of the new stronger stuff I've been trying on it recently has been having more of an effect. I just have to keep poking at its brain until I can to put it into a coma and then we can officially call it contained. I suppose it'll be helpful to have a new test subject.</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Right then. You, uh, done in here? They're bringing in the new one in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Yeah, just let me clean up a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Park:</strong> Put it down right there.</p>
<p><em>He points at a second restraint that has been bolted into the wall right next to SCP-8786-1. The guards drag SCP-8786-2 over there and forcefully sit it down. They begin tying it up, lacing the wall's cords into the loops on the straitjacket.</em></p>

<p><strong>Park:</strong> Right, have fun with that. Holler if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Don't you have other skips to guard?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Not really. Heavy containment has been surprisingly, heh, light this year. These two have been causing the most problems so far.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Well, they shouldn't for much longer.</p>

<p>Alright. It's the first of September now. The new one is the same as the old. Same growth on the inside. Same habits and behaviors. And the two of them are never hostile towards each other, only ever at me. It's like they know the one next to it is another of their kind.</p>
<p>Everything I've been trying on them just seems to make the both of them even more aggressive and unpredictable. 8786-1 started slamming its head into the wall one day and I had to tase it to get it to stop. Drugs just aren't pressing on the right areas of the brain, I'm shooting in the dark here. The only thing that makes them calm down is… well, poisons. Nerve agents. Things that just attack the nervous system.</p>
<p>I hesitate to use too much out of fear of killing them outright, but fuck it. They've taken everything I've thrown at them so far and fought it off in a day or two. Any drug I give them, they're able to just filter it out of their system and puke it back up. I'm gonna need a real intense dose to knock 'em out for good. I've got a few things to use in mind. The kind of stuff that would result in a really painful death for any normal human.</p>
<p>I'll try it on just one, at first. In case it does die, I'll still have the other.</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I'll get you food if you answer my questions.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Okay…</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Now, 8786-1, can you tell me what you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> A… person? Why are you calling me that? I have a name! I can remember it now.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> And what would that be?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Riley.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Of course, sure. What else do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> That girl in the cell with me, I think I used to know her. I think she helped me once? Her name is Kaylee. No, Katie. Why can't she talk? What's wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I'll explain everything soon. Now, how do you feel right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Scared, hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do you feel like you want to hurt people?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> What? No, of course not!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do you feel like you could hurt me with your mind if you thought hard enough?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do you know what you are?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Why are you asking me this? I don't understand what you want.</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Riley Dunne has been brain dead for the past three months.</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> In a manner of speaking.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> But I remember the cell, and you! I can't have been dead!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You remember that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> It felt like I was dreaming, or looking through somebody else's eyes. I couldn't— I couldn't think. It's so foggy. Your face— I didn't recognize you at first. But you're the woman in the white coat who kept jabbing me in the neck. Why did you do that? You kept hurting me for so long.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I was trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Help me? What's wrong with me? Why am I restrained like this? Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You're not human, that's why you are here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Not— I'm human! My name is Riley, I live in an apartment, I have parents, I'm hu— I-I <em>had</em> parents. Mom… Dad… oh… Dad, he— Did I—</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 whines and begins hyperventilating.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I did something. W-what did I do?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You hurt people. With your mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> How is that— How could I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> It's in your nature.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No! No, I'm a good person!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You're a parasite. You killed the girl whose body you now inhabit, and you killed her father, and two more men.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't trust that for a second. It's a trick of some kind, an adaptation, trying to get me to lower my guard, to empathize with it. Well that's not going to happen. I'm not slipping up and letting these things get loose.</p>
<p>I have to be careful though. Now that they can talk, the committee's going to be up my ass if I go too far with this. Fuck. Can't go back now, I guess I'll inject the other one, see how it reacts. I don't understand how this happened, the injection was just a nerve agent, pure poison. The parasite is still active, but somehow the rest of the brain just… switched back on all of a sudden. Maybe it shocked the parasite so much it just spasmed and turned the brain back on out of panic?</p>
<p>I just don't know. But I <em>do</em> know that they're still inhuman. And dangerous.</p>

<p><em>SCP-8786-2 gags and rests its head on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> 8786-2? I need you to answer my questions.</p>

<p>Damnit. That Durand asshole came back again, I had to tell him everything. I didn't get anything useful out of the interviews yet, no confirmation that the skips are still violent. Now he's telling me I have to "abide by ethical standards when dealing with sentient humanoids" or whatever the fuck. Basically he wants me to start giving these things privileges. No, fuck that. These things are just waiting for us to ease up so they can break out. I can get away with starving them for a little while longer; let's hope further interviews will give me something to work with.</p>

<strong>Date:</strong> September 4th, 1985<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 8:02am<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Emily Moore<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8786-1</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING BEGINS]</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 is now out of a straitjacket and in standard humanoid clothing. It scratches at the metal table. Emily Moore enters the room and sits down in the chair opposite of the object.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Alright, let's try this again, shall we?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Why don't we start with the events leading up to your incident. What can you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I remember a lot more now. Um… first I ran away from home. And got lost.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Can you tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Because of my mom, a-and my dad. Mom got sick. And she didn't get better. And then the hospital called and said she died in the night. And after that, dad got worse. He was always bad, even when mom was still around, but after that he just…</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> He what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Well he would drink a lot, and get really sad and angry.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Did he hurt you?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 looks down at the table and nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> So you ran away from home?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I packed a bag and tried going north. I just wanted to get out of the city, away from him. I think I tried hitchhiking for a while but that grew dangerous. You know, all these people who thought they would be helping me by taking me back home. Or people who looked even more scary and dangerous than my dad.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> So… you walked? Two hundred miles?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I think I stole a bike at one point.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Where were you trying to go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I don't know, Canada? I got lost, eventually. It grew harder to find towns and the forests seemed to get bigger and bigger and my food started running out. One night, I think I was drinking water from a pond and something weird happened.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What was it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1</strong> A bunch of plants were burned in a patch around the pond and the rocks looked… warped, and kind of weird. Like maybe lightning had struck there or something? But then there was something big. In the woods. It looked like a deer, it was hard to tell in the dark. But it was eating something that smelled dead. And its face, it— deer don't do that. I got scared and ran and tripped down a slope and I guess I hit my head really hard on some rocks. When I woke up there was so much blood everywhere. I don't know how I didn't die. But I couldn't remember anything then. Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I just remembered I left my backpack by that pond.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Do you think you could tell me where you found that pond?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> It must have been somewhere south of that town, 'cause when I woke up I was right next to it.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> That's where you met Katie Reid?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Yeah. When I woke up I cleaned the blood off my face and walked into town. I saw her and… her friend. I can't remember her name.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Ashley Carter?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> That sounds about right. I followed them into the arcade and I just wanted to play games with them. Be their friend. But Katie noticed something was wrong with me pretty quickly and she tried to help me. Ashley protested, I remember. She didn't like me, I got scared every time she looked at me. But Katie took me to her house and let me shower and eat food.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Was Katie's mother home?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No, she was at work I think. Ashley called the cops. And we all went to the station, and then my dad came to get me, and I was starting to remember things around then and I got so scared and angry that I got this far, I met such a nice person like Katie and he was going to drag me all the way back home with him! I didn't want to let him take me, and then all of a sudden it was so easy to just think about it and… remove his arm.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Then, you killed him.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 grows quiet for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I didn't— I didn't mean to. I didn't even know I could. But when I saw all that blood, there was a rush. A feeling shot up my spine. I just— I was <em>so</em> angry. At him, at the stupid cops that were going to let him take me. And it was just… so easy. To just think about it, and everything moved around me the way I told it to, melting, ripping. It felt so good. I liked it, I think. For a moment. But then I realized I had just done something I could never take back. And Katie… I thought she would hate me now. But she still tried to help me. Even after what I had just done. And I hurt her. I couldn't control myself and I hurt her. And now I don't expect her to ever forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> So, you admit it then? You are a killer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> … Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> And do you have an… urge to hurt me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> <em>(Quietly)</em> I'm thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> That'll be all for today, then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No, come on, I didn't— Don't put me back in that box! I didn't mean it!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> A fair warning, 8786-1, do not ever try to harm me or any other Foundation personnel. Or we <em>will</em> have to terminate you.</p>
<p><em>Moore stands up and moves to leave the room. SCP-8786-1 groans and sets its head down on the table. Security Officer Kim Park enters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> C'mon, time to go.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Yeah, yeah I know…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 slowly stands up and walks over to Park.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> No sudden moves, now.</p>
<p><em>Both of them exit the room.</em></p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Could you tell me what led you to take the lives of four young girls?</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I need you to talk to me, I need to know what happened.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-2 remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Was there something going on at school? Were other kids mean to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> … Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Did Ashley Carter hurt you?</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You lost the ability to recognize human faces?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> I don't know!

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> I shouldn't have done that, I shouldn't have let all that anger and hate get into my heart. I let something into me, didn't I? Something evil.

<p><strong>[RECORDING BEGINS]</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 and SCP-8786-2 sit together opposite of Emily Moore.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Why are we both in here today?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> I'd like to try to explain to the both of you what exactly you are again.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I know what we are, I'm Riley and that's Katie. And you weird government weirdos are keeping us locked up because we killed some people.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> With telekinetic abilities, yes. But do you know why both of you can do these things?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> You called me a parasite.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Yes. Wrapped around both of your spines is a thin, long, worm-like creature. We don't know where this parasite came from, but it has changed your internal biology. It allows you to do these things, and <em>it</em> is what's really in control. I imagine it is what I'm talking to right now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-2 shudders and appears nauseous. It curls up and hides its face in its knees.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I don't understand what you're talking about! I can remember everything now, I can remember my whole life! Even if this parasite is inside of me, I'm still me!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You don't understand. When we found you after your "incidents", you were clinically dead. Not sleeping, <em>dead</em>. When you woke up neither of you could speak, neither of you seemed to understand anything. Both of you were mindlessly aggressive. Brain dead. You hear me? You tried to attack our people— <em>you</em>, 8786-1, attacked me! You gave me this!</p>
<p><em>She gestures to the deep scar on the side of her neck.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> But I never wanted to hurt anyone! I didn't mean to— Neither of us meant to do what we did!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> But you did do it, your parasitic instincts compelled you to. The only reason we are able to speak now is, miraculously, the drugs I was testing on you resulted in an unexpected reaction. Your brains turned back on for some reason. But you, both of you, are. Not. Human. I need you to understand this, so you can understand why you are here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Is that why you refuse to call us by our names? Because you think we're just, what, some alien parasites controlling dead bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> That is exactly what you are. And your names are SCP-8786-1 and SCP-8786-2 now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Why? I get we are prisoners here, wherever here is. But, we can speak now, we don't want to hurt anybody, why are you so mean to us?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Because you both are a threat to everyone around you, your ability to infect and kill others makes you dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> So… we're just supposed to live in that cell forever? Katie can't ever see her mom again?</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> It's for the best.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> For the best?! How could you say that?!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Because I know what you really are! You can't fool me. I'm not letting either of you parasites hurt anyone ever again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I'm not a parasite!</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Yes you are, you're a murderer and a monster and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I am NOT!</p>
<p><em>The lights in the room flicker and 8786-1 grinds its fingers against the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> You freak.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 tenses up. The metal table begins warping slightly, and Moore stands out of her chair and takes a step back. SCP-8786-1 takes in a deep breath and the warping stops.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I-I'm not a monster.</p>
<p><em>Moore cusses and kicks her chair over, startling SCP-8786-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Neither of you are ever seeing the light of day again! I'll make sure of it!</p>
<p><em>Moore quickly leaves the room. SCP-8786-2 is sobbing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> I want to go h-home. I d-don't want to go back to that cell….</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 looks towards SCP-8786-2, then looks away, burying its face in its hands. Security Officer Kim Park enters.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-8786-2 sobs even louder and collapses onto SCP-8786-1. SCP-8786-1 is frozen for a moment before it wraps its arms around SCP-8786-2 and hugs it.

<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Maybe— Maybe we don't have to be. I'm still me and you're still you and I-I care about you. I still— I think, um…</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> I hate myself. But I can't hate you. I just—</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-2 pulls away from SCP-8786-1 and looks at it face to face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-2:</strong> I wish things didn't… happen like this. I wish we could have gone to the same school and played arcade games and been normal. I don't blame you for any of this. But I just don't know right now. How I feel… about you. About us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Okay. That's okay.</p>

<p><strong>Moore:</strong> They're monsters! They're just pretending to be people! I'm <em>trying</em> to show you that! Let me prove it!</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> They may have been hostile before, but they aren't now. Drop the taser, before you make things worse for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Fucking make me.</p>
<p><em>Moore motions to electrocute SCP-8786-2 once again. Durand rushes her and they struggle for the weapon. Emily tries to jab him with the taser but he grabs her wrist and slams her hand into the floor, making her drop it. SCP-8786-1 runs forward and grabs it, then stands over SCP-8786-2, guarding it. Durand begins to overpower Moore. She tries to kick at him as he presses her into the floor. He eventually gets her hands behind her back and she yells.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Get off of me! They're going to kill us all! The moment you slip up they will rip us all to pieces!</p>
<p><em>Durand presses his knee into her back and keeps her held down. The cell door opens and Kim Park rushes in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I'm sorry Emily I tried to stop him but—</p>
<p><em>He stops. Durand looks at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Ah, shit.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> You were in on this?</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> I didn't— She just said she was going to—</p>
<p><em>He notices the now armed SCP-8786-1. He draws his sidearm and aims at it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Drop the weapon!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> FUCK OFF!</p>
<p><em>Durand looks between the object and Park then grunts as Moore tries once again to break free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> If you want to keep your job asshole, forget about the skip. Get over here and cuff her right now!</p>
<p><em>Park groans and obeys, holstering his gun and unhooking his handcuffs. He moves over to Durand and Moore and crouches down to get the cuffs around Moore's wrists.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Fuck! Kim, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>Park:</strong> Sorry, Emily, but you've gone off the deep end. I'm not losing my job over this.</p>
<p><em>Durand moves off of her and Park stands Moore up. She pants, her face bruised. SCP-8786-2's blood stains her cheek from the pool on the floor. She makes one last attempt to break away from Park but is too weak.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Get her out of here. Don't try anything.</p>
<p><em>Park nods and begins walking Moore out of the cell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moore:</strong> Durand you fucker! You'll get us all killed! Useless fucking ethics are going to get us all killed!</p>
<p><em>Moore is dragged out of the cell and Durand turns towards the shaking SCP-8786-1, who is gripping the taser tightly and pointing at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> S-stay away!</p>
<p><em>Durand raises his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> It's okay, I won't touch you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> You people are insane! All of this is insane!</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I'm sorry, kid, I'm sorry she hurt you. Just… give me the taser, okay?</p>
<p><em>He slowly begins reaching for it. SCP-8786-1 flinches but lets him take it out of its hands. It drops its arms before hugging its body, panting. Durand pockets the taser.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> This is not how things are supposed to happen here, I'm so sorry. I tried to tell them over and over that she was losing it. This place gets to people sometimes.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 remains silent, but crouches down to look at SCP-8786-2. SCP-8786-2 is crying softly, hugging its bloody shirt.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Are you both alright? Do you need anything?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I-I don't know. Katie's hurt…</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Okay then. I'll get you both something to eat and somebody to take a look at her. I'll be right back.</p>
<p><em>He stands up and moves to leave the cell, glancing back for a moment before stepping out.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Katie?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 reaches out to touch SCP-8786-2's shoulder. It flinches and curls up tighter, hiccupping in between quiet sobs. SCP-8786-1 retracts its arm and sighs, moving away from SCP-8786-2 and leaning against the wall.</em></p>

<p><strong>Interview Room H-5 — Video Transcript — Interview 8786.4</strong><br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> September 7th, 1985<br/>
<strong>Time:</strong> 10:06am<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Eric Durand<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-8786-1, SCP-8786-2</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[RECORDING BEGINS]</strong></p>
<p><em>Both SCP-8786 objects are sitting at one side of the table. SCP-8786-1 is picking at the skin around its nails. SCP-8786-2 has its legs pulled up onto the chair and its face buried in its knees. Durand enters the room and takes a seat opposite.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Hey, you two. How are we feeling today?</p>
<p><em>Both anomalies remain quiet. 8786-1 eventually speaks up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Um… better today, I guess. Katie, I don't know. She won't talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> She doesn't have to speak then, if she doesn't want to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Hey, you didn't call her an "it".</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Ah, yes. Given my job I'm exempt from those rules.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> What even is your job?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Well, I'm supposed to make sure humanoids like you aren't being mistreated. It seems I terribly failed you both in that sense. Your case was… complicated. You both were deemed non-sapient and extremely hostile when you arrived, so Moore's treatment of you two went unreported. I only knew about it because ever since she dismissed the other researchers from her team, I've been watching her. I tried to get both of you better conditions sooner but it's been taking awhile to get the bureaucratic gears turning.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> How are things normally supposed to go, then?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Well, for starters, you would have gotten a nicer cell right away. You'll still get one, but the paperwork is gonna take a bit longer. You'll get to pick what food you want from the cafeteria. I'll get you things like books, and things to draw with. You know, to pass the time. Provided you remain cooperative with us, of course.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> … I can control myself.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I certainly hope so.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I'm not a—</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Of course you're not. We could debate all day about what exactly you are now, but ultimately it doesn't matter to me. What I'm talking to right now is a frightened young girl, but also smart and very, <em>very</em> strong too. Not everyone here will see it that way, and you may face a lot of people who find it all too easy to dehumanize you. But you don't have to be the monster they think you are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> So you don't… hate me? Like Moore did?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I try not to hate anyone, bad for the soul. You <em>are</em> dangerous, that is impossible to deny, but I choose to believe you're a good kid, murders aside.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I don't know. This all feels like one giant nightmare I can't seem to wake up from.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I'm sorry your experience here has been so unpleasant. You'll get more used to how things <em>should</em> work around here in time, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Where even <em>is</em> here?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Ah well…</p>
<p><em>Durand looks up at the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Not sure if I should be telling you this but… this is Site-17. We're in Colorado right now, near Boulder.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Site… 17? How many "sites" are there?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> A lot. I'm not sure how many exactly. But our Foundation operates worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> "Foundation"? So you aren't like, the government?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Nope, we're entirely independent and internalized. I'm sorry, did Moore not explain any of this to you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No, she just went on and on about how dangerous we were and why we needed to be locked up.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Well, besides the telekinetic murders, there are other reasons for your containment here. I'm sure you're thinking, "Alien parasites and secret coverups? Sounds like something out of a sci-fi flick!" But, yes, there's a lot of weird shit out there. Some of it beautiful, some of it horrifying. And the public at large is not ready for any of it. People would freak out if they knew about girls who could kill people with a thought, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> And then there's the fact our Foundation is not the only group that deals with the anomalous. Other groups out there would want to use you for their own gains, or to destroy you outright. But here, you're safe. You're prisoners, yes, but you can live rather comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Oh great, a lifetime of imprisonment or death. What a shitty deal.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Sorry kiddo. Hey, we have pizza on Fridays.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 smirks and snorts a laugh at that. Durand smiles back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I know this is all pretty absurd.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I guess that's just how reality is.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I suppose so. Now, I'd like to talk to you about how you're feeling.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> We just did?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> No, sorry, I meant how do you feel physically? Can you describe to me what it is like having your condition?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Oh. Uh… I guess, first off, I feel super hot all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Your body heat was reported to be incredibly high, yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Yeah, it feels like a fever. Sometimes it dies down some. I'm hungry and thirsty all the time, I guess ‘cause the parasite's got to eat too…</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Can you feel it? The parasite?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 shakes its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Not really, I didn't even know what it was at first. I feel its effects on me but not like, it actually moving around or anything. Though, uh, Katie said something about being able to feel it that night when… all that happened. So I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Are you in any pain at all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Um… a little bit. Katie, much more than me.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I might be able to help with that soon.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Are you going to bring in a new doctor to jab us with drugs again?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Not unless you want me to. It's only to make you more comfortable and… stable. We don't want you loosing yourself again.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 lets out a long sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> We'll see, then.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Nothing has to be decided right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I… I don't want to see Katie suffer anymore but… I can feel— No, never mind.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> You can talk to me, Riley.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786 rubs its eyes for a moment before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I… do… want to hurt people. Moore was right.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> I mean it's like this… itch. A reflex, in the back of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> You have every right to feel angry at your circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No it's not just anger, its this… hunger. This urge, like some kinda new instinct.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Do you feel yourself giving into this instinct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No, no never. Katie wouldn't—</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 looks to SCP-8786-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Katie wouldn't like it, I know. I won't hurt anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I appreciate your honesty then, Riley. It's important we know these things. Not to punish you, just to understand you. To understand how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> … You're being really nice to me. It's kind of weirding me out.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> No! I just, compared to everything that's happened—</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> You've been through a lot, I understand.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 rubs at its arms and looks down at the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> There's something interesting I'd like to tell you about.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 looks back up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Well, our field agents reported that they found the pond you spoke of. There was no sign of any deer creatures but the pond was filled with dead fish. They looked like something had burst out from inside their stomachs, and SCP-8786 parasites swarmed around them. We're not sure how they got there but—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> But I got infected drinking from that stupid pond, didn't I?</p>
<p><em>Durand nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Ugh. I didn't even notice them, I was just so thirsty…</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> We've quarantined the pond and collected as many specimens as we could find for research. Speaking of, if you became infected from the pond, then how was Katie infected? Can you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Um, well it had to have been from me, I guess. But I don't know— Oh. The kiss.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Kiss? You and Katie… kissed?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 face flushes and it fiddles with its hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Yeah, I just— I mean, she was being really nice to me and I got a little ahead of myself…</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> But, why would you— Okay, right. Sure. That's one mystery solved, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8786-1 glances at SCP-8786-2. It peeks out from behind its knees then hides its face again when it notices SCP-8786-1 looking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Alright then, provided there's nothing else you would like to talk about, we can be done for today. I'll try and get you both in that new cell in a couple days. It actually has beds, and there's no camera.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Thanks. Oh, wait, what happened to Moore?</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Well, it's not up to me to decide what happens to her. I assume she'll be interviewed by a psychologist, they'll see if she just had a psychotic break or something. She'll be disciplined, but I don't know if she'll stay at the Foundation or not. But she'll never hurt either of you ever again, okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8786-1:</strong> Okay. Thank you again. For helping us.</p>
<p><strong>Durand:</strong> Just doing my job, kiddo.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8786.2: Psychological profiles of the SCP-8786 subjects compiled by Ethics Committee Liaison Eric Durand:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF SCP-8786-1</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8786-1 is adjusting well to life in containment. It occasionally snaps at personnel, but has shown restraint with its anomalous abilities and a willingness to follow commands.</p>
<p>SCP-8786-1 has expressed that it does not regret the murder of its father and the two deputy officers, and even enjoyed the act. It does express regret at harming SCP-8786-2. This gives insight into its view of the world and its sense of morality. It struggles to grasp the larger implications of the work we do here, but has been compliant and is not predicted to cause any trouble. It is very affectionate and protective of SCP-8786-2. This can be taken advantage of, if need be.</p>
<p>It is recommended to avoid bringing up its true nature as an anomalous parasitic entity to SCP-8786-1 as this is a topic of contention to it.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF SCP-8786-2</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8786-2 is struggling to adapt to its new situation. It remains quiet and refuses to use its anomalous abilities, even when commanded to. It rarely speaks and appears frightened by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>SCP-8786-2 is demonstrating signs of depression and deep mental trauma. It has expressed disgust and hate towards itself and a deep fear of harming others or being harmed. It seems to be conflicted about its feelings towards SCP-8786-1, alternating between caring for it and fearing it. SCP-8786-2 is predicted to be harmless so long as it doesn't return to its past non-sapient and hostile state.</p>
<p>It is recommended to avoid speaking to it about its anomalous abilities or past violent incidents, as this could destabilize it. SCP-8786-2's mother, Alice Reid, took her own life not long after it was contained. SCP-8786-2 is never to be informed of this.</p>
