<p>Technical illustration of SCP-9022.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9022 is to be contained in Garage 4-B within Site-31’s driving range. SCP-9022 needs a regular replenishment of its 4.5 kg nitrous oxide tank under the hood of the vehicle every 4-5 days as it is a required alternative to conventional human sustenance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9022 is a biomechanical anomaly currently inhabiting a modified, street-tuned 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII. It is black in color with white vinyl sidings, modifications to the bumpers, a carbon fiber hood, and spoiler. Inside the Mitsubishi is a lifeform who claims to be the owner, Alex Ruiz Akiyama, aged 24. SCP-9022 took the form of a biomass consisting of slithering flesh tendrils inhabiting the interior of the vehicle, including the hood and the trunk. Records show that Akiyama was declared deceased after the Los Angeles Police Department responded to an illegal street race on Interstate 10, south of Downtown. SCP-9022 claims that was the moment of its transition to its current anomalous form. Initial examinations show SCP-9022 is unable to leave the Mitsubishi, as its tendrils rapidly deteriorate beyond the vehicle’s interior. It does not need to eat or drink, instead relying on nitrous oxide to live as it physically deteriorates without it.</p>
<p>Doctor Jack Lightwood, specializing in biomechatronics and Doctor Paul Oswald, specializing in parabiology were both assigned to SCP-9022.</p>
<p><strong>Briefing Log 9022.1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>8/27/2009 - 07:03:19</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Morning, Paul.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Morning, Jack. Got a new anomaly coming in today.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Yeah, Sarah told me about it. What do we have so far?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Anomalous vehicle, secured in Los Angeles somewhere in Redondo Junction. A 2005 Mitsubishi Evolution Lancer, extensively modified… Was found operating without a driver after a civilian reported it to the police. Filled with biomass of flesh tendrils covering the entire interior and under the hood.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Sounds about run-of-the-mill for this place. A self-driving possessed car doesn’t seem too exciting.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Maybe not, but our MTF boys had some problems. The anomaly was actively attempting to evade pursuit. Even got one of the team hit and run over just as they were about to secure it.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“So it may be dangerous too.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Exactly. I’ve taken the liberty to secure it in one of our containment chambers.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Alright. What’s our first move?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Well I’ll be conducting an examination on it to see how it exactly works. From our initial observations, we can’t quite see anything resembling any organs. Some hair and teeth maybe, but everything else? Pure flesh. So I will be conducting a full physiological survey of the biomass inside with a team.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Ah. Alright once you’re done I’ll have a go at it as well if you don’t mind.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Not at all.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Seems like a pretty simple anomaly then?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“I wouldn’t be so sure on that, Jack. We’ve had plenty of benign looking anomalies that turn out to be lethal. This is not an exception. Caution comes first, until then. I don’t want a repeat of Site-26 in Utah. If we don’t take the normal precautions, it can be a disaster.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“That’s fair, Paul. Alright I’ll leave you to it then. Let me know when I can have a turn with it.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“I’ll let you know.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Preliminary Physiological Assessment 9022.1:</strong><br/>
8/28/2009</p>
<p>Preliminary physiological study of SCP-9022 shows the anomaly functioning through as-yet unidentified biological mechanisms. It is able to move its muscle-like tendons to assume full control of the vehicle as confirmed by the Mobile Task Force report of its capture. SCP-9022 is unable to consume food or drink. The process of how SCP-9022 maintains metabolic function remains unidentified. Initial attempts to obtain a sample of SCP-9022’s biomass were unsuccessful; any tendon that was attempted to be taken beyond the interior of the vehicle rapidly deteriorated into necrosis before desiccating into husk.</p>
<p>Following this observation, Doctor Oswald ordered in-situ study of SCP-9022 within the interior of the vehicle itself. Attempts to study deeper into SCP-9022’s physiology via exploratory survival vivisection on SCP-9022, with the intent of closing incisions and observing recovery for observation were futile due to the anomaly retreating into the small spaces of the Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>The vehicle itself exhibits no anomalous properties and has not been altered by SCP-9022 in any way. It possesses modified parts consistent with illegal street racing, such as an upgraded engine, a nitrous oxide tank, and a modified exterior. Initial mechanical analysis confirms these alterations were performed by civilian mechanics prior to manifestation.</p>
<p>A second examination has been scheduled to investigate SCP-9022’s internal physiology in greater detail.</p>

<br/>
[Lightwood enters the observation room. He eyes the vehicle in the testing chamber as it is currently inactive. He presses the button of the intercom and speaks into it.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“SCP-9022, do you copy? … Can you hear me?”</em></p>
<p>[Movement from SCP-9022 is detected. The flesh tendrils inside flow along the interior of the vehicle as it grips the headlights switch and controls it with ease.]</p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>[Flashes headlights]</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Interesting. My name is Doctor Jack Lightwood, I believe you have already met my colleague Doctor Oswald. I can see you are able to communicate. Blink your headlights twice for yes, once for no. Understood?”</em></p>
<p>[SCP-9022 stays still for a moment before it controls the headlights switch again.]<br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Good. Let’s start with something basic. Are you able to see?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Do you know how? Oswald told me you do not have visible eyes.”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>NO</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“That’s fine. May I ask then, are you human?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em></p>
<p>[Lightwood perks an eyebrow up, leaning against the desk before continuing.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Hm… Are you a human who underwent an anomalous transformation?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Do you have a name?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em></p>
<p>[Lightwood rubs his chin as he gazes towards the vehicle. He eyes the headlights, currently off, before he speaks again into the intercom.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Do you know about letter boards?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>NO</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Right, can someone come in and print out a letter board? Testing chamber six, thank you.”</em></p>
<p>This thing may be human, will need further analysis -LW</p>
<p>[Site staff enter with a small whiteboard with a printed and pasted letter board along with instructions on its use. They place it in the driver's seat of SCP-9022 before they leave the chamber.]</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: “There, try it out, SCP-9022.”<br/>
<br/>
[SCP-9022 peeks from the dashboard as it holds itself up against the letter board. It stays still for a moment before it grabs the headlights switch and starts frantically flashing the headlights as it taps at the letter board.]</p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>NITRO</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Your… name is Nitro?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>NO. NITROPLSNEEDDNOWNITRODIEDIENEED</em></p>
<p>[SCP-9022 continues to frantically flash the headlights in evident desperation and panic. Its tendrils start to honk the horn in rapid succession. It pushes the tendrils up against the driver’s side window, appearing to gaze at Lightwood.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Oh what- I need a mechanic in here, please? With nitrous oxide, ASAP.”</em></p>
<p>The anomaly was provided with a tank of nitrous oxide. Doctor Lightwood has decided to let SCP-9022 a moment to rest due to visible weakness.</p>

<p><strong>Observation Room 6 Log 9022.1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>8/27/2009 - 18:39:33</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I was able to communicate with it, SCP-9022 I mean. He understood basic instructions, answered questions, even learned from a morse code chart. It’s sentient, Paul. It’s not just some car that just chose to drive itself.”</em><br/>
<br/>
[Oswald looks at Jack skeptically as he places his notepad down before he removes his glasses.]</p>
<p>DR. OSWALD: <em>“I’m already aware of that, Jack. The sentient part. You read the reports, right? We’re still trying to determine its exact physiology and biology. It’s heavily laden with something that resembles cranial nerves. I think the whole thing is its brain, our first examination… or first attempt at least, suggests so.”</em><br/>
<br/>
[Lightwood has a look of worry as he looks between Oswald and SCP-9022.]</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“You did use anesthetics, right?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“We did, why do you ask exactly?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“This thing might be alive. And I don’t mean, just alive. I mean human.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Many anomalies resemble humans, Doctor Lightwood. Some are not humans, some pretend to be human. And some fool us into thinking it’s human only to suddenly start eating your face off. Remember the protocol, caution first. Don’t let it manipulate you in ways it could benefit. Always be skeptical.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I know, but… I'm having certain doubts about this one.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Like I said, Jack. Protocol. Keep things airtight. We’ve been colleagues for 10 years. How come you’re forgetting this now? We need to study this thing more before we can even think of considering it as truly sociable.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I’m not, it’s just. I have a feeling there’s something more with this anomaly. It begged for nitrous oxide.”</em></p>
<p>DR. OSWALD: <em>“And did you record its effects? Was it for survival or strength?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Look, just hear me out. Let me communicate with it further. You said it yourself, right? You want to study everything about it. I just want to look deeper into its inner workings. Alright?”</em></p>
<p>[Oswald looks to Lightwood for a moment before he begrudgingly sighs. He nods as he slips on his glasses.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Fine. Just try not to fall for it, will you?”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I won’t. I just need to make sure.</em></p>

<p><strong>Information Log 9022.1:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9022 has been provided with a proper letter board and stylus affixed within the vehicle cabin Its inputs will be broadcast to an external display for transcription.</p>
<p>At Doctor Lightwood's request, Site-31 cross referenced the California Department of Motor Vehicles records on license plate 8OT████. Preliminary records show the license plate to be fake. When queried, SCP-9022 reported that the Mitsubishi had been involved in a vehicular accident.</p>
<p>SCP-9022 claims it regained awareness in its anomalous state while impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department, prior to being stolen by an unidentified party. SCP-9022 stated that the vehicle was repaired at the request of a long-time rival named Shawn Lawrence.</p>
<p>When asked how it was not discovered, SCP-9022 said it hid in places where mechanic Quinn Diaz was not actively working on such as under the seats of the vehicle. Once the vehicle was fully repaired, SCP-9022 then drove the Mitsubishi out of the parking lot of the garage.</p>
<p>SCP-9022 has given the actual license plate 7AZ████. Records show the owner of the vehicle to be 24 year old Alex Ruiz Akiyama who lived in Torrance, California. When asked if it was Akiyama, SCP-9022 pointed yes.</p>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“That’s good. Sorry I was late, I had to help Oswald with something. For now he’ll be monitoring this current session.</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>ITS OKAY</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Now, I just have a few questions. I believe that Oswald and I have been getting through the surface level information of you as an anomaly. We know you need nitrous oxide, that you don’t eat, sleep, or even really breathe in a way. So I want to get to know your claimed identity. Is that alright?</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Alright.”</em><br/>
<br/>
[Lightwood adjusts his personal video camera before he sits down. He leans against the console desk as he reads a compiled file on Akiyama. He stays quiet for a moment before he speaks into the intercom.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Okay. Your claimed name is Alex Ruiz Akiyama, born June 12, 1986. Is this true?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES</em><br/>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Okay SCP-9022, where did you study for high school?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL</em><br/>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“When you graduated, what major did you apply to?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>MAJOR ENGINEERING. BUT DROPPED OUT.</em><br/>

[Lightwood then looks at the file again. His expression furrows before he speaks into the intercom.]<br/>
<br/>
[SCP-9022 correctly identifies birthplace, family, and education.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Why did you drop out?”</em><br/>

[The biomass stays still for a moment as it stops slithering for a moment. The tendrils grip the steering wheel tightly before SCP-9022 moves.]<br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>DAD DIED OF HEART ATTACK. CANT AFFORD. HAD TO HELP.</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: [Lightwood gazes at the file as he reads that Hideki Akiyama has been deceased since 2005. He sighs quietly before speaks again.]<br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I’m sorry to hear that… Alex. He must’ve been a good man.”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>HE WAS THE BEST. GOT ME THIS CAR FOR BDAY. WILL NEVER FORGET HIM.</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“He’s a good man, indeed. You say you’ve done street racing before, but started doing it for monetary gain because…”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>YES. BILLS STACKED.</em><br/>

<p>SCP-9022: <em>DID NOT WANT TO DIE. MONEY WAS TOO GOOD. I HATE LAPD SO MUCH. THEIR FAULT.</em></p>
<p>[Heightened aggression detected. SCP-9022 grips the steering wheel tightly as it turns it in place restlessly.]</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I’m sorry for asking. We can move on. So you claimed to have woken up like this in an impound lot. It must be terrifying to wake up like this, but you say you’ve been in this anomalous for three months? How?”</em><br/>
<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>WAS ALONE THREE MONTHS. SHAWN WANTED MY CAR. DIAZ FIXED IT. HAD TO FLEE.</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“But Alex, I do question, why? Why did you continue street racing before we found you? Weren’t you afraid?”</em><br/>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Then-”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Doctor Lightwood, what is the meaning of this?”</em></p>
<p>[Lightwood looks back in surprise as he lets go of the intercom. He stands from his seat as he grips the file.]<br/>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Paul? I’m just communicating with Ale-”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“You mean SCP-9022. I’ve been watching the logs, why on Earth are you buddying up with the anomaly? This is deeply unprofessional.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I’m just communicating with him, not having tea for Christ’s sake. Why are you so worked up over this?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Because Jack I was under the impression you were doing studies on the anomaly. Instead I find you talking to it as if it’s your coworker. I haven't received any important reports from you, we don’t even know how it’s alive after the failed examination.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Paul, respectfully Alex-”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“The anomaly.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“The anomaly is expressing consistent memories and communication as the prior owner of this vehicle. Paul, this isn’t just some random monster, it might be a person.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Jack. Seriously. Is that how quick you are to be fooled? There are numerous anomalies that can mimic someone’s identity, much less a human. Have you already forgotten that or what?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“There’s something more to this, Paul. He isn’t just some mindless creature, he learned morse code for god’s sake.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“Lightwood, be rational. Plenty of dangerous anomalies can mimic social behavior, including the one you witne-”</em></p>
<p>[Heightened aggression from Lightwood detected. Lightwood tosses the file onto the table in visible agitation as he points towards Oswald aggressively.]<br/>

DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Don’t you ███████ dare mention that. Don’t you dare drag her into this.”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. OSWALD: <em>“I’m saying be sensible for crying out loud! You can’t just trust some anomaly that is potentially pretending to be human! What is the matter with you, have you forgotten the Foundation’s code of caution!?”</em><br/>
<br/>
DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I’m doing my own thing here, Doctor Oswald, and you’re disrupting my time with Alex so please just get out.”</em><br/>
<br/>
[Oswald groans out in visible annoyance as he turns back towards the door. He looks towards Lightwood as he points at him.]</p>
<p>DR. OSWALD: <em>“You’re being a fool, Jack. Goddamn idiot.”</em><br/>
<br/>
[Lightwood sighs before he sits back down onto the chair. He runs his hand through his hair before he speaks into the intercom.]</p>

<p>DR. WU: <em>“Doctor Oswald, cortical-equivalent signal activity has registered multiple transient spikes. However, no corresponding somatic response has been observed. Interpretation remains inconclusive.”</em></p>
<p>DR. OSWALD: <em>“Dosage was sufficient to induce suppression, correct?”</em></p>
<p>DR. WU: <em>“Affirmative. Anesthetic concentration is equivalent to that required for a 90-kilogram adult male, with a 30% additional margin applied. Serum analysis indicates stable saturation.”</em></p>
<p>DR. OSWALD: <em>“Understood. Flag the data for post-analysis. Have Doctor Richards review neural telemetry once this session concludes. Proceed with preparatory measures.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Report 9022.1:</strong></p>
<p>SEPTEMBER 2, 2009</p>
<p>Doctor Lightwood and Doctor Oswald are currently undergoing disciplinary training on workplace professionalism due to an incident that occurred on September 7, 2009. Data regarding the incident itself was lost due to the physical spat between the two researchers. From testimonies via other personnel, Oswald was about to commence the second scheduled examination on the physiology of SCP-9022 before Lightwood entered the testing site. Lightwood immediately intervened as he demanded the test to be called off, citing information that the anesthetics on SCP-9022 do not work due to the anomaly reportedly only being able to consume and be affected by nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>Oswald and Lightwood erupted into an argument that nearly ended in a fistfight. Damage included some Foundation-assigned devices and instruments, particularly Oswald’s work laptop and video camera. The fight and looming examination has caused distress to SCP-9022 evident by the anomaly trying to attack one of Oswald’s assistants via its tendrils. Site-31 Director Warren Guerrero has suspended any further studies on SCP-9022 and is now in contact with the Ethics Committee at the request of Lightwood and the director’s own discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Ethics Committee Report 9022.1:</strong></p>
<p>Written: September 6, 2009</p>
<p>The Ethics Committee has studied and interviewed the involved parties of Doctor Jack E. Lightwood, Doctor Paul K. Oswald, and SCP-9022, claiming to be Alex R. Akiyama.</p>
<p>Doctor Lightwood argues the following: SCP-9022 retains the memories, interests, and identity of Akiyama as a whole. Through continued communication and referencing various documents from the Los Angeles County Clerk, Torrance Unified School District, and the Los Angeles Police Department, SCP-9022 was able to accurately answer questions regarding Akiyama and his life before his death on June 2, 2009. Lightwood further argues that SCP-9022 is at risk of descending into animalistic-like mania the further it is isolated. Lightwood cited the incident between him and Oswald as the stress of the examination alongside the spat between the two researchers caused SCP-9022 to temporarily lose his sense of humanity. Lightwood ends his argument stating that if true Containment is to be achieved, SCP-9022 must be treated humanely to prevent any possible thoughts of escape.</p>
<p>Doctor Oswald argues the following: SCP-9022 is one of many cases of anomalies pretending to be human to lower the guard of Foundation staff. He argues that SCP-9022 was able to answer questions regarding the prior owner of the vehicle it inhabits due to various photos being found in the glovebox of the Mitsubishi. The attempted attack on personnel during the botched examination was an opportunity for SCP-9022 to escape due to the heated exchange between Oswald and Lightwood. Oswald also advocates that studies on SCP-9022 are still incomplete, including its basic physiology and biology. He determines that SCP-9022 has natural stages of progression, as evident by its attempt to attack personnel in the prior mentioned incident. Oswald ends his argument by citing precedent with anomalies pretending or hijacking the identities of various civilians for its own gains and that studies are still incomplete.</p>
<p>The Ethics Committee is set to evaluate and determine the case of SCP-9022 by September 13, 2009. Doctor Lightwood and Doctor Oswald meanwhile remain prohibited from working on any other anomalies for the time being as penalty for their unprofessional behavior.</p>

<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Because you remind me of someone.”</em></p>
<p>[Lightwood stands still for a moment. Conflicting emotions detected. He sighs.]</p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“SCP-████. Chicago, 1989. I lost my only family to an anomaly pretending to be human. It wasn’t fair. My daughter was so afraid. I’ve never seen her afraid before that evening. She needed me to be there. And I was. But I couldn’t protect her. When the Foundation found me, they decided to take me in as a researcher since I had a masters in mechanical engineering. Better to work than be given amnestics, they said. That’s how I got this job in the first place. I wasn’t meant to be here.”</em></p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>“I’m sorry for asking.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“No really, it’s okay. I guess that makes the two of us being stuck here against our will huh?”</em></p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>“I guess.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“You remind me of her. Defiant, yet joyful and trying to make things work. Only this time you lost your own family because… of what happened to you. That’s how the Foundation is. Cold, calculating, they don’t give a hoot about how you may feel unless it concerns containment.”</em></p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>“You remind me of my own father.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“Oh?”</em></p>
<p>SCP-9022: <em>“My dad was no nonsense but he was the best. Even if he gets mad at me and Michael yesterday, he jumps… jumped up to protect us today. I… miss him. I miss mom. I miss everyone.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I know, son.”</em></p>
<p>[SCP-9022 slithers itself towards the window near Lightwood. It holds up a photo.]<br/>
SCP-9022: <em>“Doc. You’re already doing so much for me. But please, don’t let them take this photo. I can’t lose it too, not after they flipped my car upside down to take every last damn receipt. If I can’t protect my car, I should at least protect this photo. Please.”</em></p>
<p>DR. LIGHTWOOD: <em>“I know, Alex. I promise.”</em></p>
<p>[Test Chamber 6 door accessed by personnel no. 1142: Lt. Lara Gerards detected.]</p>

<p><strong>Ethics Committee Report 9022.2:</strong></p>
<p>Written: September 14, 2009</p>
<p>After much deliberation, the Ethics Committee has determined Doctor Jack Lightwood to have sustainable evidence regarding SCP-9022 now known to be Alex Akiyama. Site-31 is hereby directed to provide humane conditions for containment at their discretion. Doctor Paul Oswald will remain as researcher and will be moved to other anomalies. Doctor Lightwood and Doctor Oswald are now permitted to resume their work within Site-31.</p>
<p><strong>New Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>As of September 15, 2009: SCP-9022 is permitted to be moved to Garage 4-B. He is hereby allowed to have personal decorations such as posters, alongside devices such as a television, radio, and decorative lights. SCP-9022 is permitted to drive around Site-31’s driving range when not in use.</p>
<p>SCP-9022 will be given further liberties at the administrator’s discretion as long as he remains in good behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Status Update:</strong></p>
<p>As of November 15, 2009, SCP-9022's mood has visibly improved ever since he was allowed to be stored in the garage. Site-31 personnel with level access such as the mechanics division have developed amiable relations with SCP-9022. SCP-9022 continues to receive therapy to assist with his underlying depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder due to his initial containment. However, SCP-9022 has proven to be a trustworthy anomaly within Site-31 and as such his Object Class has been redesignated as Safe.</p>
