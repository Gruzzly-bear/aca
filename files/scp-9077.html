            <h1>SCP-9077</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9077</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> 22.9-L.aic is to monitor amateur and professional mahjong competitions in order to determine candidates to SCP-9077's manifestation. Once a game shows signs of anomalous manifestation, all transmissions of the match are to be taken down and a Response Team is to be deployed to the location in order to contain the affair.</p>
<p>All audience members must be removed from attendance and amnestized in order to remove any memories of SCP-9077’s manifestation. These individuals are to have any recordings or photos of the incident confiscated and archived. New memories of a non-anomalous mahjong game are to be implanted onto the audience.</p>
<p>SCP-9077 is to be allowed to conclude within 2 hours, for the purposes of recording data about the phenomenon. If the game is not finished by this time, Foundation personnel are to intervene and force SCP-9077 to finish by removal of players from the mahjong table.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9077 is an anomalous rule variation for riichi mahjong,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> that manifests after a series of criteria are fulfilled. Once the phenomena becomes active, the mahjong tile set in use will be spontaneously modified to accommodate the new rulings. All players become immediately aware of all rule changes, without the need of further clarification.</p>
<p>In order for SCP-9077 to become active, a hanchan length game<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> needs to go onto south-4 round, with no player below 15000 points. At least two yakuman hands<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> must score without immediately winning the game. In addition to that, SCP-9077 was never observed to occur during casual play, only in mahjong related public events or tournaments. The anomaly only occurs in in-person games.</p>
<p>SCP-9077 adds a number of local yaku<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> varying from 1 han<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> to yakuman level. It's unknown how many local yaku are added by the anomaly, with a current known list of 15 new valid yaku. These additions do not override the standard yaku choices in any way, with it being possible for standard yaku and SCP-9077's being able to score together.</p>
<p>SCP-9077 will extend the game beyond south-4, with the round ceiling being unknown, if it even exists. The living wall from where the tiles are drawn will now contain an infinite number of tiles from every suit and number. Visually the living wall will remain the same, and is able to be dismantled in order to shuffle tiles for the next round, appearing to contain only the standard amount of tiles from each suit when shuffling. If the game is being played in an automatic mahjong table, the same properties manifest.</p>
<p>A game of SCP-9077 will only end after a player drops below 0 points. Players will be unable to stop themselves from playing until this condition is fulfilled. The anomaly suppresses all need for sustenance and other biological necessities during the duration of the game. Theoretically, a game of SCP-9077 can extend itself for an infinite amount of time, with the only reason for this not being possible is that the players would die by old age.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none">

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>In ██/██/2017 after the containment procedures for the anomaly were established, Foundation intelligence personnel found SCP-9077 in a game on ██████ ███ Mahjong Parlor. This was the final game of the 1997 ██████ ███ local mahjong championship, between the 4 finalists. After the discovery of this event, a response team was deployed in order to contain the game and start disinformation procedures.</p>
<p>The game had become a local attraction through its duration, with a casual audience coming to watch the game regularly, with the ██████ ███ Mahjong Parlor providing eventual recaps of the rounds. As there is no known mental effect of SCP-9077 forcing the audience to watch the game, it is currently believed that the regular audience watched the game of their own will throughout its duration.</p>
<p>When the Foundation's assets arrived, the game had already ended with one player, 86-year-old Robert Sakurai, having won by SCP-9077’s local yaku "blessing". All remaining players then stood around the mahjong table and paid their respects alongside the audience. The local mahjong community organized a shrine for Sakurai when the Foundation’s forces arrived. The mahjong table used was left untouched after the SCP-9077 game finished.</p>
<p>Sakurai’s winning hand was left facing down on the table, with the other hands face up. Foundation personnel were unable to move themselves to turn the hand face up. No method of revealing Sakurai’s winning hand was successful, as a result of a mental and probabilistic effect. The game table was moved for containment in a Foundation reliquary.</p>
<p>Disinformation campaigns are currently ongoing.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-unfolded" style="display:none">

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p>The following are excerpts from an interview with Elizabeth Muller, a player on the previous Incident Log related to SCP-9077. Elizabeth started the game as a 19 year-old, being considered a mahjong prodigy amongst the local comunity.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I didn't know Robert before the game. Personally, I mean. All I knew is that he was a scary guy. Had monstrous luck and excellent skills, the flow of the game was always with him.</p>
<p>No, he lost from time to time. Mahjong is a scary thing. One bad decision and all your good flow vanishes.</p>
<p>We did not play with one another before that game. Robert never saw one of my games. We knew each other as somewhat good mahjong players. But we never knew how close our skills actually were.</p>
<p>When we started playing, Robert Sakurai's face became more and more shocked. We were evenly matched. The other players, José Luis and Joshua were not bad either. But Robert was the most dangerous at the table. He hit the two yakuman. Amazing flow.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the game took a lot to finish.</p>
<p>No, I do not care about standing 20 years at a mahjong table when that meant playing more. Drawing more tiles. More wins. More struggles. More time with those people. Don't think anyone in the audience cared too.</p>
<p>Let me say something to you. Do you know what I have in my life? Nothing much. I worked a 9-to-5. No living relatives. As far as I know Robert's wife died a while ago and his grandsons don't care to call him on the phone. Do you know what José Luis and Joshua have? I don't know. But it does not seem to be much.</p>
<p>No idea what happened to Robert. He won, and I think that is about it. Mahjong, I think, is the only game that allows a human to prove themself. You need luck, skill, and knowledge. And at the end of the game, you might find some sort of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Yes, I wish to play more mahjong. I want to play all the mahjong games I can. After such a match, who wouldn't want to keep going?</p>
<p>Mahjong is a scary thing.</p>
