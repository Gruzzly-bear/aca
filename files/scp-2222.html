<p>Exterior file footage still depicting ████ ██████████ upon accidental entrapment within SCP-2222 during unauthorised interaction. Current whereabouts of spacesuit remain unknown.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2222</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation operatives embedded within ████ (█████ ████████ █████ █████████████) have been relocated and situated upon Orbital Unit-09 under the guise of qualified station personnel. Personnel consists of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">four</span> three (3) Foundation operatives preliminarily and extensively trained in aerospace engineering, extravehicular activity, confinement and experimentation/analysis for the sole purpose of SCP-2222's containment. Transmissions originating from ████ are to be intercepted and deterred by Foundation operatives trained in linguistics and vocal interpretations at Command-2.</p>
<p>Hermetic doors composing SCP-2222 are to remain sealed with the exception of testing and/or analysis purposes. No internal interaction is permitted within SCP-2222 during analysis; visual and/or auditory analysis is permitted from SCP-2222's exterior following manual opening. Testing requires the release of any number of <em>Rattus rattus</em> within SCP-2222, the supply of which is currently situated within the Unit laboratory. Emergent entities from within SCP-2222 are to be transferred to a suitable and sterile area in which further testing and analysis regarding resultant behavioural, physical and anomalous characteristics may be conducted prior to termination. Entities are to be terminated via the release of gaseous rodenticides.</p>
<p>Following Incident 2222-REF#209, any indications of fascination or obsession pertaining to SCP-2222 from Unit personnel are to be reported to Command-2, where temporary/permanent replacement of the personnel in question may be administrated. Complete personnel obsession pertaining to SCP-2222 is to result in the immediate isolation of Orbital Unit-09, where Armed Rapid Response Spatial Task Force-01 may be contacted. Additional emergency response forces are to be stationed at Command-2, who are to be dispatched in the event of a Unit personnel member becoming obsolete (refer to Exploration III for further details).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2222 is an airlock composed of two (2) opaque hermetic plug doors and a cylindrical (3.6 m in diameter) chamber within ████ ████████-█ space station (designated Orbital Unit-09). <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Attempts to internally survey SCP-2222 during the closure of both hermetic doors such as placing interior surveillance devices, pressure sensors or radios within the chamber have failed due to apparent malfunction. As a result, no means of interior observation within SCP-2222 are possible, excluding reopening via electronic control.</span> <strong>REVISION:</strong> ██/██/████ - Refer to Incident 2222REF#209 for further information.</p>
<p>Organisms entering SCP-2222 precipitate immediate anomalous effects. Upon entrance from Orbital Unit-09's interior, the inner hermetic door will seal and entrap the organism. SCP-2222 will remain sealed for approximately three (3) minutes prior to the door reopening and the organism re-emerging. Attempts to manually open either hermetic door during this period invariably fail. Entry to within SCP-2222 from Orbital Unit-09's spatial exterior is yet to be conducted.</p>
<p>Upon re-emergence, organisms exhibit complete organic and structural eversion. Organisms remain alive despite theoretically fatal alterations to their physical forms. Affected human subjects are capable of communication through vocalising individual words in reverse; as observed within Incident 2222-01, subjects appear physically incapable of vocalising individual words in standard intelligible format unless prompted to do so. As a result, immediate communication has proven impossible due to incomprehension. Despite this, reverse playback of recorded interviews have successfully determined the meaning of individual vocalisations. Individual vocalisations from sentient organisms such as <em>Rattus rattus</em> also exhibit this impairment.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 2222-01:</strong> ██/██/████: Interview with the first affected Foundation subject following SCP-2222's initial acquisition (refer to Document-2222-667DL for further details). Subject is ████ ██████████, a former Level 4 operative with qualifications in engineering. Physical alterations were first noted following ████ ██████████'s interaction and accidental entrapment within SCP-2222 during interior analysis. Individual vocalisations from ████ ██████████ are reversed for the purpose of comprehension. It is to be of note that Dr. █████ was unable to comprehend ████ ██████████ during the interview. Original unaltered audial documentation may be found here:</p>

<p>████ ██████████ was promptly terminated prior to spatial release from a separate airlock. It is to be of note that ████ ██████████'s interaction with SCP-2222 was unauthorised.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2222-01:</strong> ██/██/████: Directly five (5) minutes following Incident 2222-01. Posthumous analysis and dissection of ████ ██████████'s cadaver revealed intricate textual engravings on epidermal layers. Additionally, several lacerations and bruising on said layers indicated forced eversion originating from the genital area. Content of engravings are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Investigations regarding SCP-2222's anomalous effects are to be resumed by unit personnel. Reclassified as sapient on ██/██/███.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2222-02:</strong> Following events documented in the aforementioned incident, Command-2 have submitted the formal request for Unit personnel to receive monthly examinations and counselling through telecommunication pertaining to psychological wellbeing.</p>
<p><em>Denied. Preliminary training should suffice. Should psychological issues become apparent and then persist, I will personally administrate the replacement of the personnel in question.</em> - O5-█.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 2222-REF#209:</strong> The following events occurred between the dates of ██/██/████ and ██/██/████ following successful interior surveillance within SCP-2222 after handheld digital cameras within the chamber exhibited non-malfunction. The preceding information thus warranted inclusion and exploration within SCP-2222, conducted by seven (7) D-Class personnel resituated upon Orbital Unit-09 with preliminary sedation administrated beforehand, alongside five (5) Level 4-5 Foundation operatives with the responsibility of Unit maintenance and safety, alongside communication with D-Class personnel. Current Unit personnel were granted temporary leave, with long-term signal failure occurring across all ████ so as to maintain the undetectability of the response force relocating the personnel. It is to be of note that D-Class personnel were unaware of SCP-2222's anomalous effects prior to their exposure to SCP-2222.</p>

<p><em>D-02928 is placed within SCP-2222 three (3) days following Exploration II, a period in which temporary Unit personnel spent arranging and preparing a preliminary stratagem for Exploration III. D-02928 is tasked with the responsibility of documenting visual evidence of SCP-2222's inhabitant(s) so as to further establish the entities' behavioural and physical characteristics. D-02928's head-mounted camera setup is additionally fitted with a separate digital photographic device programmed to take one (1) photograph every twenty (20) seconds.</em></p>

<p><strong>Agent White:</strong> Deactivate your torch in order for the camera flash to be fully utilised.<br/>
<strong>D-02928:</strong> Can't I just turn it off?<br/>
<strong>Agent White:</strong> No. It's in the programming.<br/>
<strong>D-02928:</strong> Fine. Yeah, fine.<br/>
<strong>Agent White:</strong> Can you still visualise SCP-2222's interior?<br/>

<p><em>[A communication error between D-02928 and Unit command occurs. Secondary communication backups utilised following a two (2) minute period, in which D-02928 is presumed to remain within SCP-2222. Following communication restoration, D-02928's visual display depicts SCP-2222's interior engulfed in flame, with D-02928 nowhere to be discerned. SCP-2222's outer hermetic door is observed to open despite Orbital Unit-09's exterior surveillance monitors depicting its explicit closure at the displayed juncture<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Visible beyond the hermetic door is a spatial region inconsistent with any documented region to date, with an amorphous, roughly linear stellar entity resembling a nebula also visible, violet in colouration. D-02928 is observed to emerge from SCP-2222's exterior and enter SCP-2222 despite theoretically fatal spatial conditions. D-02928 hastily reacquires the camera before addressing Unit command in person]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-02928:</strong> You see that?<br/>
<strong>Agent White:</strong> God. Yes, we see it. What is it?<br/>
<strong>D-02928:</strong> It's- It's… Look, they're preparing. That's why they haven't killed me. I'll explain once I get out.<br/>

<p><em>D-02928 later emerged from SCP-2222 with no resultant physical impairments. However, D-02928 exhibited complete incapability of oral, written or other forms of communication with other personnel, disregarding them completely. D-02928 was promptly transported to Orbital Unit-09's temporary D-Class housing area, in which he spent the remainder of his accompaniment with Unit personnel before relocation to Sector-19. A total of nine (9) photographs were taken during D-02928's exposure to SCP-2222, eight (8) of which exhibit corruption as a result of hardware damage. The remaining photograph is included below:</em></p>

<p><em>D-90123 is placed within SCP-2222 upon instruction, with identical equipment as mentioned beforehand. It is to be of note that<br/>
D-90123 exhibited a heightened fascination with SCP-2222, with said fascination increasing exponentially following the effects of<br/>
SCP-2222 on her predecessors; it is to be of note that D-90123 was not informed of the current whereabouts of said predecessors,<br/>
excluding D-02928 (Refer to exploration III for further details). D-90123's fascination with SCP-2222 was additionally shared with D-46400 (refer to Exploration VI for further details), who exhibited a milder form of the aforementioned fascination.

<p><em>Similarly to D-72892, D-90123 re-emerged as a disarrayed mass of charred and blackened flesh, with the only notable deviation</em> <em>being incapability of locomotion.

<p>Do you see it?</p>
<p>Meschk-Mernanschordbtoum-VordhosbnV7.</p>
<p>It's right there.</p>
<p>Offspring, we can watch them in perpetuity. We'll join the millions. Sitting here on this violet cloud. Laughing at the humans.</p>
<p>Let me give you a brief rundown of what goes on over there, aeons away, on Meschk-Vordhosbn. First, it was plants. That was unstimulating. Then came the ridiculous squealing mammals. Then, finally, there came the first human. We enjoyed humans, so we familiarised ourselves with them, and they sent more. The first of the three new humans were clueless, the fourth was delightful. The fifth was a disappointment despite the fourth's promise. The sixth was insane. And the seventh is here with us. You've heard of him.</p>
<p>They call him 12935.</p>
<p>He hates it here.</p>
<p>Sound appealing?</p>
<p>Good. You must appreciate the work that goes into this. It's a hard job to organise. It's only a mere team of four, did you know? Who knows how far they travelled to achieve this. I hope you'll look up to them someday.</p>
<p>Offspring, we too can laugh.</p>
<p>We can be entertained. We can feast our optic lobes on flocks after flocks of human astronauts, turned inside-out, having their vocal comprehensions reversed so that we can split our sides.</p>
<p>We can watch their bloodied remains get taken to Epmn where they'll be singed, semi-torrefied, burned like anthropoid hogs on a spit. Because it's hilarious.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Sit down, offspring. This is quality entertainment.</p>
