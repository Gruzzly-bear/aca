<p>SCP-5084 instances.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5084</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5084 is to be contained within a standard safe storage locker held at Site-19. All Foundation personnel with level 2 clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-5084 at the discretion of the site director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5084 is the collective sum of 40 cherry tomatoes (<em>Lycopersicon lycopersicum var. cerasiforme</em>) invulnerable to decomposition. SCP-5084's anomalous capabilities manifest when an individual is made aware of the presence of SCP-5084 in their immediate vicinity. The individual will firmly believe that all instances of SCP-5084 are sentient. Individuals have experienced auditory hallucinations in which they report hearing SCP-5084 produce human-like vocalizations. Individuals describe SCP-5084 instances as "scared, nervous, and untrusting" due to their vocalizations being described as childlike. SCP-5084's anomalous properties do not manifest when exposed to Foundation personnel.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5084 was discovered in a hotel located in Las Vegas, Nevada. SCP-5084 was housed in a terrarium residing in the entrance of the hotel. All guests were extremely protective of SCP-5084, physically berating any individuals who harmed SCP-5084 specimens. The Foundation was contacted when nearby businesses and local residents entered the hotel and were detained by local authorities. Foundation operatives observed attempts to plant SCP-5084 instances in an effort of preserving SCP-5084 through their offspring before acquiring SCP-5084.</p>

<p><strong>Subject(s):</strong> Five (5) instances of SCP-5084<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> D-38291 is instructed to make eye contact with SCP-5084 and transcribe SCP-5084's statements. Afterward, D-38291 is to test effects of SCP-5084 consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Begin Log:</strong></p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 makes eye contact with SCP-5084</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> What the hell? How the fuck are you ta-</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> Just follow what we told you, 38291.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> Fine, hello th- what? I can barely hear you!</p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 arranges pile of SCP-5084 instances into a row</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> Dear God, how long have you guys been piled like that? A couple of weeks! No wonder you're crying!</p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 leans in and speaks in a noticeably quieter tone</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> Don't worry, I'm not here to hurt you. I just need you to calm down. When were you first able to talk?</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> Please transcribe their responses, 38291.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> They tell me that it's always been this way. They just don't know why the men in coats can't hear them. They're talking about you, aren't they?</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> We told you 38291, they aren't sentient. This is all happening in your head, Foundation personnel just can't talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> I'm Foundation personnel, aren't I?</p>
<p>(<em>Test Overseer pauses)</em></p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> Just continue.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> What do you guys do all day?</p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 pauses for several seconds</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> They've just been rotting in a bin. They can't move, they can't talk, they can't even breathe. They're trapped. Why can't you guys just let them out?</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> That's outside of your control.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> Wait, I'm not the first guy they've tested these things on, aren't I? What have the men in coats done to you?</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> It would be advisable to stick to the script before further action is needed.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> You've… oh dear god. You've sliced them, crushed them, diced them. What's next? Am I going to eat one of them or something?</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> Actually, yes. You are to consume an SCP-5084 specimen.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> …I'm not going to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Test Overseer:</strong> We'll give you one more chance 38291. Consume the specimen or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> I… I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.</p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 consumes SCP-5084 specimen</em>)</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> It tastes… like a tomato. What did you expect? I can hear it fucking screaming down my throat. It's crying.</p>
<p><strong>D-38291:</strong> You burnt them, blended them, and torn them apart. They're begging for mercy, no wonder they trust no one.</p>
<p>(<em>D-38291 escorted out of testing chamber</em>)</p>
