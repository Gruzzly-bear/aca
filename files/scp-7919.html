<h4 id="toc0"><span>Special Containment Procedures</span></h4>
<p>Agent Mahoni is required to submit to a monthly comprehensive medical exam by Foundation medical staff. Ultrasonic imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, and the thyroid must complement standard examination procedure.</p>
<h4 id="toc1"><span>Description</span></h4>
<p>SCP-7919 was an anomalously fast tumorous growth visible on ultrasonic, X-ray, and magnetic resonance imaging that was otherwise imperceptible.</p>
<p>The only known case of SCP-7919 was identified in Agent Mahoni during a routine medical examination after an unrelated mission. Initially, SCP-7919 was diagnosed as lung cancer and Agent Mahoni was recommended medical leave for civilian treatment. Civilian doctors noticed the unusually high rate of growth of SCP-7919 and tried to reach a Foundation front to ask for Agent Mahoni's medical records. Alerted by the potential anomaly, Foundation personnel took over treatment of the agent and the involved civilian staff were amnestizised. For archival purposes, a series of notes written by acting medical staff Dr. Reichelt are appended below. Standard medical files can be requested at the archive.</p>

<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Julian Mahoni</p>
<h6 id="toc4"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>Patient complains about abdominal pain and difficulty breathing. Patient just returned from field mission in the Black Forest, Germany, where physical contact was made with an anomaly. Patient doubts causal relation, but the ailments started shortly after.</p>
<h6 id="toc5"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>Mechanical pressure in upper abdominal region and above right lung elicits pain in patient. Verbal rating scale indicates low to moderate pain, increased by mechanical pressure. Patient submitted to ultrasonic imaging.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic imaging revealed presence of stage II tumor in right lung beneath tertiary bronchi. Another tumor may be present in the thyroid, it isn't clear from visual examination. Hormone tests imperative.</p>
<p>Patient recommended for civilian treatment.</p>

<h5 id="toc6"><span>Personal Notes: Dr. Reichelt</span></h5>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Julian Mahoni<br/>
<strong>Preliminaries:</strong> Patient transferred back from civilian treatment after anomalies in etiopathology were discovered.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Due to the urgency, Dr. Saidu agreed to consult in Mr. Mahoni's treatment. He is the leading expert on anomalous cancer and immune diseases. And since he is best known for contracting an anomalous form of cancer himself, and curing it before SCP classification was possible, I hope we can find a solution to this cancer too.</p>
<h6 id="toc7"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>Patient complains about shortness of breath, chest pain, and reports coughing up blood this morning. Patient further complains about night sweats, vomiting, and constipation. Suspicion of systemic disease.</p>
<h6 id="toc8"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>Ultrasonic imaging revealed large tumorous growth along the entire right lung, concentrating on the outer rim. Invasion of great vessels, invasion of tracheal carina. Further, an invasion of the supraclavicular lymph nodes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> is clearly visible but cannot be confirmed through noticeable swelling or physical examination. Metastases visible in left lung and bronchiole. Cancer reached stage IV. Thyroid subject to numerous cancerous growths of varying sizes.</p>
<p>Blood tests revealed hypercalcemia<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, hypokalemia<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, and likely hyperthyroidism<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> (lab failed to sufficiently dilute thyroxine concentration into measurable range). CRP<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> and Interleukin 6<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> values are similarly elevated and suggest systemic inflammation with suspicion of imminent immune failure. Remarkably, patient should have pneumonia by now, but no indicators of that are present.</p>
<h6 id="toc9"><span>Therapy</span></h6>
<p>Dr. Saidu ordered immediate combined modality chemotherapy with radiation therapy targeted at secondary tumors. Most of the right lung irretrievably lost. Computer tomography scheduled to ascertain efficacy of surgery.</p>
<p>Patient moved to stationary care and provided with Tramadol to mitigate pain. Patient was given a low dose of Zaleplon to help with sleep. Methimazole was administered as a thyrostatic.</p>
<p>Supplemental nutrients administered via intravenous therapy. Systemic inflammation not treated so far due to risk of drug interaction.</p>

<h6 id="toc11"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>Patient requested his family to be allowed on-site because of his deteriorating condition. I submitted the necessary documents to Ethics, to hopefully bypass some bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Patient in severe pain. I gave him morphine, and ordered local anesthetics for emergencies.</p>
<p>Patient intermittently confused. Patient complained about the sensation of loose teeth in his mouth and periodically tried spitting out imaginary teeth. Possible brain metastases or severe hormonal imbalance.</p>
<h6 id="toc12"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>When the patient was prepared for CT, he vomited. I tried to stabilize him with stasis pills<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> to avoid running into issues during the CT, but Dr. Saidu strictly opposed the use of anomalous medication for fear of interaction with an unknown anomaly. I disagree, because the patient's health should come first, but he is the authority on anomalous diseases.</p>
<p>So I resorted to Ondansetron intravenously and hoped nothing else would come up during the scan.</p>
<p>CT revealed several teratomas in bowels and testicles with fully developed organ structures (reminiscent of accessory spleens). Struma ovarii<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> presumed due to severe cancerous growths and severe hyperthyroidism.</p>

<p>Patient went into coma. Family arrived at site and was allowed to see patient intermittently.</p>
<h6 id="toc15"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>Chemotherapy cancelled due to imminent kidney failure. Patient prepared for emergency operation to remove right lung and sample cancer cells. Surgeon failed to locate cancer growths. Extended vivisection revealed entirely healthy lung. Secondary vivisection revealed no tumors in intestines.</p>

<h5 id="toc16"><span>Personal Notes: Dr. Reichelt</span></h5>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Julian Mahoni<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Patient underwent second CT scan to monitor anomalous growths</p>
<h6 id="toc17"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>N/A</p>
<h6 id="toc18"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>CT scan revealed teratomas in all extremities, essentially replicating the present tissue and organs down to the bone structure.<br/>
Tumorous growths in lung, intestines, thyroid, throat, lymph nodes and testicles all formed fully-developed secondary organs. Teratomas positioned at a slight angle relative to their normal counterparts and occupy physical space that is also occupied by the normal organs.</p>
<p>No tissue in the patient is unaffected by the tumors/teratomas.</p>
<p>I developed a strategy to ascertain the teratomas' nature using esoteric marker substances<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>, however, Dr. Saidu strictly opposed using esoteric substances inside an unknown anomaly.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Applied Occultism I installed thaumic sinks to try and remove Orphic substances<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> seeping from the patient. Obviously this is a very crude approach, because thaumic sinks aren't designed for human application, and, moreover, I don't think they will actually solve anything. But maybe I can buy some time by keeping the concentration of esoteric substances lower.</p>
<p>I also proposed installing a time dilation seal to the medical unit to buy more time, but Dr. Saidu put a stop order on it, citing dangerous anomalous interaction with an unknown disease. He instead proposed a new medication strategy.</p>
<p>Without a way to analyze <em>in vivo</em>, I have little hope of finding a solution in time, though. Not that the Foundation possesses anti-esoteric medication anyway, but I don't see where else to start. I am once again trying to reach Ethics, hoping to circumvent the stop order of Dr. Saidu.</p>
</div>
<div class="thatsbone">
<h5 id="toc19"><span>Personal Notes: Dr. Reichelt</span></h5>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Julian Mahoni<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> I have affixed multiple ultrasonic imaging devices to Mahoni's bed unit to have a permanent, if crude, visual observation of the teratomas.</p>
<h6 id="toc20"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>N/A</p>
<h6 id="toc21"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>Teratomas merged to form a fully-developed secondary human organism. It is positioned at a slight angle to the patient's physical body, but the angle is decreasing steadily.</p>
<p>Dr. Saidu removed the thaumic sinks and barred Applied Occultism from entering the medical unit. I strongly disagree with his strategy of isolation, because at this rate, the anomaly will kill Agent Mahoni. But as the leading expert, the Ethics Committee sided with him.</p>
<p>Blood tests show impossible hormone concentrations, and esoteric examination revealed that blood samples are severely contaminated with different esoteric substances. I suppose that explains why the columns<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> behaved so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Dr. Saidu instructed me to cease all attempts at saving the patient and to stop administering medication. I issued a formal complaint, but I have little hopes of getting somewhere. This isn't a medical facility after all.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="thatsbone">
<h5 id="toc22"><span>Personal Notes: Dr. Reichelt</span></h5>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Julian Mahoni<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Patient woke up</p>
<h6 id="toc23"><span>Interview</span></h6>
<p>Patient responsive and coherent. Patient reports no pain and is in high spirits.</p>
<h6 id="toc24"><span>Examination</span></h6>
<p>I witnessed the esoteric teratomas merge with the patient's physical body on the ultrasonics. At the exact moment when the teratomas lined up perfectly with their physical organ counterparts, the ECG flat-lined. About four seconds later, before I could even react, the ECG went normal again, and the patient immediately woke up.</p>
<p>Blood tests are nominal. Kidney seems in order. Patient displays some minor memory issues. Psych eval scheduled by Dr. Saidu.</p>
<p>I read the report of the psych eval. Mahoni seems physically fine and is fit for duty. He was also eager to return to his work immediately, but the psychologist postponed it because of suspected emotional trauma. Apparently, Mahoni displays little affection for his family, and is reluctant to talk about them, or any other relationship for that matter. It somehow bugs me. I saw him talking to his MTF colleagues, and while he is friendly and happy about his wellbeing, he always maintains this cold distance to everyone. It's creepy to witness, but all my complaints fell on deaf ears. He thanked Dr. Saidu, to which Saidu had some smug response. But Saidu is the expert on esoteric diseases, and saved his life somehow, so what do I know. I wonder if he did it the same way with his cancer. I can't delay his release any longer, and Saidu already motioned to classify SCP-7919 as Neutralized. I will talk to the psychologist to hopefully set up some recurring observation.</p>
