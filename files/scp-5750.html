<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong> SCP-5750 is currently uncontained, and cannot be contained. Web crawlers have been instated to flag any complaints about SCP-5750, as this may leave evidence of its existence. As of 3/18/19, over 121 complaints have been flagged, all discredited and censored. Regardless of SCP-5750's un-containable properties, plans to protect normalcy have been maintained.</p>

<p>An instance of SCP-5750-2 sold by GoI-1912, also known as "Thin Mints."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>
SCP-5750 is the collective designation for multiple words that hold memetic properties when used together in a sentence. This effect causes an individual to seek out and buy products from GoI-1912 ("Girl Scouts"). The effect lasts until the subject has spent at least $10 (USD) buying one of their products, or SCP-5750-2. Members of GoI-1912, now designated SCP-5750-1, have been shown to be completely immune to SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances have been shown to have no recollection of the effect or their immunity of SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances tend to be door to door sellers of SCP-5750-2, also known as "Girl Scout Cookies." Juliette Gordon Low, (the founder of GoI-1912,) has been designated PoI-1912. The Foundation has failed to capture PoI-1912, as all attempts close to success have ended in triggering the effect of SCP-5750. Further attempts have been set to low priority.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5750 was discovered on 06/05/19 when Junior Researcher Craig Clark reported that the words may have had anomalous properties. He stated the number of social media posts complaining about GoI-1912's sales tactics had increased. This increase directly correlates with the exponential growth of GoI-1912 since first discovered. Evidence of an anomaly was further backed up by counter-memetic filtering of the posts.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-5750-2 instances sold by SCP-5750-1 have no anomalous properties and are chemically similar to other brands of similarly flavored cookies. SCP-5750 is the only anomaly when it comes to the cookies, as combining the words <em>(do not repeat)</em> "Wanna buy girl scout cookies?" together in a spoken sentence triggers its effect. SCP-5750-1 instances only appear to target those with spending power high enough to afford their products.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-SCP-5750.1:</strong> On 03/11/2019, Foundation web crawlers picked up a string of tweets from a user going by the handle @ImMonster539. The individual was brought into custody, amnesticized, and returned to his home. The tweets have been removed; however, personnel captured a screenshot before censoring it. The image is attached here:<br/></p>

<p><strong>Addendum-SCP-5750.2:</strong> On 03/07/2019, an incident was reported by Site Director Klaid Chandler. A note ended up in the mailbox of Chandler addressed to the Foundation. A transcription is attached below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #86026b">To Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Chips and Piayas.</span></p>
</div>
<br/>
It has come to the Girl Scout's attention that you are trying to facilitate capture of our leader.
<p>We would like to request you to stop.</p>
<p>This is for your own good, as Juliette always said: "<strong><span style="color: darkred">Peace until War.</span></strong>"</p>
<p>If you continue these attempts, it'll be more than war.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: red">Hope you like your cookies!</span></p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p><span style="color: #86026b">Carla Josephine, Chief Communications Executive of the Girl Scouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:40%;">~Carla@GirlScouts</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of this Chandler also received an email in which he responded to, both are held below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><span style="color: #86026b">From Carla@GirlScouts</span><br/>
<span style="color: #86026b">Recipient(s) KChandler32@SCiPNet</span></p>
</div>
<p>Hey, friend!</p>
<p>Just in-case the previous message gets lost in transit!~</p>
<p>Your continued attempts at our leader will not stand. You don't want a war with us. We have a lot more than just cookies. I recommend you back down.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p><span style="color: #86026b">Carla!~</span></p>

<p>Hello Carla.</p>
<p>This in regards to your previous email. We will not be backing down. I speak for the whole Foundation when I say: You will lose. I promise you.</p>
<p>Your leader is the lowest priority we have. Besides:</p>
<p>We won't make a deal with a shady <span style="color: darkgrey">businesswoman</span>.</p>
<p>Buckle up, <span style="color: darkred">Scumbag</span>.</p>
