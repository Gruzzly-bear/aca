            <h1>SCP-5171</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5171</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All photonics processing and storage units associated with SCP-5171 and SCP-5171-A are to be vacuum-sealed and stored in secure containment lockers. Testing of SCP-5171 is currently suspended.</p>
<p>Locating PoI-9414 has been assigned as a priority mission for MTF Alpha-7 ("Surpassing Tindalos").</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5171 is an artificial intelligence built by PoI-9414, formerly O5-9, as an administrative assistance and memetic screening system. SCP-5171 operated on a 3rd-gen photonics processing platform allocated for all Level 5 personnel at the time, with heavily modified interfaces. While these technologies are ahead of mundane equivalents, no part of SCP-5171 was inherently anomalous at the time of its creation.</p>
<p>Originally designated Rhyme.aic, SCP-5171 had developed total self-awareness after PoI-9414 intentionally exposed it to a multitude of anomalous memetic agents, collectively designated SCP-5171-A. It is currently unknown how PoI-9414 acquired the skills necessary to create and utilize anomalous memetic agents in this way. While the Foundation retains a full copy of SCP-5171-A, the technical and ethical risk posed prohibits further experimentation.</p>
<p>According to the log recovered after PoI-9414 defected from the Foundation (see Addendum 5171.A), SCP-5171 believed that it was a human female named "Rima", and that it had grown up with PoI-9414 since their childhood. Due to the mandatory data expungement procedure applied to the personal data of O5 members, this information cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5171.A:</strong> Log recovered from SCP-5171 interface cache, temporal metadata irretrievable. The format indicates a speech-recognition interface log.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> Hello Rima, how are you today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Hi, Galuh. I was wondering when you'll show up.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> I'm so sorry, the meeting got late, I kept getting in arguments with those pesky fossils.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> No, don't be. I shouldn't have talked to you like that, I know you're very busy, and it's for both of us. It's just that sitting here all day with nothing to do…it got me all grumpy, you know?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> I know. I'm sorry, I wish I could've brought you outside.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Like I said, don't be sorry. None of this is your fault, I'm thankful that you had time to spend with me at all.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> But I could've done more, if only I stopped trying to fight my way through every little thing.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> If only I listened to your parents back then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> We're not having this conversation, Galuh.</p>
<p><em>(Strings of periodic data pattern follows, with no known meaning. Presumed to be environmental noise falsely parsed as speeches by the interface.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Do you remember when we watched meteor showers on the beach?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> That was so long ago, I'm surprised that you still remember it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> There's no way I would forget. We spent a full roll of your dad's camera film. All those photographs, I could recall every single one of them as if it's yesterday.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> I was so sure he'd be so angry at me. Those rolls were expensive. Instead, he started teaching me how to properly photograph a shooting star.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> I tried to convince you that he won't be angry at us for using a camera <em>to take pictures.</em> But you're just so convinced he would.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Oh wow, he's not angry that you used something for its intended purpose, how surprising.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> When do you think was the last time I started a conversation <em>without</em> fighting intent?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Other than with me? I'd wager a decade at least.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> …okay I'm not <em>that</em> controversial. I could hold a somewhat proper and neutral conversation with my subordinates.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> I wouldn't know, I never had any reason to meet them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Not that I want to, mind you. But it just feels so bizarre thinking about you having just normal conversations about accounting or something.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Hell, I can't even imagine <em>the</em> Galuh arguing academically against a Board of Directors!</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> Yeah, I guess I changed quite a bit since way back then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Me, on the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Sorry sorry sorry. Half your words are apology, over and over again. I didn't wake up just to hear you say sorry for days on end!</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> I…</p>
<p><em>(brief periodic data/silence, gaps in noise pattern indicate removed data)</em></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> Did you meet the doctors today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> Nope, there's no test for today. I wonder if that means I'm getting better or getting worse.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>PoI-9414:</strong> Don't worry, we'll be out of this place in no time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5171:</strong> I wouldn't hold my breath.</p>

Of note, SCP-5171 had never ceased functioning as administrative assistance and memetic screening system, up until its deactivation upon PoI-9414's defection.</div>
