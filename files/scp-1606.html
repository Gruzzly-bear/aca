            <h1>SCP-1606</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1606</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-exsequi</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The property on which SCP-1606 was built is owned by the Foundation under the pseudonym Duane Schmidt. Two agents are to reside in SCP-1606 to provide basic security and to discourage unauthorized persons from entering the building, given the cover identities Duane and Elizabeth Schmidt. Personnel may not enter SCP-1606-2 under any circumstances. Persons entering SCP-1606-2 may be left there indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1606 is a white, two-story wooden house built in 1897 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. SCP-1606 is in a state of moderate disrepair, with two windows broken, the majority of stationary surfaces covered in approximately 0.8mm of dust, and multiple holes in the walls. The building has remained in this condition since the Foundation's recovery of the item in 1977; no degradation whatsoever has been noted in SCP-1606 despite a lack of actions taken to counteract this. Further, no attempts at repairing or cleaning SCP-1606 have been effective, with any changes made becoming undone almost immediately after completion of the task.</p>
<p>SCP-1606-1 is an entity that takes the form of a middle-aged Caucasian female identified as Marissa Schmidt, a lifetime resident and native of Chippewa Falls born in 1923. SCP-1606-1 possesses the memories and personality of Marissa Schmidt as of June 1, 1977<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>; however, it is restricted to SCP-1606. Any attempts to remove SCP-1606-1 from the premises have resulted in its disappearance and manifestation inside SCP-1606, with no memory past June 1, 1977. SCP-1606-1 has never expressed the desire to leave SCP-1606, nor has it been able to provide a satisfactory explanation for the anomalous properties of SCP-1606. SCP-1606-1 does not appear to require sustenance or sleep, and poses no threat to personnel.</p>
<p>The top floor of SCP-1606, designated SCP-1606-2, consists of a bathroom and bedroom, connected by a hallway to a staircase that leads to the ground floor. Persons entering SCP-1606-2 suffer irreversible, ongoing short-term memory losses that render the voluntary exit of SCP-1606-2 impossible. Subjects affected in this manner will frequently become lost when moving within or between rooms; any attempts by the subject to form a plan of action fail when the subject forgets any resolution they may have made to do so. Subjects are also unable to follow instructions or communicate effectively with each other or with other persons. Removal of subjects from SCP-1606-2 is impossible without the use of automated or remotely-operated systems. Retrieved subjects lack the ability to form new memories and exhibit extensive long- and short-term memory loss.</p>
<p>Despite lacking the mental faculties to eat or drink should food and/or beverages be provided to them, subjects exposed to SCP-1606-2 live approximately three months before dying. This is assumed to be an anomalous effect of SCP-1606. Should a subject expire in SCP-1606-2, their corpse will disappear. On occasions in which SCP-1606-2 is vacant, previous subjects who have died there will appear at random intervals, exhibiting behavior typical of SCP-1606-2 victims.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1606-1:</strong> Three photos and one nine-second video fragment taken inside SCP-1606-2 have shown the presence of an elderly man; no such person has been confirmed to exist in SCP-1606-2. SCP-1606-1 has identified this individual as Donald Schmidt, her father. Unremarkable public records of Donald Schmidt exist; however, no additional records have been created since April 1958. SCP-1606-1 claims that Donald Schmidt suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and will insist that he resides in the upper bedroom of SCP-1606 despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
