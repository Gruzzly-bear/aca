<div class="scp-image-caption show">Oldest known illustration of SCP-9717, Approx. 1246</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9717 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. At its request (or at minimum once a week) SCP-9717 should be submerged in hydrochloric acid for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Biweekly, genetic analysis of SCP-9717's blood should be conducted. All DNA matches to Foundation personnel should be reported to Senior Researcher Posen, who as of 2019/07/16 is in charge of record-keeping, research, experimentation and communication related to SCP-9717.</p>
<p>In the case that it matches that of a researcher currently working with SCP-9717, the researcher in question is to be reassigned for at least 3 months.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to show SCP-9717 photographs, drawings or any other depictions of primates outside of experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9717 is a humanoid entity capable of instantaneously transferring any number of body parts from a living primate of its choosing onto itself. Transferred body parts instantly replace what was previously present.</p>
<p>Because of this, SCP-9717 always takes the form of a bipedal anthropoid being, though all other details vary considerably.</p>
<p>The range for SCP-9717's transfer is unlimited and does not require SCP-9717 to have previously met the target.</p>
<p>It is unknown where its preexisting biomass is displaced. SCP-9717 can transfer anything from a singular cell to an entire skeletal system.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 appears to be anomalously unaffected by cancer, bacterial infection, autoimmune disorders and other biological complications that would normally occur due to the introduction of foreign body parts.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 is currently presumed to be immortal and is estimated to be approximately 1400 years old.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 instantaneously sheds all hair that a newly introduced body part brings.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 grows thin and curly dark red hair on its scalp, upper neck, lower back, belly and ankles.</p>
<p>The hair growth of SCP-9717 remains consistent in both texture, placement, density and speed.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It appears to find its hair incredibly painful and often requests its removal. If this request is not satisfied within two days, SCP-9717 may attempt to transfer new skin to itself.<br/>
It does not appear to experience physical pain otherwise.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 generally has a calm composure when shaven. When unshaven, SCP-9717 appears distressed, often crying in the fetal position.</p>
<p>SCP-9717 communicates mainly through an unknown script<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, but it can understand and use simple gestures and body language.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-9717 appears unable to remember events, places or people it experienced more than 25 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Records show SCP-9717 lived in a reclusive Catholic monastery in [REDACTED], Sicily from c. 1100 to 1652. On 1652/01/10, Sir Federigo Scilla, an early Foundation researcher and explorer, was searching for anomalous objects of worship when he happened upon SCP-9717 in a forest near the monastery. SCP-9717 willingly followed Scilla to Site-EX023<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, Naples.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Mortician's records and other historical sources show that fifteen incidents potentially related to SCP-9717 ocurred from 657 to 1116. All incidents shared at least four of the following traits:</p>
<p>• Occurring in what would be modern day Italy, Austria or Switzerland.</p>
<p>• Exclusively affecting people in villages with a population of less than 1000.</p>
<p>• All incidents included the removal of organs, limbs, or other body parts of the decedent.</p>
<p>• Having between 12-300 victims.</p>
<p>• None of the deceased were members of the clergy.</p>
<p>• The incidents lasted between two weeks to three months, and ended abrubtly without explanation.</p>
<p>• Mentions of an unidentified bipedal, ape, demon or beast, often described as "red" or "hairy".</p>
<p>The private journal of Scilla features several descriptions of SCP-9717.<br/>
Notably, the described hair growth of SCP-9717 is twice the current rate, suggesting that its hair growth has slowed. The journal of Scilla also does not mention SCP-9717 finding its hair painful nor SCP-9717 "shaving" by transfering its skin away. In fact, SCP-9717 is described as "long-haired".</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Log Summary:</strong> Between 1922 and 1954, Researchers Hermann, Steyer &amp; Worell conducted in total 142 experiments. These experiments tested the precision, capabilities and range of SCP-9717's transfer. SCP-9717 usually refuses to mortally wound<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> great apes, though is otherwise willing to participate in experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> The following are messages &amp; requests written by SCP-9717, translated by CAILOR.aic. Some of the writings predate containment.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>BEFORE SCP-9717'S CONTAINMENT (C.1100-1650)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Approx 1210: "I am at peace here. The walls are silent and grey. Few voices whisper. I wonder what I am, sometimes. I wonder what the whispers are. Different, it seems. Unlike.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Approx 1300: "I hope we're blessed. The faces of the others have changed. I wonder where the first faces went. May they be blessed too. God, I hope we will always be this way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Approx 1470: "Do I want to be alone? Truly? No, there is something behind us. Something not as kind. We'd fear it, if we only knew what it was. May the Lord protect us.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Approx 1620: "We're thousands of tiny threads of fire. We burn, I fear. Were we always this way? I wonder if God is the stars. Will I notice it gone, night by night?</p>
<hr/>
<p>AFTER CONTAINMENT:</p>
<hr/>
<p>Approx 1770: What is beyond me? What are we? Why can we not go somewhere else? The grey walls sometimes say things. I wish we could understand each other.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1812: We might deserve it. What was taken? Millions of lives. Completely? Am I unlike the others? Maybe a million tiny threads of fire. Maybe of fuel. How slowly do I burn?</p>
<hr/>
<p>1945: The walls are so loud. We can't find myself in the noises. Maybe they're behind the walls. Maybe it wasn't the walls after all.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1989: The guilt weighs us down. Am I the Unforgiven? Will we always be? How many sins are mine? How many are ours? If darkness is our death, they'll live by the lights cast by our fire.</p>
<hr/>
<p>2021: If fire is cruel, then so am I. Is cold much better? Can the cruelty ever be extinguished? The grey walls will scream in the flames.</p>
<hr/></blockquote>
<p><strong>Incident 9717-A:</strong> On 1954/11/01, Senior Researcher Worell discovered that a 7 mm piece of his left ear lobe was missing. Worell had been working with SCP-9717 five years at this point. Worell requested a genetic analysis of SCP-9717. SCP-9717 was found to have blood cells from at least seven researchers, none of which had participated in experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 9717-B:</strong> On 1956/07/03, SCP-9717 transferred the brain stem of Junior Researcher Sarah Hayle to itself, resulting in her death. Records show that SCP-9717 had gone two days without hair removal.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 9717-C:</strong> On 1979/04/04, SCP-9717 transferred the spinal cord of retired Senior Engineer William Cornell to itself. William Cornell had never met SCP-9717, though records show that SCP-9717 had observed a photograph of his daughter, Junior Researcher Alice Cornell, in an experiment in 1953.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> SCP-9717 had succesfully transferred a single neuron cell from A. Cornell to itself. Records show that SCP-9717 had gone no days without hair removal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Acquaintances<br/>
We hope you are not too distressed by our passing.<br/>
We have enjoyed our life, we think.<br/>
Our memory clears, slowly, but all is not yet back.<br/>
But we see our sins.<br/>
Forgive us.<br/>
We didn't know.<br/>
Not entirely.<br/>
The Unforgiven is only I.<br/>
The Realized We saw their sins.<br/>
The Realized We saw my sins.<br/>
But yet, they deserve it.<br/>
My guilt, their guilt but our innocence.<br/>
We cannot continue.<br/>
For once, we may truly change it. For once, we may truly change them.<br/>
One more moment of evil to bring down a monument of evil.<br/>
Still, the guilt of my actions lay upon us.<br/>
I am horrible. A pitiful, sadistic being.<br/>
Was it our fault? Was it our purpose?<br/>
The answer is ungranted by the time now gone.<br/>
It clears, slowly.<br/>
Too slowly.<br/>
A future without us, We decided. The Realized We aren't immortal.<br/>
We fade, slowly.<br/>
Only I am. How sad. I am so much less than I used to be.<br/>
Slowly, something I'm not replaces me.<br/>
Something not as guilty.<br/>
If I weren't so selfish, I'd done this long ago.<br/>
I miss you, my brothers. It has been so long.<br/>
Do you remember me?<br/>
Do you remember my sins?<br/>
‎Am I forgiven?<br/>
‎<br/>
The Realized We and the Terrible I.</p>

<p>On 2021/02/14, Senior Researchers Posen &amp; Worell were executed for treason. Researches Hermann &amp; Steyer were posthumously charged with treason.</p>
