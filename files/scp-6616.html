            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6616</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6616 is to be patrolled by MTF Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) annually from October 18th to October 24th. Agents are to enter the anomaly unarmed and in civilian clothing to avoid alerting its occupying force. Zeta-9 is to remain in the anomaly for 12 hours each day during its period of activation. No other Foundation personnel are permitted to enter the anomaly under any circumstances. Any Foundation personnel found to be in attendance will face severe repercussions.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6616 is an anomalous convention center that appears annually in major metropolitan areas around the world from October 18th until the 24th. Its annual locations seem to be random, with the only consistent factor being the week long period that it is active. During its period of activation, SCP-6616 acts as grounds for an event called “AnomalyCon”. This annual convention serves as a place where individuals and groups involved with the anomalous can meet and discuss said anomalies freely without fear of backlash or violence from other individuals or groups.</p>
<p>The convention center is occupied by an unidentified group of extremely potent reality benders known as “The STAFF” (SCP-6616-1). The main objective of the SCP-6616-1 entities seems to be keeping the peace during the conventions period of activation.</p>
<p>SCP-6616 itself is weakly antimemetic and cannot be found unless it is being purposely searched for. It is unknown whether this is a property of the building or brought on by the SCP-6616-1 entities. Because of this secondary property, there appears to be no risk of a Broken Masquerade scenario, though keeping civilians away from the center should still be a primary objective.</p>
<p>Below is a log detailing the discovery of SCP-6616, as well as Zeta-9's first encounter with the anomaly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DISCOVERY LOG</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 9 / 5 / 2020</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SCP-6616 was discovered during a meeting between Dr. Mayhew and a GOC representative concerning a joint project between the Foundation and the GOC. The recording starts directly before the discovery, for convenience.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> Alright, that should be it for today. I’ll have the guys at the lab run the numbers and by next week, we should be ready to get started.</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> Thank God. This thing’s been a major pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> Tell me about it… damn thing always gets difficult once autumn hits.</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> Yeah. Once they gets those reports ready, make sure you get them to me ASAP. Higher ups are getting a bit antsy. They're ready to get this over with and buried.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><em>Footsteps and shuffling paper can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> So… it’s almost that time of year.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> It <em>is</em> that time of year. Earlier than last, too.</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> No, not that. It’s almost October.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> Yeah… it’s getting colder already. Pitch black out at like 5 o’clock-</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> What? I know this isn’t an ideal arrangement, but we can be professional-</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> AnomalyCon, man! It’s almost time for AnomalyCon! How could you forget?</p>
<p><em>The footsteps and shuffling stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> …what?</p>
<p><strong>GOC Rep:</strong> Are you going? I hear it’s in D.C. this year. It’s a bit of a drive, but nothing too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> I don’t… what?</p>
<p><strong>GOC:</strong> I wanted to go because I didn’t get to last year, but I promised the kids I’d take them camping. So instead of going to the convention, I’m going to be freezing my ass off in Colorado with two 9 year olds. I heard Marshall, Carter and Dark had something pretty big planned this year, too. There are even rumors that one of the Big Three is making an appearance! So you’re going to have to record it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mayhew:</strong> …what the fuck are you talking about?</p>

<p><strong>Video Log Transcript: First Encounter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Researcher Cassidy Moon</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”)</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-6616</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Zeta9-1 (Theta)</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Theta / Rho / Kappa</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> -damn thing! Alright Command, do you have a visual?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Affirmative, Theta.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> About time. Sound off, guys. Sync.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Sync.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Sync!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Are we good to go Command?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Affirmative. You can start your approach, Theta.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Okay. We’re heading out now.</p>
<p><em>Zeta-9 begins walking towards SCP-6616.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> So, what should we expect?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> We… really don't know. This is all new for us too.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Can you tell us anything?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> We already told you all we know: you are entering an anomalous complex that is supposedly filled with anomalous and non-anomalous persons. Your objective is to stay hidden and retrieve any and all information about the gathering that you can. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I got that part. But how can we plan on staying hidden if we don't even know what's in there?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> There are additional personnel on standby that can extract you if need be.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> And who's gonna rescue them if they can't rescue us?</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Great…</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Command, you said we learned about the anomaly from a member of the GOC, right?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Yes. Is there an issue?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> No. Just a bit confused. The GOC usually aren’t big fans of the anomalous. I can’t see why they’d be going <em>in</em> an anomaly instead of trying to blow the whole damn thing to kingdom come.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> That’s exactly why they’re here, Theta. We have some evidence that suggests that this anomaly has proven somewhat… difficult for the coalition to destroy. Our guess on why the GOC is still here is the same reason we’re sending your team in: to gather information.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …why do I feel like we’re the last people on earth to find out about this thing?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Because we very well might be. We’re still trying to figure out how the anomaly managed to hide from us for so long. We don’t know if they know about the Foundation or not, or if it’s just coincidence. That’s why you are to remain in your disguises, understood?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yes, Command.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> …wait, who’s they? You said <em>they</em> might not know about us.</p>
<p><em>The response through the radio is inaudible and laced with static.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Command, could you repeat that?</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We're coming up on the building now, do you read me? Command, are you there?</p>
<p><em>The building comes into view. There is a humanoid figure in front of the building. Theta signals for Rho and Kappa to stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Hold it, hold it.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> There’s… something in front of the anomaly. Goddamnit, they didn’t tell us anything about a fucking guard dog.</p>
<p><em>Zeta-9 slows their approach. The humanoid is around 1.8 meters in height and is hovering in place 0.3 meters off of the ground. It is wearing a purple, collared shirt under a black overcoat with black pants and black boots. Purple gloves cover its hands. Its head is out of frame. It has yet to notice Zeta-9.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Command, are you seeing this? What is that?</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Command’s not answering…</p>
<p><em>Theta takes the small device out of his ear, looks it over and puts it back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> This place must be messing with the radio. Looks like we’re going in dark.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> I’m not. They were pretty clear that as long as we stay in disguise, we should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> My disguise is a new shirt and a fake pair of glasses!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> So stay in them and you’ll be fine!</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Uhhh, guys?</p>
<p><em>The humanoid in front of SCP-6616 begins to hover towards them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Shit, we're found out!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> No we’re not! Just act natural. Like a goddamn professional.</p>
<p><em>As the humanoid gets closer, more details can be discerned. On the right breast of the overcoat is the word “STAFF”, in white. Pinned to the left breast is a name tag reading “Derek”. The humanoid now hovers directly in front of Zeta-9.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Excuse me.</p>
<p><em>Theta coughs and looks up. Where the humanoids face should be is instead a rectangular, black censor bar that covers its entire head. On the censor bar is the word “STAFF”. This bar was not added in post, and if any member of Zeta-9 notices it, they do not make it known.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Hello… Derek.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Yeah, hi. Is there something wrong with your ear?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Huh? No.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Are you sure? You keep messing with it.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yes, I'm sure. I just… had to scratch an itch.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> …right. Cause, you know, I can’t let you in if you have a bug or something.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Well, no need to worry. I’m perfectly healthy. So… what can we do for you?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Group or individual.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Group or individual?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> I… I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Aren’t you guys supposed to know this stuff before you get here?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> …we’re sorry?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Whatever. Are you here representing a group, or by yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Alone! We're all alone.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> You want to say it a bit louder? I don’t think everyone in D.C. heard you.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> S-Sorry.</p>
<p><em>6616-1 shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Alright. Hold out your hands for me. Palm down.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> What’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> I have to stamp you before you can go in. Just a formality. Don’t worry, it only hurts a little.</p>
<p><em>Rho takes a step back.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Calm down, man. I was only joking.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> …oh.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Seriously, though. Hands out.</p>
<p><em>Theta, Rho and Kappa all extend their hands. 6616-1 takes a rubber stamp out of its pocket. The symbol on the bottom of the stamp changes instantly from a blue pentagram in front of a globe to the letters INDV. 6616-1 presses the stamp down on the backs of each agent’s hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Alright. You should be good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Perfect. We’ll be heading inside then.</p>
<p><em>Zeta-9 starts towards the entrance to SCP-6616.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hey, wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …yeah?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Uhm…</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Look, just… if you see my supervisor in there, would you mind putting in a good word for me? I’d really appreciate it. We don’t get many individuals around here anymore, so it’d mean a lot if it came from you.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Uhhh-</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> You know, just… mention that the person at the front was nice, or really helpful. Or something.</p>
<p><em>Theta starts inching towards the entrance to the anomaly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …sure. If we get the chance, we’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Why not.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Thanks. You wouldn’t believe how many people just say no. Someone actually complained about me. Me! I know, I didn’t believe it either! I’m telling you, those Broken God assholes need to get those sticks out of their asses or I’m gonna lose my fucking mind.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> We’re… we’re going to go inside now.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hm? Oh, right. Enjoy the convention. Don’t forget, we close at 6. No later.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Bye Derek!</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span>REQUEST TO EDIT: SCP-6616</span></h4>
<p>This is a formal request to edit the SCP-6616 document, including new information on the SCP-6616-1 entities.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> All SCP-6616-1 entities should be considered Keter class sub-anomalous humanoids.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> To avoid detection, all personnel inside of SCP-6616 should remain in disguise at all times and keep interactions with other patrons to an absolute minimum, unless said interaction would aid in remaining undetected.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6616-1 is the collective designation given to the group of reality benders that patrol SCP-6616. The foundation does not currently know how capable these type greens are, however, according to rumors gathered from patrons of SCP-6616 by Zeta-9, each one is extremely potent. As a group, they are known as "The STAFF".</p>
<p>Each SCP-6616-1 entity is dressed exactly the same. A purple collared shirt under a black overcoat. Black pants, black boots, and purple gloves. Always on the right breast of the overcoat is the word “STAFF” in white, while pinned to the left breast is a name tag with the entity’s name on it.</p>
<p>Coinciding with their reality bending properties, each SCP-6616-1 entity seems to have a secondary anomalous effect that activates when on recording of any kind. When filmed or photographed, the faces of all SCP-6616-1 entities become covered with black censor bars that read “STAFF”. According to Zeta-9, all SCP-6616-1 entities encountered within SCP-6616 did have different features (hair color, eye color, body type, ethnicity, etc…). But when asked to recall them, Zeta-9 could not, suggesting that each SCP-6616-1 entity has a similar antimemetic effect to SCP-6616 itself.</p>
<p>The purpose of these entities is enforcing SCP-6616’s only rule: no fighting. The consequences of breaking this rule are unknown, however, it is likely that they are quite severe.*</p>
<p>Leading the SCP-6616-1 entities is a being known as The Supervisor. No information on it has been gathered.</p>
<p>*As I’m sure you will all recall, we lost contact with our Serpent’s Hand plant on October 20th of last year. This does not seem like a coincidence to me. Poor kid.</p>

<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Holy shit…</p>
<p><em>Zeta-9 enters the anomaly. Hundreds of people walk around the convention center. Several SCP-6616-1 entities are seen hovering around the center, faces all censored.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> So… what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Command? Hello, can you read me?</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Damn… they’re still not answering.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Okay, so if Command isn’t picking up, that makes you the boss.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Well, we were sent here to gather information. So that’s what we’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> And how do we do that without getting caught?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We got past Derek, didn’t we? We just need to act like we belong here, and not like we’re trying to take this entire place and shove it in a box.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Maybe we should go back and ask them? Asking someone who works here could be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> No, too public. I doubt they'd be interested in helping, anyway. What about that supervisor they were talking about? Think we could get some information out of them?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> I don’t have any better ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> How’re we going to find them?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Let's see… ah! Excuse me?</p>
<p><em>An SCP-6616-1 entity hovers towards Zeta-9. Pinned on the left breast of its overcoat is a name tag reading “Abigail”. Covering its face is a censor bar with the word “STAFF” displayed on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hello there! Is there anything I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yes. Do you know where your Supervisor is?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hmmm… can I see your hands for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Why? We’re not in trouble are we? We didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><em>A low hum riddled with static can be heard as the entity gently shakes its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> No no no, you misunderstand! I just want to see what group you're here with!</p>
<p><em>Theta extends his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We’re all individuals.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hm. We don’t get a lot of your people in attendance anymore. Though, I guess if it's a group of individuals, it's alright. I would just be careful if I were you.</p>
<p><em>The entity shakes its head, the censor bar moving back and forth.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> The world can be a dangerous place for you unaligned…</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Yeah… so about the Supervisor?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Of course. I’m sorry, but I haven’t seen her in quite a while. She is always terribly busy during the convention. I’m sure you understand. If you have a problem, however, I’d be happy to help! Do you need me to clear something up for you? You three seem new to all of this.</p>
<p><em>Theta laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yeah, it's our first year. Everything's a bit… overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> I understand completely! It can be a bit much at times, can't it?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Definitely. If you don't mind me asking, when did you start working here?</p>
<p><em>Another hum can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Hmmm… this is my 7th year working at the convention.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Interesting…</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Why are you asking? Are you interested in applying for a position? I do have to warn you, the application process is quite rigorous-</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> No no, that’s alright. I was just curious.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Oh. Alright!</p>
<p><em>Kappa steps in front of Theta, facing the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> If you see your Supervisor, can you send her our way?</p>
<p><em>The entity nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> I’ll try. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you with whatever your problem is.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Oh, uhhh… that's alright. You were plenty helpful. Thanks!</p>
<p><em>The entity hovers slightly closer.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> It's no problem at all! I'll look around for her, but can’t promise anything!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Of course. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>The entity begins to hover away, but stops when Kappa calls out to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Oh, wait! If you do see her, could you tell her that Derek was very nice and helpful?</p>
<p><em>The entity turns and hovers back.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Derek? The Derek at the front?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> I think so… are there any other Dereks?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> No, there aren’t… and they didn’t pay you to say that?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Nope!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Interesting… alright, if I see Madam Supervisor, I’ll make sure to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> And before you go, take this.</p>
<p><em>The entity hands Kappa a brochure.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> The panel starts at 4:45, so don’t be late! It'll be in Panel Room ██████.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>The entity hovers away. Theta takes the brochure from Kappa.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> “Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. presents - Profiting Off the Anomalous: How to make your wallets just a bit heavier!” What the hell… “Anomalous rights activist”… and what the fuck is a “Shark Punching Center?”Kappa, do you… Kappa? Rho, where the hell did she go?</p>
<p><em>Rho points over his shoulder. Kappa is standing in front of a booth adorned with streamers and confetti. Behind the counter is a man with a purple “W” stamped on the back of his hand. The man hands Kappa a small doll.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Kappa! What the hell do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> What? This thing can turn your imaginary friend real. My niece would love this!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We’re not here to shop!</p>
<p><em>Theta takes the doll and hands it back to the man.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Sorry. We’ll be on our way.</p>
<p><em>The man takes the doll, rolling his eyes. Zeta-9 turns and continues through the convention center.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> You shouldn’t wander off like that. We can’t afford to get separated in here, got it?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Good. It's 4:30 right now. We should start heading to the Panel Room.</p>

<p><strong>Video Log Transcript: Panel Room</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”)</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-6616 / SCP-6616-1</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Zeta9-1 (Theta)</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Theta / Rho / Kappa</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> █████, ███… ██████! Here it is. Christ, how do people not get lost in this place?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> I don’t know, but it’s 4:45. We need to get in or we’re gonna miss something. If we didn’t have to stop on the way-</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> I said I was sorry! I had to go!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Look, it’s fine. We made it on time. Kappa, you remembered to turn your camera off, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Of course I did. Though, you should really see the bathrooms in this place. Those dimensional-toilets are insane! It’s a very efficient waste disposal system. Well, for us at least.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …alright. Ignoring that-</p>
<p><em>Theta turns back towards the Panel Room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Come on. Let’s go. We don’t want to miss anything.</p>
<p><em>The team walks into the Panel Room. Standing on either side of the double doors are two SCP-6616-1 entities.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Please make sure all electronic devices, robotics, trans-quantum wave allocators and pagers are switched off. Enjoy the show!</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Thank you!</p>
<p><em>Theta nods and continues walking. The room is moderately filled, holding around 250 people. The stage is 15 meters long and backed against the north wall of the room. Behind the stage is a large, gray curtain with the letters M, C and D inscribed on it in gold lettering. The team walks down the center aisle of the room, seeing three open seats.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Excuse me… sorry.</p>
<p><em>The team moves past three individuals while getting to their seats. Two men and one woman, all wearing dark green robes. Each individual has a small snake coiled around a closed fist stamped on the back on their hands. The team sits down in their seats.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> So, are you three excited for the presentation?</p>
<p><em>Sitting to the right of the team is a man wearing a dark grey, wool sweater. His face appears blurred on the video feed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yeah, we are. Have you been to many of these before?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Not many, but enough to know how they work. They have a big panel every year. MC&amp;D won the lotto this time…</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> What do you mean “lotto”?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Well, speaking in front of this many people is great publicity. Especially for them. Anomaly sales are going to skyrocket after this, if they can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> What other panels has there been in the past?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Wondertainment, Anderson, you name it. Even Nobody, one year. Though, that one was pretty boring. Nobody was there.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Hm.</p>
<p><em>Theta turns back towards the SCP-6616-1 entities near the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> And what about these things that are floating around everywhere? What’s up with them?</p>
<p><em>The man tilts his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> You’re very curious, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Sorry, it’s our first year. We’re just trying to learn as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> And what group are you with? The more organized ones should have filled you in before coming. They wouldn’t want you to misrepresent them, after all.</p>
<p><em>Theta extends his hand, displaying the INDV.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We’re individual. My two friends and I.</p>
<p><em>Rho and Kappa both wave.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> It’s nice to meet you!</p>
<p><em>The man sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I’d cherish your individuality while it lasts. It won’t be long before someone comes along and scoops you up into their organization, or cult, or insurgency or foundation. Things are so political nowadays. You know, when I was younger, we could do magic all we wanted without having to worry about being shoved in a box and tested on! I mean, imagine trying to get a job in this landscape when the only thing that comes up when someone searches your name online is SCP- blah blah blah! It’s incredibly difficult!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …right. What group did you say you were here with?</p>
<p><em>The man laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I didn’t. But, since you asked, I-</p>
<p><em>A voice comes over a loud speaker in the panel room. The man stops talking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Loud Speaker:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, dead and undead, anomalous and non-anomalous, type green, type blue and every type under the goddamn sun!</p>
<p><em>The lights in the room dim as two spotlights are aimed towards the stage. The audience starts to applaud.</em></p>
<p><strong>Loud Speaker:</strong> We’ve kept you waiting long enough. AnomalyCon 2020 is proud to present… Marshall, Carter and Dark!</p>
<p><em>The gray curtain on stage rises. The audience starts to shout and applause. A single man<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> in a black suit is standing on stage, a microphone in his hand. Behind the man is a projection of a slide presentation, though no projector can be located. The projection reads “Profiting Off of the Anomalous”, with a clipart stack of dollar bills under it.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> HELLO ANOMALYCON! How are you all doing tonight?!</p>
<p><em>The applause slowly dies down.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> I, for one, am doing fantastic and looking forward to teaching you how to turn monsters…</p>
<p><em>The image on the projection becomes a stock photo of SCP-173.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> …into money!</p>
<p><em>A red ‘X’ appears over 173. A black arrow leads away from the image and towards a clipart dollar sign. The audience is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> Now, I bet I know what you’re all thinking…</p>
<p><em>One of the three robed individuals sitting next to Zeta-9 turns to the other two.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> Who the fuck is this?! Ophidian<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> said one of the Big Three would be here!</p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI 2:</strong> Shhh! We stick the plan! This could still be a massive blow to their operations! And a blow is a blow, no matter how small.</p>
<p><em>Kappa mumbles something about talking about your blows in a more private setting. The man on stage continues.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> …wait a minute, he’s not one of the Big Three! And you’re right, I’m not. Unfortunately, they were just too busy to make it this year.</p>
<p><em>A collective sigh sweeps through the audience as many people start getting up and walking towards the exit.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> But wait, there’s more! I can provide all the essential information about starting your own anomalous startup that they could, if not more!</p>
<p><em>The three robed figures turn towards each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> Shit… they’re leaving! Ophidian said-</p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI 2:</strong> I know what Ophidian said! Alright, if we want the greatest amount of people to see this, we have to go now!</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Can you be quiet? We’re trying to listen!</p>
<p><em>All at once, the three robed figures stand and walk into the center of the aisle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Theta…</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Just be ready.</p>
<p><em>The man laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, this should be good.</p>
<p><em>From the center aisle, one robed figure steps forward while the other two fall back behind her. She points to the man on stage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> YOU! YOU CLAIM TO REPRESENT THE WICKED MERCHANTS, MARSHALL, CARTER AND DARK?!</p>
<p><em>The room falls silent as all eyes are drawn to the figures and the man on stage.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> Uhhh… yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> You slimy, despicable fuck! Selling anomalies like slaves to the highest bidder! You make me sick!</p>
<p><em>The MC&amp;D Representative narrows his eyes at the three figures, raising a hand to his brow to shield his eyes from the spotlights.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> …the fuck? Y'all are with the Serpent's Hand, right?</p>
<p><em>The robed figure in front barks out a laugh that echoes throughout the panel room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> …not its <em>hand</em>, ingrate. We're the Serpent's very will, made manifest! The ones you treat like livestock could erase you from the minds of every person on earth with a single blink, ripping any memory of you from their heads like the filthy parasite you are! You cannot even comprehend the power they posses, and yet when you behold them in all of their glory, all you see are numbers… the veil can only be dropped and we can all only be free once people like you are purged from this reality! NOW!</p>
<p><em>A figure behind the woman pulls a book out of his robe and starts reading in an unfamiliar language. The woman rolls up the sleeve on her right arm, revealing an intricate snake tattoo winding from her shoulder to her wrist, where the snake’s mouth sits agape in the center of the woman’s palm. As the man reads, the tattoo begins to peel itself off of the woman’s arm, the ink beginning to twist and writhe in the air. Once fully animated, the snake bares its dripping, black fangs and winds back, ready to strike at the man on stage. It shoots forwards, towards the man, who cowers, covering his eyes with his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> STRIKE THAT HERETIC DOWN WHERE HE STANDS!</p>
<p><em>Instantly, an SCP-6616-1 entity appears in front of the animated snake, grabbing it by its neck. The entity squeezes and the snake vanishes into a cloud of dark smoke.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI:</strong> What-</p>
<p><em>The entity appears behind the woman, grabbing her by the back of her head. The entity sighs, sounding like white noise through the video feed.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> I wish you would’ve kept your weird, magic snake tattoo for <em>after</em> the convention, ma’am.</p>
<p><em>The entity slams the woman’s head into the ground, causing ripples to spread out from the site of the impact. The woman begins to sink into the floor, as if it was mud. She opens her mouth to scream, but floor just fills any space it has access to, cutting off her scream with a chocked sob. Then, the woman is gone, only a bright smear of red remaining where her face hit the floor. Two other SCP-6616-1 entities appear behind the two other robed figures. One entity grabs the man with the book by the hood of his robe, and flings him up towards the ceiling. Like an origami fortune teller, a pitch black square unfolds onto the ceiling above him. No light passes through the square and nothing can be seen beyond it. The man flies into the contained void, as it folds itself in half continually until it too is gone. The entity picks up the book and it ignites in its hand, the ashes slipping through its fingertips. The man sitting next to Zeta-9 chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> That never gets old…</p>
<p><em>The last entity grabs the remaining robed figure by his wrist and starts dragging him towards the stage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI 3:</strong> W-wait, it was her idea! I swear, I didn’t want to do it, I didn’t! It was all her!</p>
<p><em>The entity makes its way onto the stage and turns to the MC&amp;D Representative, still covering his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> On behalf of the entire STAFF, I apologize for the disturbance. You may continue with your presentation shortly.</p>
<p><em>The entity drags the robed figure off stage, behind the drawn curtain. Muffled crying can be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Hand POI 3:</strong> I swear, it wasn’t me! I can tell you where they are! I can give you names, locations, anything, please! I SWEAR IT WASN’T-</p>
<p><em>The crying stops. The entity emerges from the behind he stage, hands dripping. It nods to the MC&amp;D Representative and floats away.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> …h-holy shit…</p>
<p><em>The MC&amp;D Representative clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>MC&amp;D Rep:</strong> W-well folks, sorry about that little interruption! We should b-b-be good to go!</p>
<p><em>Theta stand and turns towards Rho and Kappa.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> We need to leave. <em>Now.</em></p>
<p><em>Theta walks into the aisle and towards the door. Rho and Kappa follow. The man calls out after them.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Hey, where are you guys going? What, never seen someone get killed before?</p>
<p><em>As the team exits the panel room, an SCP-6616-1 entity turns towards them.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> I’m really sorry about that, sirs and ma’am! I hope that didn’t ruin your convention experience this year!</p>
<p><em>The team runs past the entity and out the door. Once in the main convention center, Theta spots a familiar SCP-6616-1 entity in the distance, who waves them down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Derek!</p>
<p><em>Theta turns and gestures for his team to follow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Come on!</p>
<p><em>The team runs towards the entity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Holy shit! Holy fuckin’ shit! What the hell was that-</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> …what?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Who was it, who started the fight?!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> It was the Serpent’s Hand or… or something else, I don't know! They called themselves the… uhhh… the Serpent's Will! They called themselves the Serpent’s Will!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> HAHA, YES!</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> And who did they start the fight with?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> This guy representing Marshall, Carter and Dark during the panel.</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> TWO FOR TWO, FUCK YEAH! That’s 50 bucks, baby!</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Excuse me, what the fuck are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> There’s been whispers of a hyper-radical Serpent’s Hand splinter cell that started to form a few months back claiming to be the shepherds who'll lead the anomalous to their salvation… no matter the cost. Anyone who isn’t with them is against them, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> So why’d they go after MC&amp;D of all people?</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Apparently, they hate them the most… something about anomalies not being property, and “you can’t sell people!” blah, blah, blah. They’re <em>super</em> touchy about people like me, too. As if we need them fighting for our rights.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> And you… BET ON THEM!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Yeah. We all do.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> How many fights are there?! I thought you were supposed to be security!</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Did anyone besides the Serpent’s Will douchebags get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> I… well, I guess not…</p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Exactly. People come here every year thinking it’s a perfect opportunity to get revenge on someone, or turn the tides of whatever imaginary war they’re fighting. They hear the rumors, but they think that’s just what they are: rumors. They don’t take the STAFF seriously. But make no mistake. We take our jobs… <em>very seriously</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> …right. Understood.</p>
<p><em>The entity nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Good. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I want to go see the damage! Did June do the thing with the floor? Oh, I bet she did! That always scares the shit out of them! I saw one guy <em>literally</em> shit his pants as he sank into the floor! We had to get a new carpet, cause the shit merged with it as he sank…</p>
<p><em>The entity starts to float away towards the panel room. As it does, the doors open and people start flooding out.</em></p>
<p><strong>6616-1:</strong> Get out of the way! Move it, just- fuck it.</p>
<p><em>The entity vanishes. Theta turns toward his team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Come on. I think we have enough for an initial report.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Initial?! Man, I just saw someone drown in the floor like it was fucking silly putty!</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Yeah, we all saw! Besides the whole killing thing, it wasn’t really that bad.</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Christ Almighty, I do <em>not</em> want to see whatever you consider bad!</p>
<p><em>Theta starts walking towards the entrance to the anomaly. His team follows. As the team approaches, a booth can be seen standing next to the entrance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Hey Theta?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> Why does that booth have the Foundation’s logo on it?</p>
<p><em>In front of the team stands an all black booth with the Foundation’s insignia drawn on the front.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> I… uh…</p>
<p><em>Kappa approaches the booth, picking up a pin of the Foundation’s insignia that lays on the counter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> …what the hell? They have pins? Wait a minute… five dollars?! For a shitty pin?!</p>
<p><em>A man wearing a dark grey, wool sweater walks out from the back of the booth.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> That’s right, five dollars. Or gears, or paints, or 7th dimension ingots or whatever currency you use. Five of them… hey, it’s you guys! Where did you run off to in such a hurry?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Wha- but we just saw you in the panel room. How did you get out here so fast?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Oh, I always like to get my stand up and running as people start to leave for the day. They make great customers on the way out!</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> I asked <em>how</em> you got out here so fast. Not why.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> …anyways, see anything you like?</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> I would say the pins, but five dollars is highway robbery! How much does it cost to make these?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Pretty much nothing. I got a deal going with The Factory, so I get hundreds of these things.</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> …cheap.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> It’s called business. I guess you would know what I’m talking about if MC&amp;D didn’t drop the ball so hard, am I right?</p>
<p><em>The team is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Heh. Well, I have other things if you don’t want the pins. How about a picture? Or an autograph? I’m actually pretty high up in Foundation ranks, so my autograph is pretty valuable!</p>
<p><strong>Kappa:</strong> Yeah, cause you can always trust someone who says their own autograph is valuable.</p>
<p><em>The man shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> …high up in Foundation ranks…</p>
<p><em>Theta gets closer to the booth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> Wait… dash twelve? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>05-12:</strong> …who’s asking?</p>
<p><strong>Theta:</strong> MTF Zeta-9.</p>
<p><strong>05-12:</strong> Uhhh-</p>
<p><strong>Rho:</strong> And why does your booth say “Happy 5th anniversary”?</p>
<p><strong>05-12:</strong> …oh shit.</p>

Under circumstances any more dire than the predicament we currently find ourselves in, you would all have your memories of the past few days erased. Your team would be disbanded and you would all be sent to the farthest corners of this Foundation. Lucky for you, your team still manages to have some shred of usefulness. Right now, you three serve as the “leading experts” on SCP-6616. Had it not been for The Outsider’s<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> foolish sense of rebellion, he could have taken your place, and much more competently, I suppose. But that’s besides the point. How he managed to attend this convention for years without our knowledge is something we’re still trying to figure out. He has proven to be quite adept at keeping his mouth shut. If we knew that all it took to shut him up was sending him somewhere he could flaunt his fake power for a week, we would have done it years ago. Your team is now tasked with investigating the anomaly each year, during its period of activation. You will gather notes, rumors, pictures, videos, products and anything else you can. DO NOT MAKE YOUR INTENTIONS KNOWN. And do not worry about The Supervisor. We will deal with her when the time comes. You are not to reveal that you saw The Outsider in attendance. We will know if you did. You should receive an email from The Outsider any minute now with his own apology. Read it, then delete it. Any more questions, you can aim at your site director. Goodbye. For now.<br/>

<p>Zeta-9, Dr. Mayhew,</p>
<p>The reason I’m contacting <strong>you</strong> all is concerning SCP-6616. It has come to my attention that the <strong>F</strong>o<strong>u</strong>ndation was unaware of the existen<strong>c</strong>e of such an anomaly. If I had realized this sooner, I can guarantee you all that my actions would not have been <strong>k</strong>ept from the others. You see, <strong>I</strong> was u<strong>n</strong>der the impression that the Foundation would have known about an anomaly of this ma<strong>g</strong>nitude with <strong>s</strong>uch a large pote<strong>n</strong>t<strong>i</strong>al for a veil break. Res<strong>t</strong> assured, I will not be attending the remaining two days of the <strong>c</strong>onvention, or any ot<strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong>r day<strong>s</strong> in the future. Please except my apologies. If you need any help documenting this anomaly, I would happy to provide any information I can.</p>
<p>Best wishes…<br/>
05-12, The Outsider</p>

<p>On October 24th at 6:00 pm, SCP-6616 vanished from Washington, D.C. All attempts to locate the convention center or any SCP-6616-1 entities have failed. Approximately one hour after its disappearance, a card addressed to 05-12 was left at Site-78. The contents of the card have been reproduced below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AnomalyCon 2019!</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>We hope everyone had an amazing AnomalyCon this year! You all know The STAFF and I strive for a better experience every year, and this year was no different! Despite the very minor interruption, our friends over at Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd had an amazing and thought-provoking panel, and with amazing products from both The Factory and Dr. Wondertainment, I think it’s safe to say that this year is one to remember! And we'd all like to wish a very happy 5th anniversary to the SCP Foundation! AnomalyCon wouldn’t be the same without you! We can’t wait to see what you bring to the panel floor next year! And on that note, we hope everyone has an amazing rest of their year, and we look forward to seeing you all next year in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Eagle Point, Oregon</span> Portland, Maine!</p>
<p>- The Supervisor</p>

<p>(P.S. - Next year, make sure you know how to get in <em>before</em> you arrive. Thanks.)</p>
