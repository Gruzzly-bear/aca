<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The currently contained computerized instance of SCP-9537 is to be stored within a standard anomalous containment unit, with slight modifications. It is currently, and should stay as, a 15 x 10 foot room, with a 5-foot radius expanding from the center of the room marked with yellow and black caution tape. Cameras are to be installed in all four corners of the room and are only to be activated during visits to SCP-9537 and only analyzed by research personnel resistant to strong memetic effects.</p>
<p>During election seasons in the United States, not including the midterms, an exploratory commission between Task Forces;</p>
<ul>
<li>Iota-10 "Damn Feds"</li>
<li>Mu-4 "Debuggers"</li>
<li>Mu-13 "Ghostbusters"</li>
<li>Eta-10 "See No Evil"</li>
<li>Epsilion-6 "Village Idiots" for Rural and Suburban cases of SCP-9537 exposure</li>
<li>Pi-1 "City Slickers" for Urban cases of SCP-9537 exposure</li>
</ul>
<p>will be formed to contain possible manifestations of SCP-9537. Other Task Forces may be added depending on the manifestation's qualities.</p>
<p>Any testing with SCP-9537 is only to be authorized by the Memetic Effects Specialist currently assigned to SCP-9537. Any individual entering SCP-9537, for testing or otherwise, are to be adminstered political indentification tests before entering and every 15 minutes within the chamber. If the test identifies that alteration from SCP-9537 is present beyond acceptable parameters of the MES, the individual is to be removed from the chamber and given a memetic examination before being adminstered Class-C amnestics.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9537 is divided into 3 parts;</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:100;"><img alt="Old_computer_lab.jpg" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-9537-0/Old_computer_lab.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Recovered instance of SCP-9537. No longer active</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9537-A is a memetic effect and physical message initially perpetuated by SCP-9537-C, and maintained by the presence of SCP-9537-B. This effect alters the political views of the afflicted subject, and has been shown to alter infected individual's personalities under long terms of exposure, with only some individuals showing no sign of intensifcation. This intensifcation can only occur if -B is present within a 5-mile radius of the infected individual. If SCP-9537-B is removed from this radius, the infection will start to regress. Research has shown, however, that long-term and constant exposure to -A and -C can slow down the regression process, leading to certain infected individuals being unable to regress to a pre-infection state without the use of Class-C amnestics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9537-B is the spectral presence of George William Poli. All manifestations of SCP-9537-A and -C are accompanied by the appearence of SCP-9537. Currently, the role of -B, outside of perpetuating the memetic effect of -B within already infected hosts, is unknown, and -B hasn't manifested since the containment of SCP-9537. During manifestations that contain multiple -C instances, sightings of -B have been recorded at both locations. However, any visual or auditory recording of -B have yet to be produced. Individuals who have been in the presence of -B have reported headaches, migranes, and temporary loss of senses, which have been attributed to -B attempting to transmit -A, though no documented infections have been attributed to -B alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9537-C is the vessel in which the previous parts (-A and -B respectively.) are transmitted. In 2006, SCP-9537 manifested a -C that it now uses as a main vessel, which is currently contained within Site-537. More can be read on its containment in Addendum 0-A. Over the years since it's discovery, both physical and historically, many forms of its vessel have been logged and have been put into Addendum 0-B. While each manifestation of -C is different, the one common factor amongst all vessels is the physical message that is a part of -A. Said message can be located below.</li>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Project: Secular Democracy, Potential contamination issues with our project and SCP-9537.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hello! This is Lori Sunderweather, Project Lead for Secular Democracy.</p>
<p>We've attempted to reach you multiple times about possible contamination issues with our project and the currently contained SCP-9537. It is our priority to maintain a stable, fair, and unmodified political environment, and considering the anomalous properties of SCP-9537, we are worried that SCP-9537 might be able to effect the implementation of the project.</p>
<p>Our own Memetic Effects specialist is too worried about contamination, and would like to meet with you to discuss the possibility. However, if you aren't going to partake in a meeting, we will have to move forward with the project using precautions developed by our specialist. We hope you respond.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lore Sunderweather.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<p>During the election cycle of 2000, reports of a compound of politically extreme individuals was created inside the Everglades. While normally, the only precaution that would've been taken was to increase security at the surrounding outposts and sites, it also came to the attention of the Foundation that this same compound had been contacting a local division of Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd for help in the procurement of weaponized artifacts and anomalies, which led to a squad of Epsilion-6 "Village Idiots" being assigned to investigate the compound under the guise of the local electricity company trying to figure out why there was a increased power draw.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-left" style="width:100;"><img alt="Everglades_Sawgrass_Prairie_Moni3.jpg" class="image" src="http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-9537-0/Everglades_Sawgrass_Prairie_Moni3.jpg"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Field that borders on forest compound was constructed in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon reaching the compound, Epsilion-6 Team Leader attempted to make contact with a member of the compound, which was not responded to. This continued 3 more times until Foundation Tactical Command allowed them to send in their stealth member, Hotel-7, into the compound to try and make visual contact with anybody inside. When Hotel-7 entered into the compound, they found that all the members committed mass suicide by a combination of poisoning, hanging and starvation. Hotel-7 then encountered SCP-9537-C and -A, which led to H-7 falling under the memetic affliction of SCP-9537-C. Tactical Command received vital monitoring information that Hotel-7 was experiencing the effects of -C, and gave the rest of the Village Idiots permission to make entry and retrieve Hotel-7. Before either Upsilon-4 "Sugar Pill" or Eta-10 "See No Evil" arrived, the manifestation of -A, -B, and -C then disappeared as the election ended.</p>
<p>Please see Addendum 0-A for how the object came under containment, 0-B for past instances of SCP-9537, and 0-C for the message itself.</p>

<p>During the end of the 2004 election cycle, SCP-9537 and its parts manifested into a computer within the defunct computer room of a church. This is one of the first Foundation recorded instances of SCP-9537-B appearing to make a difference in how SCP-9537-A and -C would affect others. Recovered messages from people who attended the church SCP-9537 was being held in appeared to have encountered a "holy spirit" that was encouraging them to go into the computer room of the church. During preliminary investigation by foundation agents, the section of the nearby populace who attended the church went missing, which launched an emergency inspection of the church to confirm the presence of a possible anomaly.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Currently contained instance of SCP-9537 before containment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to the previous manifestations of SCP-9537, and apparently digital nature of the current manifestation, a JTF of Eta-10 "See No Evil", Epsilon-6 "Village Idiots" and Mu-13 "Ghostbusters" was formed to handle the emergency. On October 31st, the JTF was deployed with approval from Foundation Tactical Command to contain the possible anomaly and investigate the church. Upon arrival to the church, the JTF noted lights coming from within the church, alongside humming as they approached. Once they entered, they were welcomed in by the missing churchgoers. The memetic effects of SCP-9537 had converted the members of the church into extreme anti-governmental communists, leading to the formation of a independent commune city-state within the church itself.</p>
<p>After recording all possible data from the commune, members from Eta-10 and Mu-13 started to navigate to the computer room. Upon arrival, they found that the room was heavily guarded, and were prevented from entering. A member of Eta-10 attempted to sneak into the room through a alternate door, but was detected upon entering, leading to the affected individuals attacking JTF members. The JTF quickly evacuated the church, and Epsilon-6 deployed a strong aerosilized tranquilizer, which rendered the members inside unconscious, and additional support in the form of Alpha-45 "The Janitors" to transport the unconscious individuals to Site-14-M for memetic decontamination and amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>SCP-9537 was contained after the initial deployment of the tranquilizer, and contained within a standard memetic hazard container and transported to Site-537 for further testing under Jack Horay after inital database entry and testing at Site-56.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> According to historical texts and a personal journal belonging to Poli, George William Poli was a secret royalist during the colonial period before the Boston Tea Party. In response to the growing revolutionary movement within Boston and the surrounding city, Poli began a political party known as the Crucible. The purpose of the Crucible, according to his journal, was to disorient and disrupt revolutionary movements within Boston by creatiing too many view points for the movements to handle. However, historical records at the time indicate that the Crucible went largely unoticed by revolutionary movements. That said, records also indicate the first infections of SCP-9537 around the same time.</p>
<p>While the exact nature of how Poli was integrated into SCP-9537 as -B, or how SCP-9537 was created, during the annual Memetic Conference, the parahistorian assigned to SCP-9537 gave a possible theory. It should be noted that this hasn't be proven.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 00:00</strong> Memetic Effects Specialist Jack Horay steps down from the stage as Parahistorian Lily Orman steps on.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 00:10</strong> Lily places a binder onto the pedistal on the stage and begins speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Orman:</strong> As you may have noticed SCP-9537 comes bundled with a spectral presence, or, in more relatable terms, a ghost. While the memeticists assigned to this anomaly have yet to discover what the point of -B is beyond memetics, I feel that it is still important to compile a historical record of -B's existence.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 00:30</strong> Lily switches to a slide of a painting of George William Poli.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Orman:</strong> For all intents and purposes, Poli was a hidden royalist inside of a soon-to-burst kettle pot of revolutionary ideals and actions, and was very angered with that fact. Because of this, he created the Crucible, a political party centered around creating and promoting so many ideas that, in his hopes, would confuse the revolutionary waters of Boston. However-.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 01:00</strong> Lily switches to a slide of a newspaper, the Boston Gazette, before it quickly zooms into a section dedicated to coverage of the Crucible. The section in the corner of the 4th page, and is only a paragraph long.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Orman:</strong> It should be clear that it wasn't an exactly popular party.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 01:17</strong> Chuckles come from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Orman:</strong> That isn't to say that the Crucible had no members during its lifetime. At a minimum, going off of the first possible manifestation of SCP-9537, 5 members. This would lead us to the obvious of question of, how was SCP-9537 created? While there are many possibilities, this is the one our team working on SCP-9537 is currently researching.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 01:35</strong> Lily switches to a slide of a artistic depiction of the Boston Tea Party.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Orman:</strong> Unlike what many of you may have heard about the Boston Tea Party, there was in fact one casualty of the event. George William Poli. How he died is, well, entirely unknown to us, and seemingly was unknown to people of that time, as no newspaper reported a orbituary, and no documents recovered regarding the Crucible discussed his death. It is his death that we think he became a part of SCP-9537. However, like many anomalies, we do not have a full picture. The questions of how -C manifests or how -A was created remain unknown, and will likely end up being the same as many anomalies. Unknown.</p>
<p><strong>TIME: 02:25</strong> Appalause comes from the audience as Lily Orman steps down from the stage and █████ ████ steps up to announce that the intermission has begun.</p>
