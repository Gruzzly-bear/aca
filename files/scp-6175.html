<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A research team belonging to MTF Gamma-55 ("Starmen") is currently embedded within NASA and tasked with gaining information and sending it to Site-300-12's Para-Astronomy Department. All extranormal radio signals and soundwaves originating from SCP-6175 are to be recorded, translated and stored within Site-300-12's database. All mentions regarding anomalous phenomena surrounding the <em>Voyager 1</em> spacecraft are to be tracked and deleted by Foundation Webcrawler FIRESTORM.aic.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6175 is the <em>Voyager 1</em> probe. Following an anomalous event on the 09/15/2022, SCP-6175 turned on an unauthorized and previously unknown video camera implanted to its disk, and gained contact with a NASA research team within the Marshall Spacial Flight Center, in Alabama, for the next 5 months. During the spanned amount of time, SCP-6175 underwent several anomalous phenomena.</p>
<p>See Addendum 6175.1 for additional information regarding the timeline of events.</p>

<p>The following addendum includes a timeline of events regarding SCP-6175's autonomous behavior and additional anomalous phenomena.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>09/15/2022 - 09/28/2022:</strong> <em>Voyager 1</em> begins broadcasting footage of Neptune while gaining contact with NASA researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> None.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>09/28/2022 - 09/30/2022:</strong> NASA researchers report contact loss with SCP-6175 for unknown reasons. Hypothesis regarding the impact of the <em>Voyager 1</em> probe with another object were brought up, although quickly discarded. Research team was successfully infiltrated by MTF Gamma-55.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SCP-6175's camera was reported to be shifting and vibrating prior to loss of contact. Following this event, SCP-6175 regained contact with the research team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>09/30/2022 - 10/22/2022:</strong> SCP-6175 is hypothesized to be teleported to an unknown location, believed to be the Boötes void, otherwise known as <a href="scp-3200.html">SCP-3200</a>. The object is reported to be rotating constantly. No soundwaves, celestial bodies or astros are recorded during said amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SCP-6175 was reported to be vibrating or shifting occasionally in an aggresive way for the following weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>3 superfluous logs removed for brevity.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>10/31/2022 - 11/01/2022:</strong> First contact between SCP-6175 and a foreign object within its proximity. Object reported to take the form of an antenna, similar to that of the <em>Voyager</em> diagram.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The antenna was reported to be mangled and deteriorated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>5 superfluous logs removed for brevity.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/01/2022 - 11/08/2O22:</strong> Second contact between SCP-6175 and another object, reported to be a paper note. Object was zoomed in by SCP-6175's camera in order to be identified. The following note read:</p>
<p>Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.</p>
<p>— <em>Stephen J. Pyne</em></p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The note remained floating for a week before vanishing. It was unable to deteriorate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/08/2022 - 11/28/2022:</strong> NASA computers reported radio signals originating from SCP-6175's satellite dish, which were identified to be morse code. The signals were translated into English, and the anomaly was reported to be the lyrics of "Space Oddity", by David Bowie.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> A loud hum of the song's instrumental was heard throughout the assigned NASA facility, followed by human footsteps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: red"><strong>7 superfluous logs removed for brevity.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>12/03/2022 - 12/31/2022:</strong> SCP-6175 is seen advancing on a straight line at high speeds, several parts of itself splitting and traveling faster than the anomaly. The separate parts follow SCP-6175 regardless of their status. SCP-6175 progressively emits a large amount of radio signals throughout the mentioned span of time, translated from morse code into the message from the note recollected last month.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The separate parts were reported to be deteriorated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>12/31/2022 - 01/14/2023:</strong> SCP-6175 stops, before broadcasting static for the following 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> None. Radio signals were sent to the research team, translated as human shouting and crying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>01/14/2023 - 02/12/2023:</strong> SCP-6175 makes contact once again with its research team. During this span of time, several paper notes with stars and planets inscribed into them began spawning around SCP-6175.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> One of the notes was said to have several drawings, with one doodle resembling three individuals, though one shorter than the others, inscribed into them. SCP-6175 sent several radio signals, similar to illegible human vocalizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the last log, no anomalous phenomena spawned within SCP-6175's proximity. The anomaly was then reclassified by the 6175-assigned team as neutralized.</p>

<div class="addendum">
<p>On the 02/04/2025, a few months prior to the end of the <em>Voyager 1</em>'s mission, several radio signals were sent to a NASA facility kept within Cape Canaveral. Most of the sent radio signals, proceeding from SCP-6175 itself, were illegible but able to be stored, with only one of them was translated and kept within the facility's database until discovery by MTF Gamma-55:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love you. And I always will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this event, the <em>Voyager 2</em> probe began sending meaningless radio signals to the NASA station at Cape Canaveral, before turning off once again<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-6175 later broadcasted the Boötes Void, before the <em>Voyager 2</em> satellite, therefore designated as SCP-6175-1, appeared within SCP-6175's surroundings.</p>
<p>Additionally, a radio signal proceeding from SCP-6175-1 was sent to the facility at Cape Canaveral:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love you too, dear. It's time to come back home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SCP-6175 reclassified to Euclid. Attempts to recover SCP-6175 and SCP-6175-1 are currently ongoing.</p>
