            <h1>SCP-6860</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6860</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: SCP-6860 is to be kept in a plastic display case on the desk of Junior Researcher Florian Iscariot, kept at Site-88. No watering, trimming or any other maintenance of the item is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6860 is a deceased bonsai tree, more specifically a Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) measuring 8 centimeters in height, kept in a container filled with dirt. SCP-6860’s first anomalous property manifests once a year and can potentially happen on any day that happens to have a full moon at its zenith. When this occurs, an event known as a 6860-Virent Lacrima event occurs, which causes the object to begin growing translucent yale blue petals measuring 1.5 meters in length and 2 meters in width over a period of 7 hours. Following those 7 hours or should the petals be brought further than 1.9 meters away from the object, the petals will completely disintegrate, leaving no traces of them behind.</p>
<p>Should a sapient being come into contact with those petals within that radius in addition to being within the allotted 7 hours, it will cause the second anomalous property to be triggered. Subjects will experience a memory from the perspective of deceased Foundation Junior Researcher Florian Iscariot. Beings experiencing these memories will be rendered unable to react to external stimuli whilst experiencing a memory, which can last from a range from 5 minutes to 3 hours from a subject’s point of view. However, outside viewers note that subjects typically come out of the state after 30 minutes. Whilst experiencing the memory from Junior Researcher Iscariot’s perspective, subjects are capable of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling anything that Research Iscariot does.</p>
<p>Those experiencing the effects also note that in addition to senses, it is possible to "hear" what the junior researcher is thinking, described as hearing him speak. It has been noted that it is currently not possible to move or influence the actions of Iscariot. The criteria for triggering the viewing of the memory is that a person or being coming into contact with the petal must have interacted with the Junior Researcher before. Should the criteria not be met, then no anomalous effect will occur upon contact with extracted petals.</p>
<p>Cataloged Below are Testing Logs during some recorded 6860-Virent-Lacrima events.</p>

<strong>Perceived Time/Actual Time:</strong> None / 5 Minutes<br/>
<strong>Subject Thoughts:</strong> The subject recorded no knowledge of who Iscariot was.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> D-27781 reported nothing to occur. A recorded hint of annoyance is noted following extraction.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Due to the anomalous effect not occurring, there is no aftermath to record.<br/>
<em>Note: It seems like people with no contact or knowledge of the existence of the researcher will not trigger the anomalous effect of the petals. I'll be sure to update the document so we dont waste time again. - Researcher Cyrus</em></p>
<p><strong>Test Date: 01/28/██</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject Name:</strong> D-10177<br/>
<strong>Subject Behavior After Incident:</strong> Subject behavior was more hostile towards Foundation staff.<br/>
<strong>Perceived Time/Actual Time:</strong> 2 minutes / 2 Minutes<br/>
<strong>Subject Thoughts:</strong> When questioned on Iscariot, D-10177 was hostile and vulgar, blaming the researcher for the loss of her right index finger.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> D-10177 reported seeing a memory from the researcher where when D-10177 was used in a test with SCP-███. Subject recalled how the thoughts of the researcher did his best to reassure the subject of his safety, right before the subject was maimed, resulting in the loss of the D-Class’s finger.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Subject ceased all hostility to Foundation staff.</p>
<p><strong>Test Date: 02/14/██</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject Name:</strong> Research Assistant Alex De Vries<br/>
<strong>Behavior After Incident:</strong> Subject was more withdrawn, tended to work longer hours, and tended to be trite when it came to conversations with the other staff. The subject tended to spend long periods in the room that houses SCP-6860.<br/>
<strong>Perceived Time/Actual Time:</strong> 10 Minutes<br/>
<strong>Subject Thoughts:</strong> Assistant De Vries noted that was fairly calm albeit very dull at times individual to them. Despite this, De Vries held them in high regard as they were the ones that helped them get settled once they began work at the Foundation. Subject expressed a want to personally spend more time with them in addition to wishing that Iscariot was still here.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> Research Assistant De Vries noted that the interaction took place in a break room 3 weeks after they had started work as a research assistant. They noted being able to taste the sandwich that Iscariot was eating. Iscariot approached De Vries, asking them how they were holding up so far with working at the site. They, De Vries, responded that they had been acclimating fairly well, and profusely thanked them for the assistance that Iscariot had provided. Iscariot chuckled and told them that it was nothing to fret about.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Subject noted to remain withdrawn from others, but ceased actions that would lead to further isolation from other staff.</p>
<p><strong>Test Date: 04/22/██</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject Name:</strong> Janitor Lorenzo Di Oricalo<br/>
<strong>Behavior After Tragedy:</strong> Nothing of interest was noted.<br/>
<strong>Perceived Duration/Actual Duration:</strong> 3 Minutes/3 Minutes<br/>
<strong>Subject Thoughts:</strong> Janitor Lorenzo described the junior researcher as a fairly messy person, but that he always made sure to somewhat clean up after himself.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> Di Oricalo was brought to the perspective of Iscariot, with him noticing that he was tending to a Bonsai Tree. Di Oricalo walked past the room, as he was cleaning the hallway outside. Due to the fact the door was open, Iscariot called out to the janitor by name, greeting him. Di Oricalco greeted him in return, before moving out of sight to continue cleaning the hallway.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Subject continued prior behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Test Date: 03/09/██</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject Name:</strong> Researcher Autumn Cyrus<br/>
<strong>Subject Behavior After Incident:</strong> Subject was noticeably more cordial and amicable to other staff. Before the incident involving Iscariot, the subject's conversations tended to have aspects of brevity to them and would actively avoid other staff.<br/>
<strong>Perceived Duration/Actual Duration:</strong> 1 Hour, 25 Minutes/8 Minutes<br/>
<strong>Subject Thoughts:</strong> Researcher Cyrus stated that the two could be described as friends.<br/>
She described Iscariot as a genuinely good person, a rarity within the Foundation.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> Researcher Cyrus described a game of chess being played with Iscariot, back when the two were research assistants. Being new to the game, Iscariot was described to have made several mistakes typical of beginners. The match lasted an hour, with Researcher Cyrus capturing most of Iscariot's chess pieces, resulting in Iscariot's loss. The Junior Researcher was noted to take the loss well, mentally vowing to beat them the next time they had enough time to play again.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Researcher continued prior mentioned behavior. No other behaviors were noted to have manifested.</p>
<p><strong>Test Date: 01/02/██</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject Name:</strong> Head Researcher Lucian Iscariot<br/>
<strong>Subject Behavior After Incident:</strong> Subject was noted as wishing to retire from the Foundation following the incident. However, the subject was noted to have a further increased rate of productivity as well as more leniency to lower-level staff.<br/>
<strong>Perceived Time/Actual Time:</strong> 29 minutes/20 minutes<br/>
Thoughts Before Contact: The subject recorded that Junoir Researcher Iscariot could be described as a bit of a slacker, but could be incredibly productive when required too. In addition to that, head Researcher Iscariot stated that Junior Researcher Iscariot was a little too trusting and naive for his own good. When asked about how he was handling the loss of his son, Iscariot curtly replied to focus on the task at hand.<br/>
<strong>Subject Report:</strong> Head Researcher Iscariot described witnessing the memory of lecturing Iscariot on the multiple errors on a document that the subject was writing for a newly discovered and researched SCP. Head Researcher Iscariot noticed the very clear lethargy present in Iscariot that he had failed to notice when they had met to discuss the quality of the article. The Junior Researcher was silent for most of the interaction, with the only thought the subject recorded that he regretted not taking time off to rest, instead choosing to write the article throughout the night instead of sleeping. Iscariot profusely apologized and promised to have a better-written document by the end of the day.<br/>
<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Following the experiment, Head Researcher Iscariot decided to withdraw his retirement request and instead requested to be put in charge of any further experiments with SCP-6860. The request has been approved.</p>

<br/>
<strong>Addendum 6860-001:</strong> SCP-6860 was discovered following Research Assistant De Vries experiencing a 6860-Virent Lacrima event when attempting to come into contact with some of the petals created by SCP-6860. SCP-6860 still happened to be stored in the room where Junior Researcher Iscariot worked in 2 and a half weeks following an incident resulting in the passing of Iscariot. Due to the circumstances, it was decided that SCP-6860 would be kept on the desk.
<p><strong>Addendum 6860-002:</strong> Following chemical analysis of the liquid stored within the petals, it was determined that the main identifiable chemicals and compounds were Lysozyme, Lactoferrin, Lipocalin, Lacritin, Immunoglobulins, and Acetylcholine.</p>

<p>Dear Florian,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It has been some time. For this, I apologize, as I have been caught up with research and work on your tree. It's a rather beautiful thing, that anomaly. On the day of the incident, it was all I had left of you at the time. I am forever grateful for it preserving your legacy, your memories, in that manner.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I know i wasn't the best father, always away due to my job at the Foundation, but you always understood, always smiling at me and saying that you were just happy to spend time with me and your mother. I would be strict on you, but it was to make you stronger for the career road you had chosen. You stated that you wanted to help keep the world in the bright light in a way that no other job in the world did just like I did. I apologize for the strictness and austerity i showed you while you were here, as I only wanted to make sure you were doing your absolute best.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Yet still, you held fast. Still, you showed kindness, and compassion in a place like the Foundation in such amounts that other employees were put off by your demeanor. You still showed some empathy to D Class with lesser offenses, you showed compassion to those you disagreed with. Showed warmth to the anomalies that felt nothing but the cold. Over time, it was accepted and happily welcomed in, acting as a reprieve from the darkness. I apologize for not reciprocating your kindness, and instead choosing to remain locked in the culture there was before your arrival.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Even after your departure, we still feel your warmth.<br/>
We still acknowledge your sacrifice. You've given a lot of us second chances on how we act and treat others.<br/>
We still remember you. Your contributions will not be forgotten, forever immortalized on those you helped.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
And I am so proud to have been able to call you my son, Florian. I am sorry I rarely told you such in your life. I will make sure, that as your father, others know of you too, making it so your memory will carry on in the light, so it will never fade in the dark.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Love,<br/>
Your Father, Lucian</p>
