<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All attempts to trap, destroy, or alter this anomaly have failed, either proven to be entirely inconsequential or have been consumed by the anomaly itself. It is impossible to transport the SCP to another location, and every attempt to slow progression has stalled.</p>
<div class="edited">
<div>
<p>Thus, the Foundation is still actively exploring other avenues to contain this anomaly and prevent a possible ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario.<sup>Edited</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="original">
<p>Originally: "Thus, it is recommended the Foundation ceases investigation into this anomaly to preserve funds and manpower."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If, for any reason, a Foundation agent is dispatched to the anomaly's location, they are under <strong>strict instructions</strong> not to enter the distorted area. Agents are advised to be cautious of the anomaly's exact entrance and to maintain a minimum of a 5m distance from their perception of the "beginning" of the SCP at all times. Expeditions into SCP-8175 are restricted to D-Class Personnel only.</p>
<div class="edited">
<div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8175 is an area near Kayenta, Arizona that is currently expanding<sup>Edited</sup>, and appears to distort space and time within itself, creating an apparent "Vanishing Point" from all visible angles.</p>
</div>
<div class="original">
<p>Originally stated to be "of ever-expanding size".</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To the human eye, the area appears as if it extends forever, but increased study has led Foundation staff to believe this distortion occurs around a single point, which has steadily grown to encompass more space. As more of the town is enveloped, the buildings fold inwards to create the appearance of a tunnel and to faciliate the "vanishing" effect.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:350px;"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8175/NorthPhoto"><img alt="NorthPhoto" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-8175/NorthPhoto/medium.jpg"/></a>
<div class="scp-image-caption">

</div>
</div>
<p>As one moves into the distorted space, the area seems to "fold" around them from their point of view, creating the illusion that they walk toward the horizon. However, the time they spend and distance increases exponentially the further they walk, though appearing normally to the person inside the anomaly. Walking for a few minutes will result in a several hour trek to return to the beginning. While able to move to their relative left and right, those who have entered the anomaly consistently report an endless, empty desert. They are able to walk in these directions, but they never seem to make any progress, remaining directly in front of the Vanishing Point.</p>
<p>Through extensive testing and experimentation, researchers have determined that the ratio of perceived seconds outside the anomaly to seconds inside steadily increases the further one moves toward the horizon. If one is motionless or moving back toward the entrance, the dilation is removed entirely, as communication is possible through radio technology only while subjects are stationary or actively returning to the beginning of the anomaly.</p>
<p>An emotional sensation has also been described upon entering the anomaly, subtly compelling those who have entered to continue forward until reaching the Vanishing Point. This sensation appears to grow stronger the further one ventures, but does not diminish upon returning from the anomaly itself.</p>
<div class="edited">
<div>
<p>Descriptions of the exact feeling, voice, or sensation tend to differ greatly upon separate accounts, but ultimately, all who enter the anomaly eventually succumb to the need to reach the Vanishing Point.<sup>Edited</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="original">
<p>Sentence has been cut to end after "accounts".</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Outside the space, the figure grows smaller and smaller until they eventually disappear at the perceived point in space. No one has ever returned after reaching this point, seemingly becoming lost within the anomaly. Video and audio surveillance technology remains fully operational, but the distortion of time makes communication difficult. Additionally, the Foundation is unsure how radio technology is able to operate through the warped space, and transmit sound waves without issue.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> In early 1931, two Foundation agents were dispatched to a neighborhood outside Kayenta, Arizona, after reports of a "space hole" to local authorities were intercepted, detailing a distorted area in space that showed the horizon far away from them. Both agents verified the existence of the hole, requesting further aid from the Foundation to contain its existence and the anomaly itself.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The first photo taken of the anomaly by Dr. Ethel Hollis on December 3rd, 1931.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the time, the hole was no more than 1 centimeter in diameter, and the space distorted inside it was barely visible. Even so, the neighborhood was swiftly evacuated, and every citizen was administered Class-G amnestics to ensure there would be no stray memory of this anomaly.</p>
<p>Site-111 was established several thousand meters away from SCP-8175, utilizing the foundation of several existing buildings in the town. Its primary purpose was to monitor and contain SCP-8175, but was known to house several other smaller-scale SCPs, all of which are now "trapped" within SCP-8175.</p>
<p>On specially-approved expeditions to recover important documents from within the site, these anomalies' continued existence was confirmed, as well their relative containment methods to continue to be a success. However, after consulting the O5 Council, it was determined that these anomalies be left inside Site-111, which is estimated to pass the Vanishing Point in early 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Update- 4/18/2022:</strong> Site-111 has passed the Vanishing Point. All anomalies previously observed in the facility are to be marked "neutralized".</p>

<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reporting Agent: Ethel Hollis</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Preparation:</em></span> SCP-8175 has expanded to the size of an average doorway (approximately 2m in height), and has thus been deemed prepared for expeditions utilizing D-Class Personnel by the O5 Council.</p>
<p>D-Class Personnel #2230 was equipped with a backpack containing: 1 mechanically powered flashlight, approximately 2 day's worth rations, and a camera to take photos of the inside of the anomaly. Level 5 Researcher Dr. Ethel Hollis monitored the expedition from the safety of Site-111's observatory.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Execution:</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The following is a transcript of the audio captured from D-Class Personnel #2230 and Dr. Ethel Hollis as they entered the anomaly for the first time.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Hello, #2230: can you hear me? Is the earpiece working?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> #2230? What does that…number mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Oh, right. My apologies- you said you preferred to be called…"Marvin", was it?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Marvin. Yeah. Definitely preferable.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Very well. Have you arrived at the, uh- gate yet?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> You said it was just past the diner, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p>(A bit of shuffling can be heard on the tape, as #2230 approaches the entrance to SCP-8175. Suddenly, they come to a stop.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Holy h- What in the- What is <em>that</em>?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> #22- Marvin. We explained all of this to you before you were dispatched-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Yeah, yeah, you said it was an "area that distorts the space inside". I don't know if that was- I mean, it's accurate, but-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Please just walk forward into the gateway.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I'm…not sure that I-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Marvin. I'm telling you this for your own good: walking through this is better than the alternative.</p>
<p>(A long pause. #2230 sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Fine, yeah. I get the deal.</p>
<p>(The sound of boots crunching against the sand relays for a few seconds, then comes to an sudden stop.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Okay, I'm-</p>
<p>(#2230 abruptly pauses.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Oh- Sorry, I, uh…I'm inside.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Are you experiencing any physical pain?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Do you remember my name?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Ethel Hollis.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> And the date?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> It's uh…August 27th, right?</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis sighs in relief.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Yes. It is. Marvin, is there <em>anything</em> you can report? What do you see around you? Is it the same?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I mean, it- It looks mostly the same, yeah. But when I look past the diner on my right…there's nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> What do you mean "nothing"?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Well, the diner's still there. But there was a road behind it, and houses, buildings in the distance. Now, it just- It's just a long, empty desert with this one road down the middle. It looks…fake.</p>
<p>(The sound of a pencil striking paper can be heard, as Dr. Hollis records their conversation.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Hm…Interesting. Anything else of note?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Uh…y-yeah. Is there- Did you send other people in here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> You are the first person to ever enter this anomaly. I can assure you of that.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> But there's…some sort of voice. Or there's- Yeah, there's voices. They're faint, but I can definitely hear them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> It's not close enough to hear. I can barely even tell they're there. Should I…</p>
<p>(#2230 trails off. A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Sorry. Do I have to keep moving forward?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Yes. Please continue walking forward, and report anything notable you see along the way. I'll be standing by.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> And…when can I stop?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> (Sigh) If nothing happens at all, you can return after 30 minutes. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I guess so.</p>
<p>(As #2230's boot can be heard striking the dirt, a slight scratching sound cuts through the tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Wh- Marvin? Hello? Are you- Are you still there?</p>
<p>(Silence.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> (Sigh) Ah, <em>shit.</em></p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis tries in vain to "fix" the radio she speaks into for 3 hours, but eventually gives up and takes a short rest on the nearby seating in the observatory. 4 more hours later, the radio crackles to life.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -ell is going on with you, Hollis? …HOLLIS!</p>
<p>(A loud thud can be heard, followed by rapid footsteps, as Dr. Hollis rushes back to the microphone.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Hello- Hello? Marvin? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> YES! Where the hell have you been?!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Oh, thank god. I've been waiting for you to respond for <em>seven hours</em>!</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Se- That's…not possible. I've only been walking for about 20 minutes. And I've been <em>trying</em> to talk to you the whole time! You weren't answering me! It's the <strong>least</strong> you could do-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, or…<em>anything.</em> I thought-</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis takes a deep breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I'm, uh- I want to get the hell out of here. That's how I'm feeling. This is all…too strange.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> What exactly is "strange"?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Those voices I told you about earlier! They're- They're louder now, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Can you make out what they're saying?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> It's- I don't really… (Clears throat) Listen, Hollis: I need to get out of here-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -What are they saying, Marvin?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Well, I think they're telling me to keep moving forward. They're…begging, almost. It's still really hard to make any of it out, but I- I don't know if-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Who is "they"? Can you make out their approximate age? Sex?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> It kinda sounds- I- I…don't know. But, I can't- I can't stay in here any longer, can I <em>please</em> come back now? It's been c-close enough to 30 minutes, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> For you, I suppose. Yes, you can leave. Please return to the base and I will examine you before you return to your containment area.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Oh, thank the <em>lord</em>. I can't bear to hear these-</p>
<p>(#2230 abruptly stops. A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Marvin? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Hollis…it's going to take me a <em>long time</em> to get back from all the way out here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Conclusion:</em></span> SCP-8175 appears to create a "false" reality inside itself, replicating what is near it to the best of its ability, but lacks authenticity. Consistently, it creates a single "road" or "path" that runs down the center of the anomaly until the Vanishing Point, presumably. It also seems to attempt to draw those inside toward the center, calling out in a supposed chorus of voices, though the reason is still currently unknown.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Additional Notes:</em></span> D-Class Personnel #2230 is to be placed back into confinement. I've confirmed that they are not a danger to any further Foundation activities. Please provide them with a special designation so that they may be re-used for further expedition, and put in a request for extended containment. -Hollis</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reporting Agent: Ethel Hollis</span></p>
<p><em>Preparation:</em> SCP-8175 has continued encompassing more of the town, completely enveloping the diner it appeared next to. Its approximate size is 15m in diameter, and appears to expand in every direction.</p>
<p>While other D-Class were used, D-Class Personnel #2230, due to special designation, has journeyed into SCP-8175 22 separate times, but has never come close to reaching the Vanishing Point. The hold that this anomaly has over them has grown significantly, as the subject describes the resultant voices as "constantly present" and, oftentimes, "overwhelming".</p>
<p>This expedition, they were outfitted with 12 months worth of rations (doubling the quantity from the previous trial), as well as a mechanical flashlight, tent for shelter, and camera.</p>
<p>Agent Takumi Nakano was assigned to accompany #2230 into the anomaly to ensure total collaboration, after #2230 exhibited extreme trepidation toward entering the anomaly again. He was oufitted with a ballistic vest and helmet, as well as a Colt Official Police service revolver for defense in case of any aggression.</p>
<p><em>Execution:</em> As Dr. Hollis sets up a camera at the front of SCP-8175 to consistently film the expedition, Agent Nakano drags D-Class Personnel #2230 to the base of the anomaly, despite a great deal of resistance. Junior Researcher Dr. Anthony DeMartin was assigned to observe and study proper protocol for handling D-Class Personnel, and for approaching 8175.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The following is an (abridged) transcript of the entire expedition.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>D-Class #2230:</strong> NO! You <em>can't</em>! You can't make me go in there! Send me back!!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Takumi Nakano:</strong> (Struggling with #2230) Ma'am, h- they're presenting a bit of a problem-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ethel Hollis:</strong> -They have for the past few expeditions. It's…something we're going to have to deal with. We've deemd them necessary for further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> R-Right, but-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -I understand how this must feel, but…please. Just follow our lead, alright?.</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> I will, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Thank you. Now, please escort #2230 into the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> WAIT! W-wait. Ethel, please-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Don't- …Please, don't call me that. It's "Dr. Hollis."</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> S-sorry. Dr. Hollis, I- I can't go in there again. Please…<em>Please</em>. I- I've spent <em>years</em> in there at this point, and it's- Those voices, they're- they're <strong>killing</strong> me. Every time I go in there, they get louder and louder, and- I can't- I can't do it anymore. I just- Just send someone in my place, I'm <strong>begging you.</strong></p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis turns away from #2230.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> I'm- (Deep breath) I'm afraid your experience is too valuable. Providing more information about the compulsion you're feeling might aid us in understanding this anomaly further. I'd urge you to cooperate with Agent Nakano for this expedition. I really don't want to have to- …Just, trust me, alright?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -I DON'T CARE! I- I need to go. I need to go to…No. Nonono. Not that, I can't- I can't face <strong>this</strong> anymore. They're…they're going to yell at me, and then I won't- I won't be able to-</p>
<p>(She turns back to face them.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -There's no one in there. We've told you this many times. What you're experiencing is unique to you. No one else has reported anything remotely like what you've heard, so it is not possible that any of these…sensations are remotely real. Besides, you don't have a choice. Maybe it would help to think of the…service you're providing hum-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -No, they said that there isn't- There's nothing that we can do! I've heard them talk around my- my cell! Don't you underst- Don't you get that? Please, I- This won't help. I can't help you, anymore, and you need to just- They- They're just going to get <em>louder</em>, and I can't…focus on anything. I can't <em>keep living</em> like this! Already, it's-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Can you tell me who they are yet? Can you identify the sex of these voices? Can you tell me <em>why</em> they're calling you forward? <strong>Anything at all</strong> about them?</p>
<p>(A long pause. #2230 looks down at the ground, avoiding Dr. Hollis's gaze.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I- I don't- It isn't that simple. I can't just- I can't show you how it feels. You'd need to go in, and you won't-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Well, then continued investigation <em>is</em> necessary. We've never reached the finish line, here. There's <em>so much</em> we still don't know, and…I apologize, but I cannot accept failure in this case.</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis leans in closer.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> And I must say, all this time in the anomaly has alleviated the aging process. Anthony, make a note: #2230 and I are of the same relative age, yet they appear approximately 5-10 years younger. It isn't just a <em>perception</em> of time that is altered inside 8175, it's time itself.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Taking notes) Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Listen, I- I know what you're trying to do here is…important. And I know- I know that you want to solve this or- or fix it, but you <em>can't</em>! You can't, and- and sending me back in there over and over, it won't help! What could you even learn that would help get rid of this thing?! Tell me! You- You said yourself you haven't learned anything <strong>at all</strong> in the last few tries!</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> I already told you: we are further examining this sensation that you've described. We're not sure, exactly, what it is we're looking for in…all of this. However, we understand that scientific experimentation is often about pursuing your goals, even though the means seem to be out of your reach.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> But I'm- I'm just…<strong>I'm so tired</strong>. I'm not fit for all this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Of course you're tired. You don't think I am? I'm <strong>exhausted</strong>. I'm sure everyone here is. But it doesn't mean we aren't fit for this. This is…It's epoch-making, what we're doing. And we need <em>you</em> for any of it to work.</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis nods to Agent Nakano, signalling them to begin the expedition. #2230 whimpers softly, as the agent escorts them into SCP-8175. #2230 begins muttering immediately upon entry.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> (Whispering) No. I didn't- I didn't want it to end like that…I'm so sorry. I'm so <em>so</em> sorry. Please just <strong>stop</strong>.</p>
<p>(Agent Nakano takes in his surroundings.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Hmph.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Make sure they don't present any problems.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> And try to remain focused on the task at hand. Is there anything distracting you? Perhaps calling to you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> There's- I think I can hear someone breathing in the distance? Or maybe they're…wheezing? I'm not sure. It's hard to make it out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> How can you hear breathing "in the distance"?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> I don't know, but it- It just seems like I'd need to keep moving forward to make…whatever it is sound clear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Well, lucky for you, that's your job, here. Just keep the ultimate goal in mind, alright? We need you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> to return from this expedition. It's <em>pertinent</em>. Please check in every 6 hours, as we discussed. I might not always be here, but Dr. DeMartin will man the radio when I need to rest. You'll always get a response.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Understood, ma'am. I won't let you down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> I appreciate it.</p>
<p>(A click can be heard, signaling the end of the radio call. Agent Nakano and D-Class #2230 walk forward in the anomaly for 8 months, 3 weeks, 6 days, and 14 hours before reaching the believed threshold for the Vanishing Point. Times between correspondences steadily increased, as predicted due to the dilation caused by 8175.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Hollis? You there?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Still here. Anything new to report?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Well, I- I think we've-</p>
<p>(D-Class Personnel #2230 falls to their knees, clutching the sides of their head, with tears streaming down their cheeks.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> NO! NO! Please, I- I thought we all could be together <strong>peacefully</strong>, I- I didn't- I didn't mean for- …Please, please <em>stop</em>, STOP saying that! Please!!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Sorry- I think we've reached the end, here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> D-…Did you not just hear them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Of course, but how do <em>you</em> know? This behavior is not uncommon for #2230.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> Well, you know that breathing I've been describing? It's uh…crying. Yeah that's- it's someone crying, and it sounds like they're right in front of me. Like if I take <em>one more step</em>, I'll bump right into them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Can you see who it is? Is there someone there?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> No, everything looks…the same. The dirt road is in front of me, and we could both keep walking, but-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -I- I thought it was over! I thought everything we had was <em>over</em>! They'd- They had taken everything from me! I couldn't- I couldn't just leave without <em>you</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> They just keep yelling. I've tried to calm them down, but it's been like this for the past day and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> #2230? Can you hear me? It's Dr. Hollis.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Shhhh….Shhh, it's okay, hon'. I'm going to see you soon. Real soon, I promise, okay? Just <em>please be quiet for now</em>. I need <strong>quiet</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> #2230, who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> I- I told you- I told you <em>not</em> to let me back in here! Now, they're…they're <em>yelling</em> at me, and I- I'm not- I can't do any of this anymore. It's- It's over for me. They know it's over for me…</p>
<p>(#2230 begins to stand up, attempting to take a step forward, but Agent Nakano catches them, tackling them back to the ground before they can make a move, pinning their arms behind their back.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> NO! NO!! I <em>need</em> to be with them! Please! PLEASE!! I can't- I can't be away from them anymore! NO!!! This is the only way they'll <strong>forgive me</strong>, <em>PLEASE</em>! Don't listen to her! She doesn't understand!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> What's going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> (Struggling with #2230) Not to- ugh- worry. I've contained them, ma'am. Should I administer an amnestic?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> (Sigh) Give it a try. It doesn't usually work. And bring them back as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> NO! It's not going to- Please! Please, just let me in there! You understand, you're in here with me! You have to, <em>please</em>!</p>
<p>(A long pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> …Y-Yeah. Will do.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> You're sure that won't be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> I'll be fine. It's just that they- That person…They sound like they need help, you know? What if that's someone you've already sent in here? And- And- And they're stuck there, forever? Maybe it could benefit all of us if I went and retrieved them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> No one has ever been to this location before. That crying isn't real. It's just as we told #2230. Focus on returning to us, your duty to the Foundation, the urgency of this investigation. I'm sure you can put those…sounds behind you. It's just noise, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Nakano:</strong> …Right. It'll- It won't affect me going forward.</p>
<p>…Now, <em>how long</em> will it take us to get back?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> Agent Nakano returned to the base of the anomaly with D-Class Personnel #2230, after another ≈9 months of travel. The hold that SCP-8175 has over #2230 has only increased, further decreasing their mental capacity and ability to obey basic orders. It appears that this sensation grows stronger the further one journeys into the anomaly, and only compounds on each subsequent expedition. There seems to be a personal connection between #2230 and the "voices", as they've described, but they remain silent on any detail about the identities of those who call to them. It is not known how the anomaly assesses what will successfully draw those inside further forward, but is uniquely capable of acquiring the necessary information the second one enters.</p>
<p>Though Agent Nakano administered a Class B amnestic to the subject to attempt to erase the final few days of the journey, the effect of the anomaly did not seem to diminish. #2230 continued screaming and pleading for part of the journey back, only willingly traveling forward after Nakano administered Class I amnestics. While #2230 still reported hearing voices pleading to them, they felt no emotional connection or drive to follow them while the amnestic lasted, though effects deteriorated quicker than anticipated. Mutliple doses were required, decreasing in efficiency each time they were administered. The Site Amnestics Division advised that this method of coercion was unsustainable going forward, and #2230 should not be given any further amnestics, as they pose a severe threat to the health of the subject's brain.</p>
<p><em>Additional Notes:</em> Agent Takumi Nakoto, after pyschological evaluation, was deemed unfit for future service due to residual effects of SCP-8175, and was permanently dismissed from the Foundation.</p>
<p>#2230 was placed back into confinement and prescribed 75mg of fluoxetine and 7mg of haloperidol per day, to attempt to counteract the effects of 8175. Dr. Ethel Hollis will continue regular psychological evaluation before further expeditions. Alternate D-Class Personnel should be used in the meantime.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much longer they'll be able to keep this up. They can't even sit still anymore. So many expeditions, and still…not much new information to show for all of our efforts. And all of this, it's becoming awfully taxing.</p>
<p>This thing, whatever it is, is creeping closer to the Site every day. This is <em>everything</em>. Not just to me, but to every one of us, here. It <strong>must</strong> be contained before it envelops this Site, this state…</p>
<p>I will request further funding from the O5 Council, and we will increase the number of weekly expeditions. I'm sure they'll be amenable; they've always understood. And if we devote enough effort, we can make sense of this, I'm sure of it. We just need more time. And we <strong>will not</strong> give in. -Hollis</p>

<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reporting Agent: Ethel Hollis</span></p>
<p><em>Preparation:</em> SCP-8175 has grown to approximately 2000 meters, though precise measurement now proves difficult.</p>
<p>D-Class Personnel #2230 was prevented from entering SCP-8175 for the previous 5 years, after concerns grew from their decreasing mental capacity. However, after prolonged medication and extensive psychological counseling by Dr. Ethel Hollis, D-Class Personnel #2230 was deemed fit to be sent into SCP-8175 once again, though other medical personnel advised against the use of any further amnestics.</p>
<p>They were outfitted with the same gear as previous successful expeditions to the Vanishing Point, as well as the newly designed "Signal Protocol Device" (SPD) to attempt to slow the growth or mitigate the effects of 8175. These devices were designed to be hammered into the ground, their small spike affixing them in place, to continually monitor conditions inside the anomaly without disturbance.</p>
<p><em>Execution:</em> As customary, a camera was positioned at the base of the anomaly by Level 5 Researcher Dr. Anthony DeMartin. #2230 willing walks to the anomaly, escorted by Agent Amelia Castrello, in case of any resistance, who has additionally undergone extensive preventive Cognitohazard training to prepare for SCP-8175.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The following is an (abridged) transcript of the entire expedition.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anthony DeMartin:</strong> Hello, #2230! How are we feeling today?</p>
<p>(#2230 stares down at the ground, unresponsive.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ethel Hollis:</strong> (Sigh) They're not going to answer you, Anthony. Give it up; it's pointless. This is the best we can get of them. Any of them, really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> But I wanted to-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Anthony.</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> (To Agent Amelia Castrello) Please escort the D-Class to the Vanishing Point of the anomaly. They shouldn't present you any problems.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> Understood, ma'am. Anything else I should expect?</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis breathes in, but cannot find the words she's looking for.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Uh, it- It should try and convince you to walk past the Vanishing Point. (Clears throat) The feeling is different for everyone, but it's important you follow our instructions to the letter.</p>
<p>(A short pause. Dr. DeMartin looks nervously between Dr. Hollis and Agent Castrello.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> Of course, sir.</p>
<p>(Agent Castrello escorts #2230 past the threshold into SCP-8175. #2230 breathes heavily, but does not utter a word.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> Oh, I- I…see what you meant. There's- I can smell something-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -We're not interested in what you experience. Just guide #2230 to the Vanishing Point and back. That's all we need from you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> Right. Apologies, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Uh- Out of curiosity: what is it that you smell?</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis audibly sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> It uh- It's really faint, but it- it smells good, I can tell you that much-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Enough. Please. Just…forward. I can't do these all day anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Castrello:</strong> Can do, ma'am.</p>
<p>(The pair begin traveling forward, continuing as scheduled for 9 months, 2 days, and 7 hours, placing the SPDs along the way at equidistant points. #2230 does not speak for the entirety of the expedition, also not participating in planting the devices, despite attempted coaxing from Agent Castrello. However, upon reaching the final threshold before the Vanishing Point, they voluntarily take the final SPD out of their pack.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Hey. Ethel?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -#2230? Wh- I told you never to call me that again. But thanks for checking in…finally.</p>
<p>(#2230 begins snickering.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Wow, I can- I can barely even he-hear you at all anymore. Heh…That's- It's not even my fault…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Because of 8175? How long have- Why are you even speaking now? You haven't said so much as a word to me or <em>anyone</em> in months.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Well, I- I don't really- Ugh- God, it's, uh- it's really hard for me to- to keep my thoughts straight. But I've- I've known you for a long…long, long time now. And you…<strong>you're just like me, aren't you?</strong></p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> …I'm what?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> You're sc-scared. -Of the truth. Just like I- I was. That's why you're- you're trying so hard to figure this all out. Th- That's why you- you <strong>used me</strong> like this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Don't try to read me. You don't know who I am, why I'm here. You've only seen me through iron bars. Conversely, I know <strong>everything</strong> about your life. Enough to know that we are <em>nothing</em> alike. You're repulsive-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -I know! I know, I know, I know. It look me a l-long time, but I <em>know</em>. And that's why…I <strong>see you</strong>, Ethel-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -I TOLD Y- I told you to <em>stop</em> calling me that. I can't- (Deep breath) It's not protocol.</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> Y-you're afraid of what this- this all means. And you- you want to pretend that- that all of it- it's all under control. <em>Your</em> control. So you- you take advantage of what you can. What- what's…easy. Like me. Just like I- I did with Marie and, oh God…everyone I knew.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -People who get into this line of work don't have fear. They can't. We thoroughly vet-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -But- But everyone does! You can't- You can't just cover it up and say it's dead. It's never <strong>gone.</strong> It's just lying! And I- I did that too, until…all of this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> M- No. You're wrong-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> -Uh, ma'am. Maybe you'd like me to take over-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Don't. What are you saying, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> It uh- Heheh…It doesn't even matter, anymore. I don't even really- And y- you've already realized this. You know- you <em>know</em> it! But you can't- you won't admit it. And I c- I can't convince you of <em>anything</em>, I guess. I guess I can't! Learned that- Haha! Learned that the hard way…And you won't. You won't unless someone pushes you in. And I <em>can't</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> You're- You're full of shit. I'm- This is <em>everything</em> to me, and I have <strong>every confidence</strong> we'll pull through. Because there's nothing else-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -Wow, y- you sound…You don't sound real.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> Oh please, half of what you're saying makes no sense. You can't even string together a coherent thought! I'm not listening to what-</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> -I- I know that you'll understand. You already do, maybe. You don't- Heh…You don't have any choice at all.</p>
<p>(They chuckle to themselves.)</p>
<p><strong>#2230:</strong> You don't have any choices left.</p>
<p>(Inside the anomaly, #2230 turns and plunges the SPD into Agent Castrello's neck, catching her off guard and immediately knocking her to the ground. #2230 immediately scrambles off of Agent Castrello's body, covered in blood, toward the Vanishing Point.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> MARVIN!</p>
<p>(After two final steps, D-Class Personnel #2230 vanishes into the distance, their audio device immediately cutting out with a sharp popping sound.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> MARVIN? MARV- SHIT!</p>
<p>(Dr. Hollis rips out her earpiece and throws it to the ground, slumping down at her desk, placing both hands over her face. Dr. DeMartin stares into the anomaly, dumbfounded. After a long moment of silence, Dr. DeMartin turns to Dr. Hollis.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> It's…alright. We'll reset. We'll find someone new, and we'll just- we'll go again. Are the devices transmitting anything?</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> …No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Hm…It could be because they didn't place the final device. After the next expedition, we'll be able to-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hollis:</strong> -Just…turn the damn camera off. I'm done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> We will need to select alternate D-Class Personnel for further expeditions. Young, preferably. It's beneficial if we have a consistent sensation to draw information from. -DeMartin</p>
<p><em>Additional Notes:</em> Dr. Hollis has appointed me to oversee this anomaly going forward. She assures me that she will be taking on a more provisional role in the site. Rest assured: we will still figure this out together. With enough effort, we can overcome anything. She taught me that. -DeMartin</p>

<p><em>Preparation:</em> D-Class Personnel #7553 was equipped with a pack filled with a mechanical flashlight, materials for constructing a tent, 10 months' worth of rations, and the redesigned SPD device, which can now simply be fastened via strong adhesive. They were selected based on their unique experiences inside the anomaly, having journeyed in (at short distances) several separate times, and willingly explaining the phenomena to Foundation staff upon return.</p>
<p>Agent Severino Báez was additionally dispatched to help carry supplies and monitor the personnel's behavior.</p>
<p><em>Execution:</em> Agent Báez successfully guided #7553 to the Vanishing Point for the first time, to which the subject instantly fell to their knees, sobbing. Agent Báez described them as being "awestruck" at what was in front of them, crying tears of (perceived) joy, but the agent themselves did not claim to hear, see, or feel any pull toward the anomaly themself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The following is an interview with D-Class Personnel #7553 immediately following the expedition.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>(Agent Severino Báez drags D-Class Personnel #7553 out of the anomaly, fighting against their resistance and pleading. They pin them to the ground, cuffing their legs and hands together to prevent them from travelling back into 8175.)</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> NO! YOU HAVE TO LET ME BACK IN THERE! HE- HE WANTS ME IN THERE! HE DOES! PLEASE!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> They've been like this the whole way back, sir. It was a struggle to even get them to walk a few steps. I apologize for the delay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anthony DeMartin:</strong> It's quite alright. We expected a great deal of resistance without the use of any amnestics…But they complied when you threatened their life?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> Yes, sir. As you predicted.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Still just absolutely <em>fascinating</em>…</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin walks over to #7553, crouching down in front of them. He smiles, congenially.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Hi, #7553. How're we feeling?</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> Doctor, I- Please. <em>Please</em> let me back in there. He's- He's there waiting for me. He <em>needs me</em> to join him. I think he might even be <strong>in trouble</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Slow down, slow down. Everything's alright. 8175 won't take you-</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> Nononono, it's not- This isn't part of any of this! My <em>Dad</em> is in there-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> We told you ahead of time: you might hear, feel, smell, or see things that try to compel you to-</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> -NO! It was <strong>real</strong>! HE was there! He <em>was</em>- …Oh my- Oh my god. You don't believe me…</p>
<p>(#7553 begins to tear up, struggling against their restraints.)</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> You don't even believe me, and he's <em>stuck</em> in there! I- I can't be out here anymore! I need to be with him! He wants me in there! I'm <em>supposed</em> to be in there!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> You're really afraid of dying out here, huh? But you want to just…walk forward to the end in there? That makes sense to you? Even if you might die?</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> It'd make sense to you if you ever went in there! You can come! You can come too! Just step inside! And we won't- we won't die! I promise! Please, you- you don't need to do any of this anymore! I know- I know- You have a job to do. You swore to- I don't know, the- the- the government, a business- I don't really get any of this, but I do <em>know</em> you'd understand me if you just went in there! You'd understand!! And you already know that, but you won't- You won't just take the st-</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin quickly stands up, towering over them.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> -That's enough. You don't understand anything about what we're doing here. This? All of this is- This is what humanity <em>runs on</em>. You wouldn't even be kneeling there grovelling if you didn't-</p>
<p>(He abruptly stops, composing himself, and taking a deep breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Apologies. That was…That won't happen again. I do, however, have further questions for you: How would you characterize your relationship with your father growing up? Was it…antagonistic? Distant?</p>
<p>(Tears stream down #7553's face.)</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> I can't- I can't even- Everywhere I look, I see his silhouette, his <strong>hand</strong>- his hand is reaching out to me…I feel like- He's right there! He's <em>right there</em>, but every time I go toward him, he- God, he just- …It's <strong>unbearable</strong> to be out here, without him. I can't do this anymore- I can't feel that <em>sting</em>-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> -Answer my question, please, or we will escort you back to the premises.</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> I- I will if you let me back inside. Once- Once I'm in there…I'll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Absolutely not. We need your unique experience with this anomaly in the future. Allowing you to walk to the Vanishing Point is a non-starter-</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> No- Please, you- You need this! You <strong>have</strong> to let me back in there!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Take them back to containment.</p>
<p>(Agent Báez picks #7553 off the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>#7553:</strong> NO! NO, YOU- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT! PLEASE! LET ME- I WON'T WALK PAST IT! I WON'T!! I PROMISE, BUT- BUT PLEASE LET ME IN THERE AGAIN! YOU HAVE TO! I KNOW YOU HEAR ME! PLEASE!!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> God, <em>enough</em>…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Shit…Too far gone. (Sigh) Well, find me a different one to use. This one didn't yield the results I'd hoped. But rest assured: the expedition tomorrow with proceed as scheduled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> Agent Báez will continue on as permanent Head of Security for Site-111. D-Class Personnel #7553 will be dismissed from Site-111's purview. New personnel must be requested. Let's start fresh. -DeMartin</p>
<p><em>Additional Notes:</em> A new assistant is necessary for these expeditions. Someone needs to learn how to run this, just in case. -DeMartin</p>

<p><strong>To:</strong> Site-111 General Staff<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Dr. Ethel Hollis<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> An Admission…and Farewell</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>My Fellow Site-111 Colleagues,</em></p>
<p>I tried. I have tried for so long. But you all deserve to know that there's nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>I came to this facility to control the uncontrollable. To preserve what I believed to be the "natural state of things", some sense of normalcy for those who rely on it. But there is no natural state. There is no normalcy. We are at the mercy of the universe, and we always have been. I now understand that it isn't destiny or fate that created us.</p>
<p><em>It was pure blind luck.</em> To attribute anything more to that is, I see now, utterly foolish.</p>
<p>I may not have much time left. Or rather- none of us might, and I believe we should all spend our remaining days living the lives we've always wished. For me, that means some relaxing time on a beautiful beach, after purging all that I've seen here from my memories, allowing my thoughts to finally drift along with the waves- not that I have earned any of it.</p>
<p>I've sacrificed countless lives. None of them innocent, but none of them deserving. All in the pursuit of knowing the unknowable, obtaining some sense of…purpose, I suppose. I thought myself special…worthy of rising above my station as a fatuous cog in an infinitely-developing machine. But none of us are or have ever been worthy of that. We've only ever been lucky to be a part of it.</p>
<p>This Foundation is, and has always been, wholly pointless. There is no purpose to be found here. This site will be gone in a matter of decades, the rest of them in a matter of centuries, and the struggle to retain them will have all been in vain, ruining countless moments of happiness for hundreds of thousands of people. I know better than anyone, and I can't imagine how many others there are on this hunk of rock we profess is our home, just like this one…waiting to take away everything we thought was so commonplace, so <em>earned</em>.</p>
<p><strong>But it was all, simply, an elaborate farce, destined to be upheld by those deceived, in a desperate grasp to reign in an animal that will never stop its rampaging.</strong></p>
<p>I'm afraid I've grown weary of that fight. So I bid farewell to all of you.</p>
<p>And I beg of you: prioritize your own happiness. It's all we can do.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8175.C: Request For Dissemination</strong><sup>Edited</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="original">
<p>This addendum has been removed from the final document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="text-align:center">
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Request for Dissemination</span></h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Reporting Agent</strong>: [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Request</strong>: This anomaly cannot be contained. Any attempt to do so is entirely futile. This <em>entire file</em> is futile. The Foundation has wasted countless amounts of money to continue the elaborate coverup necessary for an SCP that will only become increasingly more difficult to keep hidden.</p>
<p>But it shouldn't <em>be</em> hidden in the first place. Everyone, not just those with Level 5 clearance, not even limited to those within the Foundation: <em>Every single human</em> deserves to have all information necessary to make informed choices about their future, to be able to choose how they face each day, and decide what they will prioritize. This "chaos" that the Foundation fears is inevitable. It can't be prevented, only postponed. And the hold on other anomalies grows weaker as the elaborate lie is upheld, especially on hopeless endeavors into this anomaly, begging for understanding.</p>
<p>There isn't enough money or time that could be devoted to understand SCP-8175. This is simply an obstacle than cannot be overcome, and it is vitally important for this Foundation to understand and accept that fact. The longer this is covered up, the longer it is hidden from the public, the less time those people will have to decide what is most important to them, how to spend their remaining days…what they love more than anything. And they will despise those who kept it from them. <em>Be sure of that.</em></p>
<p>It is for all these reasons that I implore the O5 Council allows the information in this file to be disseminated throughout every major channel available, or, at the barest minimum, throughout every researcher currently employed by the Foundation.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>The status of the request is <strong>DENIED</strong>. There will be no appeal process. All further requests for dissemination of this anomaly are suspended.</span></h2>

<p><strong>Addendum 8175.D: Internal Site-111 Memo from Dr. Anthony DeMartin on March 21st, 1960</strong></p>
<div class="email">
<div class="tofrom">
<p><strong>To:</strong> Site-111 General Staff<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Dr. Anthony DeMartin<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> No Giving In</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><em>Site-111 Staff,</em></p>
<p>I understand that a certain memo has made the rounds in the Site, and some of you have developed reservations toward your position within this Foundation. So, I'm writing to inform you: this message is <em>inconsequential</em>.</p>
<p>Dr. Hollis was a valued member of our workface, and provided this Site many benefits we continue to enjoy today, but unfortunately, suffered greatly from extended exposure to SCP-8175, possibly defying Council orders by entering the anomaly herself, ultimately forcing her to retire. As long as you do not follow the same course of action, your perseverance will not be deterred, I assure you.</p>
<p>Though we will mourn her departure, this will not overcome us. We simply need to hold our attention strictly on the goal. There is <em>nothing</em> this Foundation could have accomplished without the will and the ambition of our devoted staff thus far. Had our predecessors given in, we would not even have the choices we relish now. And, if we wish to hold onto anything that is dear to us, we must not relinquish our drive to learn, to overcome. If we give in to fear, <em>no one will be able to choose what's most important.</em></p>
<p>Control, or the lack thereof, is a myth, designed to keep those without the wherewithal separate from those who are capable and keen enough to affect change. Those who cannot withstand the trials that accompany the endeavor fall by the wayside. It's up to the rest of us to continue to be pioneers.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can't accomplish. Together.</p>
<div style="text-align:right">
<p><em>With Confidence,</em><br/>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed</strong>: D-Class Personnel #4505</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Dr. Anthony DeMartin</p>
<p><strong>Foreword</strong>: The subject, hereby referred to as D-Class Personnel #4505, was caught surveilling Foundation activities concerning SCP-8175 from a nearby town, which had already been evacuated. Upon discovery, they went willingly with Foundation agents into custody, professing no desire to intrude or disrupt proceedings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>(D-Class Personnel #4505 sits impatiently in their confinement area, their foot tapping loudly against the concrete floor. The latch on the door can be hard unhooking, the lead door then swinging open, squeaking slightly against the concrete.)</p>
<p>(#4505 freezes as Dr. Anthony DeMartin enters, holding a metal folding chair. He sets it up directly in front of #4505 and sits down gingerly. He then smiles warmly, pulling out a clipboard and clicking a pen.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anthony DeMartin:</strong> Hello, ma'am. I'm sorry we forced you to wait in here. Are you comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I'm…alright.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Do you- Do you recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I do, but I, um…I'm not exactly sure why. I don't think we've met before, have we?</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Uh, no. No, we haven't.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Listen: I don't want any trouble. I was just- There's something <em>outrageous</em> going on here, right? I can almost <em>feel</em> it, and I just had this…drive in me to follow that sensation, to study it. But I see now that, uh…</p>
<p>(#4505 looks around their containment area, which contains a window to the main grounds of the Site.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> You lot clearly have that all covered. So I'll just go, yeah? I don't even know why I came all this way in the first place.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin studies their expression, searching in their eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I think you do know. And I think…you wanted to figure it out.</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Clears throat, sniffles) Uh- Is there anything that perhaps drew you to our location? A sound or…particular sight?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Why do you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Well, it's the whole reason we're here. You too, I'm guessing.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Uh, well…yeah. It's peculiar, I- I can't remember when it all started. But for the past 5 years or so, there's been this longing, deep in my gut. It's not a sound, really, just the- the <em>slightest</em> feeling of being right on the precipice of finding the solution to it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr.DeMartin:</strong> I'm- I'm sorry, the answer? The answer to what?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> (Scoffs) I don't even know. Everything? Anything? But it's like that- it's like when you finally figure out how to solve a complex math equation after a lot of thought, and a good night's rest. You have the- the pieces you need all put together in your head. Now, all that's left is to move forward, and solve for the right answer.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> "Move forward"…So, that drove you all the way here? Arizona?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Believe me: it felt just as random and out of place to me, as well. But day after day I sat there, attempting to relax, but just could not steer my thoughts away from this tiny nagging in the back of my head.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> So there was no actual sound? This was all just in your head?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> And what you saw outside- did that image appear in your head at all?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> What- that odd-looking gate out there? No, I <strong>definitely</strong> had never seen that before.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin clicks his pen once again, putting his clipboard to the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Okay. I understand. That'll be all for today, ma'am.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin stands up, walking toward the door.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Wait, you're keeping me here? Why? I answered all your questions, I- I'll just go, now. You don't have to worry.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> You could go, but I have a funny feeling you wouldn't stay away. Besides…I think you could be extremely helpful to us.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin turns back to #4505.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Chuckle) And, quite honestly, it's- (Sigh) It's just <em>really</em> nice to have you back. Let us know if there's any way we can make you more comfortable.</p>
<p>(Smiling sincerely, he shuts and locks the door behind him, as he exits for the night.)</p>

<p><strong><em>Interview Log 8175.64.12 from Level 5 Researcher Anthony DeMartin on May 29th, 1964</em></strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed</strong>: D-Class Personnel #4505</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Dr. Anthony DeMartin</p>
<p><strong>Foreword</strong>: After extensively describing every bit of knowledge they possessed regarding the effects of SCP-8175, D-Class Personnel #4505 expressed interest in participating in expeditions. Following discussion between Dr. DeMartin and other psychological counselors, it was determined that #4505's unique sensation could be beneficial in understanding and potentially containing SCP-8175.</p>
<p>They were not given any special equipment to place, and were simply told to journey into the anomaly for five hours, then return to the Site. #4505 expressed discomfort at turning around, but was able to be convinced, and eventually returned to their containment area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>(D-Class Personnel #4505 stands, staring at the door, waiting for Dr. DeMartin to enter. The latch unlocks with a loud click, as he opens the door and steps in eagerly.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anthony DeMartin:</strong> Hello, ma'am. Good to see you again!</p>
<p>(The creak of the metal folding chair can be heard as Dr. DeMartin places it opposite #4505's bed.)</p>
<p><strong>D-Class Personnel #4505:</strong> Doctor, I- I could've kept going. You should've let me keep walking!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I understand, but we didn't want the effects to overwhelm you. You know th- …We've made mistakes in the past, that's all.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> But I can figure this out! I can! I can feel it, just beyond that threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Feel what, exactly? Has this pull you've described, maybe, deepened?</p>
<p>(#4505 sits down, dejected.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> It's not a pull. It's <em>not.</em> It's- It's really there. The answer to all of this. I can figure it out, Anthony. I <strong>can!</strong></p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> <strong>Anthony?</strong> How did y- I never told you…Do you know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> What? Who- Oh, that just popped out. I just- I'm comprehending more and more, <em>learning</em> information I never could've known, and if you let me walk further, I would've been able to figure all of it out!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Right. Of course. And, um- Why do you want to "figure this out" so badly?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I don't really know. But there's this- This feeling telling me there's something more here, it- it's <em>epoch-making</em>. I just know that…this is where I need to be. I can't just ignore something like this.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin sits opposite #4505.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Neither can I, ma'am. (Clears throat) So you're telling me that the further you go, the more you understand?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Precisely, yes! Goodness, you're a fast one.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin chuckles a bit, his smile then quickly fading.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Right, um- But do you feel unsettled, perhaps? If you don't go back into SC- the anomaly, will you be able to rest? Get a good night's sleep?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I mean, I don't think we should wait much longer. It's expanding, you know. About a centimeter every hour.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> You can tell how fast it's growing?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I <em>told you</em> to let me keep walking forward! I could've gotten even more than that from this expedition!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Well, I- I apologize. Next time, we will certainly allow you to journey further. But we'll take a few days' rest for now. I don't want to overload you with work-</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> -I said I'm fine. I can go back in now, if you're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I know you can, but we can't be too careful here. I want you to be able to work with us for a- well, a very long time, ma'am, if you're willing. Until, perhaps, we can figure this out…<em>together.</em></p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> You know, it's strange, but I- I just have this feeling that we will. And one day, we'll both be able to understand.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin smiles broadly.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> You have <strong>no idea</strong> how happy I am to hear you say that.</p>
<p>(He stands up, heading for the door to their chamber.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Tomorrow, we have some technical training for you to do. Get you ba- um…up to speed. But for now, just rest. You've earned it, ma'am.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin knocks on the door, signalling the guards to unlock the latch.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Have I earned a salary? I've got medical bills to pay for, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Chuckles) Well, we can discuss that tomorrow, as well,</p>
<p>Goodnight, ma'am.</p>
<p>(The door opens, as Dr. DeMartin exits for the night.)</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Dr. Anthony DeMartin</p>
<p><strong>Foreword</strong>: D-Class Personnel #4505, after voluntarily travelling into SCP-8175 over 20 separate times, has developed a hostile attitude toward Foundation staff. They refuse to enter the anomaly again, unless they're permitted to cross the Vanishing Point.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>(D-Class Personnel #4505 stands, staring at the door, waiting for Dr. DeMartin to enter. The latch unlocks as he pushes it open, stepping inside impatiently, greeting #4505 with an affable smile. #4505 does not move or respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anthony DeMartin:</strong> Hello, ma'am. Good to see you again. It's been a few days, so I'd like to-</p>
<p><strong>D-Class Personnel #4505:</strong> -Let me back in there. Now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Sigh) Yes, I- I was told that you've been giving Agent Báez a few problems after the past few expeditions. But I'm here to hopefully-</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> -He won't- He won't let me in!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Well, you're very valuable to us, here. Any further on your last trip and you would've walked past the threshold-</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> -I don't give a shit! I <strong>need</strong> to figure this out. Just a few more steps…a few more steps and I'll get it <em>all</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I…understand. But taking those steps would prevent you from providing that information for the rest of the Foundation. To me. You don't want that anymore? What about- What about Anthony?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> He- He'd want me to- to find the answer. That's- That's all we wanted: the answer, and- and it doesn't matter what we do to get it! He knew that! With the- …thethe- The D-Class, they-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Now, calm down, ma'am. Everything's alright. You're safe.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Nonono, you don't <strong>get it</strong>! No one is! No one's safe! Not until I can get in there and decipher this! Please, I know- I know you, and- I know you want to figure this out too! And- we can! We're finally there, after all these years of trying!</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin elicits a small gasp.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> …"All these years"?</p>
<p>(He steps toward them.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> E- Ethel? Do you- …Do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I don't- I don't know <em>you</em>, but I feel- I've always felt what you mean to me, I think. I can- I can tell that- that the answer will help you, just as much as me, that- that just beyond that door, there's…<em>peace</em> for us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Then, if you know who I am, you have to understand why I cannot allow you to walk into 8175. You're…indispensable. Without you, there isn't anything left for us, here.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> But, you aren't <em>sure</em> I won't come back from there. You don't know! Even I don't know! And I- I can sense that I'll be able to understand everything, so <em>why not</em>? Why not let me through?! I'd come back! I would!</p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Sigh) I really want to believe you, but no one <em>ever does</em>. I can't risk that. Not with you.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I could be different, right? Right?! You said- you said that I have a "unique experience", m- maybe that means it works differently than it does for the others! Please, <em>please</em>, I- I'm sorry, but I can't be out here, anymore. I <strong>need</strong> to make sense of this! It's- It's all I can think about, anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> But that's no different than before, right? This is…all we ever <em>wanted</em> to think about. And we have this chance to- to start over, you know? To keep working until we solve this- <em>from the outside</em>. Ethel, it's been- God, it's been such a gift having you back. Please don't- don't give up on all of this, now. Not now-</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> -It's not that! It's not giving up! That's not-</p>
<p>(#4505 groans in frustration, slumping down onto their bed and gripping their hair with their hands.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> No one who's- who's walked in there has <em>ever</em> given up. They just- They just recognized the- the futility of it all!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> What "futility"?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> Of this! <strong>All</strong> of this! What you're doing, what I- what I did…<em>God</em>, I- I can almost remember, but it's still- it's locked behind <strong>there!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> There's nothing in there, E-</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> -Yes, there is! I'm telling you there is! Why won't you- Please, you have to- you have to believe me! <strong>Please!</strong> There's nothing more for us to- to <em>do</em> here!</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin crouches down to meet their eye level.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I do believe you, okay? I do. But I'm struggling to- to fully grasp it all, like you can. I need you to help me here, okay? I need you to stay here and <strong>help me</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> No. Nono. I can't help you anymore, u- unless I can go back in. Just <em>please</em> let me in there. I need to be with- I need to know what this is! I need to solve this for him!</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin sighs. A long pause, as he looks directly into their eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> Ma'am…Look at me. I- I need you to listen to me: I've been trying to- to keep going without you, but I just- I'm <em>scared</em>, Ethel. I am fucking <strong>terrified</strong>. And I- I <em>need you</em>. Is that what you need to hear? I <strong>need</strong> you back with me. Working with me. You promised me- You <em>promised</em> we would figure this all out together. You always reassured me of that. You took- You took me from <strong>nothing</strong> and gave me everything I could've ever wanted. Gave me hope. And then you just…<em>abandoned me</em>!</p>
<p>(#4505 remains silent. Tears begin to drip down Dr. DeMartin's cheek.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> I know that- that you're starting to remember how things used to be between us, the incredible work you did here at the Site, and I just- I really want to believe that you'll be back. We- We were <em>so close</em> to having you back. And I know that this is really difficult, but I feel like this could be a gift. For- for both of us. This could be the <strong>best thing that ever could have happened.</strong> So, can't you just- Can't you just keep going? For me? Just so- Just so we can deal with all of this together? So I don't have to- So I'm not <em>alone</em>. Can you please do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I- …</p>
<p>(A short pause. #4505 begins tearing up, as well.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> I'm s- I'm sorry, Anthony. But there's nothing left for me here anymore. Or- Or you. Or <em>anyone</em>. And you can't- you can't just distract yourself from that by u-using me. And you can't keep <em>me</em> from it, either. You can't. All you can do is embrace it: that's it. There's no other choices here.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin sinks his head down, tears pouring down his face.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> No. This- This can't be you. Please, Ethel. You were always…blazing ahead, no matter what you saw or what you felt, no matter if <em>anyone</em> was trying to dissuade you. <strong>You were unstoppable.</strong> I know that woman is still in there, still fighting to work things out. That person who- who <em>needs</em> to help others. Who can help <em>me</em>- You can't just turn away from that, can you? That's <strong>you.</strong></p>
<p>(A short pause.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> But I'm not. I'm not. Because…there's nothing to turn from. Only something to turn towards, and if you just let me back inside there, I can- I can help you- I really think I can. <strong>Please.</strong> I'll do anything. There's just…nothing left for me out here.</p>
<p>(Dr. DeMartin lets out a sigh, as he stands up, turning to leave the containment chamber.)</p>
<p><strong>#4505:</strong> No! …NO! Please, I have to go in there! Anthony! ANTHONY! Please!!</p>
<p>(He shuts his eyes, blocking out #4505's screams as best he can, refusing to turn and face her. Exiting the chamber, Dr. DeMartin speaks to the attending agent: Severino Báez, who has been monitoring the entire interview.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Wiping away tears) Can we- Can we give her something? Start over, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> I don't think so, sir. With the effect of 8175, wouldn't it just be the same? They'd still feel-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> -But there's- There has to be some type of amnestic we could use. Something that just- It removes the-</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> -<em>And</em> I should remind you that the Site Amnestics Division reported that future use could be dangerous for, well, what's left of their mind. I'm- I think this is the end of the line for them.</p>
<p>(A long pause. Dr. DeMartin looks back toward #4505.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Báez:</strong> Sir?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. DeMartin:</strong> (Deep breath) Alright, then. Let's- …Let's send her to the beach.</p>
