<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Above: Blueprints devised by Area-882 staff, depicting some of SCP-7882's currently-understood internal mechanisms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its sheer size and the likelihood that it will eventually autonomously relocate itself (thus causing a breach of containment), forcible relocation of SCP-7882, and thus any physical containment of the object within a Foundation facility, has been deemed infeasible.</p>
<p>Consequently, Provisional Research Outpost-7882 has been established at the site of the anomaly in Thousand Islands Regency, Jakarta, Indonesia for purposes of establishing constant surveillance and enabling exploration inside SCP-7882. Monitoring of SCP-7882 for any internal changes and predictive efforts focused on analyzing the potential path of any migrations it may take in the future have been assigned to Area-882's "ANVIL" General Intelligence System, which has been remotely connected to a terminal in Outpost-7882.</p>
<p>There currently exists <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">[DATA EXPUNGED]</span> no method to permanently forestall SCP-7882's movement during migration events, nor prevent future migration events entirely, without damaging the object. As physical containment is not currently a concern, this does not warrant reclassification to Apollyon; however, such a method must be devised before SCP-7882 undergoes its next migration event (currently predicted to occur in the year 2211 AD).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7882 is a giant mechanical apparatus of poorly-understood anomalous function, currently stationed on a small island off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia. The object is encased by a spheroidal bronze shell measuring approximately 655 x 390 x 405 meters. This casing is ornately carved with glyphs in the Linear B script<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and additionally decorated with vaguely humanoid figures, some with wings, in red paint<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-7882 exhibits extremely high inertial resistance to thaumaturgy and ontokinesis, and has thusfar proven impossible to move while in a dormant state.</p>
<div class="image-hover-enlarge scp-image-block block-right" data-feature="image-feature" style="max-width:300px;"><img alt="1Ec8Sq0.png" class="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/1Ec8Sq0.png"/><br/>
<div class="scp-image-caption show">Above: A blueprint assembled by Area-882 personnel depicting SCP-7882's engine and propeller system (top), and a visualization of SCP-7882-1's clock (bottom).</div>
</div>
<p>While in an active state, SCP-7882 is capable of autonomous movement over extremely long distances both in terrestrial environments<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and underwater. Over a period of time spanning at least the past 2500 years, records indicate the object has independently circumnavigated the Indian and Pacific oceans several times before landing at its current location, successfully leading itself to dry land each time. It appears to enter an active state of motion every 199 years, based on records of past activity, before becoming dormant again upon reaching its destination<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The majority of mechanisms that make up SCP-7882 itself appear to serve one of two functions: either to enable the autonomous movement of the object<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, or to preserve and sustain SCP-7882-1. SCP-7882-1 is the central apparatus within SCP-7882; an elaborate clockwork device comprising a mechanical calendar of presumed astrological and cosmological importance. SCP-7882-1's other main component is a large analog clock built into the main surface of SCP-7882-1, the turning of which acts as impetus for the motion of several kinetic mechanisms of the aforementioned calendar device through an intricate system of clockworks and strings.</p>
<p>SCP-7882-1 appears to be constantly counting down to an event in the future (hereafter ████-Ω, which is believed to also represent the beginning of the next cycle on the Mekhanite Long Count calendar system; see below excerpts) and seems able to accurately predict the time of this event's occurring<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> through hypothesized thaumatological mechanisms.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Above: An ordered sequence of timekeeping glyphs as found on the inverse of SCP-7882-1, likely meant to express the amount of time remaining until ████-Ω at the time SCP-7882 was constructed.</div>
</div>
<p>Though an exact date cannot be ascertained, it is theorized that, should SCP-7882-1 continue to count towards the occurrence of ████-Ω at its current trend<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, the calendar will reach completion by the mid-late 22nd century.</p>
<p>The internal casing of SCP-7882 possesses a number of inscriptions in Attic Greek — unlike the Linear B on the object's outer surface, this text can be meaningfully translated into English as an account of various events. Below is a brief collection of excerpts from the writing inside SCP-7882, selected as the most essential to understand as contextual material by Area-882 personnel<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>.</p>

</div>
<p>Given context from these inscriptions and the mechanisms comprising SCP-7882 which have thusfar been identified, the following can be concluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>As corroborated by various dating methods, SCP-7882 is believed to be a preservation vessel constructed during the Mekhanite Amoni period, likely in the city-state of Amoni itself.</li>
<li>████-Ω represents a profound and possibly apocalyptic thaumaturgic event on Earth, determined at least partially by its location in outer space via astrological methods.</li>
<li>SCP-7882 was built specifically to preserve SCP-7882-1 and globally propagate the information contained therein, as to ensure the existence of an accurate clock able to foretell the time of ████-Ω's occurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Prior to discovery by the Foundation, SCP-7882 had already embarked upon several so-called "migration events", repeatedly cycling between long-range travel in an active state and returning to dormancy in a passive state at its new destination. Provided below is a timeline meant to brief personnel on the historical context of the object.</p>

</table>
<p>In analyzing the data surrounding all known SCP-7882 migration events, a significant commonality arises. Namely, on seemingly every occasion, the object lands at an inhabited site — frequently harboring native tribes which are as of yet relatively uncontacted — and is discovered and explored by the locals, immediately seeming to become a significant cultural object upon discovery.</p>
<p>A persistent trend amongst all cultures contacted by SCP-7882 is the unnaturally quick tendency to create a collectively-held religious and mythological narrative around the anomaly, with the complete formation of these beliefs and conversion of the local population to them sometimes taking only a few years or less. In these cases, SCP-7882 itself is often featured as an object of worship, source of revelation, or holy shrine, and ████-Ω is commonly interpreted as a forthcoming eschatological event or other great shift of spiritual paradigm. In these cases, individuals in the exposed group tend to exhibit a significant degree of religious fervor with regards to the belief system synthesized upon contact with SCP-7882.</p>
<p>Though this cannot be definitely ascertained, this appears to suggest the object possesses an additional anomalous property: namely, some form of memetic influence or compulsion which enables it to be anomalously successful at propagating its message<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> through the medium of myth and religious imagery and ritual.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned trend — which is, as previously mentioned, in common throughout all known SCP-7882 migration events and their respective aftermaths — it seems that SCP-7882 deliberately seeks out inhabited and relatively isolated areas as destinations, likely to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prolong some variation of Broken God religion by "spreading" its contained prophecies to new civilizations and cultural groups.</li>
<li>Inform said groups of ████-Ω in some way.</li>
</ol>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident Designation:</strong> Migration 7882-3</p>
<p><strong>Landing Location:</strong> Taveuni, Fiji, Melanesia</p>
<p><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Native islanders.</p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Activity:</strong> <em>Serpentidraco monocapitus</em> (one-headed basilisks) begin to appear on Taveuni and nearby islands. Locals gain anomalous augmentation technology which is used to biomechanically alter these organisms into a variety of forms. Modified organisms appear to be worshipped as religious idols of some kind, with omens being interpreted based on when they lay their eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Appears to be a synthesis of Archonic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> faiths with Melanesian and Austronesian traditions. Degei, the supreme serpent-like god of native Fijian myth, appears to be recharacterized as a fusion between the Broken God and the Demiurge Važjuma. Creation myth bears similarity to the creation attested to in the Mekhanite mythology, with the aforementioned creator deity producing two "cosmic eggs" which birth the primal and logical aspects of human nature respectively<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup>. SCP-7882 is believed to be the egg of logical nature, which adherents believe is currently reforming to usher in a golden age of human civilization upon hatching again. This so-called "Second Hatching" appears to represent ████-Ω.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident Designation:</strong> Migration 7882-4</p>
<p><strong>Landing Location:</strong> Utheemu, Maldives</p>
<p><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Native Hindu islanders.</p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Activity:</strong> Karmic manipulation technology and advances in pre-death afterlife travel experience a significant spike around the time of SCP-7882's landing. It has been proposed that this advancement was derived or extrapolated from texts and carvings contained within SCP-7882, however this remains unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Contacted civilization creates a largely Mekhanite-Hindu syncretic belief system. The "Aioun" precession mentioned in carvings within SCP-7882 is equated to the Hindu Yuga cycle, of which ████-Ω is said to represent the upcoming end of the ongoing Kali Yuga. Adherents believe in the assimilation of the <em>Ātman</em> (self) into <em>Brahman</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> via transhumanism and bodily mechanical augmentation. Recent findings suggest this augmentation may also have been seen as a method to achieve <em>Nirvana</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident Designation:</strong> Migration 7882-7</p>
<p><strong>Landing Location:</strong> Paracel Archipelago, South China Sea; sank into the sea shortly after landing due to shifting of islands from volcanic activity.</p>
<p><strong>Discovered by:</strong> A civilization of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-cn-985" target="_blank">sapient nurse sharks</a> (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>), after sinking underwater.</p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Activity:</strong> Contacted entities begin to etch replications of SCP-7882-1's calendar wheel into the seafloor, presumably using their tails and fins. These act as improvised thaumaturgic circles capable of channeling gravitational distortion properties. Said symbols are still used by the entities to aid in hunting and agriculture to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Religious system seems inspired by a combination of ancient Chinese cosmology and the history of First Occult War-era Mekhanite city-states. Oral tradition of the contacted civilization claims there once existed an above-water "Builder" civilization of technologically-advanced selachians living across the Aegean coast and islands in the ancient past, who worshipped an entity similar to the Broken God and created various mechanical marvels before being banished underwater by an "envious and spiteful" coalition of human states.</p>
<p>SCP-7882 is thought to be a gift given to the shark population by said precursor civilization, created using their advanced technology. ████-Ω is believed to be an upcoming "day of reckoning" in which "we (sharks) will finally ascend to the surface world and forever break free from (the) shackles of human oppression"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-15" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Native islanders.</p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Activity:</strong> Hostile, semi-corporeal aquatic entities largely matching the description of Adaro<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup> begin to manifest around the area of Makira island<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-17" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')">17</a></sup>. These entities display carnomantic thaumatological capability and acute technophobia for unknown reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Mythological narrative revolves around a divine figure believed to be adapted from Warohunugamwanehaora, a heroic character of Melanesian folklore. Described as a cunning explorer and pioneer, he is said to have placed the stars in the sky using a great hammer so that sailors may use them to navigate. Myth places this figure as the victim of attempted murder several times by his envious brothers, whom he ultimately defeats by dropping boulders down from the branches of an incredibly tall tree.</p>
<p>The trunk of this tree is often said to ascend into Heaven. When he reaches the top, Warohunugamwanehaora is struck down for trying to circumnavigate the planes of existence themselves, losing an arm and a rib in the process, and is forced to live as a mortal on Earth.</p>
<p>SCP-7882 is supposedly a vessel constructed by Warohunugamwanehaora as a means to sail through the sky and be able to visit Heaven again; a place he had longed for since being exiled from its gates and forced to walk the land. The object is said to have fallen onto the island of Makira from the sky, implying it was abandoned midway through the voyage. Adherents were to act as custodians of SCP-7882, looking after it should Warohunugamwanehaora ever fall down to Earth again — the date of this return was thought to be ████-Ω, until SCP-7882 departed from Makira to undergo its eleventh migration event.</p>

<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Area had previously been converted to Islam by Arabian traders at some point in the 10th century. Upon exposure to SCP-7882, a sect emerges syncretizing the monotheistic God with Mekhane/WAN. Adherents venerate a number of prophets including several ancient Mekhanite religious figures in addition to the traditional series of abrahamic prophets recognized in Islam, seemingly as part of the same unified prophetic succession. Starkly contrasting most other Broken God religions, use of technology and artificial devices to represent or worship God is considered an attempt to physically represent the divine and forbidden. Mechanical artifacts typical in other Mekhanite and pseudo-Mekhanite societies, such as bodily augmentations, are deemed idols and destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:</strong> Locals create a highly ritualistic doomsday cult known as the "Final Masquerade".
