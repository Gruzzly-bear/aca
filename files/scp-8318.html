<p><strong>Item #</strong>: SCP-8318</p>
<p><strong>Object Class</strong>: Keter</p>
<p><strong>Threat Level</strong>: Orange (Obscure/Hostile Potential)</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: The geographical area encompassing SCP-8318 (designated Zone-8318) has been classified as a restricted cultural heritage site under Foundation front company ████████████. All civilian access is barred under the pretense of environmental protection and indigenous rights preservation.</p>
<p>A perimeter radius of 3 km is monitored via motion-sensitive drones and EMF detectors. Foundation personnel stationed at Site-███ must not attempt to activate SCP-8318 under any circumstance without Ethics Committee authorization.</p>
<p>All experiments involving biological materials on SCP-8318 have been suspended indefinitely following Incident 8318-A.</p>
<p>Due to SCP-8318's passive activation mechanism and its lethality to unrelated civilians, total containment is prioritized over study. Unauthorized interaction may result in immediate disciplinary action or termination. SCP-8318 is currently classified as a high-risk parabiological and memetic hazard pending further analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: SCP-8318 refers to a cluster of four geographically separated hills (designated SCP-8318-A through SCP-8318-D) located in [REDACTED], near the former site of the ███████ tribe in ███████ Africa.</p>
<p>When four distinct anatomical sections (cranial, thoracic, abdominal, and upper femoral) of a once-living organism are placed individually at the summits of each SCP-8318 location, the organism will spontaneously reconstruct and reanimate approximately 5–12 hours later.</p>
<p>Reanimated specimens (designated SCP-8318-R) demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic biological functions (breathing, standing, limited eye movement)</li>
<li>Complete absence of voluntary behavior or stimulus response</li>
<li>Eventual biological death within 3–7 days</li>
</ul>
<p>Each activation of SCP-8318 consistently leads to the deaths of four individuals, spatially distributed across distinct locations within a 2–5 km radius. Autopsies reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acute necrosis and internal decay concentrated in head, chest, abdomen, and femoral regions</li>
<li>No common preexisting conditions</li>
<li>Deaths occur within the same time frame as the reanimation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discovery Log</strong>: SCP-8318 was discovered following the declassification of a private research journal authored by Dr. T. Kamau, a Kenyan anthropologist active in the 1980s–1990s. The journal was recovered by his granddaughter, Dr. Miriam Kamau (a Foundation-affiliated cultural analyst), who submitted the materials for analysis under anomalous folklore protocol FOLK-13.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A photo included in the journal depicted a goat bearing four distinct markings standing intact at the edge of a hill. Subsequent forensic data matched the animal to one reportedly sacrificed earlier that day.</p>
<p>Cross-reference with local health records confirmed the simultaneous death of four villagers, each displaying regionalized tissue failure corresponding to the anatomical sections used in the ritual. No other cases of comparable pathological presentation were identified that year, underscoring the singular nature of the event.</p>
<p>The journal also referenced an artifact described as a fragmented black stone engraved with four unknown glyphs previously held by the tribal elders. The artifact was reportedly shown to Dr. Kamau under strict secrecy and was believed by locals to be sacred. Following the incident, the artifact could not be located, and is currently classified as missing. Retrieval is considered Priority-Level 3, with investigation assigned to Mobile Task Force Mu-98 (“Myth Chasers”).</p>
<p><strong>Personal Note by Dr. Miriam Kamau</strong>: “My grandfather spent years chasing this myth, not out of arrogance, but guilt. I think he blamed himself until the day he died. Some parts of the journal feel like hallucinations, others too detailed to be false.”</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8318.1 - Recovered Journal Excerpt (Dr. T. Kamau)</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>17 Februari 1985</strong><br/>
<em>Nilirudi katika kijiji cha █████ leo, baada ya siku nne za safari kutoka ███████. Jumuiya hii haipo kwenye hati zozote za kikoloni au utafiti wa kihistoria ninaoujua. Lugha yao ina mizizi na Kinubian, lakini kuna athari za zamani. Hii inaweza kuwa nafasi pekee ya kurekodi historia yao kabla ya kutoweka kabisa.</em><br/>
(I returned to the village of █████ today, after four days of travel from ███████. This community is absent from any colonial documents or historical research I know of. Their language shares roots with Nubian, but there are older traces. This might be the only chance to record their history before it disappears entirely.)</p>
<p><strong>12 Agosti 1986</strong><br/>
<em>Tangu mwezi uliopita, nimefanikiwa kuleta daktari kutoka ██████ mara mbili. Watoto walikuwa na homa ya matumbo na wazee walikuwa na shinikizo la damu lisilotibiwa. Kiongozi wa kijiji alisema kwa mara ya kwanza watu wake wameweza kupata msaada bila hofu ya kudhalilishwa au kuchukuliwa.</em><br/>
(Since last month, I managed to bring a doctor from ██████ twice. Children had typhoid, and the elders had untreated hypertension. The village leader said it’s the first time his people have received help without fear of humiliation or being taken away.)</p>
<p><strong>3 Januari 1988</strong><br/>
<em>Leo walinifungulia chumba cha zamani karibu na mti wa tambuu. Ndani, kulikuwa na sanduku lililokuwa limefungwa kwa ngozi na kamba za zamani. Sikuuliza kilichomo - waliniambia, ‘Bado hujawa tayari.’ Lakini nilihisi, kwa mara ya kwanza, kwamba wanaona mimi si mgeni tena.</em><br/>
(Today they unlocked an old room near the tambuu tree. Inside was a box sealed with hide and old ropes. I didn’t ask what was inside - they told me, ‘You are not ready yet.’ But for the first time, I felt they no longer saw me as a stranger.)</p>
<p><strong>28 Machi 1989</strong><br/>
<em>Nimevutiwa na jamii hii, si kwa sababu ya hadithi zao, bali kwa sababu ya ujuzi wao wa kipekee wa kihistoria. Lugha yao ina maneno ambayo hayapatikani kwenye familia yoyote ya lugha niliyoisoma. Kuna uwezekano mkubwa kuwa jamii hii ni mojawapo ya vizazi vya mwisho vya ustaarabu usiotambuliwa.</em><br/>
(I'm fascinated by this community, not because of their stories, but because of their unique historical knowledge. Their language contains terms not found in any linguistic family I've studied. There’s a strong possibility that this tribe is one of the last descendants of an undocumented civilization.)</p>
<p><strong>03 Aprili 1990</strong><br/>
<em>Watoto wawili wamekufa wiki hii. Malaria, walisema. Lakini hilo halielezi jinsi macho yao yalivyokuwa na hofu hata walipolala.</em><br/>
(Two children died this week. Malaria, they said. But that doesn't explain the fear in their eyes, even in sleep.)</p>
<p><em>Mwana wa Omari alikuwa mjanja sana. Alipenda kuniuliza kuhusu dunia ya nje. Siku moja aliniambia angekuwa daktari ili asaidie kijiji.</em><br/>
(Omari’s son was so clever. He liked asking me about the world beyond. One day, he said he wanted to be a doctor and help the village.)</p>
<p><em>Lakini sikuweza kumsaidia. Nilijua hatari ya maji machafu, lakini sikuwa nimefanya chochote hadi sasa. Labda nimezoea kuwa mtafiti zaidi ya kuwa binadamu.</em><br/>
(But I couldn’t help him. I knew the danger of the dirty water, but I hadn’t done anything until now. Maybe I’ve grown too used to being a researcher instead of a human.)</p>
<p><strong>12 Mei 1990</strong><br/>
<em>Tumeanza kuchimba mfereji mdogo kutoka mto mdogo kuelekea kijiji. Inachukua muda, lakini watu wanafurahia. Nimeandika barua kwa daktari ambaye nilikutana naye mjini ███████████ - yuko tayari kuja mara moja kwa mwezi.</em><br/>
(We’ve begun digging a small trench from the nearby stream to the village. It’s slow work, but the people are excited. I’ve written to a doctor I met in ███████████ - he’s willing to visit once a month.)</p>
<p><strong>17 Desemba 1990</strong><br/>
<em>Nimefanikiwa kuratibu mpango wa afya ya msingi kwa kijiji. Daktari kutoka Afrika ██████ sasa huja mara moja kwa mwezi. Tumefanikisha pia kuweka bomba la maji kutoka mto ulio karibu. Watu wameanza kuniita "rafiki wa jamii."</em><br/>
(I've managed to coordinate a basic health initiative for the village. A doctor from █████ Africa now visits once a month. We've also installed a pipeline from the nearby river. The people have begun calling me "a friend of the community.”)</p>
<p><strong>03 Juni 1991</strong><br/>
<em>Kichwa wa kijiji amenipa nafasi ya kuona kile walichokiita jiwe la miujiza. Lilikuwa limevunjika vipande vinne. Alisema maneno yaliyokuwemo kwenye jiwe hilo ni siri ya zamani, hurithiwa tu kwa viongozi.</em><br/>
(The village elder gave me a chance to see what they called the miracle stone. It was broken into four pieces. He said the words carved on it are an ancient secret, passed only between leaders.)</p>
<p><em>Alionekana kuwa na hofu hata kuzungumza juu ya hadithi hiyo. Nilihisi si hadithi ya kawaida. Labda ni fumbo. Au onyo.</em><br/>
(He looked afraid even to speak of the legend. I felt it wasn’t just a story. Maybe a riddle. Or a warning.)</p>
<p><strong>20 Desemba 1993</strong><br/>
<em>Nimeanza kuamini kuwa kuna ukweli ndani ya hadithi hii. Majina ya milima minne yaliyochorwa kwenye jiwe yanafanana na sauti zinazopatikana katika lugha ya jamii hii - lakini hakuna anayekumbuka milima hiyo iko wapi. Nitajaribu kutafuta.</em><br/>
(I'm starting to believe there's some truth to this story. The names of the four mountains carved on the stone resemble sounds found in the language of this community - but no one remembers where the mountains are. I'll try to find out.)</p>
<p><strong>12 Juli 1997</strong></p>
<p><em>Mbuzi huyo hakusogea hata kidogo. Alisimama pale vile vile, kama sanamu. Lakini niliona kifua chake kikiongezeka na kupungua - alikuwa akipumua.</em><br/>
(That goat didn’t move an inch. It stood there like a statue. But I could see its chest rise and fall - it was breathing.)</p>
<p><em>Nilijaribu kumkaribia usiku uliopita. Macho yake yalikuwa matupu - sio tu kama mnyama aliyekufa, bali kama hakuwahi kuishi.</em><br/>
(I tried to approach it last night. Its eyes were empty - not like a dead animal, but as if it had never lived.)</p>
<p><em>Asubuhi hii nilirudi kijijini. Watu wanne walikufa usingizini. Kila mmoja alikuwa na uozo kwenye sehemu tofauti: kichwa, kifua, tumbo, na paja.</em><br/>
(This morning I returned to the village. Four people had died in their sleep. Each had rot in a different part: the head, chest, stomach, and thigh.)</p>
<p><em>Najua kilichosababisha. Najua.</em><br/>
(I know what caused it. I know.)</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8318.2</strong>: Experiment Log SCP-8318.2 (01/09/2005)</p>
<p>Test Materials: One (1) SCP-8318-R ( <em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em> - goat), euthanized, dissected into four anatomical sections matching SCP-8318 pattern.</p>
<p>Procedure: Each part placed on summit of SCP-8318-A through SCP-8318-D, over 1.5 hours.</p>
<p>Outcome: Goat reassembled and found standing 10 hours later on the summit of SCP-8318-D, unresponsive to stimuli. No Foundation personel stationed near SCP-8318-D reported witnessing the transport or reappearance of any goat remains, suggesting the reassembly occurred instantaneously or outside human perception. Expired 6 days later.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, 4 civilian deaths reported in the nearby villages of ███████, █████, and ███████. Autopsy results: localized necrosis matching dismembered regions.</p>
<p>Result: Ethics Committee has prohibited further experimentation. This event has been formally designated as Incident 8318-A.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>To:</strong> Site Director, Site-███<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Ethics Committee Oversight Cell<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Moratorium on Further Biological Testing Involving SCP-8318<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 04/09/2005<br/>
<br/>
Following the outcome of Experiment Log SCP-8318.2 and the resulting civilian casualties, the Ethics Committee has unanimously voted to suspend all further experimentation involving SCP-8318 indefinitely.<br/>
<br/>
The lack of predictability in SCP-8318's activation and its lethal collateral effects on uninvolved civilians represent a gross ethical violation under Protocol-7B (“Unintended Civilian Harm”). No additional testing, dismemberment procedures, or biological interactions are to occur without express approval from the O5 Council.<br/>
<br/>
Continued observation of SCP-8318 is authorized, but all activity must prioritize non-interference. Local mythos should be treated as containment-relevant intelligence and not provocation for further rituals.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this memorandum binding and final.<br/>
<br/>
- Ethics Committee, ████████████</p>
