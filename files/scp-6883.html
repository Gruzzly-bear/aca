<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-6883 refers to the spontaneous transfiguration of human individuals, generally workers and salary people, into human-sized entities resembling the American cockroach (<em>Periplaneta americana</em>). It is mainly localized to 12 cities in the Czech Republic, particularly in Prague.</p>
<p>The primary victims of SCP-6883, designated SCP-6883-1, are individuals who suffer from moderate or severe depression, are overworked, and have experienced burnout episodes. Another common trait is that they have histories of failures, as well as traumatic events.</p>
<p>SCP-6883 manifestations primarily occur at nighttime, when the victims have entered deep sleep. After approximately two hours of deep sleep, a cocoon will rapidly wrap around the subject, demanifesting after the individual wakes up, now a fully-turned SCP-6883-1 instance. Once converted, the individual will experience limited mobility and cognitive dissonance, although their sanity notably remains at a baseline level over long observation periods. Attempts to break the cocoons have unilaterally ended in failure. Noospheric, memetic, and psychological techniques are similarly ineffective in communicating with the victim.</p>
<p>Interviews indicate that the dreams of SCP-6883-1 instances mainly occur from the first-person point of view and consist of crawling through a variety of landscapes, greeneries, and empty fields with intensified feelings of euphoria.</p>
<p>Many instances have often described a Baroque-style castle overgrown with trees, referred to as SCP-6883-2. It is described as featuring towers composed of documents, papers, and office supplies. Notably, Foundation personnel report that this castle evoked strong nostalgia and longing. Upon entering SCP-6883-2, the subjects report experiencing a feeling of lightheadedness, which is followed by cessation of sleep.</p>
<p>They also report seeing SCP-6883-3, often described as 'building-sized piles of scrap and blocks' composed of foliage, machines, and several greeneries, that can assemble into a man'. SCP-6883-1 instances often express mild hostility upon discussion of SCP-6883-3, calling it an affront to their happiness. In reality, SCP-6883-3 refers to the 43,500 metric tons of metallic and organic blocks currently stored in Site-345, near the Alpine Mountains delineating Italy and Austria.</p>

<p>Analysis indicates that SCP-6883 is connected with GoI-503 (<a href="scp-5631.html">"Aviatica"</a>)<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">An anomalous journalistic organization focused on publicity stunts and large-scale social change.</span>, which in turn links back to the Administrator, a former reporter and journalist. As Aviatica is decentralized and composed of journalistic cells led by an officer called an Arch-editor, as well as its dealings with the anomalous world, regular contact with its constituents has been difficult to fully establish, although delegations are sent to entertain Aviatica's offers. Aviatica primarily compensates for its insufficient manpower and physical scope via the use of avian drones, robotics, software, and information-based deals.</p>
<p>Due to Aviatica's connections with several high-profile news outlets and anomalous groups, the Foundation currently pursues a cordial working relationship with it as a source of information in the anomalous and occult in exchange for secrecy, protecting journalists and providing potential scoops. Meanwhile, both GoIs are receptive to inculcating each other's members.</p>
<p>The Administrator has approximately 10 years of service under Aviatica, before moving to the Foundation as an Agent. They have been involved in the highly classified EVNT-ALPINE-01, an Aviatican expedition to the Western parts of the Alpine Mountains to investigate an anomaly connected to SCP-6883, as well as a failed peace treaty involving several anomalous entities such as the <strong><span style="color: green">life-givers of the forest.</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Good morning, Thirteenth Overseer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> to you gregor</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> It's nice seeing you nice and lively as always, Overseer. but the most pressing matter right now is your condition. A lot of people outside have become the same as you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> We were hoping you could help us out by sharing your feelings right now, your thoughts… anything you want to say could contribute to understanding this anomaly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i woke up and i was by the bed</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> under the bed</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i didn't really understand at first i didn't really react</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i laid there</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> when you're in this position you don't really think anything is going to happen to you</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i was at [REDACTED DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS] you know how the rooms are and the wallpaper</p>
<p><em>No communication for a hundred and twenty seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Is everything alright, Overseer? Do you feel like stopping here and maybe picking the interview up from where we left off another time?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i'm here i want to go on</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it's the wallpaper</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i feel fine however it was the disorientation that was killing me at first</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you have woken up on the floor looking at the ceiling but you have never felt like this</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the enormous room and the minuscule you</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the ceiling looking like it's kilometers away</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it's simply different</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> we all turned overnight both in the site and the town it's in</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> in the morning the scuttling was deafening</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i felt it vibrating through me not heard it</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you know why</p>
<p><em>No communication for a hundred seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Overseer, could you tell us anything about the consequences of your… newfound physical limitations?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i didn't move until the task force found me</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i was on my back</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> and now i don't move that much</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i can't interact with my surroundings</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> there's no real reason to move i'm faster but everything is so extremely far</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the alpha1 agent assigned to me provides me with what i need</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> maybe it's a vicious cycle</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you're going to say i am digressing</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i can't feel my limbs and my wings feel heavy very useless</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i can't hear sounds and the only thing i can smell is raw meat and shit</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> there's a kaleidoscopic filter to my vision</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> positive thing is cockroaches can't really hyperventilate</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> physically i mean</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i'm trying to adapt but it's going to take me a while</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> is that enough</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Yes, Thirteen, that is perfect. How has your work been coming along? Have you delegated one of your people to carry out some tasks in your stead?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> couldn't be elsewhere</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> one of our problems here was almost solved already</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> despite what some others think <a href="http://scp-cs.wikidot.com/">scp cs</a> is strong enough to handle itself</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> their help has been invaluable so far</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> they don't need our supervision not to the current degree at least</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> What anyone other than yourself thinks is irrelevant, Thirteen. Let's drop this line of questioning, shall we? What about dreams? How has your sleep been?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> back to the regularly scheduled sterility</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i've slept dreamless sleeps every night save yesterday and the night i turned</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> don't feel particularly rested in the mornings but nothing out of the ordinary</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> That is not for you to determine, I'd say. Do you recall these two dreams you mentioned?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i don't</p>
<p><em>No communication for eighty-five seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> It doesn't work like this, Thirteen. Do you remember anything about these dreams? Everything is important when studying anomalies, come on.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the first dream was dull</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i was crawling through a rice field, by the water</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you know how rice fields are</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it was hot i felt it on my wings</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> no i don't use them i don't know how to and don't want to. it was hot and humid and the field was empty</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> no people no animals not even crickets</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> everything was still and nothing made a sound</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> as i said dull</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> when i reached the end of the field i saw something at a short distance</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> a building like a castle or a medieval style house</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> considerably tall and large with half a dozen twisting towers protruding from its ceiling</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it was made of some kind of smooth white stone</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it reminded me of a ruined mansion i'd seen in tuscany back when i worked there</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it felt out of place by the field</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i moved closer</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> and that was how the dream ended</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> of yesterday's i recall little</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Alright, shoot… Ah, sorry for my crudeness, it's just that I am particularly invested in the SCP-6883 case.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i can see that</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> yesterday i saw the castle thing again</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i entered it</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> and that was the end of the dream</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i'm sorry my work ended up piling up on your desk again</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it wasn't meant to be this way</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i'll have one of my most trusted go back to 01 to help you out</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> No need, and no need to be sorry. It's my duty and I will carry it out gladly. After all, one more project is nothing compared to the ones I'm already working on. You're a hard-working man, Harold, and the fact that you only took a break due to… extreme health concerns, to put it lightly, does you more than justice. That reminds me — you should take breaks more often.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it's your work just as it is mine</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> It'll be mine for a long while more. The stream of things we have to do changes and grows in size and might as time goes on, but you have already laid more than enough bricks in the dam to contain it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> so you say</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> still this is a temporary setback i hope</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i'll think about what to do once i get back in the meantime</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> between now and what else i don't know but i'll think</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> I'd say we're reaching the end of the interview, so I'll proceed to ask the final question. Are you feeling better?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> feeling better how</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Better in general. Less stressed, getting better sleep, this kind of better.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i have not been able to work</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i am unsatisfied with being in a body that is not my own</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i am feeling not unwell</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> my condition is all but exceptional though i thought my reaction would be worse</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> That's <em>not terrible</em> to hear, then. We are done, I believe.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> one last thing</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> could i suggest you take some time off this</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> this interview alone lasted too much</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> everyone has limits</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Different limits. If that is all, Thirteen, we can call it a day</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> this is all</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> take care gregor</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> You take care too, Harold.</p>

<p>Five days after O5-13's interview, the following recording was obtained via secret data recorders implanted inside the Administrator's brain, under the orders of five O5 members lead by O5-1. The Administrator was resting in their home in Venice, Italy, as they conversed with Mr. K., a former colleague and a high-ranking officer of GoI-503 ("Aviatica").</p>
<p>The following conversation was recorded:</p>

<p><strong>Individuals Involved:</strong> <strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K.</span></strong> (Aviatica Arch-editor), <strong><span style="color: brown">Doctor Sandford Gregorius</span></strong> (Foundation Administrator)</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> (<em>Standing on top of a pillar, adjusting his visor.</em>) So Gregorius, nice to see ya 'gain. <em>Beh</em>, I suppose that you have been living quite a -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Get down from there, you idiot. You never learned from that damn sniper shot in Milan, huh? (<em>Sighs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> (<em>His visor slightly flashes and beeps, as he frowns, whispering.</em>) Ahh, how cold. Look, Gregor, it was your fault that the guys noticed me, since you were too jumpy for some action. You still owe me a beer for that, you know. (<em>Chuckles.</em>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Svejk was pestering me too much during that time. Said that we had to get the kind of news to give 'im shivers or something like that. Well…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Anyway, it's been some years already since that. How's your life as an admin?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Hmmn, (<em>Lights a cigarette.</em>) About as good as the shit that occurred in Milan.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> (<em>Pauses for five seconds. More beeping.</em>) Ehh, even though it was a disaster that got burnt into your mind, Aviatica did get some data from that place. Or… (<em>His head turns around, beeping. He frowns</em>). Or… are you referring to that promise?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> <em>Treba</em>, you came here for that, no?</p>
<p><em>The pillar begins to rise up, bending and folding in several directions. Mr. K is standing unmovingly on it.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Of course, <em>Administrator</em>. Well, no pressure on ya, just keeping tabs here and there. But well, don't you think that it's time to cha -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> I can't, K. The Foundation is crippled by the same bureaucracy we saw everywhere. Throughout my 10-year tenure, nothing has practically changed. The same vicious cycle of papers to be filled, bureaucratic shit, pretty much anything that should be burnt under the sun. I can't do anything, not even my hopes for reforming everything, including the world, K. Even O5-13, the guy you wanted me to train, got consumed by it.</p>
<p><em>They sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius</span>:</strong> Damn it, K. I'm really bad with promises.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Hmmn, you couldn't handle it? Ahh, you were always the guy who said, "I'm gonna turn this place upside-down!" like a hotshot writer or somethin'.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> It's as hard as meeting Leggere's deadlines, you know.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> (<em>Chuckles.</em>) Huh, those are pretty good times. Seeing you on the bench and noddin' around was something we used for bets. Anyway, let's get to the point now. Just three days earlier, some of Aviatica's top brass received info on ya, and since you did pretty much a lotta stuff for us, we thought about informing you.</p>
<p><em>Mr. K snaps his fingers. The pillar that they are standing on begins to duplicate itself, connecting to Dr. Gregorius' home via tubing, wiring, and avian sculptures. After five minutes, the Administrator's home begins to resemble Milan's Castello Sforzesco. Mr. K. sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> What are you yapping about?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> To start with, Gregor, we only got sent to the Alps for a small expedition, with no shooting involved. (<em>Narrows eyes.</em>) You're prob' confusing the gun stuff with other places like Prague, Barcelona, or Caracas, or those blokes at Moscow… ah shit, we journalists are shot at too much. Anywa-</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Look, don't start bullshitting me about my time in Avia-</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Listen, we were sent there around 25 years ago to investigate the Castello. Not much happened there, except you being too jumpy. when exploring it. Remember it, Gregor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Hmmn, that ca- that castle's ringing something in my mind. I am not sure why though.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Of course, Gregor. what's ringing in your mind must be the jokes we had about you fainting at the entrance of that place, saying something about 'changing the world as I promised to Crea' or something else. You know, when we found you, you were absolutely filled up with roaches coming from your mouth. We thought you died a bullshit death.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Crea… damn it, I never got to paying my respects to her.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> What the hell are ya talkin' about, Gregor?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Crea. The newbie reporter who exploded into pieces back at the Castello. We almost saved her, just before the roaches ate her out of nowhere! (<em>The Administrator switches into a colder tone.</em>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Crea, ehh - that expedition required us veterans, ya know.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Oi, don't say that-</p>
<p><em>A loud beeping sound is emitted from the visor of Mr. K.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Well, well, well, whoever is this Crea you're talking about, or your memories… well, I won't comment on them further. However, the thaumaturgic readings we got from ya back at the castle are almost similar to what you're scatterin' around in this place. That's the gist of it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Look, K., I'm sorry, but you guys have a few screws loose. I have been functioning as an officer and an Administrator of the Foundation. <em>Treba</em>, at least most of the time. I just spent the rest of my free time getting drunk or enjoying cigars or whatever.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Oh well, investigating ya right now wouldn't lead to anything good. Look, Gregor, this is for our own sake. At that same place, at the Castello, something related to cockroaches is reappearing again. Better take note of it, you know, as our sources are just beginning to catch on. At the same time, you stink of the same readings involved with those roaches.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> Cockroaches, huh. (<em>Appears to be slightly shocked.</em>) Alright, alright, I will keep in mind what you have said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K:</span></strong> Also… one last thing. Don't stand too much on pillars. You might faint like you did in that castle.</p>

<p>The Administrator transformed into an SCP-6883-1 instance five days following their conversation with Mr. K. The phrase 'MUTARE MUNDI' was engraved on their carapace.</p>
<p>Footage involving the Administrator's behavior in the previous days has been analyzed after psychological investigations ordered by O5-1 has determined abnormal behavior on their part. The transcript of Log #55, which is the most notable due to its anomalous effects, is provided below. O5-13 do not recall the incidents that transpired in these logs after extensive psycho-memetic analysis.</p>

<p><em>The two individuals scheduled a meeting behind closed doors, which was granted by the Ethics Committee. During the event, they were separated via a glass pane and were provided computers.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> hey gregor. hows work in this room? O5-1 told us that its still a bit of a shock that you turned into a roach but hopefully things still work pretty fine</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> well, the books are there, the laptop for roaches is on that table, and pretty much everything else is in those closets.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> my eyes, all of them, still take some time to adjust to the lighting and the fact that I get many images streaming into my head, but overall it's not a bad deal. i can see pitch-black stuff</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> i have also been feeling pretty well and happy not much angst over getting turned into a roach</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> having compound eyes does wonders. must be good for sore eyes due to work.</p>
<p><em>O5-13 heaves its body, with its wings and carapace slightly buzzing.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> its too bad coffee tastes like shit to us roaches</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> hmmn wasn't it the other way around with roaches in the coffee</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> I remember your story about nescafe and cockroaches in their ground coffee</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> probably</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> lets get to the point now</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i have received news about o5-1's plans for us of retirement or containment</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> they have started by confining us to our room,</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> but at least we can still be useful to the foundatoin</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> seems like the perfect time to get rid of us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> can't exactly blame him, though, despite his ambitions. to climb the ranks h</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> he didn't… exactly trust me, even at the start. well, I was a journalist back then hahaha</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> also, the fact that the Administrator got turned into an insect</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> well, keeping that as a secret is bound to mess up stuff and security concerns.</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Both are silent for several seconds.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> hmmn mind if I tell you something about the foundation? I wanted to let this out</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> what's it about</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> do you ever feel like breaking the Veil</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> we spend so much burucracy tryin to maintain everything in secrecy</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it stifled our dreams back then</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you know</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> change the world and all</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> but it's too late now to break the viel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> anyway how did you plan to do it?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> i wanted it to be somewhat gradual.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> just like how leggere often taught us when we were setting up the magic cams and the bird drones so they don't squawk a lot on spy missions</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> I have a list or outline to do that and so far well err</p>
<p><em>O5-13 rapidly flaps its wings, and raises one of its legs as a salute.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> with the fondazione at helm we can guide everyone throughout the noosphere, maybe even tangle up with oneiroi</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the sarkics, well, they can be dealt with easily.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> serpents hand, aviatica, practically everyone</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> they can at least be on much better terms with us if we are more transparent</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> we can better protect the free ports, the antenelian pasages in milan</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> tenoktitlan's area in mexico</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the guys at site-120 trying to fight off flesh gods</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the weones at site-34 crying out 'SEKHO' as their battle cry, or say, company cheer, …. everyone, I think.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> But then, those are just a pipe dream though</p>
<p><em>O5-13 stomps their feet.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> change like that is not working. aviaticas decade long calls for political reforms being jackshit, and even my own pare</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> wha</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> i have a question for you harold</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> wuld you oppose the foundation if we did something like whiplashing the world</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> of course no one will get hurt</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> but the veil would break up like restaurants' windows when we were gettin' shot at</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> its for like, the betterment of the world, you know</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> why are you asking that</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> It's not like we can do anything in this goddamn room hahahaha &lt;<em>Quickly goes silent.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> hmmn it's not a bad thought</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> but something that drastic is not something I really want</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> most of the time everything just gets fucked up</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> sure, the world changes, but more often than not, it turns into a world half-empty. Or half-full? you get the idea</p>
<p><em>Both are silent for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> so i will probably oppose something like that</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> more often than not, strings are being pulled behind the scenes, tangling and causing the events to crash</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> aviatica often fucked up doing that sort of thing, im quite surprised that our friends over there are still kickin</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> it's why I get the rationale of the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong>we just don't want to stir up so much trouble. We're methodical</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> hahh you truly learnt a lot of things from K, eh</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> I see what you mean</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> though I don't necessarily agree with the bureaucratic part</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> change is something that is not like a rash decision but</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> but?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Dr. Gregorius:</span></strong> what if its something that's already decades in the making</p>
<p><em>At this point, reality instability levels spike. The sentence 'I am beginning to remember now' manifests on the Administrator's carapace.</em></p>

<p>The interior of the church in Broumov. It was crushed by an assembled SCP-6883-3, based on the Administrator's visions.</p>

<p><strong>Personnel Involved:</strong> <strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span></strong> (Junior Aviatica Reporter), <strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span></strong> (Aviatica Officer)</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>A younger version of the Administrator is seated on the steps leading to the interior of a Baroque-style church in Broumov, Czech Republic. The church is unidentifiable and does not correspond to any known structure. However, it has a generally typical appearance with large spikes on its roof and a belfry tower nearby, save for massive overgrowth and foliage surrounding it. Meanwhile, a silhouette of a 100-meter-tall humanoid entity, SCP-6883-3, can be seen in the distance. The stomping of the entity can be heard, although the Administrator ignores it.</em></p>
<p><em>As he tries to stop a cockroach pestering him via his hands, the Administrator briefly enters the church. The song 'Waymaker' can be heard playing, while wooden automatons clad in navy blue and black, with armbands bearing the Aviatica logo, can be seen.</em></p>
<p><em>A casket can be found near the altar, surrounded by wreathes of flowers such as chrysanthemum and calla lilies. Most people had left, as the service had apparently ended. The Administrator converses with one automaton whose face is significantly blurred who called him, although he sighs. The automatons breaks into cockroach shells.</em></p>
<p><em>After 30 minutes, the service concludes. The people then leave, heading towards the cemetery. Everyone is grouped in knots of three or five.</em></p>
<p><em>Now with the casket interred in the cemetery, Mr. K, one of the few individuals with an organic appearance, approaches him. They talk on a nearby bench.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Yo, Gregor. &lt;<em>Waves hand, as he takes a seat beside the Administrator. Both are silent for at least 30 seconds.</em>&gt; I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius:</span></strong> … Don't be so… ah well… &lt;<em>The Administrator's hands curl up into balls, but then relax after a while.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Looks around.</em>&gt; At least she would have liked this weather. You know, the girl in red… what's her name aga - &lt;<em>Turns silent.</em>&gt; It's a good thing we managed to at least get her back.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius:</span></strong> …I suppose. It would have been somewhat cruel if, if she did not have the chance to at least see the damned sky. She often joked that it was so cloudy whenever she was in this godforsaken place. Even Britain showed her some of the sun, she said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> From the looks of it… that girl, you know, she seemed to have really seen a lot of places. Lots of memories. Though it's sad that she got hit by those fuckers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius:</span></strong> Her parents, you know, even forgot their only daughter when I approached them about the funeral… those Fae… apparently, the Foundation had gotten 'em. Can't be sure where they are now exactly, or how they're rotting in a cell somewhere.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> …Well, let's, let's just… wait. I think I remember something now about the girl. A very faint memory, I guess. Gregor, do you know the one about the pen? I remember seeing it in an in-depth investigation of Crea.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius:</span></strong> Hmmn… ah. The good ol' party trick Crea used to do. What of it?</p>
<p><em>Mr. K takes out several Faber-Castell pens, all of which are dotted with holes near the knib. He ties a chrysanthemum flower and a string to each pen, before throwing them into the sky. The pens shoot up like a rocket, scattering red, blue, and yellow water.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Compression… I never got tired of this trick.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> I jogged my head a lot of times, and I think these pens saved us once. Don't exactly know where, but I remember them zipping through like firecrackers through a sea of…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Damned corporate beetle fairies. They had this stench that I can still smell up to now. When I remember it, the deal we tried to broker so that everyone - humans, faeries, fuck-ups, everything - could live in peace. Too bad we overstepped as journalists, so they say.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Beetles, huh? Crea used to be amazed by those. Back when we were kids, we used to get a very long tube or stick up, poke some trees in the middle of nowhere, and those beetles would fall. Then we scoop 'em up, or put them in a Tupperware container. (<em>Chuckles.</em>) Then we would be content for the whole day, at least until the beetles would start a revolution and somehow get the hell out of the container.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Hmmn… it's amazing that you changed from that into a journo ready to throw flashbangs when needed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Well… that carelessness makes people screw up so badly… fuck that.</p>
<p><em>Both are silent for at least three minutes. The visor of Mr. K beeps steadily and more rapidly.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Ah, I remember something else that Crea said. Always give the last straw, the <em>poslední kapka</em>, or something like that. Even if it takes your identity. For her, it was for the happiness of the people. As a journo… well, I once told her that sort of thinking is stupid. As journalists, we hang out with motherfuckers all the time. But you see… she told something else. Do everything, she said. Live like a goddamn adventuring reporter, you know? Something like that?</p>
<p><em>The Administrator wipes his eyes.</em></p>
<p>She also said some weird stuff like "functionality transcends form and shape at all costs", especially when we were comparing beetles and humans back then… ahhh. Damn it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Sighs.</em>&gt; Oi, oi, oi. Don't keep it bottled up. I know being stoic is one of your things, but… but, ah.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Oh well. K… I have been thinking about something. A question boiling in my mind.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Hmm, what's it?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Aviatica, you know, has that sort of calm, suave stance on everything. Not so militaristic - a very hopeful group of journalist nerds pushing for reforms and shit. Something, something like Crea, you know? But… you see, do you think the day will come when something drastic, a whiplash, you know, is needed for this world?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Well… hasn't that been practiced pretty much everywhere? Most declarations of independence, 'round the world'. The Intelligentsia Uprising of the Free Ports. The Foundation-Aviatica Wars. Those times when the Philippines or pretty much the whole of Southeast Asia got fuckin' reset six times <a href="scp-5631.html">by our guys and a snake</a>. Something like that, no? Well…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Well?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> I don't really like those. The Philippines, for example, even if it got reset several times, still have nothing good enough occurring. Still a third world country, and in a state, you can't describe as 'better'. These events, you know, seem to bring more chaos than expected. I mean, sure, something good happens - would suck if that's not the case. In any case… &lt;<em>A phone rings.</em>&gt; Ah, something's come up. You ok if I leave ya here for a moment?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Fidgets for a few seconds, smoothening his suit.</em>&gt; Ah, sure.</p>
<p><em>After a few minutes, the Administrator, now alone, begins to tear up, chuckling occasionally. The surroundings begin to drastically change, as he takes out a business card, labelled 'Castello'. It is shining, and the text on the card changes at a moment's notice.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Sandford Gregorius</span>:</strong> Ah, damn it. At least those beetles brought something good to me. Crea… damn it, I won't fuck up this time. I remember everything now… why, why I of all the people of Aviatica, had been brought to the Foundation.</p>
<p><em>A cockroach swarm then manifests, preying over the wooden automatons. Overgrowth of the trees and plants in the area also occurs, destroying the cemetery and making several buildings collapse in the vicinity. Meanwhile, the entity, now identified to be an amalgamation of SCP-6883-3, is closing into the Administrator, destroying the church in the process. The Administrator stands still, chuckling.</em></p>
<p><em>The land where the casket was buried begins to inflate and rumble, revealing a large cockroach. It obtains several massive gashes that leak liters of colorless blood and becomes paralyzed at the end as it fights SCP-6883-3, although it wins and manages to return SCP-6883-3 into pieces. The cockroach that was previously pestering the Administrator also grows in size, and devours him. The remains, composed of bone and tissue, begin to turn into smaller cockroaches that then swarm.</em></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>The Administrator, still in human form, is in the middle of a medieval-style room, carrying a bulk of paperwork.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Ahh, you damn idiot. Is this what you meant by a warm-up? Reviewing tax forms and documents for your daily life, ha?</p>
<p><em>A shrill buzzing sound can be heard, followed by the laughter of a glasses-wearing woman in a long-sleeved shirt and culotte. The woman fixes her braided hair.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Oi, you, what's with the get-up? After 20 years, this is what your fashion sense amounted to?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> You really are quite rude, Gregor, even two decades into the future. Is it bad for a nature goddess to wear clothing like this? Yes, I represent roaches, but technically, I still am a goddess, and I have the power to wear anything I want. You know, you know, it's boring to just always wear white, or a carapace.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> You tell me. For starters, wearing wildly contrasting colors somewhat hurts my eyes. Two, the glass frames do not fit your jaws. Three, I don't think that this type of clothing is… <em>conducive</em> enough for things like human observation, like you always do.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Hmmn… human observation eh. You see, Gregor, I was trying to play a scenario with this clothing. A friendless, ordinary, college school girl - something like that and without my memories to boot. Well… it's not… &lt;<em>POI-6883 becomes silent.</em>&gt; Well, it didn't turn out so bad? Dodged a few bullets here and there, and well… &lt;<em>POI-6883's face considerably contorts, frowning.</em>&gt; the worst thing I suffered from was being splashed with Listerine. That hurts a lot for a roach.</p>
<p><em>Both of them turn silent, with the Administrator sighing.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Any- anyway, how was it? The 20-year overdue stay, iya, more like an illegal settlement, at the Foundation? Up to this day, I still can't believe I managed to wring in those heathens from the Forest to help us out despite our actual plan with them, so you better have good results, Gregor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> …it wasn't what I had expected. Two whole decades of backbreaking work, bureaucracy, as I climbed through the ranks from an Agent to an Administrator. Few, lucky strokes, I guess. But I kept my end of the deal when I visited you at the Castello.</p>
<p><em>The Administrator snaps their fingers. The room dematerializes, and they and POI-6883 manifest in the observation room of Site-354, where SCP-6883-3's remains are contained under Class-A Protocols.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Ahh, so the mighty <em>Uomino</em> has collapsed even under the Foundation's iron boots. If this wasn't only a vision, then I could mock him more effectively.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> <em>Crea</em>, when we found it in the Alps, it was already heavily broken down, though still functioning. Ahh, I wonder if it has a connection with a certain nature, nah, idiot goddess here. Anyway, we delivered a grand beating to it, so it broke down into pieces we stashed somewhere in those mountains and then called it a day. Also, it was still functioning with a massive amount of thaumaturgic energy, so we implemented some tubing and cables to drain it. We'll be going there anyway, after I dealt… &lt;<em>The voice lowers.</em>&gt;</p>
<p>Ahhh, not exactly an easy thing to do, to be honest. <em>Treba</em>, if this thing wasn't attacked by those greenland inhabitants of… yore, well, the Italian and German branches would be in the dregs right now. &lt;<em>Chuckles.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Uomino… are you sure that It wouldn't be awakening anytime soon. It would suck if -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Well, I'm confident it will work. &lt;<em>Takes out a cigarette.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Alright, alright. Looks like our next targets are focused on the Forest, Gregor… I almost couldn't hold it in when they killed me just a year after we made a deal. It was your idea though - we cockroaches are hardy and will survive fools like those, but we wouldn't be able to meet again to provide… emotional growth for you, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Hmmn… '"Functionality over form", right, Crea? If you exterminated them, we wouldn't have… an energy source for our grand salvo, and the Foundation would just be pissed. This is a game of planning and waiting, after all, as well as setting bets far into the future.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Waiting, and waiting, and waiting… huh. You always made me wait, ever since we found each other as you ran away from your blazing village, Gregor. Those beetles - the Scarabei - were really a blight on the world, and it seems that based on your dreams and fabricated memories, they really got lodged into your mind. Then we separated, you know?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> I… ahh, I don't exactly know anymore. The stunts I pulled with my mind aren't particularly, well, good.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Haah, it's fine, it's fine. Then you joined Aviatica - full of journalists who knew nothing better to do but want a better world by releasing the truth. You instead had to worry about your backs being shot by mooks, and nothing of actual note, aside from the stunts, happened.</p>
<p>Then I had you got to the Foundation as a final measure - I do apologize for perverting your ideals as a journalist. But it was all for a chance to see if you can still fix the world, and for the sake of finding <em>Uomino</em>, that abomination. Ahh, I really forced a lot on you, haven't I? Still, you really… changed. Like a bleakened moth coming out of its cocoon.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Nah… &lt;<em>Sighs.</em>&gt; It's, it's fine, Crea. You don't need to worry too much about that. Anyway, since our last… trial, no, test has failed, well, it's time to draw the conclusion.</p>
<p>We will head to the forest using a Way I know in Venice. Then, we will proceed with the plan.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Ah, first thing. The Verwandlung. You haven't forgotten it, right?</p>
<p><em>The Administrator turns to POI-6883, appearing shocked for a few seconds, although they gradually relax.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Is it… is it really needed?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Of course. You can't brace the full brunt of my capabilities, after all, even if you are already an Administrator. &lt;<em>Chuckles.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Ahhh, alright, alright. I won't… I won't budge from it now, especially if it's the only way remaining… one last thing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> What's it?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> After implementing the <em>Emergence</em> all over humanity, are you sure you can make everyone at least happy, especially at work?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Hmnnn… of course. We nature goddesses don't renege on decade-old promises.</p>
<p><em>A pentagram then manifests, with the Administrator and POI-6883 inside. POI-6883 hands over their eyeglasses to the Administrator, as several appendages sprout from their back The skin begins to turn brown and flake up, as they then devour the Administrator. A mass of bones, skin, and tissue are left behind.</em></p>
<p><em>POI-6883, now fully identical to an SCP-6883-1 instance aside from being 23 times the size, begins to amble forward; the vision of Site-354 collapses, reverting the surroundings into the medieval-style room. The abdomen of POI-6883 begins to inflate, causing the carapace to crack and leak fluids. Several cockroach swarms now appear at this point, surrounding POI-6883.</em></p>
<p><em>POI-6883's ootheca sac drops from its abdomen after leaking several liters of black and green fluid. This also causes an influx of eggs, one of which hatches into a white nymph, whose rapidly growing size is comparable to POI-6883's. It molts several times in a span of minutes, with the instars, or intervals in between, only taking 30 seconds at most. The logos of Aviatica and the SCP Foundation appear on its mature carapace.</em></p>
<p><em>A massive rumbling can be heard, as SCP-6883-2 manifests in front of the two, which then promptly board it. At this point, the data recorders in the Administrator's mind cease to function after the stress of the metamorphosis.</em></p>

<p>Several cockroach swarm attacks were then reported near <strong><span style="color: green">the forest in extranormative space</span></strong>, with the loss of approximately 95 percent of <strong><span style="color: blue">all who have made it their abode</span></strong>. According to monitoring stations near <strong><span style="color: green">the field of names</span></strong>, a 20km wide, 150m-tall castle, referred to as SCP-6883-2, has manifested, with approximately 4,300,000 cockroaches of varying sizes enabling it to levitate. above <strong><span style="color: green">the greeneries in the chimneys</span></strong>. Meanwhile, <strong><span style="color: blue">the socialites of the grounds</span></strong> attempted to evacuate from the SCP-6883-1 instances, although they incurred losses up to 90 percent.</p>
<p>Thaumaturgic presence in the <strong><span style="color: green">no man's farland</span></strong> have dropped to negative levels - thaumaturgic responders have reported the loss of function with most of their equipment, as well as significant transformations of several MTF forces accompanying them into SCP-6883-1 instances. It is hypothesized that significant levels of thaumaturgic energy have been obtained from the <strong><span style="color: green">the stacks of greeneries</span></strong>.</p>
<p>After destroying <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo" target="_blank" target="_blank">the crux of the meadows</a>, SCP-6883-2 has moved towards Venice in the span of two weeks. It then fixed its location, hovering over the city.</p>
<p>Three days after the disappearance of the Administrator, 80 percent of all Foundation Sites worldwide around the world lost contact with SCiPNet, following reports of destruction due to thousand-strong cockroach swarms. Physical entry into the Sites has been practically rendered impossible due to dense foliage, barriers composed of cockroach carapaces, and castle-like edifices. Meanwhile, all of the O5 Council members, save for O5-13, are reported as missing.</p>
<p>Five days afterward, a Foundation Class-1 mandate was signed by the Ethics Committee. The mandate, announced globally through public and Foundation's channels, is provided below:</p>

<p>We represent the SCP Foundation, once dedicated to the mere goal of containing and studying anomalies and related phenomena. However, upon further introspection, the Foundation is now focused on featuring the real nature of everyone - human or not - and society - happiness.</p>
<p>Currently, the Foundation is setting up Provisional Sites, as well as mobile platforms, for transforming members of society into more productive, livelier, and happier lives with their emotions in mind. All citizens, including Foundation personnel, are welcomed.</p>
<p>Communication is encouraged between all involved sectors - let us just introduce ourselves to one another with our real selves - even if our selves will become <strong>nameless</strong> in the future as time clangs against our mediocrity and bureaucracy - and we will work together for the future of all. The Foundation flies and dies in the darkness for you to live happily in the light.</p>

<p>Following this announcement, the Foundation has redesignated SCP-6883 as Thaumiel.</p>

<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc7"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foundation Collapse Report</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>Only 12 percent of all active Foundation assets can combat SCP-6883. Led by O5-13, they evacuated to Switzerland, alongside members of Aviatica, led by Mr. K. Major Sites, such as Site-19, Site-24, and Site-120, are now compromised.</p>
<p>Following the Foundation announcement, approximately 124,562,000 individuals worldwide, all of whom suffer from varying levels of depression and harbor feelings of mediocrity, have approached Provisional Sites set up by the Foundation over the past month to turn into SCP-6883-1 instances after undergoing thaumaturgic psychological techniques.</p>
<p>Analysis has only revealed that most of these individuals are only mildly affected by Foundation memetic agents and have come by their own volition. Meanwhile, more aggressive campaigns by the Foundation are focused on providing relief and purpose to citizens by turning them into highly-coordinated SCP-6883-1 instances.</p>
<p>Afterward, these individuals are released back to their ordinary environments, with memetic agents normalizing their appearances. They display heightened levels of happiness, optimism, and productivity at work.</p>
<p>At the start, approximately 98,000 SCP-6883-related accidents occurred worldwide due to the lack of familiarity with cockroach-based functions. 11 Foundation Sites were then forcibly occupied by SCP-6883-1 instances, resulting in the release of 235 anomalies, all of which turn into deformed SCP-6883-1 instances. Due to freed Keter anomalies, many parts of the Americas and Asia have been obliterated. However, the world's population has not reacted negatively to the released entities or the incidents, and instead cheer and continue their daily routines.</p>

<p>Approximately 81 percent of humanity has been converted into SCP-6883-1 instances, with record-high advances in workplace productivity, scientific progress, and quality of life, according to a Foundation update report released by the Ethics Committee. Meanwhile, the Foundation and Aviatica has launched an expedition to Venice, in hopes of luring the Administrator to Bolzano or the Western Alps in order to initiate Operation UOMINI.</p>
<p>O5-13 was included in the roster for the expedition after the development and successful testing of the V-2 Eckernacht Noospheric Apparatus, a cerebral microchip which allowed for telepathic communication with other individuals. They were chosen due to their familiarity with the Administrator, lessened hostility of SCP-6883-1 instances in their vicinity, and augmented flight capabilities.</p>

<p><em>With the help of MTF Lambda-12 ("Pest Control"), MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down"), and MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters"), an opening for O5-13 and Mr. K. was created to reach the bottom of the central spire of SCP-6883-2 and enter it. Using preliminary data obtained by Aviatica and the surviving members of the <strong><span style="color: green">residents of the land of green crucibles</span></strong>, they head down to the control room.</em></p>
<p><em>Surveillance drones and data recorders attached to one of O5-13's compound eyes capture the interior of SCP-6883-2. Its walls are lined with the imagery of the following: a doctor prying out a tooth, red threads wrapped around a man, a serpentine-like entity carrying koalas, a man with a bird hat, a large clockwork machine, and a rebar sculpture.</em></p>
<p><em>Further murals in the upper levels display images of the Foundation and Aviatica logos and anomalies.

<p><em>Mr. K and O5-13 repel the attacking SCP-6883-1 instances as they run through the corridors. Several instances are benign and raise all of their legs as a sign of surrender. A few protect smaller instances. Mr. K, sighing and looking around, activates their PenShield.</em></p>
<p><em>They soon arrive at a wide octagonal room at the top of the tower - it has a single door.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> behind you k there's some roaches comin &lt;<em>Mauls one of them, as K shoots the incoming SCP-6883-1 instance.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Alrighty, here we go. Now, it seems that Gregor holed up in this place as a sort of final fortress, so we'll not know what kind of fuckery he has in store here.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Sighs.</em>&gt; gregor prepare yourself. &lt;<em>Takes out a C4 amplified with a reality anchor and places it near the door.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Oi, Harold, the hell are ya holdin'?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> isnt the policy to go have a blazing entrance</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Look, those guys inside would be alerted. Much better to attack in silence, ya know?</p>
<p><em>Mr. K hits the door, which then promptly activates a computerized voice, introducing itself as LIBERA.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: blue">LIBERA</span>:</strong> Please answer the following question. "When does freedom ring?"</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> Hmmnn…?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: blue">LIBERA</span>:</strong> Well, well, well. &lt;<em>Sighs, and smokes a cigarette.</em>&gt; Good ol' Gregorius still hasn't forgotten his roots, after all, so he's still human in a weird sort of way. Judging from our memories back at Milan, Moscow, Medellin, Manila…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> something based on his experiences from things like the aviatican crisis of 2001, i suppose? no, more like how he would think when it comes to these sort of things, and i remember him thinking like ya'…</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Frowning.</em>&gt; Well, let's try this. "Freedom rings with a blazing entrance." &lt;<em>Sticks another C4 on the door, and signals O5-13 to run for cover, as he leaps away from the door with PenShield at maximum power.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: blue">LIBERA</span>:</strong> Access approved.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Eh?</p>
<p><em>Reality instability levels begin to spike, with Mr. K's and O5-13's Scranton Reality Anchors breaking apart. Their weaponry and most equipment, save for their armor, also demanifest. They are transported to a replica of the Site-19 Pavilion, which is generally reserved for spatial entities. Kant levels indicate that they are now out of phase with baseline reality.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Yo, Harold and K.</p>
<p><em>The Administrator's appearance is a mix of cockroach and human forms, bleeding from several orifices, while a 50-meter-tall, bulging head, with one antenna missing, of a cockroach is located behind him.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> What a haircut you got there, Gregor. Also, I guess that's Crea at the back?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> I suppose you came here to talk? Also, about Crea, don't talk like that 'bout her, K. She spent everything, banking on this one particular moment to empower the world for everyone for one simple trade-off - and it worked for once. She can only talk, so… if you aren't going to kill us <em>yet</em>, well, let's go talk then.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> not as if theres any choice for us. you stripped us of our weapons after all</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Hahhh… look. We all have our principles. To start, if you weren't interfering, the world would have been much, much, much elevated to a considerably higher state. Look into this vision I prepared for you.</p>
<p><em>Another dimension shift occurs with all the individuals present in the Pavilion. They are transported over landscapes that show scenes from the daily lives of SCP-6883-1 cockroach instances. Note that the words "Scene #X show over each landscape, with X being a number. These scenes are shown as they were in the vision.</em></p>
<p><em>In Scene #1, Venice is depicted. An SCP-6883-1 instance, garbed only in a hat and burgeoning clothes, can be seen flapping its wings as it uses its appendages to row a gondola. Accompanying it are another instance with only a ribbon on its prothorax, and several smaller instances. The song "Fame un spritz" and "Sarde in Saor" plays in the background. Several Venetian landmarks, such as the Ponte di Rialto and Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, can be seen in the distance, albeit heavily modified with cockroach iconography.</em></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Images from the present and the future… or what could happen with our plan to make the world a happier place. Anomalies, even feared ones like 682, can be controlled, while those that escape during Emergence are quickly subdued. Functionality over form, you see.</p>
<p><em>The cockroach head behind the Administrator emits a low-pitch, bellowing sound, but does not move.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Don't you think it will work now? &lt;<em>Their skin flakes off, revealing a cockroach shell.</em>&gt; A small sacrifice of the human form, for the betterment of the soul, don't you think it's a valid idea? &lt;<em>Several appendages sprout from the arms of the Administrator.</em>&gt; The Foundation, with all of its unethical experiments performed on people like little girls, on the girl who cried pig… cannot sacrifice aesthetics for the sake of peace?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> There are two problems, Gregor, with your plan. First, it is fuckin' difficult to get a haircut when you are roach, and I like my haircuts. &lt;<em>Taps his visor, which obscures most of his hair and head.</em>&gt; Second, who do you think are, Reporter Gregorius, to think about changing the world?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Oi, wasn't all Aviatican reporters dreaming of -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> In a way that makes sense and does not set any nasty precedents for the future Foundation. Imagine losing your human form - aesthetics is not something you should mock, Gregor, just 'cause you are aiming for functionality. Now, considering you made a deal with a goddess from who knows where, then that sets an even more dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>You can change the world if you ask the fairies. The Sarkics. The Broken God peeps, and sure, something good can happen if you take the right steps and with the right amount of luck. But who knows if the result, no matter how perfect it is, will work.</p>
<p>Hell, even with insane shark punchers, I think the world can change. Can't say whether it will be good though, but I bet 20 bucks that it's much better than roaches.</p>
<p>Now, as for your wor… work ethics will change -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Work ethic, huh… now we're talking work ethics with the admins. Look, that is the point of why I am here in the first -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> gregor let me talk as your friend</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> youre burnin way too many bridges here</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> its a rash decision too in the end, though i admire that you took decades of planning for it</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Rash decision? Don't screw with me - &lt;<em>Flaps their wings.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you always worked alone even with me available for advice</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> for 10 years</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> no</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> 20 whole fucking years</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> the foundation was built on the spirit of collaboration</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Hahh? Then what about that social climber, O5-1?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> In your planning wasn't that how you also climbed up ranks</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> you never seemed to have friends as a result</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> except for those who managed to sneak aviatica in</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> as a result you were a workaholic cause how else can you perform</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> but you see, there's still a chance for us. for you. for the foundation</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: turquoise">O5-13</span>:</strong> didnt i say that i also wanted to change the world but in smaller, more gradual steps?</p>
<p><em>The Administrator now appears angered, as more of his human skin flakes up. O5-13 and Mr. K back down. However, he then relaxes, with his human appearance quickly returning.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Thank you for pointing that out… I guess, Harold. But you see…</p>
<p><em>The Administrator quickly reverts to their SCP-6883-1 form.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> That's another thing that I need to do in this new world. I paid too much for this opportunity, K and Harold. Crea too. The dignity of the Foundation. Everything, everything… everything, you see?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Oi, that's the sunk cost fallacy, Gregor. One of the first few things we learned at journ school.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Journ school… do you think it matters now with the administrator of a truth-bending organization. For this new chance for a better world, I'm willing to -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> I see, so you are prepared to even lose that part of yours. In the end, you know, Gregor &lt;<em>Takes out a Faber-Castell pen from a pencil case.</em>&gt;, if you remove the aspect of a journalist from yourself, don't you think that your actual identity will no longer exist?</p>
<p>Think about it. Everything we talked about in these past few days, nay, even 20 years ago, was about you being a journo or you changing the world. Now… I guess you're just a man who blabs about changing the world… but nothing else.</p>
<p><em>Mr. K activates the pen - a disguised Scranton Reality Anchor - warping them back to SCP-6883-2. Then, Mr. K and O5-13 are beset by several cockroach swarms, although they protect themselves via their PenShields.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> Alrighty. One last thing, Gregor, we and your pal Uomino will be waiting for ya at the Western Alps!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Uomin…o? Shit, how the hell—</p>
<p><em>Mr. K launches himself into the air with the help of O5-13. His PenShield blocks any attacks from the SCP-6883-1 instances present in the area. He then throws the pencil, which then manifests into a reality anchor. Although the Administrator deactivates the anchor, it paralyzes them and all SCP-6883-1 instances. He lands near the window, signaling O5-13 to come near him.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: brown">Administrator</span>:</strong> Oi, K &lt;<em>Holding the anchor</em>&gt;, it's quite admirable you bypassed my safety checks for anchors via pen but did you just seriously think that this -</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> Idio… take a closer lo—</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: green">Mr. K</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Salutes towards the Administrator and POI-6883, with their visor shining bright yellow.</em>&gt; Well, as Leggere often puts it, you should always leave a sort of gift at the house of the interviewee, particularly if they are an Otherworlder. Ciao! &lt;<em>Signals O5-13 to leave a drone for documentation, and then escape together. Before that. however, he throws another pen at the Administrator.</em>&gt;</p>
<p><em>After O5-13 and Mr. K have escaped the castle and into Venice, the Administrator looks at the second pen. Their legs lose balance, as the effects of paralysis persist.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: violet">POI-6883</span>:</strong> &lt;<em>Sighs.</em>&gt; A double feint, huh. Well, well, well… that was…. a fine play from your frie… wasn't… it? As for this… well, the good ol' compression trick, huh. Should've… seen it comin'…</p>
<p><em>The pen begins to emit beeping sounds, as Kant levels start destabilizing rapidly around it as the remains of the anchor also react with it. The Administrator is still holding it, however, but they soon emit a shrill scream. The pen shoots up from their hand, emitting red, blue, and yellow powder, before culminating in a nuclear explosion that obliterates the room and destroys the drone.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:150%;"><tt>Timeline Log 6883-01</tt></span></strong></p>
<div style="font-size: 15px; margin: 30px">
<p style="text-align: center;">— <tt><strong>BEGIN LOG</strong></tt> —</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:00:25</tt></strong></p>
<p>A small mushroom cloud dominates the Venetian landscape, destroying approximately 10 percent of the city. SCP-6883-2 is in a heavily damaged condition, with several spires, battlements, towers, and half of the bailey collapsing after the combination of the Aviatican nuclear pen attack and the reality anchor. Mr. K, seated on O5-13, is escaping from SCP-6883-2 with multiple cockroach swarms in pursuit. Telemetry data indicates that they are heading towards the Western parts of the Alpine Mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:05:16</tt></strong></p>
<p>A large, cockroach-like entity, designated SCP-6883-Ω, with deep gashes, manifests from the ruins of SCP-6883-2. It sports long trails of cockroach carapaces attached to its body. Mechanical tubing, wiring, cables, and tubes protrude out of its mesothorax and abdomen. Half of its prothorax, which corresponds to the head, is missing. Several florae, such as palm trees, azalea, and lilac, are rooted in the carapace. It then emits a shrill, hissing sound recorded to reach 140 decibels by an automatic Foundation outpost.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:15:21</tt></strong></p>
<p>Via somersaults and dives, O5-13 and Mr. K evade the cockroach swarms, although one of the cockroaches stabs a leg into the arm of Mr. K. before being terminated. Meanwhile, reinforcements from the Alpine Squadron have arrived, firing a barrage of missiles that slow down SCP-6883-Ω, severely damaging it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aviatica's <a href="scp-5630.html">SCP-5630</a> instances, which are thaumaturgically-enhanced bird drones, commit diving attacks on SCP-6883-Ω, delivering bombs. When severely damaged, they crash themselves into the now-bleeding carapace. They also explode into a black, sticky fluid upon contact with SCP-6883-Ω. The fluid has massively slowed down the entity due to its hardening properties.</p>
<p>Through time sinks and portable reality anchors, O5-13 and Mr. K manage to accelerate further.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:26:21</tt></strong></p>
<p>Operation UOMINI Mission Control in Site-354 notifies O5-13 and Mr. K via noospheric links that 10 more minutes are needed to distract SCP-6883-Ω. At this point, Site-354 now loses significant amounts of energy. A black-out is expected after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a combination of the Foundation and Aviatican dive-bombing attacks have crippled two legs of SCP-6883-Ω. However, 10,000-cockroach-strong swarms, several of which bear the Foundation logo, counter them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:32:16</tt></strong></p>
<p>Several missiles and nuclear weapons originating from the Austrian border, most likely due to the assimilated German branch, arrive at Site-354. These weapons are terminated via the still-functional PENTERN system along the Alps, although two of them hit Sites-350 and 352. Thaumaturgic mages not assigned to energy diversion repel the swarms of SCP-6883-1 instances via Ways and railguns.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:40:51</tt></strong></p>
<p>O5-13 and Mr. K, now heavily injured, continue to resist the onslaught of SCP-6883-1 instances. As Mr. K's arm is no longer capable of wielding the gun, O5-13 has them rest and hang onto the carapace. O5-13 then wields a Gatling gun via its appendage, firing at the SCP-6883-1 instances while executing aerial maneuvers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:46:11</tt></strong></p>
<p>Mission Control announces that it is now operating at emergency power. Operation UOMINI is considered a success, and every involved Foundation and Aviatican asset retreat to designated safehouses. A massive rumbling then begins as parts of the Austrian Alps crumble. SCP-6883-3 is now active.</p>
<p>Formerly a pile of blocks and remains that assembled upon sufficient energy diverted to it, SCP-6883-3 is a 100-meter-tall humanoid entity, with distinctive 'hat' and 'cane' portions. It is primarily composed of a mix of mechanical and organic materials. Steam rises from several holes in its body while gears and twines operate to maintain body rigor. A loud beeping sound, followed by bird chips, originates from the upper portion.</p>
<p>SCP-6883-Ω emits a shrill hiss as it flaps its wings and crashes into SCP-6883-3 to engage it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>00:56:11</tt></strong></p>
<p>SCP-6883-3 and SCP-6883-Ω viciously fight. SCP-6883-3, recovering from the battering ram attack earlier, knocks its cane into SCP-6883-Ω's compound eyes, which then shine from yellow to red. Meanwhile, SCP-6883-Ω stabs its appendages into SCP-6883-3's hat, tearing it, although SCP-6883-3 responds with a kick into SCP-6883-Ω's anal cercus. SCP-6883-3 launches a volley of punches and kicks, half of which SCP-6883-Ω counters.</p>
<p>As a result, SCP-6883-Ω's head bursts into pieces, although it continues to live and attack with substantial power.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>01:03:21</tt></strong></p>
<p>Retaliating, 100,000-member-strong cockroach swarms bind SCP-6883's legs, causing it to crash into mountains. Its facade is chipped away by dive attacks and acidic secretions, although it soon recovers. Meanwhile, a massive pentagram, composed of SCP-6883-1 instances, manifests on the horizon. It launches projectiles similar to a cockroach nymph, pummeling SCP-6883-3.</p>
<p>The fight continues for 30 more minutes until SCP-6883-3 begins to collapse and disassemble. Meanwhile, SCP-6883-Ω leaks massive amounts of blood while its organs, such as the gastric caecea and the esophagus, have detached. However, it continues to move towards Site-354, emitting shrill cries. Aviatican and Foundation flight assets continue bombing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>01:27:59</tt></strong></p>
<p>On the verge of defeat, SCP-6883-Ω launches a 500km-wide pentagram into the sky, reviving all SCP-6883-1 instances neutralized by Foundation and Aviatica. However, most of these instances no longer attack and appear to act independently from SCP-6883-Ω.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><tt>01:35:59</tt></strong></p>
<p>The now-exposed heart of SCP-6883-Ω contains the mutated, half-cockroach body of the Administrator. O5-13 and Mr. K leave their outpost to attack it, claiming to know the most effective means of neutralization. Upon arrival, they throw a modified reality anchor into it, shifting the three of them into a virtual landscape.</p>

<p>O5-13 and Mr. K manifest one hour later, unconscious. The following data was then obtained from O5-13's noospheric recorder. The recorder's organization of data is preserved in the following transcript, which is only composed of flashing text and sounds.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, O5-13 is declared as the new Administrator, with Aviatican officers helming the O5 Council. Due to SCP-6883-Ω's death, neutralization of SCP-6883 is observed, with individuals in Northwest Italy and Austria gradually returning to their human forms. A worldwide return to the human form is expected after three months.</p>
