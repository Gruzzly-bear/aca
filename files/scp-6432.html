<p>SCP-6432-1</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6432</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6432 and SCP-6432-1 are currently stored in adjoining object containment lockers at Site-51. Personnel surveilling SCP-6432's containment locker are to be changed every 2 weeks. Direct physical contact with SCP-6432 is not permitted except during testing. Individuals who make direct contact with SCP-6432 are to remain isolated under surveillance for 15 days, or until SCP-6432's effect wears off. All but 1 SCP-6432-1 instance have been incinerated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6432 is the corpse of an avian creature, measuring 110cm from beak to tail, with wingspans of 130cm, 80cm and 50cm. While superficially resembling a bird in most respects, SCP-6432 differs in that it has six wings and no legs. Limited accounts prior to its termination observed it moving when on the ground by hopping on the 10cm talons found at the elbow joint of each wing. These 6 talons and SCP-6432’s beak are significantly sharper than the talons of ordinary birds of<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>prey.</p>
</div>
<br/>
SCP-6432 exerts an anomalous effect on any living creature that comes into direct physical contact with it. Physical contact with the anomaly induces intense visual hallucinations, usually of flora and fauna typical of where the victim grew up, or other locations associated with significant memories. In addition to the hallucinations, the victim experiences disembodied sensory input, most commonly through only one sense. Examples of reported experiences are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Smelling woody or floral scents</li>
<li>Hearing indistinct speech or whispering, often perceived as very nearby</li>
<li>Feeling weather inconsistent with the victim's physical location</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-6432-1 instances are the corpses of SCP-6432's victims, carrying pseudo-portals in all areas of the body fed upon by SCP-6432. These pseudo-portals appear as areas of bright, prismatic light, and when viewed through a specialized lens, act as windows to a hereto unidentified forested area. Five SCP-6432-1 instances were discovered in SCP-6432's initial area of destabilized reality, with pseudo-portals located in the facial and chest regions. It is hypothesized that SCP-6432 attacked the eyes first, as suggested by the most fully realized portals always being located in the region of the corpse's eye sockets, and as observed firsthand during the<br/></p>

recovery of the anomaly.
<p><strong>History:</strong> SCP-6432 was discovered as the source of a small splinter reality centered on an abandoned house near Millinocket, Maine. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) was assigned to investigate but failed to return the anomaly<br/></p>

<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Comms check.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Hoo-rah.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Sounds good. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Born ready!</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> We're the first people to get a look at this thing. We don't know what we're in for in there, so keep an eye out for illusions.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Gonna appear as everybody's worst fear. Like Pennywise.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Wow, Powell, you'll get to see your dad for once!</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Fuck off, Reid, you're- you're <em>short.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I admit, I'm not half as tall as the stories you tell about the size of your-</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Burn.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Awfully liberal with your 8 allotted words of the day, are we, Hewitt?</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> You good, Thirteen?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Great. Eyes up, everybody. Don't fall for any tricks. Reid and Hewitt, with me. Powell, take the upper South hall. Watts, go with Powell. I want you on the highest vantage point you can get with that sniper, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Loud and clear.</p>
<p>[Lambda-5 splits accordingly.]</p>
<p>[The interior of the house is seemingly larger on the inside than the outside, either by illusion or unreality. Plant life grows through the walls and floor.]</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> We found a staircase. Heading- well, heading sideways. See you at the top-or-bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Roger that.</p>
<p>[Footage corrupted, staircase only partially visible.]</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Ugh. I hate when they do things like this.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Don’t we all, newbie?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I’ve been here longer than Reid AND Hewitt.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Coulda fooled me.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I've never choked.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> First time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Leave him alone, Powell. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> First time for you to actually hit a shot, too.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> You can chat in the van, boys. Focus.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Conley, I found something. A body, most likely.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Move in. Carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Anchors ready?</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Confirming life signs; negative.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> His face.</p>
<p>[Agent Powell enters an open hall with a high ceiling. Several walls have closed wooden doors.]</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Looks like something was eating it.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> It's <em>bright.</em></p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> I’m reading big numbers from that. Minimal interaction for now. Don’t look too hard at it.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Copy. Tagging it now.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Remember that portal? From ███████████.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> It <em>does</em> kinda look like that.</p>
<p>[A door slams directly behind Agent Powell.]</p>
<p>[Agent Powell turns around. The area behind him, previously the top of the staircase, is now a solid, flat wall. Agent Watts is not visible on camera.]</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Hey, Conley?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Powell, a door just shut on me. Can you grab it?</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> What door? There’s no door. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Eyes up, everybody, we have spacial fluctuations. Keep moving and keep those anchors ready.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Powell has the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Yeah, Watts doesn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I don’t have one, either.</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> I’ve got you, Reid.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Watts, your priority is to find your way back to Powell, got it?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p>[Agent Powell's camera angles down to a male corpse, face entirely missing. White light shines from the wound.]</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Hey, is that dead body of yours glowing?</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Just the- bite holes.</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Then I’ve got another one over here.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Tag any you find and get back to Watts, Powell.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Found a third one.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Find a fourth one?</p>
<p>[Agent Powell pauses as he waits for a response.]</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Respond, Watts.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> There’s a kid in here.</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Do you have eyes on the anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> It’s just a kid, Powell-</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Careful, Watts, certain things tend to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I know what I’m looking at, alright?!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Watts, stay where you are, don’t agitate it-</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Hey, it’s okay.</p>
<p>[Brief noise from Agent Watts's microphone, voice sounds slightly distant.]</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> See? Not gonna hurt you. I’m here to get you out of here safe, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> …Did you just take your helmet off?</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Jesus Christ, Watts, put your fucking helmet on!</p>
<p>[Powell has begun running through the hall, quickly checking doors.]</p>
<p>[Each door seems to open to an unseen portal, Agent Powell visible from different angles through each.]</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> She’s just a kid! I don’t want to scare her!</p>
<p><strong>Conley:</strong> Put your helmet on now, Watts, that is an order!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I have eyes on the anomaly! And on Watts! Repeat, eyes on the anomaly!</p>
<p><strong>Hewitt:</strong> Anchor it, Reid!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I don’t have one!</p>
<p><strong>Powell:</strong> Then wound it!</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I’m not shooting a fucking child!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> That is NOT a child, Watts!</p>

<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p>[10 second pause]</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> How's it feeling?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Are you all-right?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> It's funny, admit it. You're gonna get so much mileage out of that joke. Might as well start now.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> It didn't get my trigger finger so you'd better watch yourself.</p>
<p>[Reid chuckles.]</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> What did Conley say?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Uh, 6 months to a year.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Oh. That's not as bad as I was expecting.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> They need to make sure nothing else is going to happen to your eye.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>Watts:</strong> …What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> You're not coming back to Lambda-5.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> What?!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> You're not fit for duty, Watts.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Yeah, not now, but 6 months? That's a long time. My face'll be healed by then, Conley can get me one of those bionic arms, the really high-grade ones they use with-</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> They're talking about decommissioning you.</p>

<p><strong>Watts:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> No, I can be better. I know what I did wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I can make it work.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> No, Watts, you can't.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> On ANY force?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I don't know. They didn't sound favorable toward it.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> This is the only thing I know how to do, Reid! This is all I've got, where else am I supposed to go? What, I screw up <em>once</em> and it blows my chances forever?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I'll help you find something-</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> No. I'm not done. Tell Conley I'm coming back. Once I'm healed I'll requisition one of the advanced prosthetics and I WON'T fuck it up again, I <em>promise</em>-</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> We already voted on it.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Do I get a vote? Between you, me and Hewitt I could-</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> It was unanimous.</p>
<p>[33 second pause]</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I almost watched you die once. I'm not going to your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> Do you think it was my fault?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> The mission. Do you think it was my fault?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> I never said that.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> DO you?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> No. I don't think it was your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> No, 'cause I'm sick of the rest of the team lying to my face about the elephant in the room, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> "13A."</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> Watts-</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> I know you all think I'm the weak link. You're not exactly subtle.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> You're not a "weak link."</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> No? Then what am I? All it had to do was look like a kid!</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> It wasn't your fault, okay? You're in qualifying parameters for the team, and you have plenty of skills that-</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> It was me. I fucked up. <em>I</em> botched the mission.</p>
<p><strong>Reid:</strong> It wasn't your goddamn fault, Watts!</p>
<p><strong>Watts:</strong> You don't believe that!</p>
