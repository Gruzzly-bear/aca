<p>Clearest known image of Item 1984.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> 1984</p>
<p><strong>Containment Class:</strong> Uncontained</p>
<p><strong>Containment Protocols:</strong> Foundation personnel who believe they are being pursued by Item 1984 should take shelter in a well-lit area, remain there until the Item selects a new target, and report the occurrence to their superiors immediately. Known or suspected targets of Item 1984 are prohibited from entering and/or approaching any Foundation facility.</p>
<p>Item 1984 is to be contained at Facility 04 in a designated humanoid containment chamber with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excluding through the main doorway, which must be kept closed and locked at all times, the interior of the chamber must not be visible from outside, except through remote surveillance.</li>
<li>Four light strips built into the corners of the chamber must be kept continuously active, illuminating the interior between 30 – 60 lux without interruption.</li>
<li>Remote surveillance of the interior must utilise high-contrast greyscale cameras, installed to ensure all contents of the chamber are visible at all times, and calibrated to ensure Item 1984 is visible only as a uniform black silhouette in footage.</li>
<li>No freestanding or loose furniture or items are permitted inside the chamber, to prevent the Item from creating a surveillance blind spot. A portion of the floor is padded for use as bedding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Item 1984 must be continuously observed, in silhouette only, by at least four individuals without interruption; the Item will escape containment if unobserved by at least one individual for any amount of time. Foundation personnel must avoid direct exposure to Item 1984, and must remain continuously visible to at least one other individual if otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Item 1984 is an opaque humanoid entity estimated at 1.5 metres in height, with a masculine physique. The words ‘Mr. Shadows, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment’ are occasionally visible in glowing white on the Item’s back; these are typically concealed by clothing. No further physical characteristics are definitively known, as the Item has only been observed in silhouette or by its shadow.</p>
<p>Item 1984 possesses an anomalous capacity to persistently stalk individuals, facilitated by an ability to transport itself between locations while unobserved. Attempts to evade the Item during a pursuit invariably fail; all have concluded only with the Item voluntarily ceasing the pursuit, selecting a new target, and/or its current target spontaneously disappearing while both they and Item 1984 are unobserved.</p>
<p>The Item’s primary impediment is an apparent obsession with avoiding detailed observation; Item 1984 exclusively occupies areas or positions where only its silhouette and/or shadow are visible, and appears to possess an awareness of its own visibility to all observers. If Item 1984 encounters an area where its features would become visible, the Item will attempt to alter light sources to generate shadowed regions it can occupy, and if unsuccessful will avoid entering the area whatsoever. Individuals can utilise this to temporarily postpone a pursuit, however the Item will navigate around such areas and resume once able.</p>
<p>Recordings of previous encounters indicate Item 1984 is primarily focused on locating ‘Mr. Message,’ and/or acquiring information to assist such. An increasing number of Foundation personnel have reported being pursued by the Item and/or witnessing it within a Foundation facility. It is currently unclear how many missing personnel have been abducted by the Item.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Capture<br/>
On 27/10/2025, Foundation telecommunications employee Jonas Delvin reported they were being pursued by Item 1984 throughout several public spaces. A Mobile Task Force was immediately dispatched, who co-operated with Mr. Delvin to entrap the Item in a location where it could not avoid observation, nor escape without its features becoming clearly seen.</p>
<p>Once captured, Item 1984 was transported to its pre-prepared containment chamber at Facility 04, where the following audio-only interview was conducted.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 27/10/2025</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Item 1984</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Stein</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Hello, Mr. Shadows.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Hello, Mr. Foundation. Shall we skip the formalities? You want information, I want basic rights, we agree to exchange the two. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> In essence, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Good. First request: turn off the light.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> The lights must stay on so you are visible.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Turn them down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> They are already on the lowest setting.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Then find a different way to watch. Use night-vision cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> The light from the television will cause glare –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Then remove it. I want the lights gone or turned down. If you won’t do that, I have no reason to cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> … very well, I will see what we can do. Is this light distressing?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7394">My conversation with Mr. Leaf was recorded.</a> You know about the curse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> You did not call it a curse at the time, only ‘changes.’ What is the extent of this curse?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> As I said then. Light changes us. Gives us new knacks, characteristics, obsessions. Compulsions. Darkness slows it. Nothing stops it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> And what caused this curse? How did it begin?</p>
<p><em>[A long pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> You have only told us what we already know. Early cooperation will go a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> … Fine. Matches, Watches, and I were first. Ignoring Leaf. We got along well. Nothing unusual. Then Watches started staring. Would see someone and just stop, and watch them. Sometimes it was brief. Other times… he fought if we pulled him away. Matches started copying people.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> I started following. Didn’t realise it – just… walking somewhere, then kept seeing someone. Thought they were following <em>me</em>. I couldn’t stop. Still can’t. I choose the targets now, but I’m always following someone. Always. I can’t make myself stop.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> You’ve stopped now, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> … then who are you following?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> You.</p>
<p><em>[A brief pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> I… see.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> They thought we were misbehaving. We got into trouble. More when Ties &amp; Suit and Present went strange too. ‘Bad influence.’ ‘Our fault.’ Then…</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Mr. Shadows?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Watches showed his… new knacks. We all followed. People couldn’t escape me anymore. When I followed, neither of us could stop it. Went places I shouldn’t be. Followed Doctor to a board meeting once.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> The half of us done went bad. The others… came out <em>really</em> bad, from the start. Only got worse. Mr. Yawns. Mr. Tears. Hide &amp; Hunt. Weather. Then…</p>
<p><em>[A long pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Then…?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Doctor’s last idea. Mr. Message.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Hm. I recall you blame Mr. Message for your shared condition – the curse?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Yes. This is his fault.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> How? You said this started with you, long before Mr. Message existed – how is he responsible?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> He knows what it is. It’s a part of him. We were all independent ideas, brought in for the list. ‘A man made of trees.’ ‘A man made of shadows.’ Mr. Message was different. His idea came from what was happening to us. We were twisted by the curse. Message was <em>made</em> by it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> I see. So, dealing with him will… lift the curse?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Don’t know. He does. Said as much, before he…</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> The Doctor abandoned us, because of him. Cancelled the project. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8429">Unfinished were left unfinished.</a> The worst were dealt with. Rest of us, forgotten, ignored, left to ourselves. Still would be, if they hadn’t realised Message could…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Realised…?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> … nothing. Message knows something. Maybe how to fix this. But he didn’t say. We could have at least been a complete batch. He took that from us.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> So you are looking for Mr. Message to get revenge.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> This life was going to be better. He’s left me living as someone else’s shadow.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> This life…?</p>
<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Mr. Shadows?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Move on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> … very well. Could you describe Mr. Message for me?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Male, African-American, six feet four. White curly hair. Red suit, gold clothes, purple tie. Tattoo on… left arm, tattoo on left arm. Changed his clothes, I think. Fits his theme.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> It does? How?</p>
<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Mr. Shadows? How does your description fit his theme?</p>
<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Is this sufficient for my request?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> … I believe so. I will get the containment personnel to –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> I have a new request.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> … I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> You will find Mr. Message. You will give him to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> We can organise a meeting between you –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> No. Not meeting. You find him; you capture him; you give him to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> I’m sorry, but I can only guarantee a meeting. Once he is in containment –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> You will give him to me. I will tell you everything. Once I have him. No negotiations.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong><br/>
On 23/04/2026, Site Director Maylenne Ptriovski did not arrive at Facility 04 during her usual work hours, and could not be contacted; attempts to contact her husband were also unsuccessful. A subsequent investigation found that Director Ptriovski, Mr. Ptriovski, and their children had disappeared from their residence during the night, with neighbours reporting no unusual activities or events.</p>
<p>The surveillance footage of Facility 04 was reviewed for any potential information regarding Director Ptriovski’s whereabouts; the following transcript is of their office immediately prior to their departure from the facility.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>[Site Director Ptriovski is sitting at their desk, working on their computer. They are alone.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> Enter!</p>
<p><em>[A pause. Director Ptriovski looks up at the door; a moment later they stand and walk over, open the door, and step aside as if allowing someone to pass. They test the doorhandle briefly before turning back to the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> No. Everything’s been fine on my end.</p>
<p><em>[A pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> Go ahead.</p>
<p><em>[Director Ptriovski turns slightly to face her desk. A longer pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> I was just finishing anyway. Let me log out first.</p>
<p><em>[Director Ptriovski steps behind her desk. She shakes the computer’s mouse, then after a moment taps a key on the keyboard; she frowns, and presses the monitor’s power button.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> Did you –</p>
<p><em>[A pause. Director Ptriovski sighs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Director Ptriovski:</strong> Nothing important. Please be more careful next time. Have a good night.</p>
<p><em>[Director Ptriovski leaves the office, closing the doors behind them. The room’s lighting turns off ten minutes later. The wall behind the desk is illuminated by the computer screen, forcing both cameras to adjust and obscuring the room in darkness.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Footsteps are heard. A figure identical to Item 1984 approaches the front of the desk, with only their silhouette visible. The figure rotates the computer to face them, the screen silhouetting them and preventing the cameras from entering low-light mode.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The figure opens a blank document and types several lines of text, periodically referring to a note in one hand. When finished, they turn the monitor off; both cameras enter low-light mode, but the figure is absent by the time the room is visible again.]</em></p>
</div>
<p>An entity identical to Item 1984 was found to have infiltrated Facility 04 on 22/04/2026, rapidly alternating targets between unaware personnel to navigate to Director Ptriovski’s office undetected; Item 1984 had not escaped its containment, and was visible in its chamber for the duration of these events.</p>
<p>The following document had been left on Director Ptriovski’s computer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maylenne Ptriovski and her family have been found by a New Little Mister, a discontinued product from Dr. Wondertainment.</p>
<p>Be Mr. Helpful, and find Mr. Message.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Interrogation</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 23/04/2026</p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Item 1984</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Stein</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Where is Maylenne Ptriovski?</p>
<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Mr. Shadows, this is not a negotiation. Tell us where she is. Now.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> I don’t have them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Shadows, we’ve seen the note, and the surveillance footage. We know there’s more than one of you.</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Of course. Shadows – plural.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Steins:</strong> Enough! You will return the Site Director immediately –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> If you don’t cooperate, we will turn the lights up –</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> No, you will not. The curse could prevent me from returning the Ptriovski’s. They will stay with Ties &amp; Suits. You will bring me Mr. Message. We will exchange the two. Be quick. Mrs. Suits has compulsions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> You believe you are in control, now?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> I can acquire more valuable targets. You are on a deadline. You will cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> And what if I open this door?</p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> Releasing me will not –</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> What if I open this door, and look in? Look straight at you, with the lights showing you from every side?</p>
<p><em>[A long pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> That is a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> Maybe it is, but it sounds like it would be quite distressing for you, too. So, right here, right now, you will tell me where the Director and her family is, you will tell me where Mr. Ties &amp; Mrs. Suits are, and you will surrender your other bodies, however many of them there are. Or I will open this door, and walk in.</p>
<p><em>[A long pause. Item 1984 sighs, audibly adjusting their clothes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Item 1984:</strong> I knew I would need this one day. I was fine with staying, but you are being inhospitable. I will send instructions for contacting me.</p>
<p><em>[A metallic item clatters across the ground.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stein:</strong> <em>Gua</em>–</p>
<p><em>[A loud bang.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Item 1984 used a flash grenade concealed on its person to simultaneously blind all surveillance cameras in the chamber; the Item was absent by the time the cameras recovered.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong><br/>
On 18/07/2026, local police in Ontario, Canada, discovered the corpse of Foundation telecommunications employee Jonas Delvin, reported missing in Arizona three days after Item 1984 was contained. Mr. Delvin had been bound and tortured, and dressed postmortem in a tuxedo and bowtie, matching the signature characteristic of the ongoing ‘Dress Code Killer’ murders.</p>
<p>An inner pocket contained a note detailing a television broadcast which would notify Item 1984 of Mr. Message’s capture, and two polaroid photographs: one of the Ptriovski family posing in a room, all restrained and dressed in formal suits and ties; the second was of Facility 13 Director Alex Jameson, taken from a distance in public.</p>
