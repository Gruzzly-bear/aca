            <h1>SCP-8671</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8671</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8671 is to remain in a deactivated state within Site-49's high-security storage vault for the purposes of historical preservation and technical analysis. As of 2004, access to SCP-8671 or its associated documentation requires Level 4/8671 security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8671 refers to an unfinished humanoid mechanical exosuit constructed between 1943 and 1945 by the <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal">Sonderkommando für Paranormales</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> (SKP). It was intended for use in ground engagements by specialized German troops.</p>
<p>SCP-8671 is 2.8 meters tall and consists of a reinforced steel-acralt alloy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> frame, hydraulic musculature encased in heavy armor plates, a cockpit designed to house a single pilot, and three weapon mounts: one on the left forearm, one on the right hand, and one on the left shoulder. These mounts were intended to accommodate a railgun resembling a MG-131 machine gun, a multi-purpose "siege claw," and an experimental particle cannon respectively.</p>
<p>Recovered design schematics indicate that SCP-8671 includes, or was designed to include, a wide variety of additional support systems and features, such as a gravity-manipulating device capable of decreasing SCP-8671's effective mass by up to 72% by generating an anti-gravity field around it, a rudimentary propulsion system, and an automatic self-destruction mechanism that activates upon the forced opening of the cockpit by an individual of non-Germanic descent.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 38% of SCP-8671's internal systems lack parts, have degraded to the point of uselessness, or were never fabricated. In addition, it lacks a functional power source. SKP documentation references a device designated the "Vril-Z3 Resonance Core,"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> but no such component was recovered during initial discovery or containment. Without this component, SCP-8671 is entirely inoperable.</p>
<p>SCP-8671, along with several associated documents, was discovered on 8 April 1945 inside a former SKP research, development, and manufacturing facility located in Nordhausen, Germany. Due to its convenient location and its mass (3.5 metric tons), which made transportation to a secure site difficult, SCP-8671 was left in situ. The facility later fell under Foundation jurisdiction following the end of World War II and was subsequently repurposed as Containment Site-49.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Formally established in 12 May 1935 under the direct authority of Heinrich Himmler, the Sonderkommando für Paranormales originated as a splinter faction of the Foundation's German branch, following increasing political pressure and internal ideological fractures across several major Foundation facilities in Germany. The group was composed largely of former Foundation personnel who were sympathetic to National Socialist ideology.</p>
<p>Unlike the Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps, whose activities focused primarily on the broad militarization of anomalous artifacts, the SKP functioned as Himmler's personal body of parascientists, theorists, and engineers. Their mandate centered on the development of practical methods for utilizing anomalous objects to further the goals of the Third Reich, regardless of ethical constraints and unimpeded by the Foundation's containment-first ideology.</p>
<p>By late 1943, the advance of Allied troops and mounting casualties resulted in severe personnel and resource shortages across Germany. Recovered internal documentation reveals that this deficit directly impeded the SKP's ongoing operations. In response, Himmler authorized a covert initiative, designated Operation Eisenherz, which tasked SKP agents with locating and conscripting (forcibly or otherwise) individuals associated with Group of Interest-004 ("Church Of The Broken God") to mitigate the effects of this situation.</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Details of Operation Eisenherz</p>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 12 November 1943</p>
<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong> The ongoing material shortages and unacceptable delays in the development of multiple projects necessitate the immediate acquisition of skilled laborers with extensive technical knowledge. Unfortunately, all available German personnel lack the understanding of exotic principles required for the creation of advanced as well as paranormal armament and other systems.</p>
<p>Fortunately, several analyses conducted by intelligence agents confirm that multiple sects of Paranormal Organization 004 ("Church of the Broken God") remain active in Germany. This is significant, as members of these sects possess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive practical knowledge in several mechanical fields</li>
<li>Familiarity with the handling and production of exotic alloys</li>
<li>A documented ability to construct devices exceeding the limits of conventional engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the Reichsführer-SS has authorized the clandestine acquisition and conscription of adherents of this religion for cooperation in selected projects, effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Result of Operation Eisenherz</p>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 04 January 1944</p>
<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong> Operation Eisenherz has concluded and has been deemed an operational success, though not without significant complications.</p>
<ul>
<li>47 individuals affiliated with PO-004 were detained</li>
<li>Of these, 30 were classified as technical assets</li>
<li>A further 11 possessed extensive paranormal augmentations, considered useful for experimentation</li>
<li>6 proved particularly troublesome and were executed</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, all detained subjects remain unwilling to properly cooperate, even under threat of punishment. Having said that, Operation Eisenherz has provided the SKP with a reliable pool of specialized labor and irreplaceable expertise. Future projects are expected to proceed at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>It is my personal recommendation that the exploitation of surviving sect members in Germany continue until the conclusion of the war or until all relevant research objectives are fulfilled.</p>

<p>By early April 1945, Allied ground forces had advanced into central Germany, prompting an emergency evacuation order across several SKP facilities. Remaining SKP personnel attempted to destroy or relocate anomalous materials and documentation, among them SCP-8671, but were unable to carry out this goal due to interference from the Foundation and the Allied Occult Initiative.</p>
<p>In the years following the end of World War II, the majority of anomalous assets fabricated or seized by the SKP and Obskurakorps were either destroyed or taken into custody by the Global Occult Coalition. SCP-8671 is one notable exception, having been preserved inadvertently as a result of jurisdictional arrangements established with the AOI during the war.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> PoI-2776 (Elyra Müller)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Johannes Keller</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 16 April 1945</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> PoI-2776 was one of the surviving individuals conscripted by the SKP during Operation Eisenherz. At the time of recovery, she exhibited signs of severe exhaustion, malnutrition, and considerable wear in the mechanical prostheses serving as her hands.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> You already asked me that yesterday, but fine. Elyra Müller, devotee of the Broken One, if that part also matters to you people.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> It does, thank you. Now, Elyra, you were found inside this facility. Why? How did you come to be here?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> How do you think? They broke into our hideout in Leipzig, dragged us out at gunpoint. Told us we were "needed for the salvation of the Reich."</p>
<p><strong>[PoI-2776 laughs weakly]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> Right. They only needed our hands and whatever they could pull out of our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> You were being forced to work for the SKP?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> I… <em>we</em> were enslaved, yes. Do… not make me repeat myself.</p>
<p><strong>[Dr. Keller nods]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Now, based on what we recovered, it appears you were assigned to a project involving a mechanical exosuit. What can you tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> The… the big metal suit? It…</p>
<p><strong>[Pause]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> They had made the frame before we arrived. It was bulky and crude, more than it is now. It had no power system, and yet they wanted us to prepare it for an engine they didn't even have yet, the brutes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> But they believed you could do it?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> They believed we could do anything. They think our faith is some kind of… infinite workshop that can churn out everything they ask for.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> What work did you and your peers perform, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> We patched their metallurgy, tuned their armature, and forged some of its internals. They tasked us with making it as light as possible, but… you can see how that turned out.</p>
<p><strong>[Pause]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> The documentation we discovered mentions a core. Did you ever see it?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> No. They talked about it like it was already built, but we never saw even a sketch. Whatever it was, they kept it secret from us. We tried telling them their machine would never work without a heart, and they just said they’d get one "soon."</p>
<p><strong>[Soft snort]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> Soon never came.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Aside from the suit, did you work on any other projects?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> Too many. The Germans had a lot of ideas, though most of them would never be finished on time if that hunk of metal is anything to go by.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Could you be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>[PoI-2776 shakes her head]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> They didn't trust us enough to tell us what we were working on most of the time, and we never asked either. They simply gave us blueprints and materials, and once we were done they would give us another set of blueprints and materials, most of the time for something completely unrelated to the previous piece. This project is the one I know the most about, and even then it's not a whole lot.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> Did you collaborate willingly on any of this?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> I collaborated to stay alive. Everyone did.</p>
<p><strong>[Sigh]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> Believe me, I’m not loyal to dead men in black uniforms. Not after… everything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I see. What was the punishment for not cooperating?</p>
<p><strong>[Silence]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> I… do not want to talk about it, but it was mostly psychological. They wanted to keep us capable of working for as long as possible. I suppose physical torture would be counterproductive.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Keller:</strong> I see. Very well, that would be all for today Ms. Müller. Is there any closing comment you would like to add?</p>
<p><strong>[Pause]</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoI-2776:</strong> The others… please, treat them gently. They've… we've all been through hell.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> The following evaluations were conducted under wartime conditions with limited personnel and poor resource availability. Several components were substituted with improvised or otherwise adequate equivalents due to ongoing material shortages. Results should therefore be considered preliminary and not indicative of the final operational performance of each component.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test-01</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> "MG-131R" Electromagnetic Railgun Prototype.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Evaluate stability and recoil tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The MG-131R successfully accelerated a 13 mm ferrous slug to an estimated velocity of 1,900 m/s, exceeding previous recoil estimations by a 20% margin. This resulted in slight damage to the weapon mount during the fourth discharge. The temperature of the barrel was recorded as having exceeded 400 °C after emptying the magazine, with the cooling system taking longer than expected to activate.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Failure. The MG-131R prototype is not battlefield-ready yet. It requires urgent improvements to reduce recoil and enhance the cooling system.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test-02</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Multi-Purpose Siege Claw.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Evaluate responsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The claw performed as expected, grabbing, crushing, and cutting all materials it was tested on. Attempts to perform rapid movements in quick succession led to a system malfunction and erratic trembling. Leakage of hydraulic fluid was visible during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Partial success. The claw is functional but unreliable, and prone to malfunction under continuous use or rapid movements.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> A conscriptee of PO-004 provided recommendations to address the leakage issue. These recommendations are currently being evaluated.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Test-03</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> "Hydra" Particle Projection Array</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Confirm the feasibility of initiating a controlled particle stream.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A complete activation of the device was impossible due to the lack of an adequate energy supply. Several low-power tests were conducted, and the device produced faint discharges. Two technicians received moderate, though not lethal, radiation exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Inconclusive. The lack of the Vril-Z3 Core prevented any meaningful evaluation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> In late 1987, the Foundation's internal network infrastructure (at the time still transitioning from site-localized databases to an organization-wide interlinked digital system) experienced a series of unauthorized access attempts and irregularities in data packets. While the incident was initially attributed to system malfunctions, a subsequent RAISA investigation conducted in 1993 determined that a partial database breach was likely to have occurred during the event.</p>
<p>In July 2004, Foundation intelligence assets embedded within the Global Occult Coalition reported the deployment of a new class of heavy mechanized exosuits, designated internally as Mk. III Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis (Orange Suit), used by personnel of the PHYSICS Division during several anti-cult military operations in Azerbaijan and the Kamchatka Peninsula. Blueprints and related documentation relating to the Orange Suits, later acquired from the GOC's central database by undercover members of Mobile Task Force Delta-5 ("Front Runners"), revealed extensive similarities between these assets and SCP-8671's frame design, with numerous improvements and modifications meant to compensate for the original design's incomplete nature.</p>
<p>Although the GOC has officially denied all allegations of utilizing foreign paratechnology or design data, all evidence suggests that the Coalition (or one of its member organizations) obtained access to at least one version of SCP-8671's documentation sometime between 1987 and 1988, as that is when the conceptualization phase of the orange suit began. As such, the clearance level required to access materials pertaining to SCP-8671 has been raised from Level 2 (Restricted) to Level 4 (Secret) to guard against further leaks.</p>
