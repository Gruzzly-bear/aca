<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-6782 are to be reported to Site-228 security personnel upon manifestation. Staff are instructed not to engage SCP-6782 instances in direct combat or prolonged observation unless authorized.</p>
<p>All captured instances are to be contained in separate containment units at Site-228's humanoid containment wing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6782 is a group of diminutive humanoid entities that manifest sporadically within Site-228. Instances measure approximately 10 cm in height and appear dressed in armor resembling medieval gear.</p>
<p>Each SCP-6782 instance has a glowing red horizontal bar suspended approximately 2 cm above its head. It has no apparent physical form but appears visible to all observers and dims or vanishes entirely upon the entity's termination.</p>
<p>SCP-6782 instances frequently engage in seemingly unprovoked combat, either against Foundation personnel, each other, or non-anomalous small fauna and equipment.</p>
<p>Additionally, during these offensive actions, a larger, brighter red bar will manifest roughly 5 cm above the ground in front of the instance, aligned with their target.</p>
<p>Notable encounters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of five SCP-6782 instances cornered and attacked a cockroach colony near the garbage disposal chute. The cockroaches retaliated, and at least two SCP-6782 instances were observed vanishing mid-battle as they were terminated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A duel between two instances in Laboratory 3-C. The fight concluded when one tackled the other into a sink drain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A group of eight SCP-6782 instances flanking and repeatedly striking Dr. Kraf's Roomba using miniature hammers and spears. The Roomba continued to operate uninterrupted, but three instances were launched across the office by its movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an SCP-6782 instance is terminated, its body disappears in a faint flash of light. Despite this, visually identical instances may reappear in future manifestations. It is unconfirmed whether the instances are the same or not.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 25 contained instances.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.6782-1: Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>Date: 11/03/2021.</p>
<p>At 14:36, an SCP-6782 instance appeared underneath the desk of Researcher Hanford. Surveillance footage shows the instance brandishing a tiny sword and striking Hanford’s right foot repeatedly for several minutes. Hanford did not appear to notice as he was busy performing an autopsy on a rat that was involved in an SCP-████ experiment. A red horizontal bar, approximately one meter above the ground, was seen hovering in front of Hanford's feet during the attack and gradually shrank over the course of five minutes.</p>
<p>At the moment the red bar fully disappeared, Hanford collapsed and experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Emergency medical staff were dispatched, and Hanford was successfully revived and transported to the medical wing. He has since recovered.</p>
<p>Approximately six hours later, a new SCP-6782 instance manifested in the break room. The instance bore identical physical traits to the one from the earlier incident, but now wore a miniature version of Hanford’s lab coat as a cape. It was also armed with Hanford’s missing scalpel, dragging it on the floor because of its weight.</p>
