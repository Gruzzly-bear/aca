<p>Containment Site-22 was erected around SCP-8404’s location with a 20m radius ‘Red Zone’ established around the containment chamber. No living entity is permitted to enter this zone. Foundation personnel who must enter this zone for maintenance and repair of containment devices, or the neutralisation of SCP-8404-1 entities must carry with them a portable Scranton Reality Anchor in order to prevent transmutation.</p>
<p>24/7 maintenance of vital SIMULACRUM systems is to be maintained at all times. Should a containment breach occur, automated emergency systems will attempt to neutralise SCP-8404 and any SCP-8404-1 instances.</p>
<p>MTF-Lambda-22 will be on standby as site security as well as assisting in evacuation or re-containment of SCP-8404.</p>

<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></span> SCP-8404 is a large deific entity approximately 50m at its full length. Its appearance varies between viewers, however, certain elements remain constant. These include an upper half which appears almost humanoid with reptilian features, with its lower half being completely reptilian with scales and clawed feet, if legs are present at all.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="echidna_statue.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8404/echidna_statue.jpg"/>

</div>
<p>Occult historians and other evidence point to SCP-8404 being the physical manifestation of Echidna.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from its unnatural strength and ability to breathe fire, SCP-8404’s main anomalous property is to mutate living organisms and nonliving matter into instances of SCP-8404-1. These instances vary widely in appearance.</p>
<p>In living subjects, they are usually a composite of the non-anomalous subject and several other animals<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. The process is extremely painful and involves the conversion or growing of new appendages belonging to a separate animal.</p>
<p>In non-living subjects<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, a similar process is observed. Dissection of these instances shows a fusion of new organic material with the inorganic material containing rudimentary circulatory and nervous analogous systems. SCP-8404 notably favours using already living organisms or organic tissue rather than inorganic material.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-8404-1 retain a certain level of autonomy but will become loyal to SCP-8404. This effect persists even after all mutated tissue is amputated from affected subjects.</p>

<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>PROJECT LETHE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Following the capture of SCP-8404, it was noted that its anomalous property was still active even when the anomaly remained unconscious, albeit at a reduced rate. The SCP-8404-1 instances produced at this time were more aggressive and erratic, attacking any human they came into contact with.</p>
<p>However, after brain wave scans of SCP-8404, Foundation researchers found that SCP-8404-1 transmutation only occurred outside of the REM stage of the sleep cycle. Short-term success with high-dosage sleeping medication was found, however, the high cost and inconsistent results required a more permanent solution. As such, Project Lethe was initiated.</p>
<p>Using an isolated SIMULACRUM network, SCP-8404 is to be placed in a Class-B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> pre-rendered environment. This environment will be inhabited by several NPCs, the majority of which use predictive text to mimic a simple conversation. Two companion AI characters with higher capacity dialogue generators are to follow SCP-8404.</p>
<p>A single camera is present to follow SCP-8404 at all times, giving a live feed of its actions. While only one camera is able to give a live feed at a time, researchers will also be able to monitor SCP-8404 as well as the surrounding environment through the free pathing replay function which saves a recording of all activity and conversation within a certain area.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to place SCP-8404 in an environment indistinguishable from consensus reality with no physical matter. Through this, its anomalous effect can be neutralised.</p>

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> That’s our school uniform. But I’ve never seen you before… Oh! Are you the new transfer student? Pleasure to meet you. My name is Ichiro Tadashi.</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT extends its hand for a handshake. SCP-8404 does not reciprocate.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> The school is that way, but we gotta hurry or we’ll miss homeroom!</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT runs in the direction of the school, SCP-8404 looks at it in confusion before following.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> <em>(muttering)</em>What in Hades’ name is a home room?</p>
<p><em>The two silently walk to the school. SCP-8404 observes its surroundings, showing a typical Japanese city street. The sun is bright and the ambient sound of cicadas can be heard.

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> We’re here.</p>
<p><em>The school is sparsely crowded with student NPCs. They ignore SCP-8404 who does not interact with them.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-8404 hesitates but enters the school grounds and into the main building.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Fine.</p>

<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Good for you! Oi Tadashi-kun, your noodles are getting cold. Are you still doing homework?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I will, but I can’t seem to figure out this question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> That one? Simpleton human. You didn’t account for the constant when you integrated the exponential figure.</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT looks at its question, thinks, and solves the question.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> You’re right. Wow Midori-san, that’s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Tch. I was there when calculus was invented. It was no surprise during the mathematics class I was bored out of my mind. Don’t get me started on biology class.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> You must be like a genius or something. Are all the classes easy for you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Of course they are. Except for history. Normally I would excel in this too but I am unfamiliar with this distant otherworldly country.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> You mean Japan?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Ehhh? So you do have weaknesses!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What?! No! I would never reveal such a thing!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Ha ha! You’re funny Midori-chan. Were you like this in your previous school?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Come to think of it, you never told us where you transferred from.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 stops midway from placing another noodle in its mouth.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-8404 releases the food from its fingers..</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> …It does not matter. All I know is that I am here now.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> That is a good mindset to have.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Yeah! It’s always great to be grateful for what you have now!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 looks down at its hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What I have now huh? Tch.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Perhaps you have people from your hometown you miss?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Oh right! Did you have classmates you ate lunch with like this?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> …No. There is no one left from where I come from. Damn Foundation. I do remember eating with my… creations, similar to this, but I always kept my distance. I do not expect you humans to understand.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Well, they may not be here now, but now you have us!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> She’s trying to say she wants to be your friend like the ones you miss.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> They’re not… <em>(sigh)</em> I realised I am unable to summon the energy to argue with you. You may be my ‘friend’ Sumiko.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Yay!</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Ugh.</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT laughs.</em></p>
<p><em>It checks its watch and its eyes widen..</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Oh no! Lunch break is almost over! We have to go for another class and then P.E.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Yay! I heard they’re doing baseball later!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It’s too bad I’m no good at sports.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Midori-chan have you played baseball before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What in Zeus’ name is a base-ball?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> You’ve never played? It’s a good thing I love sports so I can teach you.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> The reflexes in this accursed body are serviceable but I am not used to holding such an implement yet.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Well that's just everyone when they first start something new. Who knows, maybe you’ll become the best in the school.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> To display my superiority over these feeble creatures does sound enticing…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Ehh, so you did enjoy it…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Enough with your insinuations. I simply found it less mundane than listening to information I already know. Sumiko was also quiet for once.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Until she saw you hit the ball once.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> My moment of glory overtaken by that… thing.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I think she means well. We’ve known each other for a while.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Whatever. I give you gratitude for being my guide and bringing me to my… home.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> You’re welcome! Anyway, I’ll see you tomorrow at school.</p>

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Point taken… But speaking of the other students, have you noticed something strange about them? L-like they don’t talk to us like we talk to each other?</p>

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Because I don’t want her to get hurt! You know how she is, she’s a little strange so I don’t know how she’d react to the news!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Hmm… You’re right. But we should tell her when we’re certain there’s something wrong. I… don’t want to make her worry for nothing.</p>

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I just realised. We don’t speak. We just make words and we read them in our minds. Wait, let me try something.</p>

<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It doesn't make sense. What makes just the two of us special?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I don't know. But it's been getting worse too.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I'm seeing… the stuff underneath all of it. It's how I saw this place. There's like little lamps and lines following everyone, even us. It's so weird!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Oh those.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> You see them too?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I thought I was just sleep-deprived.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> <em>(sigh)</em> I wish all of this could just be solved by just going back to bed. But here we are. Just the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> We still don't know if it's just the two of us. Maybe we're not the only real people around here. Maybe there's more of us who can help. What about Midori?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I just don't want to!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> We said we would tell her if we found something and we did!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> It doesn't feel right!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I'M NOT GETTING MY BEST FRIEND INVOLVED IN THIS!</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> <em>(sigh)</em> Fine. What about our other classmates then?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> You really think the things out <em>there</em> are people?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> We've been with them for…</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> For how long huh? I don't even know how long we've lived for!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> But still, they're still people!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS gets up and walks to the wall.</em></p>
<p><em>It pokes its head out into the corridor, reaches its hand out, and pulls in another student by the collar.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko-san what are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Cut the honorifics Tadashi, we're not even speaking Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I-</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Look. Hey, I'm going to gouge your eyes out. Are you fine with that?</p>
<p>STUDENTCHAR_31: Uhhh, do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> That's it? That's your reaction?</p>
<p>STUDENTCHAR_31: Look, if you don't have anything good to say, could you please leave me be?</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS’ model flickers.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I could sink my teeth into your neck and pull out your throat. How about that?</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS begins to breathe heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Huh?! Answer the question, dumbass!</p>
<p>STUDENTCHAR_31: Could you please leave me be?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> See! It's just a thing that repeats the same thing over and over again. Just a… just a…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko?</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS stares at the NPC's neck. It licks its lips.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> A sack of meat.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko stop!</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS bites down hard on STUDENTCHAR_31’s neck. A look of bliss is seen on its face. It closes its eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>The teeth do not penetrate the skin. NPC does not react as physical trauma does not cause pain in the simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>It opens its eyes again and pushes itself away from the NPC in fear. CE-02-NS is seen covering its mouth as it falls to its knees.</em></p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS is no longer flickering.</em></p>
<p>STUDENTCHAR_31: Could you please leave me be?</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT pushes STUDENTCHAR_31 out into the corridor where it resumes its designated pathing.</em></p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT crouches down next to CE-02-NS.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Hey, hey calm down everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Fine?! I just tried to EAT them!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> But you didn't do it in the end. That counts for something right?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I… I wish I could say that. I really did bite. I wanted to taste his flesh so bad but…</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS’ hands begin shaking.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> But I only stopped because I legitimately couldn't do it. No matter how hard I tried, I wasn't strong enough to rip out his flesh with my teeth. God even when I give in, this damn place won't give the damn satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS covers its eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>It begins to sob.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Do you think… if whatever is watching us finds me, they'll reset me too? Maybe I'll go back to normal like the rest of–</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Don't say that. Please.</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT grabs CE-02-NS by the shoulders.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> If we are the only ones, if you go… I won't have anyone else. Please.</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS sighs and holds CE-01-IT.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Okay… I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>The CEs sit in silence for several minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> How long can we live like this?</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Tadashi?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori-cha- <em>(clears throat)</em> Midori? What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I forgot my school bag.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Oh. I think it's at your table. You can just grab it and leave.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 stands at the doorway.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no schoolbag at SCP-8404’s desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Where's Sumiko? I thought you were walking home with her?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I told her to go ahead first.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I… I wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> About what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Really?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Do you think I am an idiot? That you don't think I didn't notice you being distant? I see you avoiding everyone and how miserable you look. Do not lie to me Tadashi.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It's not something you should be concerned about.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Tadashi I'm worried about–</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 begins to blush.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> <em>(ahem)</em> I am concerned about your well being.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 remains at the door, not moving.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Can I at least sit with you?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Yes please.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 slowly walks closer to CE-01-IT. It hesitates but sits down next to it.</em></p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT and SCP-8404 sit next to each other, both stare at the setting sun out of the classroom window. No dialogue is detected for several minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I just… feel like I don't fit into this world anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It's gonna sound a bit silly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Just speak. You don't need to be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I've been learning a lot about myself and my place in the world we live in. But whenever I try to think about it, it just doesn't add up. No matter how I try, I don't think I'll have a place in this world.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 places a hand on its shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Like the whole world is against your very existence? The one flaw in a great tapestry that needs to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Well um… yes actually. That's exactly right. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Hmph! Perhaps if you listened more, you'd know about my great wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Heh. Yeah, you've always been smarter than me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> And you've always been kinder.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I have?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> When we first met, you guided me despite my… initial character.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> That was before I…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Before what? Despite everything, you and Sumiko have remained by my side. The least I can do is be by your side now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> To feel foreign in the world you have lived in all your life. That is a feeling I have felt far too often. And it is one I will never wish upon you.</p>
<p><em>They hold hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori… I don't know what to say… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What's that thing Sumiko says? Don't mention it.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Heh, yeah. Sumiko…</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT stands up.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori there's something I have to tell you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 blushes again.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> W-what?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It's a little complicated but…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Are you confessing your love to me?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> H-huh?! No! I mean it's not that I- Nevermind! There's something about this world that–</p>
<p><em>As it stood up, CE-01-IT whipped its head up and looked into the viewport.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I-I’m fine, I just need… I… oh my god. It's you. You're the common factor.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori. I need to do something. Meet me at the field in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What? Why? Tadashi what is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori I promise I will explain everything. I can't say it now, but I need time and you to meet me there. Do you trust me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 hesitates.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 sighs.</em></p>

<p><em>SCP-8404 sits in the classroom, waiting.</em></p>
<p><em>The sun sets. Setting the skybox to transition to night mode.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, a bright light is seen from the classroom window, SCP-8404 and the simulation camera looks out of the window to investigate.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What in…</p>
<p><em>A white dome is formed around the schoolyard made up of a patchwork of textures with its lighting value set to maximum. Around the schoolyard, many models are missing parts of their geometry and textures incorrect, overlapping with each other, or missing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> They finally found me. Damn. Wait, that location… Tadashi is…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 widens its eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> …no. Nononono NO!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 scrambles to its feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> DAMN YOU FOUNDATION SCUM!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 runs downstairs to the school field, tripping multiple times. It stands outside the dome, analysing the structure.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 faces the sky.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> WELL FOUNDATION? I AM HERE! TAKE ME AND STOP THIS MADNESS! BUT PLEASE! Please…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 grits its teeth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> They are innocent! They are simply denizens of this world and do not deserve the punishment you plan for me! They’re my… my…</p>
<p><em>No response is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><em>It reaches to touch the dome, realising it is not solid. SCP-8404 retracts its hand, checking that it is unharmed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Mother Gaea if you still heed my call. Protect them.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 steps into the light which the camera attempts to follow.</em></p>
<p><em>At the time of the playback, the camera only sees darkness within the structure. However, upon entering this structure within the playback, a different scene can be seen.</em></p>
<p><em>Researchers prime SIMULACRUM killswitches.</em></p>
<p><tt>&gt; SIMULACRUM Freecam mode enabled.</tt></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 enters the schoolyard, breaching past the lighting errors. Inside the field, it is significantly brighter, and looking up reveals a recreation of the daytime skybox.</em></p>
<p><em>The textures and properties of the models in the yard have been altered severely. Holes in the environment puncture the walls and trees.</em></p>
<p><em>Pink errored textures interact with the wind physics which break off from their models and fly across the schoolyard. SCP-8404 shields its eyes from the pink ‘petals’.</em></p>
<p><em>In the middle of the yard, stands CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Tadashi! Sumiko? What are you doing here? Gods, nevermind at least you’re safe.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 nervously walks over to the CEs, avoiding the texture errors on the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> She’s here. I really hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 places a hand on each of their shoulders.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> This is going to be difficult to explain, but you need to leave this place immediately. There are powers beyond your understanding at work and you won’t be safe here. Leave this town or this country if you can. I’ll do my best to make sure those doing this will-</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT sheepishly smiles and rubs the back of his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Actually, it was kinda our doing.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 stands still, mouth agape.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You…</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Is everything–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You IDIOTS! WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?!</p>
<p><em>SIMULACRUM begins to shut down.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Silence! I need to concentrate.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 spreads its hands out.</em></p>
<p><em>At the time of replay, large amounts of Akiva radiation were recorded emanating from both the SIMULACRUM control monitors as well as SCP-8404’s comatose body.</em></p>
<p><em>Through unknown means, SIMULACRUM shutdown protocols were overridden.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 breathes heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Excellent. Thanks to the two of you, the Foundation knows my location in this realm and has come to kill us all!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 pinches the bridge of its nose.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Just a little peace in this place is all I wanted! <em>(sigh)</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Wait, Midori, you know about us being in a simulation too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> What in Hades’ name is a simulation?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Like in a computer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> That’s not helping.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> We looked around and this place isn’t right! It’s been weeks and there’s been strange stuff that’s been going on with–AH!</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS’ model flickers with CE-01-IT’s flickering soon after. They both strain in discomfort.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> This has been happening. We don’t know what’s wrong with the world or us. We’re not even sure what we are and we had to make sure you weren't suffering the same. We think you’re the link to what’s happening to us somehow.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> That’s… impossible.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 holds CE-02-NS’ face in its hands, inspecting it. Its eyes widen.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Midori?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> My magic had been alive since the beginning… at least in a diminished sense.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Magic?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> And you…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 inspects CE-01-IT’s face, the flickering appears to intensify when SCP-8404 makes direct contact.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Oh my. Fascinating…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> What is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You are… One of my own. Numbers. Life born from this facsimile. The very fabric of this world birthing new living beings. Incredible. No wonder you have such mastery over manipulating the materials of this realm.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Wait Sumiko, when the three of us first met…</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT holds its forehead.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> It’s really hazy, but I remember, you claimed to be someone else. I-I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me. I don’t know what’s wrong with my memory.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I don’t care about that! What did you mean by being born from whatever you just said?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> It was when you were given life most likely.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Midori what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> You mean born?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Midori, surely when we were outside the simulation we were born at some point right? Right?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko, I’ve been thinking about what we are and our behaviour along with our inconsistent memories.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> No. Shut up. I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko–</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I DON’T WANT TO HEAR IT!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> I don’t think we’re human.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> No… no. W-we’re humans! We eat, sleep, go to school and… Oh god…</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS falls to its knees and holds its head in its hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> O-our families…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> They don’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> We were never human.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I was never human either.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> <em>(sigh)</em> I suppose I owe you an explanation. Midori was the name I was given when I entered this strange dream. My real name is Echidna, given to me millenia ago. I am a life giver.</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS stand in shock.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Millenia? What are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Some called me a goddess. I spit in that title. That damned pantheon and their offspring only ever gave me pain and humiliation. The only thing I despised more than the gods were the accursed humans. They gave me another title: Monster. The empires they went by always changed by the ages but they still pursued me. The Greeks, the Romans, the Crusaders, and now, the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Are these the people who put us in this simulation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> If you mean the realm we inhabit, then yes.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Just humans. Just living beings that walk Gaea’s earth. Some powerful magi are among them but it is the same old. They captured me and put me in this dream.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Wait, if you’re this powerful person, why didn’t you escape?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Upon entering this place, I was unfamiliar with its laws and my new body. My magic was hindered because of it.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> B-but now that we’re all here, we can work together to get out of this place! You can show us the way out and we can help free each other!</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 looks at its hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Why would I do that?</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS creases its brow.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> It’s a simple answer.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> No it’s not! We can’t stay here! T-this place, we can’t eat, we have to fear being erased, it’s horrible!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I do not see a problem.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> How?!</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> If this Foundation people have trapped you here, isn’t this supposed to be some kind of prison?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 looks away, refusing to make eye contact with the CEs.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Why the hell won’t you at least try? Or why the hell can’t you see this crappy fake world for what it is?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Why? WHY?! YOU DARE?!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404’s model flickers. Its true form is visible for several frames.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Why? Why must I live in a world where I must be shunned from the rest of civilization? Cursed by the primordial existence, giving life to those around me only to have them see the same fate?!</p>
<p><em>It grits its teeth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I have seen… so much life springing from the very soil I step on, the blood I bleed, the animals I look upon just for them to be snuffed out! Do I deserve this existence? I do not know. But them?! It’s not FAIR!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 breathes heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Excuse me for wanting to escape such an accursed world. Excuse me for wanting to rest. That realm is better off without me and I without it!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> I…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Why can’t I just… go to school, chat with my best friends, fall asleep in class, and play games until the sun sets every day? Is it so evil of me to want to stay?! Because that is all I’ve been labeled for my existence.</p>
<p><em>The flickering around SCP-8404’s model ceases.</em></p>
<p><em>Tears drop down its face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Would it be so bad for the two of you to stay with me?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Midor- Echidna I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Maybe. But in the state that we are in, we cannot exist properly in this world. The last few weeks since finding out have been nothing short of torture.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404's eyes widen.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Oh. Is that why you came to me earlier? It was my fault… Gods. I am so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> It really has been hard.</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I’ve done it again. I’ve cursed another being to share my own torturous existence. Damn it all, even here!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Midori…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You must hate me so much. To give you the ‘gift' of life in such a counterfeit world. To taste the joys of being alive only for it to be ripped away in a second and be called false.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> The humans were right to call me a monster.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> You can’t be so–</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Forget it.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 snaps its fingers, the footage begins to distort and a large circular error in the simulation appears. The error flickers, the colours shifting but revealing a large unblinking reptilian eye, thaumaturgic symbols could be faintly seen at its edges. Akiva radiation spikes along SCP-8404’s comatose body at this time as well.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I regained my magic in its full capacity weeks ago. I knew I was able to escape this place but did not need to. Step through this gateway and you will appear in the ‘real’ world. Although I cannot guarantee where you will be, it is the least I can do.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 looks at CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> It seems that the two of you are better off without me as well.</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS slaps SCP-8404.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Sumiko!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Ow! You INSOLENT–</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Answer this question ‘goddess’. If you’re Echidna, then who is Midori? Was my best friend ever real?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I…</p>
<p><em>The feed flickers and a low hum is heard along with the audio.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Something is happening!</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> In a sense, Midori was never real. For a time, she was just the name that was forced upon me as I entered my prison. I resented that name. I believed it was the Foundation attempting to strip away everything I was.</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Oh…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> But over time I learned to embrace her, being her. Midori is a small part of who I am but she is still me as I am she.</p>
<p><em>The white noise intensifies and the stability of the replay decreases further.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Names, I have in abundance, but Kato Midori? This name is the first name I have been given to mean something kind. It is attached to so many cherished memories. Memories that are very much real…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 sobs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> And I suppose that makes Midori real too.</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS hugs SCP-8404. It has tears in its eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Kya! Sumiko!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 covers its mouth but slowly lets go. It wraps its arms around CE-02-NS, returning the hug.</em></p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> Then I could never hate you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I-</p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT hugs the two of them.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You two…</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> She’s right.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 closes its eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>The replay begins to glitch and show signs of instability.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I have never been able to create something large, intelligent, or kind enough to hug.</p>
<p><em>The three hug and remain in position for several seconds. It is unknown if this is a playback error.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I just–I just wish that I cherished them more.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 squeezes harder.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 steps away.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I cannot leave the exit open for very long. Go while you still can.</p>
<p><strong>CE-01-IT:</strong> Right… Be safe. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> You too.</p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS begins to sob.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>CE-02-NS:</strong> God I’m so sorry. There’s so many things I wish we could have done. I wish we went to the beach together, I wish we all graduated together, I wish we could have done so much more together…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> But you will be happy.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 breathes in. The Akiva radiation intensifies.</em></p>
<p><em>White noise begins to disrupt the audio.</em></p>
<p><em>CE-01-IT begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><em>CE-02-NS begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8404 begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><em>The CEs step closer to the visual error. SIMULACRUM replay detects multiple errors.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> Tadashi, Sumiko!</p>
<p><em>They turn around.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8404:</strong> I… cannot say for certain. B-but, I can swear on the name you cherish me by, I will do everything in my power to make sure this is not the last we see of each other!</p>
<p><em>Footage becomes heavily distorted.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>“Thank you!”</strong></span></p>
<p><em>At the time of recording, all SIMULACRUM systems experience a fatal error and go offline.</em></p>

<span class="hilighter"><strong>CONTAINMENT BREACH ALERT:</strong></span></p>
<p>On 10/7/2023, Containment Site-22 had reported a 7-minute outage in the simulation live feed. However, after the incident, the simulation resumed as per normal with SCP-8404 remaining in containment.</p>
<p>After investigations into the SCP-8404 containment systems, it was discovered that two hard drives were missing from the local SIMULACRUM servers which contained NPC savedata. No breach in the site was reported and SCP-8404 remained in its containment chamber in a comatose state.</p>
<p>Investigation is ongoing and an auditor is to analyse the recent SIMULACRUM playbacks for suspicious activity on the part of SCP-8404.</p>
<p>Further updates pending.</p>
