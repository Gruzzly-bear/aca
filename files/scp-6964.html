<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has received official approval from the United States government allowing it full and complete oversight of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Site-222 has been conscripted to oversee both the mundane upkeep of the memorial and containment of SCP-6964<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As reaching SCP-6964 requires an individual to fully scale Mount Rushmore, standard anti-trespassing signage consistent with other United States national parks alongside light security measures have proven effective for managing the anomaly. Falsified public reports have been created to perpetuate the claim that internal studies performed by the memorial's staff have proven the mountain is too unstable to have any further interference, such as adding a fifth face, in order to prevent any possible negative reaction from the SCP-6964 anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6964 refers to an extradimensional anomaly accessible from the peak of Mount Rushmore currently theorized to be Purgatory (as reported in Dante Alighieri's <em>Purgatorio</em>). Despite this hypothesis, SCP-6964 is noticeably different from the afterlife described within the Divine Comedy.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:280px;"><img alt="1200px-Aerial_view_of_Mount_Rushmore%2C_South_Dakota_LCCN2010630618_%28straightened%2C_enhanced%29.jpg?20231107075019" class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Aerial_view_of_Mount_Rushmore%2C_South_Dakota_LCCN2010630618_%28straightened%2C_enhanced%29.jpg/1200px-Aerial_view_of_Mount_Rushmore%2C_South_Dakota_LCCN2010630618_%28straightened%2C_enhanced%29.jpg?20231107075019"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Mount Rushmore, aerial view.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon entrance into the anomaly, an individual perceives SCP-6964 to be an extension of Mount Rushmore itself, with the mountain extending far higher than it does within consensus reality. Physically, this mountain has seven terraces, made up of heads of former United States presidents carved into the mountain, resemblant of baseline Mount Rushmore, with a flat surface at the top of each terrace above the heads to enable passage. All deceased individuals who previously held office as President have a carved head within SCP-6964<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, short of the four already represented by baseline Mount Rushmore<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, while the “punishments” given to inhabitants of each terrace are consistent with those described within <em>Purgatorio</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, the only inhabitants of the space currently conscripted to suffer through them are all deceased individuals who were formerly United States President; each face carved into a terrace corresponds to which of them are currently present on each. Due to its low and highly specific population, SCP-6964's relationship with Purgatory, and whether or not it is the full extent of the actual biblical Purgatory, remains under continued investigation by the <a href="/tactical-theology-hub">Department of Tactical Theology</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6964.1:</strong> Initial Exploration</p>
<p>Following the discovery of SCP-6964 and basic exploration protocols having been performed, the Site-222 administration approved a research convoy transported by Mobile Task Force Zeta-5 ("Stars and Stripes") and led by Senior Researcher Dr. Francis Own to further survey the anomaly.</p>
<p>During the exploration, the team encountered a humanoid entity hereafter referred to as SCP-6964-A. A transcript detailing this encounter has been placed below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>«Begin Log»</strong></p>
<p><em>[Drs. Francis Own and Alan Lock, alongside three agents from MTF Zeta-5, are surveying the area at the entrance of SCP-6964.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> So, you're telling me that you <em>really</em> prefer your potatoes baked rather than mashed? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> Own, we're on a research mission. We should be focusing on—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Nah, I'm not letting this go. How could you possibly prefer baked? It's so boring.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> Well, if you must know, it's a texture thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> How much of a texture difference could there possibly be between baked and mashed? It must be miniscule!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> I think you—</p>
<p><em>[A flash of red, white, and blue light suddenly appears in front of the team.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> What the fu—</p>
<p><strong>Z5-1:</strong> Get behind us, you two!</p>
<p><em>[Drs. Own and Lock retreat behind the MTF agents, as the light gradually dematerializes.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> What is that?</p>
<p><em>[In place of the light, a humanoid figure — SCP-6964-A — is visible. SCP-6964-A physically resembles common depictions of Uncle Sam, a popular personification of the United States.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Is that Uncle fucking Sam?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> That is correct, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> <em>You're</em> Uncle Sam?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Yes, my friend! It's been a while since I've had some visitors, and so many, too!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> What is this place, uh, Uncle Sam?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6964-A's gaze darkens slightly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Ah, well, it's a place I hoped any of our God-fearing American citizens would never have to see. So, while I'm happy to meet you all, I'm sorry it had to be like this. This is Purgatory, my friends.</p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Excuse me? It's—It's what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Yes, Purgatory. Though, probably not in the way you imagined. As much as the good book tries to describe it, it never really got it right. You see, this is where the big man upstairs sends those who have a debt to pay to him, and everyone here has a very, very special debt to pay. You can sort of consider me the prison warden.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Who's here, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> By the feathers of the great bald eagle, this place is specially reserved for those who had the glory of running our great country. Yes, those who were elected President in the most democratic country in the world!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> So… you're saying this is where dead presidents go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Absolutely, my friend! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to. Feel free to take a look around and say "hi" to some of our great American heroes!</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6964-A disappears in a flash of light.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence on recording.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Hey, Lock?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lock:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> I'm not letting it go. We're resuming the potato conversation when this is all over.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6964.2:</strong> Assorted Interview Excerpts</p>
<p>After being given free reign of the anomaly, Dr. Own proceeded to conduct interviews with various former presidents within it. Notable excerpts have been placed below:</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> So, how are you finding it here?</p>
<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Fucking awful. I have the worst of it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> How so?</p>
<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Well, let me learn you a thing or two, son. I don't know how this goddamn place works, but basically, I think it punishes you for having been president of our United States.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> That seems apt.</p>
<p><em>[A particularly thick cloud of the blinding, noxious smoke found throughout the third terrace spontaneously forms around Cleveland, causing him to erupt into a coughing fit.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> God, fuck, ugh. Well, I've technically been president twice, so now I get twice the goddamn punishment as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Yeah, and that fucker FDR gets away with having four terms just because they were all connected! It's bullshit. Besides, history should remember me better anyway after what he did.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> Internment?</p>
<p><strong>Cleveland:</strong> Marrying his cousin.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6964.3:</strong> Further Investigation</p>
<p>After interviewing all former presidents present within SCP-6964, Dr. Own reached the peak of the mountain, where he rediscovered SCP-6964-A.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> You know, I have a question if you don't mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Ask away, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Own:</strong> You mentioned before at the entrance to this place that the people here, the presidents, are here to pay off a debt. I mean, I understand a lot of them did horrible things, but shouldn't they be, well, downstairs because of all that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Well, I'm not permitted to talk about a lot of the details myself, but I'll do my best to paint you a picture. A long time ago, there was a man who your country celebrated so much that they put him on the $100 bill. He was the one who set everything in motion.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-6964-A:</strong> Yep, but I'm afraid that's all I'm allowed to tell you, friend.</p>

<p>Following the above interview, a Foundation agent embedded into the Federal Bureau of Investigations' <a href="/unusual-incidents-unit-hub">Unusual Incidents Unit</a> was alerted to search for any information of interest within the group's historical archives. Several days later, they sent a copy of the following document written by Benjamin Franklin and addressed to fellow Founding Father Alexander Hamilton:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Alex,</p>
<p>I know your ambitions are high, but do be warned; as a diplomat, I considered my job to go far beyond our allied countries. Yes, the matters of the spiritual — I believe — are just as important. To put it simply, I had to make a particularly important covenant five years ago, and the cost was high. I promise you, though, the resulting prosperity will be worth it. Our great nation — our haven of liberty and freedom — will become the greatest in the world, so long as we hold up our end of the bargain. Or, well, more accurately, the brave men who we elect hold up their end.</p>
<p>I will tell you more after our next meeting if you truly wish to run; I've already told anyone else who informed me of similar plans to ascend to the presidency so they know what they're getting into. Do inform me if you have heard of anyone else with the same idea. While I would rather keep things hushed, my guilty conscience prefers they know the price they'll pay.</p>
<p>Thank you, my friend,<br/>
Ben</p>
