Initiatives to expand this region to its previous natural range are ongoing. Mobile Task Force Lambda-40 ('Sasan's Sorcerers') will log meteorological and ecological data at every facility containing SCP-6736. Outside of Site-90, SCP-6736 is to be removed from a facility if the following conditions are present: an annual increase in precipitation in excess of 30% or a decrease of 5%; a 10% increase in local soil salinity; or a 30% increase in pollen count.</p>

<p>At least two incursions into Site-90 are to be made by MTF Lambda-40 per week. The task force is to document SCP-6736-Aleph instances present in the environment and neutralize all glyphs of class 'Cathay' and class 'Carthage'. Counter-glyphs of class 'Garden', class 'Cloud', and class 'Yerevan' are to be utilized during SCP-6736-Caspian, -Ctesiphon, and -Carthage events. SCP-6736-Aleph instances identified by the public are to be neutralized and a cover story implicating GoI-4302 ('Children of Fire') is to be distributed.</p>
<p>Per <strong>Reintegration Protocol #6736</strong>, instances of SCP-6736 housed at facilities outside Site-90 must be returned to Site-90 upon request. Instances in containment are to be housed together in 10m x 10m x 5m amphibious terrariums and always have materials available to enable written communication. Facilities currently authorized to house SCP-6736 include Site-17; Site-██; Site-28, Site-35; Site-48 (Variant Wing C); Site-██; Site-73; Zoological Facility-B34; Botanical Facility-Ш1; Facility-Λ9; Ethics Committee Baku Office; Tactical Theology ██████ Office.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6736 is a population of the genus <em>Eoscapherpeton</em> in the family of giant salamanders. It is currently native to the Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion, but was present in a much wider range encompassing Asia Minor, Central Asia, and South Asia until as recently as seventy years ago.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> SCP-6736 is similar in physiology to other species of giant salamander, with the exception of bioluminescent markings on their extremities and epidermal glands capable of secreting a sulfur-based toxin.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> SCP-6736 have indefinite lifespans in captivity and retain the ability to regenerate limbs and to undergo neoteny<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> of the gills.</p>
<p>SCP-6736 instances are sapient, and develop cognition comparable to five-year-old human children<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> if they are exposed to interactive social structures.

<div class="scp-image-caption show">SCP-6736-032 ('Edna'), estimated age 59, housed at Variant Site-48.</div>
</div>
<p>Members of SCP-6736 communicate using a sophisticated combination of percussive noise, body language, gestures, vocalizations, drawing, and writing. They are able to communicate emotions and abstract concepts through an understanding of symbolism. With sufficient education they can comprehend arithmetic, multiple expressions of human language, and be trained to participate fluently in conversation using Morse code. SCP-6736's communication makes use of multiple politeness registers, with formal introductions usually involving the collaborative creation of a pictogram.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Members of SCP-6736 exhibit a passive antimemetic effect, making them difficult to directly observe. Individuals struggle to perceive members of SCP-6736 as fixed objects in their environment, often losing track of them or failing to notice them entirely. This effect is cumulative, amplifying with each instance of SCP-6736 present in a given space. Large or tightly-packed groups exhibit such a strong effect that they can become visually undetectable. This effect is lessened significantly when instances interact with people they recognize.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p><strong>SCP-6736-Aleph</strong> is the designation for thaumatological effects associated with the Hyrcanian Pictography. Wild specimens of SCP-6736 are able to create syntactically unique pictograms using a combination of the Hyrcanian Pictography and collective ritual, such as music and dance, from a very young age. These rituals can radically alter the local weather and ecology of the area in which they are performed. Wild specimens will instinctively draw pictograms using whatever medium is available, including soil, tree resin, algae, foliage, mucus and writing utensils. Hycranian Pictography tends to appear more often in the environment during important stages of SCP-6736's life cycle, such as breeding season or after forest fires.</p>
<p>Individual glyphs do not, in and of themselves, manifest thaumatological effects; rather, SCP-6736 uses the symbols to communicate concepts to each other, causing the thaumatological effects to activate as SCP-6736 performs other tasks. Because of this, a symbol's effect changes in proportion to the frequency of its use, fluctuating in "power" as SCP-6736 creates or erases it from its surroundings. The effects manifested are categorized below by memetic class.</p>

<hr/>
<div class="textbook">
<p>So, when did the Hyrcanians develop their script? A simple question with a complicated answer. We must first take into account that the script is not, in any sense, developed. Logographies as typified by Chinese characters utilize both precise calligraphy and an established lexicon to disseminate meaning. For Hyrcanians, these are only suggestions. The set of glyphs used throughout this text cover over 95% of known lexical items, but the number of potential glyphs is functionally infinite. We speculate that SCP-6736's "vocabulary" has grown and shrunk many times throughout history …</p>
</div>
<div class="textbook">
<p>… Suppose you have written a note card and a highly intricate message, or heard a spoken message that you will not hear again. You might resort to the use of shorthand and abbreviation to condense such information. Writing exists to not only assign a reproducible value to phonetic information, but also to maintain that value across generations as phonetics change. Many people believe, incorrectly, that the Hycranian script functions in the same way. But human historical precedent would disagree.</p>
<p>Languages change as their speakers do. For writing systems developed for oral traditions, radical shifts in meaning are an inevitability. But for Hyrcanians, the phonemic value<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> of their voice has no bearing on the words written, and symbols can be made, changed or unmade on a whim. So, where is meaning derived? As far as we can tell, cultural value, context, and not much else …</p>
</div>
<div class="textbook">
<p>… If we know that the myths associated with salamanders have reflected Aleph-class events since at least Pliny the Elder, then it's easy to claim Hyrcanian was established nearly two millennia ago. But, this is not the complete picture either. Do we go back further, make connections between their writing and our proto-writing, our hieroglyphs? It will serve us better to start with something concrete: our oldest preserved Hyrcanian glyphs shortly predate the Sassanian Empire, and this period is more bountiful in evidence than any others before 1700 …</p>
</div>
<div class="textbook">
<p>… The most unique aspect of Hyrcanian is that it does not exist to transmit information to the future. The fundamental motivation of all physical mediums developed by humanity, to outlast our ephemeral use of language, is a notion which Hyrcanian pictograms reject. Hyrcanians have preserved their gift not through reason, but through instinct. While our language survives to tell us what <em>has happened</em>, Hyrcanian tells its speakers what <em>is happening</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum- Discovery:</strong> SCP-6736 was poorly studied prior to the 1950s. Because of the species' antimemetic properties, accurate population estimates are exceedingly difficult to collect, but environmental markers suggest a current population ranging anywhere between 12,000 and 100,000 individuals. Their anomalous abilities were discovered in 1954, when a captive member of SCP-6736 produced glyphs as part of a circus exhibition in Astara, Iran. Interrogation of the proprietors led the Foundation to GoI-4302 ('Children of Fire'), a millenarian sect of Zoroastrianism.</p>
<p>Further probing from an agent recruited from within GoI-4302 resulted in the discovery of a compound in Sorkhanhol Wildlife Refuge which contained at least 14 instances of SCP-6736. A mobile task force entered the facility and the instances were contained.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>Agent Uysal, Agent Zhordania, and informant Alizadeh isolate two members of SCP-6736 for observation in a chamber exposed to the surrounding forest. Translated from Russian.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zhordania:</strong> Containment log one. Objects are capable of pattern recognition of symbols instilled by trainers.</p>

<p><strong>Alizadeh:</strong> … And this sign… This is the sign for 'salt'. And this one is 'gift'. They want salt. 'No'.</p>
<p><strong>Uysal:</strong> No?</p>

<p><strong>Alizadeh:</strong> No. They're just making the sign for 'no'. 'No give salt'. There's too much salt in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Zhordania:</strong> There's <em>no</em> salt in the dirt, idiot.</p>

<p><strong>Alizadeh:</strong> 'No salt human'. That one's 'human'.</p>

<p>[Subjects collaboratively scrawl 'danger', obscuring the 'human' glyph.]</p>
<p><strong>Uysal:</strong> It's crossing us out.</p>
<p><strong>Zhordania:</strong> I think I get that one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> <em>14 subjects of various ages were stored in an amphibious terrarium at nearby Site-71. Alizadeh was tentatively permitted to act as caretaker of the anomalies. Their antimemetic properties led to a gradual containment failure, resulting in a rapid growth of the SCP-6736 population at the site.</em></p>
</div>
<hr/></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Informant Alizadeh conspired with members of GoI-4302 to expand the Site-71 containment area to four square acres, enough space for the now 104 specimens. Due to the antimemetic properties of the anomaly and the remote location of site, this change went undiscovered for over a year.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum- History:</strong> Pre-Foundation sources about SCP-6736, SCP-6736-Aleph, and its effect on history do not stand up to rigorous academic scrutiny. Thus, an established history of SCP-6736 does not extend much further back than the 20th century. However, it is well-established that SCP-6736 was critically endangered by the mid-90s, primarily due to aggressive policies enacted against GoI-4302 by Iran and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>GoI-4302 covertly maintained populations of SCP-6736 for an undetermined amount of time.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> Surveillance of the group was made difficult by concurrent political conflicts and opposition to Foundation activity in the region. SCP-6736-Aleph events related to GoI-4302 were thus responded to on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> A high-magnitude Class-Ctesiphon event occurred in Golestan National Park, Iran. GoI-4302 organized the event by relocating various broods to a centralized location within the surrounding forest. Using the glyphs for "fire", "tree", and "storm", GoI-4302 created a forest fire over an area of approximately 16km<sup>2</sup>. Within this forest fire was a clutch of approximately 10,000 eggs belonging to SCP-6736, which were protected from the intense heat. Approximately 6,000 hatchlings were believed to have been released by this Class-Ctesiphon event.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Foundation agents tasked with controlling the population of SCP-6736 immediately identified the forest fire as a result of anomaly, and successfully terminated over 2,000 instances spawned from event.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran established a prohibition on both Foundation activity and the activity of GoI-4302. Public displays of the Children of Fire's Zoroastrian beliefs were criminalized, resulting in the group's clandestine activity increasing and millenarian philosophy becoming more radical. Incorporation of psychotropic substances into religious ceremonies, including the administration of substances to SCP-6736 instances, became a practice of the sect.

<p><strong>04/08/1985</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The group of individuals and SCP-6736 affected by SCP-6736-Caspian-02 trekked to the city of Aralsk, Kazakhstan. Approximately 5,000 instances of SCP-6736 were compelled by memetic hazard to scrawl the symbols for "salt/danger", "ritual", "sandstorm", and "king". Interviews of GoI-4302 members involved suggest that this was an attempt to prevent or delay the arrival of the Angra Mainyu.</p>
<p>At approximately 12:00 local time, an anomalous sandstorm began to develop in the region, affecting an area of nearly 2,500km<sup>2</sup>. The storm persisted for several days and resulted in over nine hundred casualties. A profound ecological collapse would later affect the surrounding farmland, degrading the corridor from the Aral Sea to the Caspian Sea into a massive salt flat.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Attempts to reverse environmental damage are ongoing, but are hindered by both a lack of cooperation with Foundation personnel and existing hydropower and irrigation installations draining the Aral Sea further.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The government of the Soviet Union would later respond with procedures to neutralize SCP-6736.</p>

<strong><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> APPROVED 13.XI.1985     |     PRINTOUT NR: 3 </span></strong><br/>
<strong><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> SIGNED ..................          S </span></strong><br/>
<strong>DEPARTMENT HEAD III-P-9-GRU</strong><br/>
<strong>RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL:</strong> Neftaly Gorogod, Stepan Tyulkin</p>
<p><strong>DETAIL:</strong> OSI <strong>"SCYTHIAN"</strong> is the designation of a previously poorly understood species of salamander. It is now understood that this species is intelligent and capable of dramatically restructuring the chemical composition of the environment in which it resides. These changes are performed using the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong> establish a thaumic conduit through runic scripture</li>
<li>This runic scripture can generate undirected masses of salt, water, fire, and organic matter</li>
<li>Strength of effects is contingent on numbers of runes amassed</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have had a disastrous effect on the regions of the Union inhabited by <strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong>. It is well-established that Western powers have conspired against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by releasing waves of <strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong> into the environment where there were previously few or none present. In doing so, they have compromised the water reserves of the Union and rendered barren the once-fertile land in the Caspian belt.</p>
<p><strong>PROPOSED USES:</strong></p>
<p>(i) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agricultural Improvements:</span> <strong><span style="color: red">REJECTED</span></strong> - A reliable way to enforce the creation of runes associated with rain or environmental recovery is not currently available.</p>
<p>(ii) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weaponization:</span> <strong><span style="color: red">REJECTED</span></strong> - Members of <strong>"SCYTHIAN"</strong> are not capable of directing their magic outside of their area of habitation.</p>
<p>(iii) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relocation:</span> <strong><span style="color: green">APPROVED</span></strong> - One breeding population of <strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong> will be preserved for potential future use.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT:</strong><br/>
OSI <strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong> are an existential threat to the continued survival of the Union. In less than two years, <strong>"SCYTHIAN"</strong> numbers may result in mass crop die-off. Project <strong>"RASHIDUN"</strong>, a culling of all <strong>"SCYTHIANS"</strong> in the Caspian Sea region, including within the nation of Iran, is to be implemented.</p>

<p>Despite SCP-6736's antimemetic properties, data indicates that the actions of GRU Division "P", and, to a lesser extent, the ORIA, were successful in reducing SCP-6736's population throughout their original habitat range. Outside of an estimated 2,000 specimens in Azerbaijan and 200 in Turkmenistan, SCP-6736 is now considered functionally extinct within the borders of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum- Reintegration Proposal:</strong><br/>
Following multiple decades of continued observation and study, Site-90 concluded that SCP-6736 was of no apparent risk to Foundation personnel and declared it safely contained. Resident research head Ezekiel Hammond made an appeal to the Foundation Ethics Committee in October of the same year, citing that the species' capacity for intelligent thought were potential assets to future containment efforts and study of similar organisms. Also cited was a successful reversal of a Class-Carthage event's effect on soil salinity within Site-90, achieved by informing SCP-6736 of the event's negative effects and through the utilization of Cloud and Garden counter-glyphs.</p>

<hr/>
<p>I, Site-90 head researcher Ezekiel Hammond, submit the following to the Ethics Committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-6736 is an integral component of its local biosphere;</li>
<li>SCP-6736 has potential applications as a means of terraforming or environmental restoration;</li>
<li>SCP-6736's anomalous properties do not pose a risk to continued containment, or to the exposure of itself or other Foundation assets;</li>
<li>SCP-6736's anomalous properties are easily controlled and monitored, and they have the potential to positively impact Foundation site security and morale with their presence if accommodated;</li>
<li>SCP-6736 has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity for human or near-human intellect and properties of sapience as defined under the Pseudohuman Civil Rights Act:
<ul>
<li>Understanding of personhood, perception of self by other intelligent creatures and individual and group identity;</li>
<li>Distinct cultural traditions and values;</li>
<li>Ability to communicate fluently with humans (trained in use of Morse code);</li>
<li>Capacity for intelligent, peer-to-peer communication as defined in the 2016 edition of the Ngwane-Turei Accord;</li>
<li>Complex internal concepts of self such as empathy, altruism, and the creation and maintenance of multiple types of social bonds;</li>
<li>Command over basic forms of thaumaturgy and ritual</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my professional opinion that SCP-6736 is a sapient, autonomous entity of minimal risk to itself or others, and is therefore eligible for a reintegration appeal. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I submit the records of Site-90 from the years of 1998 to present for your consideration in this matter. We await your correspondence.<br/>

<p>Reintegration Committee representative "Hatess" arrived at Site-90 shortly after they received Dr. Hammond's inquiry. Over the course of the next several months, they completed an exhaustive assessment of the site's internal records and resident staff, testing over one hundred of Site-90's SCP-6736 instances for cognitive ability, thaumatological properties and capacity for socialization.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>Representative Hatess is accompanying a pair of Lambda-40 agents (Lim Chung-Ho and Navarro Ruiz) during a routine perimeter survey of Site-90.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chung-Ho:</strong> … and that one there is "shelter."</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Thank you, agent Chung-Ho, but I have a copy of the glossaries. I'm cataloging what I see. You should be too.</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> [to Chung-Ho] Not getting paid hourly, remember. We got another acre to do. [to Hatess] I hope you're finding Site-90 to your liking, representative.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Too hot, too wet. Not your fault, though. This is the asset's natural home, correct? They survive best here? Weren't relocated?</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> That's correct. Our terrariums match the Hycranian climate as closely as possible, and SCP-6736 reacts favorably to them.</p>
<p>[Hatess wipes a sheen of rainwater from their jacket. They grimace and shake their hand.]</p>
<p><strong>Chung-Ho:</strong> Come on, Hatess. They've got rain where you're from, surely.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> [Deadpan] Nope. It rains blood where I come from. Blood and guts. [to Ruiz] Suppose there's not a … drier population, is there?</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> Not anymore. During the 20th century they reached as far as the Aral Sea. Their habitat is a fraction of what it once was. Or so the director tells me.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> I'm not interested in the Aral Sea, mister Ruiz, I'm interested in the lizards.</p>
<p><strong>Chung-Ho:</strong> [Interjecting] Amphibians, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> The Committee handles taxonomies, dear. Lizards are lizards.</p>
<p>[Hatess turns to agent Chung-Ho and bares their teeth, peeling back the skin of their jaw to reveal their molars.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> And I'm not a <em>ma'am</em>.</p>
<p>[The team continues in silence. Agent Chung-Ho refuses to speak for the remainder of the survey.]</p>
<p>[Hatess stops as the team reaches a clearing. They inspect the tree line, then turn to agent Ruiz.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> They're here, aren't they? Seven or eight of them.</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> Uh …</p>
<p>[Ruiz checks his tablet. Seven members of SCP-6736 are detectable in the clearing.]</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> … seven, yes. Are you able to see them, representative Hatess?</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Smell. [sniffling] Reeks of pepper.</p>
<p>[Hatess steps into the center of the clearing and claps their hands twice.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Alright, darlings. Roll call.</p>
<p>[SCP-6736-044 ("Dudley") approaches Hatess. He sits up on his hind legs, waving a stick with his forelimbs. Hatess crouches down to meet him at eye level and smirks.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Hello, little fella.</p>
<p><strong>Dudley:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .... . .-.. .-.. --- / -. . .-- / .... . .-.. .-.. ---</span><br/>
<em>HELLO HELLO NEW HELLO</em></p>
<p>[Dudley begins drawing a circle in the dirt. He creates a series of pictograms, then offers the stick to Hatess.]</p>
<p><strong>Dudley:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-- .- -.- . / - .-. .- -.. . / ..-. --- ..- -. -.. .- - .. --- -. / .... ..- -- .- -. --..-- / .... . .-.. .-.. --- / -.-- . ...</span><br/>
<em>MAKE TRADE FOUNDATION HUMAN, HELLO YES</em></p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> Dudley, this is representative Hatess. They're here to make friends.</p>
<p><strong>Dudley:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-.-- . ... / -.-- . ... / -- .- -.- . / ..-. .-. .. . -. -.. / .... .- - . . --..</span><br/>
<em>YES YES MAKE FRIEND HATEEZ</em> [sic]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> This is the bonding behavior Hammond discussed, I assume.</p>
<p>[Ruiz nods. Hatess takes the stick from Dudley and draws the glyph for "Foundation", followed by "yes", "human" and a spiral symbol of their own design. They return the stick.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Alright, Dudley, draw me like one of your French Sarkites.</p>
<p>[Hatess and Dudley collaborate on their pictogram for several minutes.]</p>
<p><strong>Dudley:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">...- . .-. -.-- / ..-. .-. .. . -. -.. -.-.-- / .... .- - . . --.. / ..-. .-. .. . -. -.. / -.. ..- -.. .-.. . -.-- / --. .-. . .- - .-.. -.-- / -.-- . ... / -.-- . ... / -.-- . ...</span><br/>
<em>VERY FRIEND! HATEEZ</em> [sic] <em>FRIEND DUDLEY GREATLY YES YES YES</em></p>
<p>[Dudley waddles repeatedly in circles. Hatess stands and takes a series of notes.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> You said there was an outpost past the clearing?</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> That's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> I'll be collaborating with my liaison back at the site, then. Your service is appreciated, gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Hatess swivels and exits the clearing. They scowl at Chung-Ho as they pass, making a point to bump into him. After a short delay, Ruiz rejoins Chung-ho and the two resume their survey.]</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> You <em>really</em> fucked that up.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[Hatess sits across from Edna and Site-90 head researcher Ezekiel Hammond. The three are eating lunch: two sandwiches for Hammond and Hatess, and a plate of mealworms and fruit slices for Edna.]</p>
<p>[Hatess pores over their field notes. Edna slaps her tail obstinately and Hammond hands her a grapefruit, which she begins peeling.]</p>
<p><strong>Hammond:</strong> Exceptional, aren't they? [to Edna] Hook your thumb in there, dear. That's it.</p>
<p><strong>Edna:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.. / -.-. .- -. / ..- ... . / -- -.-- / .... .- -. -.. ... / .... .- -- -- --- -. -..</span><br/>
<em>I CAN USE MY HANDS HAMMOND</em></p>
<p>[Edna struggles with the grapefruit. Hammond opens his own field notes, sighing.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> This one scored much higher than the others. I assume age correlates positively with intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>Hammond:</strong> Edna has been living at Site-90 since 1988. Juveniles fully mature after about four years or so, so at her youngest she would have been around 32. But other specimens of similar age ranges demonstrate much lower intelligence, at least in regards to speech and mathematics. We speculate she's much older than that. Possibly 40 or 50.</p>
<p>[Hatess studies Hammond's notes. They sort a series of glyphs and write them out on a piece of paper.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> And the "Cathay" glyphs are reserved for elders …</p>
<p>[Hatess passes the paper to Edna.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Got something to tell me, Edna?</p>
<p>[Edna slaps the table repeatedly with her hands, then pushes the paper away.]</p>
<p><strong>Edna:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">..- -. -.- .. -. -.. / - --- / .- ... -.- / .- / .-.. .- -.. -.-- / .... . .-. / .- --. .</span><br/>
<em>UNKIND TO ASK A LADY HER AGE</em></p>
<p>[Hatess chuckles.]</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> [to Hammond] You said they can change the power of these things.</p>
<p><strong>Hammond:</strong> At the behest of a leader, yes. We believe that the power is tied to their collective belief rather than the symbols themselves. The symbols' strength is a <em>consequence</em> of that change, rather than the <em>cause</em> of it, if you follow.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> So not as easy as writing our own, then.</p>
<p><strong>Hammond:</strong> I suppose you could, with control of an elder to relegate such things. But most of their actions are instinctual. They just create glyphs as they work. It's … not quite spontaneous, but very few of them create with discernable purpose. It's possible that influencing their emotional state would achieve what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Hatess:</strong> Hm. [To Edna] If you're done, little lady, I think we have a prior engagement. I want to see how well you can disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Edna:</strong> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.. / .-- --- ..- .-.. -.. / .-.. --- ...- . / - --- / -.. .. ... .- .--. .--. . .- .-. / .-. . .--. .-. . ... . -. - .- - .. ...- . / .... .- - . ... ... --..-- / -.. --- / -. --- - / ..-. --- .-.. .-.. --- .--</span><br/>
<em>I WOULD LOVE TO DISAPPEAR REPRESENTATIVE HATESS, DO NOT FOLLOW</em></p>
