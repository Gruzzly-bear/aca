<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Upon discovery of an SCP-5745-1 manifestation, depending on the location and severity, MTF Units Paleo-1 through Paleo-7 must be dispatched to contain any SCP-5745-2 instances. If possible, any captured instances are to be brought to Site-5745 and placed in the large environment for further research and study. Lethal force is authorised if an SCP-5745-2 instance becomes hostile.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5745-1 is a reoccurring space-time anomalous event, during which a rift in time is manifested through unknown means. The rifts always connect our time with periods before humans are thought to exist (typically Cambrian to Pleistocene eras). The location of SCP-5745-1 manifestations is seemingly random, though they occasionally repeat in locations they have previously appeared in. SCP-5745-1 always manifests in locations with a similar climate and ecosystem to the era that the rift is connected.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Presently, no link between SCP-5745 and <a href="scp-1265.html">SCP-1265</a> has been discovered.</p>
<p>SCP-5745-2 are creatures that appear from SCP-5745-1 (typically from the clade Dinosauria, Reptilia, or Mammalia). It is currently believed they are legitimate specimens from the eras they emerged, as DNA samples match. SCP-5745-2 are normally docile, appearing to avoid humans at all costs, but if cornered or startled will become aggressive. Carnivorous instances are extremely prone to these outbursts and often actively hunt humans as prey over other possible food sources. The reason for this is unknown. Some have been known to hunt for sport, potentially displaying a slight degree of sapience. SCP-5745-2 instances have shown an ability to survive in a modern environment for some while, despite atmospheric differences, and a herd of <em>Parasaurolophus walkeri</em> currently under study have been permitted to roam the Amazonian rainforest for some time. Some instances that have been observed in our time period have thrived in the new environment for months before discovery, as all SCP-5745-2 seem to immediately adapt to modern atmospheric composition and condition.</p>
<p><strong>The following is a list of all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">repeat</span> locations SCP-5745-1 has manifested as of 12/03/2021:</strong><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Notably, most of these locations are famous for fossilised fragments and/or full skeletons.</em></p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> The first recorded instance of an SCP-5745-1 manifestation comes from the 11th Century, the event being documented in multiple historic paintings. It depicts St. George killing what is believed to be a <em>Dimorphodon macronyx</em> that emerged from SCP-5745-1. A cover story has been fabricated, dismissing the entity as a fictitious ‘dragon’. The section of paintings with SCP-5745-1 visible has been removed. Depictions of SCP-5745-2 are present throughout historical texts and artwork, for example, Asian depictions of dragons are theorised to resemble <em>Titanoboa cerrejonensis</em> or some other species of megafauna snake. If any new references to SCP-5745-2 instances are discovered, they must be dismissed as common folklore or exaggeration of an already existing species.</p>
<p>In 1964, it was discovered that manifestations could be detected an hour before their opening, as radiation levels in the area would spike. This knowledge has benefitted the Foundation in efforts to contain SCP-5745. This requires a Geiger counter<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> to be present in the location, so rifts are not always detected if this is not present.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a period where SCP-5745-1 manifestations became non-existent or dormant, as there is no evidence supporting this anomaly from approximately 1450 to 1890. Throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries, SCP-5745-1 seems to manifest more prevalently than ever in modern day. It is theorised the opening of rifts has active and dormant periods, lasting approximately 200-300 years between each dormant event. Currently, we are living in a time where SCP-5745-1 is in an active state.</p>
<p>Due to the frequency of rift openings, 7 MTF Units have been created to specifically deal with SCP-5745-2 threats. These MTF teams have been designated the ‘Paleo Division’. <strong>A full list of Paleo Division squads and specs can be found here:</strong></p>

<p>Site-5745 has been created around Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, to facilitate long-term containment of captured SCP-5745-2 instances. The area surrounding Mt. Taranaki is open to the public for tourism so as not to arouse suspicion, but permitted only on Foundation operated tours that follow a predetermined scouted route. Site-5745 is home to many natural species of modern day animals and plants that serve as food sources for the SCP-5745-2, however a herd of larger live creatures such as cattle are to be added to the area weekly for carnivorous instances to hunt. Large amounts of consumable greens are to be dropped into a small field in Site-5745 weekly, as herbivorous instances will completely consume the forest within a matter of years if left to fend for themselves. Though SCP-5745-2 often do not hunt each other, they will occasionally hunt and kill other instances, at which point, a new instance from the next rift event shall replace it.</p>
<p>The following is a log taken by Researcher Walker during his routinely inspection of the environment within Site-5745.</p>

<p><strong>08:00:</strong> Me and 5 men from Paleo-6 left the research building early to get a full day in. Walked right into a tree branch. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>09:14:</strong> First sign of an SCP-5745-2 instance. A few small creatures ran in front of us, but left as suddenly as they appeared. Probably the Balaurs, they are good at being unseen.</p>
<p><strong>10:45:</strong> Heard a large sound resembling a bassoon. I believe it was a Parasaur, hopefully we will reach the herd soon. Also found a large kill with lots of crushed bones near a lake, possibly from the Sarcosuchus.</p>
<p><strong>10:56:</strong> Heard it again but louder. Getting close.</p>
<p><strong>12:00:</strong> Stopped for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>13:01:</strong> Stumbled across the herd. It seems the Parasaurs, Apatasaurus and Psitticasaurus have formed a large herd. This is unexpected, all 3 species would have never interacted with each other (they lived millions of years apart) let alone created a herd. Survival in numbers I guess. Still no sign of the Triceratops.</p>
<p><strong>14:00:</strong> Have been watching the herd for an hour. Leaving to look for something else.</p>
<p><strong>14:28:</strong> Command alerted us that the cows would be dropped in about half an hour. Moving to the drop point.</p>
<p><strong>14:56:</strong> Reached feeding point. Ready to observe feeding, team is on high alert.</p>
<p><strong>15:11:</strong> Cows were dropped off 10 minutes ago, the Tyrannosaur made an appearance! It just shot out of the tree line, grabbed one off the ground and made off with it. It was in and out of the clearing in less than 10 seconds. Worrying to see it move that fast.</p>
<p><strong>15:13:</strong> Soon after the Rex left, the Balaurs showed up. These things are tiny, about the size of a medium dog. They did some amazing stuff, one of them bit the cow’s leg and while it was distracted, the other 2 jumped on its neck and finished it off. They remind me of wolves.</p>
<p><strong>15:20:</strong> We caught the Balaurs trying to sneak up on us. Probably just curious, they like to watch what we do through the fence of the research lab, but the guys want to get moving. No show from the Baryonyx or Dilophosaurus. (Or Sarcosuchus, but that thing never gets seen).</p>
<p><strong>16:00:</strong> Have been trekking for 40 minutes straight, taking a break.</p>
<p><strong>16:12:</strong> Heard Triceratops mating call, moving in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>17:40:</strong> Have been looking for that Trike for a while, might head back to base soon, it’s getting darker.</p>
<p><strong>18:23:</strong> You won’t guess what happened. That wasn’t a Triceratops. The damn Dilophosaurs were mimicking the calls of the Trikes and waiting for it to be night so they could ambush us. I don’t know how they were able to replicate the sound, it sounded so loud. That’s completely new evidence for how Dilophosaurs take down such large prey, they sneak up on it by luring it into a trap (take that <a href="scp-1265.html">SCP-1265</a> researchers!). One of them bit Geoffrey’s leg, but I think he’ll be fine. Moving back to Site Command.</p>
<p><strong>18:45:</strong> We were followed back, I’m sure of it. The whole time on the walk back I felt like I was being watched. The others were confused, saying I’m crazy. I know something was there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: Following Researcher Walker’s bodily examination, it revealed that he had been bitten by a Dilophosaurus wetherilli. It is now believed that this species uses a form of mind-altering substance in its saliva to cause prey to become disoriented. Testing on this is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 5745.2:</strong> As can be seen in incident logs relating to SCP-5745, the frequency and severity of rift events is drastically rising. Previously, rifts would occur approximately once every 5-10 years. Within the last five years alone, 3 SCP-5745-1 materialisations have occurred. It is believed that this can be attributed to warming of Earth's atmosphere, as the most common time for materialisations in the past has been during warm periods of spring and summer. Senior Researcher Wood has made a statement about the future of SCP-5745 research that can be found in the following paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>Statement from Senior Researcher Wood:</strong><br/>
You have probably noticed that the last 3 rift manifestations were within a small time period, and you are correct. Current theories suggest that SCP-5745-1 manifestations are heightened by warm temperatures, as you also probably noticed, they are most common during warmer months. Rising CO² levels have been trapping solar radiation and warming our planet, meaning that rifts are appearing in higher frequencies and staying open for longer, making containment harder.</p>
<p>As more instances are emerging from SCP-5745-1, construction of a new site for long term containment is underway, Site-5745-2. It will be larger than the first and has a broad underground and above ground facility for containment of rarer Cenozoic species, including a large bay for marine life forms.</p>
<p>With the rising intensity of SCP-5745-1 manifestations, the possibility of an SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario must be considered. These creatures were the prime species in their time, and if we are changing our environment to be more like theirs, their domination over us is a likely outcome. If the frequency of rifts continues to rise exponentially as it currently is, then we will soon run out of resources to contain the SCP-5745-2 instances. I am formally submitting a request for SCP-5745 to be reclassified as Keter in light of recent events.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Senior Researcher ████ Wood.</p>
