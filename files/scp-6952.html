<p>An instance of SCP-6952-1, designation "Gauss Rifle"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6952 is kept within Site-78's Arms and Equipment Department. SCP-6952 is to be kept sealed within an Adamantite case when not in use, and may only be removed with authorization from members of Omega-45, or designated researchers who possess Level 4 Clearance or above.</p>
<p>Before construction begins, new entries within SCP-6952 must be approved first by the Ethics Committee, and instances of SCP-6952-1 shall only be used by members of Omega-45. In the event that a member of Omega-45 falls in combat, any SCP-6952-1 weaponry must be retrieved or scuttled at all costs.</p>
<p>Foundation recovery sites are built around instances of SCP-6952-2 for their retrieval, and any discoveries of SCP-6952-2 by civilians should be promptly recovered and covered up. Witness Amnesctization should be applied as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6952 is a leather-bound book with metal covers. On the spine of SCP-6952 is an engraving that reads "VI of IX". SCP-6952 is a manual on the creation and development of anomalous weapons and armor, hereby classified as SCP-6952-1 instances. The creation of new instructions on SCP-6952-1 instances is triggered by writing on a blank page of the book, which will prompt the anomaly to start writing schematics, forgery instructions, and usage guidelines. Currently, there are three known limits to the manual. It is unable to create weapons that can damage anomalies with indestructible or immortal properties and other books of the Set of Nine. Furthermore, queries to build weapons to target the author of SCP-6952 will not be answered.</p>
<p>SCP-6952-2 instances are anomalous materials and devices that facilitate the anomalous properties of SCP-6952-1 weaponry. SCP-6952-2 instances are created along with SCP-6952-1 if the requisite materials do not already exist. Repeated queries to the manual will lead to different SCP-6952-1's being created. These resources show promise for a variety of uses outside of weapons development, and research is currently ongoing into their applications.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, describing or asking for documents regarding things that aren't considered weaponry will result in a failed query - the request must be distinctly for something like a sword, gun, bomb, or similar objects. SCP-6952 appears to be able to create more pages for its weapons if all of them are filled with queries.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-6952-1 that are approved by the Ethics Committee are allowed for usage by MTF Omega-45 to aid in the capture of anomalies and combat with hostile GoI units. This weaponry provided by SCP-6952 has aided in the capture of over fifty anomalies thus far.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-6952 was discovered on 5-3-2022 by a mixed unit of Valkyries<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, belonging to the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/valravn-corporation-hub" target="_blank">Valravn Corporation</a>. This unit was deployed against GoI-8947 (Volk Division) a mercenary group that was sighted using anomalous and unidentified weaponry.</p>
<p>The Valkyries were successful in eliminating the mercenaries and retrieved SCP-6952 from their operating base. After returning SCP-6952 to Valravn, The High Table<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, contacted the O5 Council a few days later, offering to trade SCP-6952 for information on <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6755" target="_blank">SCP-6755</a>. The following video transcript was declassified and made available to Level 4 personnel to appraise them on the situation involving the Set of Nine and the Valravn Corporation.</p>

<p><strong>A note from Researcher Johnston:</strong> Well, I must admit I'd never heard of the Valravn Corporation before being assigned to this project but now that I've been reading into them… their appearance in this is concerning. While Valravn taking on GoI-8947 (also known as Volk Division) may seem like the lesser of two evils; I would never trust these "ravens". Anyone who uses the term Acceptable Collateral Damage to refer to civilian casualties should never be trusted. Hell, at least <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/centre-de-primordial" target="_blank">Primordial</a> and <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/argus-inc-hub" target="_blank">A.R.G.U.S</a> pretend to care about human rights and they don't go around cosplaying as Vikings and shouting about "Valhalla" when killing people. Valravn seems to be cut off a different cloth… an unhinged and concerning cloth.</p>
<p>I was able to pick through what they'd created in the manual, mostly it was used to create more cybernetic augmentations for their soldiers. Arm-mounted Gauss and electric weaponry, cognitohazards to disguise their agents in the field and that's just the start of it. It's hard to know the true extent of what they learned from this as their R&amp;D could have extrapolated on the knowledge gained from this book.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Gauss Rifle is a ballistics projection device shaped like a conventional rifle firearm, but uses a coilgun<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> design in place of gunpowder propulsion. Inside the chassis of the gun is a series of coils wrapped around the barrel made from Coronal Ferrite, which is a metal with anomalous heat resistance and superconducting properties. Coronal Ferrite lacks electrical resistance, allowing the coils to be more power efficient and generate enough magnetic pull to accelerate the projectile at supersonic speeds - most critically the gun doesn't generate heat. A ferromagnetic projectile is provided by the magazine into the barrel, with an anomalous magnetic shield around the magazine's remaining ammunition to prevent the gun from ripping itself apart.</p>
<p>To compensate for the added recoil of the higher-speed projectile, kinetic dampeners were installed into the Gauss Rifle's chassis by combining previous Foundation designs with ones provided by SCP-6952. This results in a ballistics delivery system with less recoil than even many pistols.</p>
<p>The Rifle can be equipped with an underbarrel 38mm laser-guided HEAT9<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup><br/>
rocket. Several variants have been developed for anti-personnel and anti-armor purposes.</p>
<div class="blokquote-alt">
<p><strong>SCP-6952-2 Description:</strong><br/>
<strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 26<br/>
<strong>Symbol:</strong>C-Fe<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Ural Mountains, Rocky Mountains, Himalayas, TBD<br/>
<strong>Melting Point:</strong> 10,000C</p>
<p>Coronal ferrite is an allotrope of iron found in mountainous regions where the atmospheric pressure is the lowest. It appears to act like regular iron under all circumstances, except for its extremely high melting point, almost 0 electrical resistance and superconducting capability. While this makes it harder to forge, the result is a superconductive metal, allowing for the development of railguns and coilguns. Other potential applications of this material are broad, from space exploration to deep core drilling.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> If I am being honest, I'm no gun expert, but the men and women of Omega-45 give it their thumbs up. The sheer force of bullets' kinetic energy is highly effective against heavy layers of composite armor like that of tanks and if that isn't good enough, you have the missile launcher. In the field, the weapon has been performing admirably. Our boys shred insurgency folks like paper, and the tungsten bullets don't bounce off of tougher anomalous hides.</p>

<li><strong>Weapon Type:</strong> Bladed Weapon</li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> UV Generator needs to be charged for 48 hours of use</li>
<li><strong>Required SCP-6952-2 instance:</strong> Ultrasonic Vibration Generator</li>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> Volk Division</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Utilizing an Ultrasonic Vibration generator, the affected blade begins to vibrate at a rate of 10,000 Hertz. The intense vibration of the atomic structure of the blade, causes the bonds of the target to disintegrate leading to an easier cut. Foundation personnel combine a High Carbon-Adamantine blade with these generators to create weapons that can nearly cut through anything. Every High-Velocity blade is fitted with a vibration-proof handle, to prevent discomfort or harm to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> The High-Velocity Blades are quite an interesting development. We haven't yet come across a singular material that the blades can't cut through, although there is a limit to how much armor they can get through in a single swing. You can't cut a tank or a mech in half with this thing. That would be ridiculous. - Researcher Johnston</p>

<li><strong>Required SCP-6952-2 instance:</strong> Adamantite</li>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> Volk Division, design refined by SCP Armaments Ltd.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> By using the anomalous properties of Adamantite, a metal with similar properties to graphene, the Foundation was able to create lighter-weight bulletproof vests and plates for plate carriers that render a soldier nigh invincible from conventional weapons. The technology can be applied to all types of heavier metal armor and explosion-proof suits. In applications where the Hephaestus-Grade plate would be too heavy and impair the user, a powered exoskeleton was developed to aid the user in remaining protected and keeping mobility.</p>

<p>SCP-6952-2 Description:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> B<sub>4</sub>A</li>
<li><strong>Hardness:</strong> 38 GPa</li>
<li><strong>Fracture Toughness:</strong> 6.5 MPa</li>
<li><strong>Location of Adamantite Deposits:</strong> Earth's crust, composition is now 1% Adamantite</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation: 2 B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 7 A → B<sub>4</sub>A+ 6 AO</p>
<p>Adamantite is an anomalous metal being hailed by Foundation scientists as a new wonder metal. Compared to Boron Carbide, Boron Adamantide is twice as strong. Adamantine shares the properties of Carbon with the added bonus of being able to be made into steel. Boron Adamantide is a super dense, highly conductive material is great for making metal matrices, cutting tools, and most importantly, body armor. Its increased neutronal absorption capability makes it excellent for the construction of neutron bombs, in the event there is an anomaly that requires such dire measures.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> No metal is indestructible, and neither is body armor. What we've dubbed "Hephaestus" Grade is easily one of the largest leaps in armor technology we have for our MTF. While anomalous means are required to destroy it, we've had a bit of fun trying the old conventional ways of trying to dent a Hephaestus plate. .- Researcher Johnston</div>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Matter Displacing Gauntlet utilizes the Atomic Resonator, an instance of SCP-6952-2 in order to teleport a target to the wearer at the speed of light. When activated, the Resonator locks on to a chosen target determined by the line of sight. The Resonator then begins taking measurements of the target's particles (Position, Moment, Spin, and Polarization), and then creates a copy at the user's current position creating entanglement between them. This entangled information is stored as Qubit<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. a quantum channel is thus opened and the target begins sending the information in Qubits to the resonator to recreate the target at lightspeed. Once the resonator has created a perfect duplicate, it ensures the target was created with its original quantum state and discards the original target information.</p>
<p>Thus it is not true teleportation but rather the recreation of data at another location.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong>This was my attempt to see if I could use SCP-6952 to revolutionize particle science and I think I've done it. This gauntlet perfects quantum teleportation and quantum entanglement on a Macro scale. Just imagine the applications for what we can do with this technology, full-scale teleporters; instant communication. I have very high hopes that this gauntlet could be the future of further quantum research- Researcher Johnston.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Type:</strong> Explosive</li>
<li><strong>Blast Yield:</strong> Varies</li>
<li><strong>Radius:</strong> Varies</li>
<li><strong>Required SCP-6952-2 instance:</strong> HAX</li>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> Maria Johnston</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The "Bouncing Mary" has the shape of a regular rubber bouncing ball, but in reality, it is made of 95% SCPE-45 (Securely Constructed Pure Explosive No.45). SCPE-45's kinetic absorption property allows the ball to absorb the kinetic energy of its impacts, storing five times the initial energy inside of itself. When fifteen bounces are reached, the explosive is primed and begins to glow. The user only needs to depress the trigger for 5 seconds to activate the 10-second fuse. It will automatically detonate on the next impact.</p>
<div class="blokquote-alt">
<p><strong>SCP-6952-2 Description:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Ingredient:</strong> HAX (Hephaestus Anomalous eXplosive) or Adamanhexogen (O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>AH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: SCPE-45 is a plasticized explosive similar to C-4 with an explosive power that is 2.4x that of a kg of TNT before it's anomalous property is activated. The addition of Adamantite into the formula of RDX<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, allows the material to anomalously store kinetic energy that is applied to it by a magnitude of five times. This allows users in the field to increase the blast yield without worrying about accidental detonation or having to use more SCPE-45.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Researcher's Notes:</strong> I based this on the Bouncing Betty mines from WW2. I figured that I should make something out of the box and I've always had a fondness for rubber bouncy balls. The men say that this has no tactical advantage on the battlefield but hey, it's a self-defense thing for me so I'm keeping it. HAX also works well as a C4 replacement. Want larger bangs? Just throw the thing at a wall a few times.- Researcher Johnston.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6952.02:</strong> Testing with the creation of SCP-6952-1 instances.</p>
<p>On petition by Researcher Johnston, the Ethics Committee allowed for the attempted queries of more impractical requests of SCP-6952 to test its weapons-making capabilities.</p>
<div class="blokquote-alt">
<p><strong>Query #1:</strong> "Gauss Rifle with a toaster attachment."</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Instructions for one Gauss Rifle with a toaster in the middle of the Rifle's Chassis. Toaster is powered from the Gauss Rifle's battery, toaster works as normal.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #2:</strong> "Weaponizable Butter"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6952 outlined a recipe for butter with a pH level of 14.0, comparable to 1.0M Sodium Hydroxide.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #3:</strong> "A screwdriver"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6952 produced a Gauss Rifle variant that fired screws as ammunition. It is believed that while screwdrivers are unable to be produced, mass drivers that fire screws are acceptable.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #4:</strong> "A bust of Researcher Johnston"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> N/A</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #5:</strong> "A kitchen fork"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6952 produced instructions for a trident.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #6:</strong> "A spoon"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> N/A</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #7:</strong> "A weaponizable spoon"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> N/A</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #8:</strong> "A door"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6952 produced instructions for a trap door into another dimension. The instance was not produced due to concern of not knowing what might come out the other side.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #9:</strong> "Electric bread slicer"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> N/A</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Query #10:</strong> "Electric human slicer"</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6952 created instructions for an electrically powered knife that anomalously cut flesh better than it did bread.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Well I'm glad this thing never runs out of paper with how much junk we filled it with. It appears that its purpose as a "weapons manual" is pretty strict. It can work around some definitions, like turning a fork into what is essentially a weaponized fork. However, things that are strictly meant for tool or decoration purposes give bum results. Sometimes you can cheat it by wordplay or using certain prefixes but other times nothing happens. -Researcher Johnston.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6952.03:</strong> Interview with Valkyrie Operative, "Thalaestris"</p>
<p>On March 10th, Foundation retrieval teams managed to geolocate the location of the Valkyrie's skirmish with the Volk Divison. MTF Omega-45 was sent to retrieve any instances relating to SCP-6952 that were potentially left behind by either side.</p>
<p>It appeared as though the area had been picked clean, fifty Volk division casualties were confirmed along with one Valkyrie. When the Valkyrie was approached, it suddenly came back online and started to whimper for help. This Valkyrie was later determined to be of the Greek Branch of the Valravn Corporation, code-named, <em>Koráki ton skotoménon<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></em>. This Valkyrie was willing to give information on the Valravn Corporation in exchange for asylum.</p>

<td class="active">I can. It was supposed to be a relatively simple op. Me and my commander, Hippolyte were paired with two Sverðmeyja<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> to eliminate some Volk mercenaries and take out their weapons workshop.</td>

<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">One of them was their commander, Brynhilde. Real hard ass from what I'd seen of her. She was getting annoyed with her subordinate Sigrun during the whole mission. The Volks had done something particularly bad to Sigrun, not sure what but she was really riled up to engage with them.</td>

<td class="active">Did that affect the mission at all?</td>

<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">Not at all, we arrived at their workshop. Brynhilde and Sigrun snuck in and eliminated all of them. Me and Hippolyte were keeping guard outside. I had to admit, they were pretty capable for a bunch of fanatics.</td>

<tr>
<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">You don't think highly of the Nordic branch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">Normally you wouldn't catch me dead near one of those Nordic crows. They believe that going to Hades is a bad thing and that by dying in combat they'll go to the land of the gods! It's madness, Mount Olympus is reserved for immortals only. It's heresy to believe otherwise.</td>

<td class="active">Interesting, I wasn't aware that there were other religions in Valravn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">There are plenty of pagan religions in Valravn. We have a Mesoamerican branch, Shinto, Greek of course, and many more. We may call them by different names and worship them differently. All of us have different ideas about where we're gonna end up after all this. But at the end of the day, Kukulkan is just Jormungandr by another name and the comparison can go on with all the other big snakes. It's the one thing that stops us from just tearing each other apart.</td>

<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">It's a unique way of interpreting the theology. So what happened after Brynhilde and Sigrun cleared the warehouse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">We came to get the place ready for a retrieval team when we saw Brynhilde scolding Sigrun, there was this corpse near Sigrun, absolutely torn apart. Brynhilde was trying to tell her that her revenge mission against some guy named Grigori was going to get her killed. Sigrun however, was gloating about being able to get Grigori's unit information from the guy. Anyway, we told them both to stow it and that's when it happened… we got ambushed.</td>

<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">They were waiting for you?</td>

<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">I don't know how they knew. But the wolves were all over us. The operations department told us to get the hell out of there but there were too many of them. I took a round from one of their rifles, which ripped straight through my Chassis. Hurt like hell.</td>

<td class="active">I know the kind you're talking about, Gauss weapons are terrifying.</td>

<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">You don't know the half of it. Anyways, My commander tells them to leave me, Spartan philosophy you see; weak don't deserve to be saved from the battlefield. Brynhilde and Sigrun disagreed but my commander outranked them. My commander gave me one last task, detonate the explosives they had on the site and cover their escape. Scorched Earth.</td>

<td class="active">And you did? Even with injuries like that? Your body was absolutely torn apart by the time we found you.</td>

<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">I cut them all down, every one of those rabid dogs. I made it to the cache and blew them all sky high, I had my golden coin on me to give the ferryman when I went out but he never came. I guess my backup systems kept my organs alive long enough for you to find me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">That's… quite the story. Can you go back? Why do you want to stay with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">I'm a warrior through and through, like the Athenians and Spartans before us. But Valravn, they don't have honor. Why would I want to be a part of an organization that doesn't care about its soldiers? No one came back for me, not even the Sverðmeyja.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">Even if the Sverðmeyja wanted to, they likely assumed you were dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A-04</th>
<td class="active">I agree, Valravn probably wrote me off as a loss. Just another negative if their ledger. Goddamn it, I used to be a soldier fighting for a good cause before those damn suits showed. I lost my arms on a UN Peacekeeping mission But then they came. "We'll give you a purpose", they said. "You'll feast on the battlefield once more." So what did I do? Of course, I said yes, I wanted my arms back. That's how they get you, they came to me because I couldn't say no. More like Vultures rather than crows.</td>

<th>Johnston</th>
<td class="active">Well, I am preparing to offer you something. Your record shows that you are a capable warrior and we need someone to train our MTF in case the Cartagena agreement goes sour. Thalaestris, I'm offering you a place in one of our Mobile Task Forces. My boys call themselves the Street Samurai, would you like to join?</td>

<td class="active">Excellent, it'll take a while to get the paperwork approved, this is a bit of an unusual move but I want the best of the best in Omega-45. You'll also probably have to have a failsafe installed in your cybernetics, like an easy shutoff.</td>

<hr/>
<p><em>The following notice has been disseminated to all personnel employed within Site-78.</em></p>
<p>Attention to all staff,</p>
<p>Due to the involvement with the Valravn Corporation in the efforts to retrieve the remaining books in the Set of Nine. All Mobile Task Forces are to be on high alert for Valravn interference in our containment operations. All MTFs are not to engage with Valravn personnel in combat unless an order has been given down by the Overseer Council. The Cartagena Agreement prevents us from open conflict but they've made clear through their actions that like with the Insurgency and Volk Division before them, they are attempting to locate the missing volumes in the Set.</p>
<p>We do not need to break our longstanding agreement without reason but we cannot allow any of these volumes to fall into their hands. Containing the Set is now this Site's utmost priority and if it comes a day when we must fight the Valravn for control of the set, we will be ready.</p>
<p>Site-78, please remain vigilant. These are troubling times.</p>

<span style="color: #17e610">It has been a bit since our last correspondence. I apologize that I've been so tight-lipped on specifics on SCP-6952. Its classification as Thaumiel has necessitated level 4 clearance. I've been trying to get Director Richter to relent, given that SCP-6952 is part of the ongoing research into the Set. However, she seems adamant that your… eclectic personality isn't the right fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">Now In regards to SCP-6952's connections with the Set… I can say that with <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419">SCP-6419</a> formerly in the hands of Chaos Insurgency and the Valravn Corporation having knowledge of SCP-6952 before they retrieved it, I think something might be cooking in the GoI community that we just aren't aware of yet. We tried looking to see if we could exploit the rift between the Main Nordic Branch of Valravn with their overseas branches to see if any of them would give up something but that turned up empty. The true author of these books evades us still.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">In addition, I received your list of queries and I was permitted to test them. It wouldn't reveal the identity of or make weapons that could kill its author ( I am not suggesting trying to eliminate the author yet, but if we knew what kind of weapons could kill them, we could infer their identity). SCP-6952 would not make weapons that could destroy other books in the Set. It won't respond to queries it can't make weapons for. If this thing has sentience, we haven't found any evidence of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #17e610">I hope that answers some of your questions. I'll keep you posted on any further developments.</span></p>
