<p>SCP-5907 is a 19th-Century oil lamp comprised of a small oil chamber and a wick consisting of hemp and cotton. Igniting the wick causes SCP-5907 to emit trace amounts of fluctuating Akiva radiation.</p>
<p>After approximately 30 seconds, SCP-5907 starts releasing smoke; with inhalation causing transfiguration of human tissue into synthetic cotton-like material and calcium-heavy bio-matter such as bones into aluminum.</p>
<p>There is no known method of terminating the transmutation.</p>

<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>On 2020/02/23, the Foundation received a police file containing information on severely mutated human corpses, including several photographs. Foundation Agents were deployed to the residence where the corpses were located, which was still under police investigation.</p>
<p>SCP-5907 was discovered due to its abnormal levels of Akiva radiation, detected by investigators' GADs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. It was located in the room of William Corbin, the son of the residence's owner. The bodies of William, Veronica, and Fresco Corbin were all located in the room. A video file was also recovered from William's personal computer.</p>

<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> Okay, it's February 19th and I picked up this really cool lamp from a pawn shop down on Wilson Ave.</p>
<p><em>[William holds up SCP-5907.]</em></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> Now, the guy there said this thing is a real deal genie lamp.</p>
<p><em>[William turns SCP-5907 to reveal its underside.]</em></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> See here, it says "Levi Strauss 1840", according to the guy at the shop, Levi Strauss himself used this to become successful. I believe in the supernatural but this seemed almost too good to be true, so I couldn't pass it up.</p>
<p><em>[William sets SCP-5907 down on a small table in front of the camera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> So all I've gotta do is light the lamp… <em>[He uncovers the wick and lights it.]</em> Rub it three times… And I don't know, I guess just wait for the genie. <em>[William laughs.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The lamp begins producing smoke from its spout.]</em></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> Holy shit, I can't belie–</p>
<p><em>[William begins coughing as a tendril of smoke forces its way down his throat.]</em></p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> <em>[Gasping.]</em> help, he–</p>
<p><em>[The smoke detector in William's room begins beeping as William collapses to the ground, clutching his chest.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The skin on William's fingers, nose, and neck begins to peel, revealing a blue fabric underneath. William coughs out blood mixed with a fibrous white substance.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The door to the room opens.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Corbin:</strong> Oh my god, Fresco get in here!</p>
<p><em>[William moves to his side and opens his mouth to speak. Clumps of bloody cotton fibers fall from his open mouth. Two tendrils of smoke are seen drifting off-screen.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Corbin:</strong> Help! <em>[Coughing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Corbin:</strong> What the fuck is go– <em>[Coughing.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Two thuds can be heard as the coughing turns to gasps for air. Dozens of zipper elements<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> are pushed out from the corner of William's eyes.</em>]</p>
<p><em>[After 30 minutes, William's entire epidermis has peeled away and has been replaced with denim fabric.]</em></p>
<p><em>[One hour after the transfiguration was complete, SCP-5907 self-extinguishes.]</em></p>

<p>Cover story TT31 (Carbon Monoxide Leak) was enacted to explain the deaths of the Corbin family; all three corpses as well as SCP-5907 were relocated to Site-51. All mentions of the corpse's mutation were removed from police records and all emergency responders were amnestisized to remove memories of the incident.</p>
<p>The Investigation Team attempted to locate the pawnshop described in the video, but public records indicate no such store has ever existed in the area.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">The Corbin family upon relocation.</div>
</div>
<p>On 2020/03/25, the three corpses were being moved from Biohazard Observation Chamber-3 to their permanent storage location in Safe Storage Locker-59. Upon being lifted, the corpses shed their outer layers, which formed a total of three denim jackets, six denim gloves, three pairs of denim pants, six denim socks, and three denim gimp masks. Aside from their creation, the clothing is non-anomalous. Underneath the corpses' layers of clothing were only skeletal remains and cotton stuffing.</p>
<p>The Corbin family's skeletons were incinerated and the remaining clothing has been folded and stored within SCP-5907's containment locker.</p>
