<p>PoI-9224 performing treatment on a patient</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5104-1 is to be contained in standard containment cell SCC-03, located at Area-179.</p>
<p>PoI-9224 has been integrated into the Foundation's internal structure as Level 1 personnel. On request, PoI-9224 is to perform Protocol-SPINAL-TAP upon SCP-5104-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5104 is the collective designation for an anomalous relationship between two entities: SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224.</p>
<p>SCP-5104-1 is a serpentine entity of unknown origin. SCP-5104-1's physical appearance consists of a raised crest attached to a protracted, segmented vertebral column. Pairs of curved appendages are attached to this column, decreasing in length as the sets are arranged along SCP-5104-1's body. The biological composition of SCP-5104-1 is unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-5104-1 is capable of flight, elevating itself at an estimated 6 meters from the ground, and gliding forward at a gradual pace.</p>
<p>PoI-9224 is David R. Shaffer, a resident of Easttown Township, Pennsylvania, and owner of "Shaffer Chiropractic". PoI-9224 does not possess any apparent anomalous knowledge or ability aside from their relationship with SCP-5104-1.</p>
<p>SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 are instinctively aware of each other's physical locations, no matter the distance. While SCP-5104-1 is not capable of vocalization, the entity chooses to communicate with PoI-9224 telepathically at a short range distance. Prior to containment, SCP-5104-1 pursued PoI-9224 in an attempt to interact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5104.1:</strong> Discovery</p>
<p>On 07/19/2020, at 17:38, Easttown Township law enforcement received a phone call from PoI-9224, who reported SCP-5104-1's presence, and claimed the entity was pursuing him. Within the next hour, multiple calls and reports from various witnesses were received as SCP-5104-1 moved through Easttown Township. Foundation agents intercepted the calls, and containment specialists were dispatched. Both SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 were successfully contained and transferred to Area-179. Witnesses were amnesticized as deemed appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5104.2:</strong> Interview</p>
<p>For informational and contextual purposes, an interview with PoI-9224 was conducted. An excerpt can be found below.</p>

<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> That's what I'm telling you! I was watching TV, then I blacked out. When I got up, I could see, no, <em>feel</em> that thing. It was on 4th street, and I knew it was coming for me next. Can't explain it. Just knew.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Interesting. And you don't have <em>any</em> idea what could've caused this, hm? No playing around with things you shouldn't have? You're sure this hasn't happened before? Keeping secrets isn't helping anyone, Mr. Shaffer.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> I have no clue what you're talking about, honest. I'm a tax payer! I'm a chiropractor! I don't do that pagan shit, if that's what you're saying.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Well Mr. Shaffer, it's not every day something like this happens. I hope you can understand my concern.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Look, I love my country. I'll do anything to help you guys out, but I —</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Laughs</em>) Relax, I'm screwing with you. Hold.</p>
<p><em>Trenton holds his hand to his ear, listening to a communication feed. After 20 seconds, he resumes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> That was my colleague. We just finished your check. Upstanding member of the community, huh? Almost ran for mayor a couple times. Very impressive. On Yelp, Mr. Shaffer?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Your business. Do you have a Yelp page?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Oh, Yelp. I think my son set something up awhile back. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Check it often?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Never.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Figures. We checked it for you. This ring any bells?</p>

<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> The hell's this?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Review from your page, seemed suspect. Most recent one, posted minutes before the entity manifested itself in the middle of town. We were hoping you'd be able to provide context.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Yeah, sorry. No clue.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Understandable. Still feel the anomaly's presence?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Uh, it's in a cell a few hallways down. He's a freaky bastard, that thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> What do you say we pay it a visit, huh? See what it wants.</p>

<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> It's going to kill me! No way in hell I'm going in there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Actually, it was quite docile during containment. Didn't lash out, showed no signs of aggression, what have you. As far as we can tell, the entity poses no physical threat.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> God.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> We could <em>put</em> you there, Mr. Shaffer.</p>

<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) Wait… I see. It's, uh, telling me it's heard of my… praises? It wants me to work my…. healing treatment on it. The hell?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> If I hadn't been paying attention to context clues, that might've been a fun twist.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> Sir, I think this thing wants me to crack its… back. It keeps saying that it's hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> That is what you do, Mr. Shaffer.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> You want me to give it chiropractic treatment?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Crack the entity's back, Mr. Shaffer.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> (<em>Distressed</em>) It's a goddamn flying spine! Where do I even start?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Just go for it. Should be relatively easy.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-9224:</strong> (<em>Sighs</em>) I've cracked worse.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher's Note:</strong> <em>PoI-9224 enacted a two hour chiropractic session on SCP-5104-1. The entity displayed clear affection towards PoI-9224 and satisfaction with its treatment. SCP-5104-1 remarked to PoI-9224 that the treatment 'freed all pain' and '[it] gives 5 red shapes'.</em></p>
<p><em>A more thorough examination of the entity has been conducted using anomalous symbology, imagery, and various threat-assessment protocols. It is almost certain that SCP-5104-1 is a non-malicious entity, and poses no immediate threat to the world or The Foundation at large.</em></p>
<p><em>Considering this and due to PoI-9224's ability to perceive SCP-5104-1's presence at all times, a decision has been made to employ David R. Shaffer on-site as a practicing chiropractor and aide to SCP-5104-1 if need be. PoI-9224 has been granted Level 1 security clearances.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-5104-1 remains in containment, and is approved to receive treatment from PoI-9224 upon request.</em></p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Review taken from Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp page (hover to enlarge)</div>
</div>
<p>On 07/27/2020, the following review was posted on Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp Page.</p>
<p>PoI-9224 was asked to communicate with SCP-5104-1. The entity informed PoI-9224 to 'prepare for healing', and refused to elaborate on this statement.</p>
<p>At 13:56, a massive portal manifested in Easttown Township, Pennsylvania. Several hundred entities similar in appearance to SCP-5104-1 emerged from the portal before its closure. Foundation personnel responded immediately, succeeding in containing the entities and preserving the Veil.</p>
<p>Following transportation to Area-179, PoI-9224 performed chiropractic treatment on the entities, the duration of the session lasting three days in total. Further information on SCP-5104-1's species remains pending.</p>
