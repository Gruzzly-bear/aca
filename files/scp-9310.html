<strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid<br/>
<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”) is authorized to operate full-time within SCP-9310. This task force is also designated as the primary unit responsible for preventing civilian access to SCP-9310 by any means.</p>
<p>Any authorized personnel intending to conduct work, research, or exploration within SCP-9310 must be accompanied by at least one member of MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”) at all times to ensure safety and compliance with current protocols.</p>
<p>The operational headquarters of MTF Sigma-50 is located along the western perimeter of SCP-9310, where facilities supporting rapid response and anomalous containment measures are maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notice:</strong> Personnel are strongly advised to avoid entering SCP-9310 on Halloween, as anomalous activity and uncontrolled incidents have been observed to increase significantly on this date.<br/>
<strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9310 is an anomalous village of thaumaturgical origin located deep within a forested area of Val Poschiavo, Switzerland. According to historical records and testimonies provided by internal entities, SCP-9310 is believed to have been established during the 15th century, coinciding with the escalation of witch hunts across Europe.</p>
<p>SCP-9310 is entirely enveloped by a large-scale thaumaturgical concealment field, which functions as both a visual and perceptual obfuscation mechanism, rendering the village undetectable to unaided observation and modern surveillance technologies. As a result, SCP-9310 effectively does not exist to unauthorized individuals.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of SCP-9310 are collectively designated SCP-9310-A. SCP-9310-A entities are humanoid in appearance and possess advanced proficiency in the application of thaumatology. However, the thaumaturgical methodologies employed by SCP-9310-A are fundamentally distinct from and incompatible with the systems of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-thaumatology">modern thaumaturgical practice documented by the Foundation.</a></p>
<p>All SCP-9310-A entities are classified as Wielder-class entities, demonstrating the ability to channel and manipulate anomalous energies directly through their physical forms. Additionally, SCP-9310 contains six (6) entities designated SCP-9310-B, which function as the ruling council and primary authority within the village. SCP-9310-B entities are classified as Gifted-class entities, exhibiting significantly higher levels of thaumaturgical capability and influence than standard SCP-9310-A instances.</p>
<p>SCP-9310-B entities typically manifest as elderly humans; however, multiple instances of voluntary morphological alteration have been documented, allowing these entities to assume significantly younger appearances. The estimated biological ages of entities residing within SCP-9310 range between 550 and 650 years, achieved through sustained thaumaturgical practices intended to prolong lifespan.</p>
<p>Despite their anomalous characteristics, the daily lives of SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities closely resemble those of baseline humans. Entities require regular consumption of food and water, sleep cycles, and physical activity to maintain physiological stability.</p>
<p>Notably, SCP-9310 entities possess full awareness that witch hunts no longer occur in the outside world. Nevertheless, they have elected to continue residing within SCP-9310 as a closed and self-governing community. Select SCP-9310-A entities are periodically permitted to exit SCP-9310 for limited durations to procure supplies from nearby civilian settlements.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that SCP-9310 maintains a functioning electrical infrastructure, though the origin and long-term sustainability of its power source remain undetermined.</p>

<p>Grand Elder Lilly (4/6).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Interviewed: SCP-9310-B-04 (“Grand Elder Lilly”)<br/>
Interviewer: Agent Rigid<br/>
Location: SCP-9310, Western Perimeter Facility</p>
<p>Physical Description:<br/>
Grand Elder Lilly is a humanoid female entity measuring approximately 1.49 meters in height. Postural deformation is present; estimated height without spinal curvature is approximately 1.60 meters. The entity wears a tall, sharply pointed wizard’s hat and consistently carries a crooked wooden staff. Clothing consists of brightly colored garments, predominantly white with accents of warm colors.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly is consistently observed in a state of mild intoxication. A flask is attached to the entity’s waist at all times. Records indicate the flask formerly contained a universal medicinal compound; it is currently used exclusively to store alcoholic beverages.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: Good day, Grand Elder. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.</p>
<p>(Grand Elder Lilly leans on her staff before sitting down, resting it against the table.)</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Oh, my poor bones… they ache so terribly.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: Would you like some assistance?</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: No, no. Just the usual troubles of old age, nothing more.</p>
<p>(Grand Elder Lilly’s voice is raspy and low. It becomes difficult to hear her clearly when ambient noise increases.)</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: Ma’am—your flask stopper seems to be missing. It’s leaking.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Oh, that’s quite all right. That flask lost its stopper a long time ago.</p>
<p>(The entity takes a long drink from the flask.)</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: What is that liquid?</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Alcohol. Much better these days than when I was young. I keep it in this medicine flask and carry it with me.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: I see… Grand Elder, may I ask when this village was founded?</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: (Frowns) This old mind of mine… let me think… around October 31 , 1450, if I recall correctly. We built this village and concealed it with magic to hide from the authorities. We’ve lived here for a very long time.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: How did you feel at the time? I apologize—this may bring back unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Time dulls even the deepest wounds. I regret only that I did not stand and protect those I loved. I fled with the others, ran far away. Back then, all I felt was hatred, deep in my core. But… yes, I was childish. They could never live as long as I would.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: That sounds… terrible. I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Have I ever told you? In the past, they even used captured witches to hunt other witches. Ah, you won’t find that in your history books. I and the others erased it from history.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: Do you mean torture—forcing witches to confess and betray others?</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: No. Far worse. They used some kind of dark art. They removed the witches’ brains and bound each one to a raven. Ravens filled the skies—each bird was one of their eyes.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: So they used witches to control ravens for hunting. That’s horrifying.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: They are only echoes of an old age. We live happily here now. Four thousand three hundred and eighty-one witches live in this village. We survived that dark era. We live on for those who did not.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: I understand. A truly dark period.</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: Indeed. Oh, my spine… I believe I must visit the clinic today.</p>
<p>Agent Rigid: Would you like me to assist you?</p>
<p>Grand Elder Lilly: No, no need. Thank you for your kindness, child.</p>
<p>(Grand Elder Lilly mounts her staff and levitates away from the area.)</p>

<h2 id="toc1"><span>Addendum 9310-2: MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”)</span></h2>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”) was initially established as an exploration and reconnaissance task force assigned to investigate SCP-9310. Following successful infiltration and extended observation of SCP-9310, Foundation command determined that a permanent, integrated presence would be more effective than conventional containment measures.</p>
<p>As a result, MTF Sigma-50 was reassigned to embed within the SCP-9310 community. Due to the notably cooperative and non-hostile disposition of SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities, the integration process was completed with minimal resistance or incident.</p>
<p>Prolonged cohabitation with highly skilled thaumaturgical practitioners resulted in a significant anomalous development among Sigma-50 personnel. Over time, multiple members began to manifest thaumaturgical abilities consistent with the operational paradigm of SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities, rather than modern Foundation-documented systems.</p>
<p>At present, all active members of MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”) are classified as Scholar-type Thaumatologists. Ongoing research efforts are focused on identifying the anomalous mechanisms that allow a significant proportion of SCP-9310-A entities to advance into the Wielder-class.</p>
<p>The following section summarizes the recorded observations regarding thaumaturgical practices employed within SCP-9310, as documented and analyzed by MTF Sigma-50.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Thaumaturgical Practices of SCP-9310-A Entities</strong></p>
<p>Thaumaturgy utilized by SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities adheres closely to pre-modern European ritualistic traditions, differing fundamentally from contemporary thaumaturgical methodologies recognized by the Foundation.</p>
<p>Through this system, SCP-9310-A entities have demonstrated access to a wide array of abilities traditionally associated with folkloric witchcraft, including but not limited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Potion brewing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Curse application</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hexes and maledictions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Divination and prophetic rituals</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alchemy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conditional invulnerability when subjected to bladed attacks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Directed dream traversal into designated targets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, these abilities require minimal long-term training. Proficiency is primarily dependent on understanding functional principles and activation conditions. Examples include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curse rituals requiring a physical component belonging to the target</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Potion creation involving extensive and variable formula sets</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Talisman construction requiring animal blood, with effectiveness dependent on species-specific properties</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Advanced Thaumaturgy of SCP-9310-B</strong></p>
<p>Thaumaturgical application by SCP-9310-B entities follows the same foundational framework as SCP-9310-A; however, it is heavily influenced by subjective interpretation and individual perception.</p>
<p>For example, while SCP-9310-A entities require specific material components (e.g., blood) to create talismans, SCP-9310-B entities may disregard such requirements entirely, focusing instead on symbolic elements such as engraved patterns. Despite bypassing traditional conditions, SCP-9310-B entities consistently produce talismans of greater potency than those created by SCP-9310-A.</p>
<p>In multiple documented cases, SCP-9310-B entities have demonstrated the ability to omit individual steps—or entire ritual procedures—altogether. Manifestation of thaumaturgical effects appears to occur immediately upon conceptual intent, without observable activation conditions.</p>
<p>Thaumaturgy employed by SCP-9310-B is therefore assessed as perception-driven and condition-independent, operating according to the entity’s internal logic rather than external constraints.</p>
<p>As a result, each SCP-9310-B entity possesses at least one unique, high-yield thaumaturgical ability, characterized by extreme effectiveness but infrequent usage. Some SCP-9310-B entities are believed to possess multiple such abilities, though full documentation remains incomplete.</p>

<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="Halloween-witch.svg.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-9310/Halloween-witch.svg.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>Halloween festival poster at SCP-9310.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Within SCP-9310, Halloween is regarded as one of the most significant annual celebrations, as it coincides with the anniversary of the village’s founding. Preparations typically begin ten (10) days prior to the event. During this period, SCP-9310-A entities display heightened enthusiasm, decorating structures with Halloween-themed posters and conducting frequent excursions outside SCP-9310 to acquire supplies. The atmosphere within the village becomes notably vibrant and anticipatory.</p>
<p>On the night of the festival, a synchronized countdown ritual is observed throughout SCP-9310.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>“9”<br/>
“8”<br/>
“7”<br/>
All residential lights are extinguished simultaneously.</p>
<p>“6”<br/>
“5”<br/>
Fully matured pumpkins, previously harvested, are gathered at the village center.</p>
<p>“4”<br/>
“3”<br/>
“2”<br/>
Logs are stacked vertically into a tall, conical pyre.</p>
<p>“1”<br/>
“0”</p>
</div>
<br/>
At the conclusion of the countdown, the pyre is ignited. The flames rapidly rise, flickering violently as every dwelling within SCP-9310 illuminates at once. A dense fog settles low across the ground, producing a distinctly unsettling atmosphere beneath the firelight.
<p>Despite this, loud laughter and cheerful conversation are recorded among entities whose lifespans exceed five centuries. At approximately 22:00 local time, SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities gather around the bonfire in a communal assembly. At this point, a male entity ascends the raised platform adjacent to the pyre, signaling the beginning of the central ceremonial proceedings.</p>

<p>“Thank you all for gathering here today.”</p>
<p>(Grand Elder Aphex, exhibiting pronounced spinal curvature, steps forward while gripping his staff tightly.)</p>
<p>“Time will continue to flow. One by one, we shall eventually abandon this fragile mortal realm and pass into a quieter, more peaceful world beyond. This year, we bear sorrowful news: Grand Elder Carmen (1/6) has passed away. Her loss is a profound one for us all.”</p>
<p>“However, we must not allow grief to bind us for too long. Regard this moment as bitterness—an unkind jest played by fate itself. We endure, as we always have.”</p>
<p>“Now, I hereby declare the Halloween Festival of this year officially begun.”</p>
<p>(Grand Elder Aphex’s cloak suddenly expands, enveloping his entire body. From within the cloak, a large number of white doves emerge and take flight. Upon dissipation of the cloak, Grand Elder Aphex is no longer present.)</p>

<p>Grand Elder Dorothy (5/6).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>“We fled. We ran. We abandoned those hellish lands drenched in death and came here. Yes… no. We were never strong enough to create a great concealment barrier like this. Such a thing was impossible with the power we possessed at the time.</p>
<p>The skies behind us were blackened by the King’s ravens. They lurked within the forests, and we prayed that the flocks would fail to find us. But how could anyone ever escape them, when those ravens could merge into a single, unified swarm?</p>
<p>Then came the King’s hunting hounds.</p>
<p>Liam descended upon us.</p>
<p>The King maintained an entire pack of hunters tasked with eliminating any threat he believed might endanger his rule. Liam was the most infamous among them. He wielded an enchanted blade imbued with freezing magic. He moved through forest after forest, killing indiscriminately. One… ten… fifty lives were taken by his hand. It was only a matter of time before he reached us.</p>
<p>Carmen knew this.</p>
<p>As we fled, she whispered continuously—murmuring a chant I had never heard before, a spell unknown even to us. When he finally drew close, preparing to strike me down, Carmen descended from above. Her left hand twisted unnaturally, poised for a single snap.</p>
<p>Snap.</p>
<p>His body was crushed flat against the ground, reduced to ruin in an instant. Without hesitation, she seized his sword and severed his head.</p>
<p>I tell you this not to glorify the past. Our generation is nearing the end of its long life. You—the younger ones—now carry burdens heavier than we ever did. You shall become the new flame that guides humanity forward.”<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>—Grand Elder Dorothy</p>
</div>
</div>
Throughout the ongoing investigation into the unusually high concentration of Wielder-class entities within SCP-9310, the Foundation has conducted extensive interviews and informal interactions with SCP-9310 residents. To date, the statement provided by Grand Elder Dorothy (5/6) remains the sole consistent and actionable lead.
<p>Personnel exposed to or actively utilizing the thaumaturgical systems practiced within SCP-9310 consistently report a distinct psychological response. This response is characterized by an intense sensation of anger, resentment, and suppressed rage. These effects have been independently verified by MTF Sigma-50 (“Witch Apprentices”).</p>
<p>Notably, this phenomenon is not limited to direct practitioners. Any individual who is the target or recipient of thaumaturgical effects originating from SCP-9310 methodologies has reported similar emotional feedback, regardless of prior thaumaturgical sensitivity.</p>
<p>A prevailing hypothesis has been proposed identifying Grand Elder Carmen (1/6) as the potential origin of this effect. According to Grand Elder Dorothy’s testimony, prolonged incantation duration directly correlates with spell potency. Based on this principle, it is theorized that Grand Elder Carmen conducted an extended, large-scale thaumaturgical invocation during the period of persecution described in historical accounts.</p>
<p>Foundation researchers now hypothesize that Grand Elder Carmen intentionally created a secondary anomalous construct to serve as a power framework for SCP-9310-A and SCP-9310-B entities. The substance used to condense and stabilize this construct is believed to be the accumulated hatred and anguish of witches killed during the European witch hunts.</p>
<p>This construct—while not directly observable—may function as a collective thaumaturgical reservoir, amplifying emotional resonance and lowering the threshold required for SCP-9310 entities to ascend into the Wielder-class.</p>
<p>Further investigation into this hypothesis is ongoing.</p>
