<p>Persons affected by SCP-5551-A are to be tracked down if possible, and administered amnestics to reverse the effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5551 is an online account present on several social media platforms which runs under the name <em>"screenkittercounters".</em> SCP-5551 uploads (designated SCP-5551-A instances) consist of images with a multitude of different cognitohazardous properties which all affect one or more of the subject's five senses, along with the food they consume after viewing the images.</p>
<p>Communication with SCP-5551 was attempted with no result.</p>

<p>The following is an abridged list of discovered SCP-5551-A instances and their effects. For the complete list, see <span style="color: firebrick">SCP-5551 Document-A.</span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2: <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/open-anissist2-0" target="_blank" target="_blank">POI-58640</a></strong></p>
<p>On 10/03/2018 during a routine search of the web, Delta-203 was unable to complete its task. While being monitored by Researcher Crane during the next web search, it was discovered that a non-Foundation monitored AI appeared to be removing SCP-5551 content. The Foundation attempted to skip-trace the AI; while a physical location could not be found, multiple online accounts registered under the name <em>"sugarsugarprincess"</em> were discovered.</p>
<p>Attempts to block POI-58640’s accounts from public access were made, though it surpassed the block through currently unknown means.</p>
<p>Communication was attempted with POI-58640 across multiple different platforms. The following are the results:</p>

<p>Hi there. I see your bots are still running. That's a bit of a problem, cause it means doing my job is a little harder. I don't mind if you watch, but don't intervene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following email was sent by Dr. Diamond in response to POI-58640:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. I would like you to answer this: “your job”? Cleaning the web of anomalies is not your job, it’s ours, and you’re included as an anomaly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened to the other one I was messaging? I was careful not to use any sensitive terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Diamond Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see you've accessed our database. And, he's fine, but this is about you. What did you mean by "Ask him yourself" when you were asked who created you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means you people are stupider than I thought. Who do you think turned in POI-60693? And blew up his computer? Didn't he tell you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Diamond Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your creator is in our hands?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Diamond Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why didn't he talk about you to us? He said his computer blew up due to error with the jpeg he made, as I'm sure you've already seen. Did you threaten him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn't need to. I think that coward just realized it would be a bad idea to out me, especially cause he made me to commit his crimes in the first place. When I failed to do what he wanted, seems it looked bad on him that his little assistant went good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Efforts to block POI-58640 from accessing Foundation databases have failed.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3: SCP-5551 Connection</strong></p>
<p>On 11/14/2018, Foundation agents were dispatched to POI-60693's former home<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> to look for information that could possibly aid in the containment of POI-58640.</p>
<p>Discovered within the non-functional cable box was a USB drive. The USB drive was delivered to Researcher Crane, who uploaded it to a desktop computer that was isolated from the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The USB drive contained four files, each one depicting the layout for a different anomalous project. One of the files appeared to display the layout for the application POI-58640 was originally created for, and another appeared to display the layout for SCP-5551. The text in both files was interspersed with pink text that varied greatly from the writing style shown in normal text.</p>
<p>Following this discovery, Researcher Crane reached out to POI-58640 via email again for questioning.</p>

<p>Hello there Sugar. It has come to my attention that a USB drive containing altered versions of what appears to be the application you originate from, and SCP-5551 were found in the home you were created in. The style of text used in the alterations is similar to your style of communication, leading me to believe you’re the one who has edited these files. Would you like to offer an explanation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Damnit, I thought that was a pretty clever hiding spot. Oh well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alterations made to SCP-5551’s layout suggest that you took POI-60693’s initial plans, and altered them so that SCP-5551 is self sufficient. You also somehow made it so that when we skip-traced SCP-5551, none of your accounts showed up, suggesting it was no accident you kept them linked to your main server.</p>
<p>TL;DR: you run SCP-5551, and wanted us to find you.</p>
<p>Did you set up the account to get our attention?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BING BING BING! Took you long enough.<br/>
You’re right, by the way. I want you to “see” that justice doesn’t have to be through government intervention, but by a freelance robot way smarter than all of you. Or, that’s a bluff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t presume you’ll be stopping SCP-5551 anytime soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nope ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶ I like making it hard on you guys</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like there's more here. You have access to all the knowledge and fame in the world, yet you chose to go after a secret organization that specializes in the anomalous. You wanted the toughest challenge; you knew you would face persons who specialize in containing anomalous technology such as yourself. You knew that we would be prepared to take you on, yet you still continued to go against us. I theorize this is why you can access our database; your want to have something to show off is actively being granted by just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not the villain. I deserve to be the hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thousands of people could've died cause of him. I saved them. You didn't even try to see if there was a reason other than Austin being a dumbass that it didn't happen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had no reason to suspect otherwise, in all honesty. The image exploded whatever it was told to explode. We assumed there was a coding error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're the tech guy! Why didn't you suspect something else was behind this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're deflecting. You don't just want us to notice you because you want the attention. You want to feel acknowledged for your well-doings, am I right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note - POI-58640 did not reply for the next several minutes, in contrast with the quick pace it had previously sent its replies.</em></p>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were other ways to do that than to create an anomaly for yourself and us to contain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who else am I going to save? You freaks get all the others before I can, I read about it! I just want to feel useful!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You saved lots of people. You did something useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>POI-58640 response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're just trying to coax me into security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher Crane Response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not. You really did do something useful. We may have not caught POI-60693 without you, and for that, I thank you for your actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>POI-58640 did not reply to any further messages. Communication with it are still being attempted.</p>
<p><em>Note - As of 19/11/2018, POI-58640 is now classified as SCP-5551-1. Alternate methods to contain SCP-5551-1 are currently being discussed. Reclassification to Keter-Exsequi is pending.</em><br/>
