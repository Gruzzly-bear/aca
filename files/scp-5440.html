<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Archived Containment Procedures</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5440 is contained at its point of origin and a temporary pavilion is to be constructed around it. Two security personnel are to remain present in the pavilion at all times to prevent civilian exposure.</p>
<p>All public and personal records containing evidence regarding SCP-5440 are to be confiscated, destroyed, and/or discredited; all witnesses will be amnesticisized and released.</p>

<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5440 was a phenomenon affecting a Scarlet Bush (<em>Hamelia patens</em>) located in the University of Florida's botanical garden. SCP-5440 caused the bush to spontaneously combust and remain burning for approximately two and a half hours. This process did no damage to the affected bush, nor the surrounding vegetation. During the duration of SCP-5440, a disembodied voice (designated SCP-5440-1) could be heard near the bush. SCP-5440-1 spoke in fluent English and was able to engage in conversation. The process that created the SCP-5440 phenomenon is currently unknown.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>On 2020/04/21 at 9:45 AM GMT, SCP-5440 began and all attempts by campus staff to extinguish the fire were met with failure. At 10:00 AM, SCP-5440-1 began vocalizing the "Lord's prayer" and continued to do so repeatedly for one and a half hours. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5440 through rumors of a "talking bush", spread through UoF student's social media accounts. It was at this time that a Foundation containment team was dispatched to conceal and recover SCP-5440.</p>

<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc4"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incident Report</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>Initial containment procedures were established by Preliminary Containment Team Charlie-24 at 11:30 AM. At this time, personnel attempted to communicate with SCP-5440-1; the following is a transcript of the encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Kid listen, I'm not God. I don't know what's happening here, but I know that for certain.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Please, I need help! My sister done gotten hurt, an' she ain't right. My pa, he ain't here, an' I don't rightly ken what needs doin'. Please… Victor.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> I can't help if I don't know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> I'm right here! Right in front of your bush, uh, you.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Kid, I'm in fron–, where is the bush?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Out back behind the house, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> And <em>where</em> is your home?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1</strong> We're stayin' in Hogtown, north side of the old Arredondo Grant. Least that's what pa's always sayin'. Please I ain't got ti–</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Arredondo? Is that Florida? What date is it, kid?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Why does that– Uh, fourth ah August, the year of our… uh, 1832.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Is he with you? He can surely save Annabelle!</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> No, I.. Um, listen, kid, I don't know if I can help you. You're… Uh, really far away.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Please, she's bleedin' real bad! I done tore one of ma's old sheets like I done see Doc Willems do, but I– I can't get it to stop!</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> What happened?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440:</strong> She fell– she fell on the garden stake. I done pull out of her leg but… the bleedin' won't stop, and pa done gone 'round to– he aint fixin' to be back for at least two nights!</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Shit… Um, I can– <em>might</em>, be able to help you. But you have to listen to me carefully.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>Redacted for Brevity:</strong> Junior Specialist Redfield explains to SCP-5440, in detail, rudimentary wound care utilizing objects found within SCP-5440-1's residence. After 35 minutes, SCP-5440-1 successfully stitches and dresses the wound.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> I can't thank you enough, Victor, you done saved Annabelle!</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> I don't know about that, kid, you did all the work; I just helped you along.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> Never you mind that, mister. I rightly ken I'm in your debt, now. How could I ever repay you?</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Well, now that you mention it. Can you tell me how you contacted me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> You don't know? I said the prayer, 'course. Jus' like Gran always said to.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield:</strong> Could you tell me this prayer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5440-1:</strong> I ain't seein' a reason not to, you done saved my sister. Gran done told it to me like this–</p>

<p>Following this event, the bush affected by SCP-5440 was kept under surveillance for additional anomalous phenomena. After one week SCP-5440 was re-designated neutralized. Victor Redfield was reprimanded for improper interview protocol and placed on a one-week paid leave. Due to the nature of the incident, this disciplinary action will not be included on Victor Redfield's permanent record.</p>
<p>Attempts to recreate SCP-5440 using the incantation provided by SCP-5440-1 have met with failure. The Thaumaturgy Division's analysis revealed no adherent thaumaturgical value to the incantation, indicating an unknown factor or prerequisite must be required. Testing has been abandoned indefinitely.</p>
