<p>SCP-4829 prior to 9/19/2072, in false color spectroscopy (left) and real color (right).</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4829</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures [<span style="color: blue">UPDATED 9/20/2072</span>]:</strong> Standard Class 4 (Nearby Celestial Object) disinformation protocols and image doctoring protocols apply. Containment personnel are to remain in Uranus' orbit and monitor SCP-4829's state.</p>
<p>In the event that SCP-4829's containment staff deem neutralization necessary, one instance of <a href="/scp-2501">SCP-2501-EX</a> will be immediately delivered to them from orbital storage by MTF Mu-119 ("Red Squadron").</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4829 is Uranus' moon Umbriel.</p>
<p>SCP-4829 repeatedly generates large, flower-like structures made of ice or rock along its surface; each of these structures measures up to 40 km tall and moves rhythmically for several months before sinking back below the surface. Routine probes determined that beneath the ice lies a gelatinous layer of dissolved hydrocarbons, proteins and enzymes.</p>
<p>On 9/19/2072, Foundation astronauts Chad Roland, Vanessa Marquez, and Monica Lorenz descended from Umbriel's orbit in a lander to investigate SCP-4829’s surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The following log is transcribed from Monica Lorenz's bodycam.]</p>
<p>[<strong>BEGIN LOG</strong>]<br/>
(<em>The camera jolts as the lander touches down on Umbriel's surface.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Roland:</strong> Mission Control, this is Skywalker. We've landed half a kilometer from one of the structures.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Control:</strong> Roger, <em>Skywalker</em>, we copy. Excellent job.</p>
<p><strong>Roland:</strong> Stepping out.</p>
<p>(<em>Roland opens the airlock and climbs onto the ladder.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Marquez:</strong> Performing thruster diagnostics, stand by.</p>
<p>(<em>Roland descends the ladder and steps onto the surface, with Lorenz following on the ladder.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Roland:</strong> Surface appears- what the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>Lorenz:</strong> Are you alright?</p>
<p>(<em>Roland sinks into the regolith up to his knees, and his space suit dissolves. His body balloons and stretches into an ellipsoid shape as his skin becomes translucent white.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Lorenz:</strong> Oh shit! Vanessa, get us out of here!</p>
<p>(<em>Lorenz climbs back into the lander and disconnects Roland's tether, throwing the remaining length out of the lander.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Roland sinks further into the surface and bursts, spreading white liquid across several square meters of ice. The liquid is pulled into the surface and the ground shakes.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Lorenz closes the lander door.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Marquez:</strong> Fuck! 3, 2, 1, ignition!</p>
<p>(<em>The camera feed shakes as the lander takes off.</em>)<br/>
[<strong>END LOG</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> As Lorenz and Marquez returned to orbit, the surface of SCP-4829 cracked along the equator, causing vast amounts of lunar material to fall into the widening chasm. SCP-4829 continued to crack until it fully split into two identical, smaller instances of itself.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>UPDATE 9/21/2072:</strong></span> SCP-4829 is currently thousands of small moons attached to each other in a spherical arrangement, dividing roughly every 13 hours. Orbital data shows SCP-4829's constituent objects to be composed of cytoplasm, surrounded by shells of ice and rock.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>UPDATE 9/23/2072:</strong></span> Individual lunar structures now number beyond 20,000. SCP-4829 remains roughly the same size.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>UPDATE 10/11/2072:</strong></span> SCP-4829’s orbit decays further; causing it to fall into the ε ring (Uranus' brightest ring). The ring material rearranges, sheathing SCP-4829 in a diffuse cloud while a stream of ice particles extends down to connect SCP-4829 with Uranus' atmosphere. Gas from the atmosphere flows up the ice stream, covering SCP-4829 further.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>UPDATE 11/14/2072:</strong></span> SCP-4829 has deformed and is no longer spherical. Sensors indicate a rhythmic, repeating vibration generated by SCP-4829’s core at a rate of 110-120 beats per minute.</p>
