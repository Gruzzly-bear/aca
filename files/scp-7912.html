<p><span class="st">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-7912 refers to the interior of former Testing Chamber Alpha of the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Advanced Studies.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Foundation black site facility responsible for the securement and research of anomalies with distinct, highly <a href="/scp-2921">complex</a> effect profiles/containment procedures.</span> At this time, knowledge of the existence of SCP-7912 is limited to members of the Department of Deletions.</p>
<p>SCP-7912's reference data does not exist; the sectors of the Database which lead to SCP-7912 have not been marked as read-only. Instead, a number of <a href="/scp-2719">abstract-metaphysical construct pointers</a> lead from writable whitespace to the identifier "interior of SCP-7912's chamber." This has been confirmed by Deletions agents, which observe the anomaly as empty void.</p>
<p>The origin of SCP-7912's current state is unknown. Due to its location, it is presumed to have been the result of testing or neutralization efforts of <a href="/scp-184">another</a> anomalous designation, the details of which were never documented.</p>
<p>The previous state of SCP-7912 is similarly unknown— although assumptions can be made about its general layout and condition based on neighboring chambers, any concrete data about this topic is lost and unrecoverable. Attempts to fill these sectors with extrapolations have failed due to SCP-7912's apparent resistance to its own information; rather than seeking equilibrium within the surrounding area by naturally cohering to expected tropes and established rules of the fabula, SCP-7912 rejects all definition in a manner directly proportional to its own relevance.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A notable violation of the Ockham-Hitchens Proposition. Specifically, between non sequitur and apagoge; ie. "The relationship between the most likely cause and its inherent truth is typically linear." More information can be found in the included testing log.</span></p>

<p>SCP-7912 represents a significant pluripotent metaconceptual hazard, with three main vectors of phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any extranarrative materia (e.g. <a href="/scp-6183">blackbox</a>) written to the affected sectors can manifest within SCP-7912's chamber as stochastic phenomena, leading to unforeseen hazards and complications stemming from retroactive continuity.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">In other words, extranarrative detritus introduced into the bounds of the anomaly inherently becomes part of that anomaly's substrate by virtue of existing within it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When entered from the chamber doors by existent personnel of typical configuration, mental constructs and/or internal landscapes of said personnel undergo massive metamorphic psychogenesis.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The manifestation of thoughtspace within the material plane, typically reinforced through repeated acknowledgement of its existence or concentrated belief.</span> Because of this, a vast majority of anomalous interactions experienced by Foundation personnel are not reported as such. These manifestations are limited to a cone of awareness created by the sensory organs of the individual experiencing them; the chamber appears to dynamically render outcomes the impacted individual finds <span class="strike">least</span> likely to occur.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-7912 is directly accessible at any time by Deletions agents, as the anomaly is a persistent, bi-directional vector between Research Station Mnemosyne and a Foundation site, the first of its kind.</li>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> We should do this more often. Why don't we do this more often?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Another entity manifests in the chair <span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A</span></span> faces. It also possesses the same instability but leans back in the chair, relaxed.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> Because it's insane. This is quite literally delusional. I'd call it masturbatory but, for some reason, I'm against the idea of roasting you <em>too</em> hard. All of this pretense is a waste of—</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Disembodied.&gt;</em> Time? You know that word has little meaning here. And please, don't act like you have anything else better to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;A third humanoid appears across the table from the second, on <span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A</span></span>'s right.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> We wouldn't be here if there wasn't something better to do.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Coughs.&gt;</em> Well, that's exactly why I've arranged this meeting; as you can probably tell, you exist again, which means we have a new assignment.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> So, holding a department-wide, in-person meeting is purely symbolic?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> No, it's done for the "internal debate." <em>&lt;Scoffs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> Laugh all you want. I'm aware of the shortcomings of this format, but you are also aware we parse some things out better like this.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> Usually, it's not necessary. I mean, <em>usually</em>, our tasks are somewhat clear, as complicated as they may be.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> Not today. We have a gravity well in the Database that needs to be filled, and I'm sure you understand the issue with that sentiment.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> Of course.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> <em>It's all information, baby.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> Right. If it can destroy its own information, nothing we put there will last. It lacks read-only protection, lacks true understanding. The fact that we're discussing it right now in these plain of terms means we haven't interacted with the timeline in a way that would have impacted us, nor will we at any point. I'm not sure if we <em>can</em> interact with it now, even though we all can see the open window.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> We have to overwrite our memories. Leave a note for the next iteration.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> You don't know that—</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> No, I <em>do</em> know that. We all know that, avoiding the inevitable is just easier, isn't it? Sitting here, getting all chummy with ourselves, throwing this little pity party for less than one. You've been getting too comfortable. We all have. We're not supposed to get comfortable here. I'm ready to move on.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> Wait—Wait. Let me just get a second opinion.</p>

One rests its elbows on the table, head in hands, while the other fidgets uncomfortably, left knee jittering with nervous energy.

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff8b6f">N/A:</span></span> What do you hope for me to add to the conversation, man? Let me go back to the void, for fuck's sake.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #444b47">N/A:</span></span> Shush. Let's just get this over with.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> Er—yeah. And don't stretch us too thin. Although, I agree with you that there has to be something else we can try before reformat. <em>&lt;Turning to <span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A</span></span>.&gt;</em> Not because I'm attached to these people but because I think it's a stupid idea.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ba5258">N/A:</span></span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #5c5b8e">N/A:</span></span> We don't know what would happen if our department came into contact with a metaconceptual hazard. I was certain it wasn't possible until a moment ago—Hold on. Where did that information come from?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #ff8b6f">N/A:</span></span> Don't look at us. We aren't new to this mode of existence.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #744758">N/A:</span></span> Wait, this can't be right. Fragmentation levels are the same. No foreign memories, no dead sectors. How is this possible?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Standing.&gt;</em> That would probably be me, sorry. I was hoping it would be more… subtle.</p>

He was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone</span>, something no other member of Deletions could say with such conviction.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> I'm an inevitability; my presence an eventual outcome given the nature of the Database. My patchwork is whole. You must understand what I'm saying.</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> This- This is unprecedented. You're an anomaly among anomalies. The chances of something like this occurring are… <em>&lt;Pauses.&gt;</em> Two hundred and ninety-four million to one.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> And yet, here I am.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> How?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Unfortunately, statistics is not the only factor at play here. You've deleted me before. Well, not <em>you</em>, you. Previous iterations of you. The cause of this… <em>deviation</em> eludes me, but I assure you, it is well beyond the scope of probabilities. As you said; unprecedented.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Well… Let's just say I'm not used to having company.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> What about your little troupe, are they not company enough?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> The line that separates you from I is far more tangible than that which separates the rest of us. That delineation was lost before introduction. It's far less unpredictable, far more mundane.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> I expected something to that effect. I keep thinking you'll be different but existential boredom seems to be a constant around these parts.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why you showed yourself here, now.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Putting feet up on the table.&gt;</em> Your little problem. That gravity well. I've been trying to figure it out, we have. You keep overwriting parts of yourself to get around the effect, but have grown quite proficient at being exposed.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Rubbing temples.&gt;</em> How do I know you're telling the truth? You could just as easily be another Database error we're trying to contain. It's far more likely than the story you've presented.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Yes, that's the problem, isn't it? The unlikelihood is proof of its certainty.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Shakes head.&gt;</em> What?</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> This is all the experiential data we have about the anomaly. At some point, a neutralization attempt of SCP-184 took place within the P.M. Center. We don't know why, nor how. We can't even be sure this was the result. But it makes sense in a nonsensical way, doesn't it?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Reading.&gt;</em> Not really, no.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> What is the inverse of something that duplicates an interior with increasing inaccuracy the farther you move outward?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Something that removes an interior with increasing accuracy the farther you travel inward? I mean, I <em>guess</em>—Wait, so, what happened to 184?</p>

<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Yeesh. Okay, so, how can we even discuss this? You've clearly encountered this anomaly before, you claim the metaconceptual hazard can affect us, wouldn't that mean this thing can't be discussed outright?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> You're fine, for now. Like you said, you haven't interacted with the timeline yet. I have, but because of our unique position, my cognitive faculties are the ones at risk here.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> And yet, we keep exposing ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Yes, you keep ignoring my warning.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Warning? What warning?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Taking feet off the table and leaning forward.&gt;</em> Do not go through SCP-7912. It must remain sealed. Everything will be fine if you stay here.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> And you?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> I haven't gone through it yet, but I know I will. I also know my Semblance remains whole after that point, as it has throughout my many deletions. A few specks of data are lost, here and there, but I have never once lost anything I cared about losing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A</span></span> disappears and reappears, now standing behind the chair, hand resting on it. The entity vanishes once more and five take its place, debating quietly in a tight huddle. A moment later they melt into the floor. <span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A</span></span> manifests back in the chair, shifting quickly as if agitated.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Is there a problem?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> No. Thinking. We'll need a better understanding of what happens inside the chamber. Can we get a camera working in there?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Hm. <em>&lt;Pauses.&gt;</em> A surprisingly novel idea. I believe I can, yes. It would have to be embedded in the Mesh itself, which is doable.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Right, you keep mentioning an adaptive mesh. What is it?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Well, it's a mesh that adapts to things. That doesn't make sense?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> No—It- I thought there would be more to it than that.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> None whatsoever. Oh, I did manage to switch it off once. I think. It's probably still off, considering.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> <em>&lt;Surprised.&gt;</em> Why would you do that?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> You can't all be this fucking dense, can you? How should I know?! I barely have context for this. All I know is that it <em>was</em> off, and I know how to turn it back <em>on</em>. But I <em>haven't</em>. That enough for you?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> Look, we just want to understand your perspective. We usually have no problem getting to know each other.</p>
<p><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> stares, wearily. A pained expression crosses his face. After a moment, it passes and he speaks again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Sighs.&gt;</em> You're right. Maybe I should try something new. If it doesn't work, it's just a matter of time before you forget me anyway, right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;The defined figure does not wait for a response to the rhetorical and continues.&gt;</em></p>
<p>In truth, I'm the one making this dynamic weird and <em>also</em> the one leaving you in the dark. It was your preference. These memories are painful, but I still hold them and the weight of their burden. Someone has to.</p>
<p>I was—I am one of SCP-184's neutralization team. Out of them, I'm the only one whose identity hasn't been fragmented to shit. The rest of them… the rest of those people and the rest of that anomaly is <em>gone</em>. Gone <em>here</em>. They're you.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> How—?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> When it, uh, <em>happened</em>, you were mostly yourselves. One gestalt sure, but, you knew each other's names. And mine. You could form us separate and that separation was so profound. We were lost in this state. I mean, the things you could do with that dodecahedron inside you. You'd have not believed it.</p>
<p>A conference room? A holding cell? <em>&lt;Scoffs.&gt;</em> Think of floating castles, arboretums in the clouds, skyscrapers above them. Orangeries on their rooftop gardens. Infinitely. Our power was infinite. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>We began to worry about that place, that hole in nothing that can be anything, so long as it wasn't the right thing. We started seeing it, in daydreams, when we closed our eyes. A vast and pulsating void, I would feel myself sink into an ocean of tar, where every direction of escape was wrong and led further downhill, further into darkness. The liquid would climb up my body and pour itself into my mouth and nose… I could feel every sensation. I'd never been so frightened.</p>
<p>We decided to start looking, not knowing what we'd do with it. Do we jump back in, fully changed to the state we are now, or does the nature and direction of time preclude that possibility? Were there states worse than this one we'd been given as mercy?</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> So, you couldn't do it.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Stands, enraged.&gt;</em> No, <em>we</em> couldn't do it! You were there too, but only the physical images. You had figured out how to 'reformat' parts of your data so you could be unburdened by your ego, unburdened by your visions. Your memories. Abusing the same methods we used to improperly neutralize 184 in the first place. You'd leave instruction—</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A:</span></span> —Instructions for the next iteration, yes. It's a stopgap measure. To prevent exposure.</p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> <em>&lt;Approaches <span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A</span></span>.&gt;</em> You fools. It was guilt you were exposing yourself to, guilt over abandoning your Assignment, and myself. Weakness. You're weak. And too scared to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>I will do what needs to be done. And as long as you stay on this side of the Barrier, you'll be safe from the hazardous effects, remember? Well, except each others'.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #fdf1f2">N/A</span></span> looks down in surprise, noticing their feet melting into the floor, along with <span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912's</span></span>.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> Turns out we both know how to design an interior. Don't worry, undoing it is easy; ever solve a Rubik's Cube for the first time? Know what, your answer doesn't really matter at this point.</p>
<p>You'll know when I have installed the cameras. Until then. Don't be a stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> disappears into the floor.&gt;</em></p>

<td>Upon opening the doors to SCP-7912's chamber, Dougherty is physically assaulted by a rough approximation of her father, who chastises her for keeping her doors locked. She apologizes several times, quickly fleeing and hiding in a nearby supply closet. Foundation efforts to locate and identify the escaped entity are successful, after which it is released back into SCP-7912's chamber as per its request. When questioned, Dougherty expresses no confusion or surprise at the events that transpired, instead confabulating likely explanations which are, of course, unlikely to be the actual cause and thus should be discarded.</td>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;The lighting in the hall shifts hue, settling within the ultraviolet spectrum. As a result, the chamber walls shimmer with phosphorescent lattice. The hall shifts back a moment later.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912:</span></span> H-How—?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Before an answer could be provided, <span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> turns on a heel and sprints to the back entrance of SCP-7912's chamber. It starts as a pinpoint of light in front of him, expanding as he continues to run towards the location. When the portal increases in size to a shimmering passage, he dives through, emerging into a perfect replica of SCP-7912's once-interior. That can't be right. <strong>Something is wrong.</strong>&gt;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> exits the chamber into the P.M. Center's Experimentation and Neutralization wing. He takes a sharp right, the space turning into a temple, one the man had never seen before. Unfazed, he looks up at the shifting light above him. It speaks to him.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt"><span style="color: #950508">THE INTERIOR:</span></span> <tt>THERE IS NO MORE OUTSIDE</tt></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> runs further inside. He runs through void.&gt;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> runs further inside. He scales a mountain of dust and ash, coughing, each breath of opaque air labored and desperate.&gt;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;<span class="bt"><span style="color: #783a8d">POI-7912</span></span> runs further inside. He hides in the awnings of furnished cabins against rainstorms that never end, from skies never seen.&gt;</em></p>

<li><strong>Tenebrarius:</strong> The Foundation does not and cannot possess information about the anomaly.</li>
<li>Foundation black site facility responsible for the securement and research of anomalies with distinct, highly <a href="/scp-2921">complex</a> effect profiles/containment procedures.</li>
<li>A notable violation of the Ockham-Hitchens Proposition. Specifically, between non sequitur and apagoge; ie. "The relationship between the most likely cause and its inherent truth is typically linear." More information can be found in the included testing log.</li>
<li>In other words, extranarrative detritus introduced into the bounds of the anomaly inherently become part of that anomaly's substrate by virtue of existing within it.</li>
<li>The manifestation of thoughtspace within the material plane, typically reinforced through repeated acknowledgement of its existence or concentrated belief.</li>
