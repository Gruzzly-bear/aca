<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Should SCP-4051 breach the outer wall of its containment unit, Dr. Yesenia is to be called upon as the primary catalyst for de-escalating potential conflict and recontaining it. If Dr. Yesenia is unable to de-escalate the breach due to unforeseen complications, on-site containment teams are to use standard Ranged-Incapacitation engagement tactics. Note that if SCP-4051 becomes cognizant of the assault team, the strike is to be aborted and the team immediately redeployed.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4051 is a male humanoid which can create temporary Class-E wormholes to extradimensional spaces populated by a theoretically infinite number of a unique item. These items are able to be removed from the extradimensional space, given that they are physically able to fit through the wormhole. Testing has concluded that SCP-4051 is unable to alter the contents of the extradimensional space after manifestation.</p>
<p>SCP-4051 has been able to manifest the following items during controlled experiments overseen by Dr. Edwards at Site-17. Manifested items detailed in the relevant experiment logs below have been omitted.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small, weighted net, measuring 3 m<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>A standard pharmaceutical container of sugar pills, although the label describes the pills as headache medication.</li>
<li>A glass of drinking water.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-4051 has either claimed or has been reported to have manifested the following items outside of experiments sanctioned by Dr. Edwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>An aluminum baseball bat.</li>
<li>Several rolls of duct tape.</li>
<li>An incendiary device and blast-proof sheet.</li>
<li>Eleven instances of Class-E paracognitohazards.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-4051 has been allowed to use its anomalous abilities to assist with general repairs at Site-17.</span> After retroactive review of all procedures and programs relating to SCP-4051's containment by the Ethics Committee and subsequent evaluation by the Foundation Containment Committee, SCP-4051's presence outside of its containment unit has been demonstrated to be a substantial threat to any and all personnel located at Site-17.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> SCP-4051 was first brought to the attention of Foundation operatives in August of 2012 when a video depicting it using its anomalous abilities began to gain significant online attention. The recording depicted SCP-4051 assaulting and detaining several men via its anomalous abilities.</p>
<p>The video gained over two million views before warranting an intervention, following multiple testimonies by commenters of similar occurrences. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#pi-1" target="_blank">Mobile Task Force Pi-1 "City Slickers"</a> identified SCP-4051 and performed a successful retrieval and extraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-4051</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Due to SCP-4051’s resistance during its retrieval, SCP-4051 has been separated from Dr. Roswell by a one-way glass barrier and is handcuffed to a chair.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Greetings. My name is Dr. Roswell. Is your name Rainer Miller?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4051 is heard struggling against its handcuffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Rainer, it would be helpful if you could remain still for the rest of this interview.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> A safe place, I assure you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4051 is silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Please, explain your anomalous capabilities to us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> My… are you government guys? Sorry. Um, I can make things appear out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Anything you want?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Kind of. Only small objects, I think. I mostly use it to help people.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> You’re referring to your vigilantism?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah. It used to be carjackings and thefts and stuff, but recently I’ve gotten involved with this group called the Looming Shadow. They’re stealing money for something, so I have to do nightly patrols. I tried contacting the police, but I’m pretty sure they’ve been bought out. Actually, wait, could you guys do anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> I’ll send a request. Do you know if anyone has seen you use your anomalous capabilities?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> A few people, yeah. I helped this one woman a while back, and there have probably been a few I don’t know about. I try to keep this stuff quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Alright. I think that will conclude this interview. You will—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Wait, hold on, do you have anything else to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Not at the moment. Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> If you guys want to know anything else about this thing that I have, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Your willingness to work with us is appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> You’re welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/15/2012</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest several items by Dr. Roswell: a 3 cm<sup>3</sup> cube of lead, an object of SCP-4051's choice, and a container of bleach.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-4051 produced the cube after some hesitation. Requests for an object of its choice resulted in SCP-4051 removing a framed picture of its mother. SCP-4051 expressed discomfort at being requested to remove the bleach but complied without incident.</p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-4051 was escorted back to its containment unit and reportedly asked how long it would need to test its anomalous properties. Site staff were informed that they ought to avoid the question if possible, for the continuation of SCP-4051’s compliance.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Seems like it needs to have a clear mental image before it can manifest anything. More testing to determine boundaries of its anomaly will follow.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/16/2012</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a copy of Leo Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em> and a functioning mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The produced copy of Tolstoy's novel displayed the English words "War and Peace" written in large font on a blank cover. Most pages of the book contained redundant gibberish tangentially related to war, and SCP-4051 confessed that it was unfamiliar with the contents of the novel.</p>
<p>The mobile phone that was manifested appeared to be unremarkable until attempts were made to operate it, and it was revealed to be completely hollow.</p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> As SCP-4051 was being escorted back to its containment unit, it asked repeatedly how its family was, and if it could have any company as it waited for the next test. All questions were ignored by the escort team.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Test suggests that SCP-4051's anomaly is based on how much it understands about the object? Next test should have 4051 manifest something nonexistent.</p>

<p><em>[A transcript has been provided to supplement the following experiment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/17/2012</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a circular square, the color blue, and a statement that says it is false.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-4051 responded aggressively to the requests. Dr. Roswell attempted to negotiate with SCP-4051 to complete the test, and SCP-4051 manifested all specified items in rapid succession, creating multiple paracognitohazards, and a sheet of blue construction paper.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Transcript of Experiment 4051-e-3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> We will now begin the third test. The purpose of this experiment will be to ascertain whether—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> When can I go home?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> You may return home when the Foundation determines that it no longer requires your ability for research purposes. After this test, provided no new developments occur, we will begin to investigate how your anomaly functions on a scientific level.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Are you sure? The men who took me back to my cell weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> I am certain. The experiment will now—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Please, I need to see my family. Is there any way that I can talk to them? Do they even know what happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> Your mother has been informed that you are engaging in a school-sanctioned college visit. Unfortunately, we can only allow communication once—</p>
<p><em>SCP-4051 begins to pace the testing room.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I'm not doing any more of these experiments until my mother knows what happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> I can communicate your wishes to my superiors as soon as this test is completed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, okay. Good. Do that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Roswell:</strong> The requested items are a circular square, the color blue, and a statement that says it’s false.</p>
<p><em>A look of confusion passes over SCP-4051’s face before it rapidly manifests all three. Detrimental effects on the cognitive abilities of anyone directly observing the objects exhibited themselves immediately. SCP-4051 was immediately incapacitated by attending security personnel and returned to its containment unit.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-4051 was returned to its containment unit and the testing chamber was sanitized of residual paradoxical contamination as per standard paracognitohazard protocol ψ-3.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-4051 can manifest non-existent objects, apparently. Due to the effects of this experiment on Dr. Roswell, it is unlikely testing of this nature will continue. Additionally, SCP-4051’s noncompliance may prove to be an issue. I’ll send in a request for a pediatric specialist in a bit. This could be monumental in our understanding of how gateways to other dimensions are formed, and it'd be a shame to have 4051 just be another anomaly we need to keep locked in a box. Just imagine how helpful it would be if we could just use it to patch up the facility. Yeah, I'll send that request now.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following incident report describes SCP-4051's attempt to breach containment, which occurred directly after the events of Experiment-4051-e-3.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>16:14 -</strong> SCP-4051 regains consciousness in its containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>16:15 -</strong> SCP-4051 curls over onto its side as though in pain, only its back now visible to the surveillance camera in its cell.</p>
<p><strong>16:18 -</strong> SCP-4051 begins to make slight movements with its arms.</p>
<p><strong>16:20 -</strong> SCP-4051 stands, revealing that it has covered most of its front side in small sheets of kevlar, held together by an extremely adhesive glue. Security personnel are called for assistance at this time but are preoccupied with escorting Dr. Roswell, Dr. Edwards, and accompanying researchers from the contaminated testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>16:21 -</strong> SCP-4051 manifests an incendiary device and a blast-proof sheet made of unidentified material, attaching the device to the door of its containment cell and fixing the sheet over it to contain the blast. Security personnel from another wing are notified and begin moving towards SCP-4051's location.</p>
<p><strong>16:22 -</strong> SCP-4051 detonates the device and succeeds in breaching containment. At this time, SCP-4051 also manifests an aluminum baseball bat. SCP-4051 begins moving down the hallway, opposite the direction of the testing chamber.</p>
<p><strong>16:25 -</strong> Security personnel make contact with SCP-4051 as it rounds a corner. A fire-fight ensues. The personnel have been advised to use projectile-taser capsules for recontainment, which prove ineffective against SCP-4051's makeshift armor. Personnel are now advised to engage SCP-4051 in close-quarters combat, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>16:27 -</strong> Two other teams of security personnel converge on SCP-4051's location, and successfully incapacitate it.</p>

<div class="test">
<p>Site-17 personnel,</p>
<p>In light of yesterday's containment breach, SCP-4051 has been moved to an enhanced humanoid containment unit. That being said, we've concluded that it would be beneficial for Site-17 as a whole to work to better understand SCP-4051's capabilities. Multiple options are being discussed, such as using it to assist in standard repairs and maintenance, but certain influential individuals have also proposed using it to produce more valuable materials.</p>
<p>I'd wager that most of you don't have the clearance level to know how we produce our amnestics, but suffice it to say that the procedures range from <a href="scp-3171.html">potentially unethical</a> to <a href="scp-3000.html">extremely dangerous</a> and <a href="scp-2419.html">costly</a>. The Ethics Committee has taken a particular interest in SCP-4051 and are discussing using it to produce the active #Y-909 agent in amnestics. As such, Dr. Edwards has been given authority as Project Director over all experimentation and research regarding SCP-4051.</p>
<p>All of this can only be accomplished if SCP-4051 is compliant with Foundation procedure. Anything less than absolute dedication to the Foundation will mean that SCP-4051 is not ready to assist in our directive. To accomplish this, we will begin using standard punishments and rewards to promote good behavior, and scheduled weekly sessions with an on-site therapist, Dr. Yesenia.</p>
<p>All personnel assigned to directly interact with SCP-4051 have been sent a copy of the updated containment procedures and other relevant materials. Your mistake was not realizing how versatile SCP-4051's anomaly was. Let's not make that mistake again.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Hey, Rainer! Happy to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Oh, hi! Are you doing alright?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I'm doing well. Most of the time, I'm talking to people who just got back from a mission in the field, so having someone normal to talk with is nice.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Eh, I'm not normal, though. That's why I'm here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Yeah, I guess so. You can make things out of nothing, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Kind of. Just small objects, like paper or food.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Or bombs?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, um…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Dude, it's alright. I get it. Containment can be hard on people. It's easier when it's an interdimensional dream witch who wants to eat your brain, but when it comes to containing good people who want to help, things tend to go south, ethically speaking. Can I ask why you wanted to escape?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I mean, I wanted to see my family again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> There was a note about your mother in your file. I take it you were close?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, but can you keep this off the record?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Record?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, like, can you not tell the guys out there about my family?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> You're welcome. So, you and your mother were close?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah. Goddamn, she was a fantastic woman. Sorry, <em>is</em> a fantastic woman. Dad left when I was twelve, and we've been supporting each other since.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> And you miss her?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Terribly. I wish… it doesn't matter.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I think it does. Do you want to see her again?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah. The weird thing is that I'm honestly not opposed to living in the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> You're not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Not really. I was actually hoping someone would come along who could help me understand my powers. Being the Foundation's lab rat doesn't bother me all that much, since at least I know I'm helping someone by sharing my ability. I guess I just wish it could be a different kind of arrangement. Am I making any sense?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> That's… well, that's just not the reaction I was expecting.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, I guess. I'm full of surprises, apparently.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This may be easier than I thought at first. Right now, effort should be made to convince SCP-4051 that the Foundation has its best interests at heart. I would like to see some modifications to its containment unit as well. Too much concrete.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Experiment 4051-e-4:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Edwards</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/23/2012</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A D-class subject is to be introduced inside the observation chamber with SCP-4051. SCP-4051 will be instructed to manifest a small stone, and the D-class subject will attempt to remove the stone from the portal.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-4051 appeared intimidated by the D-class subject, Subject D-29543, but did not vocalize any concerns. Dr. Edwards instructed SCP-4051 to comply with the request, and Subject D-29543 was told to touch the edges of the portal before inserting his hand. Subject D-29543 made multiple explicit comments and was reminded of the consequence of unruly behavior. Subject D-29543 reported that the edges of the portal were solid, then retrieved the stone from the wormhole.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Thank God, we're getting somewhere again. It seems like SCP-4051 is only anomalous in that it can manifest the wormhole. Theoretically, if we could replicate the anomaly, we could cut out the middle man of getting it to work with us. Since we already have sufficient data on the wormhole itself, I'll try to determine how it uses its anomaly: brain scans, analyzing nerves in its arm, that kinda thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="test">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Experiment 4051-e-5:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Edwards</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/24/2012</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A mechanical arm holding a GPS tracking chip will insert the chip into SCP-4051's portal. SCP-4051 will retrieve the intended object, close the portal, and manifest the same object. Staff will determine if a signal from the tracking chip can be established.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-4051 complied with all requests and created a wormhole leading to the same framed picture of its mother as manifested in Experiment-4051-e-1. The chip was inserted and was observed to hang suspended in space on the other side of the portal. When a signal from the chip was received, SCP-4051 removed the picture and allowed the wormhole to close. The signal was lost at this time. SCP-4051 again produced the portal to manifest the picture, and a signal was reestablished, but the chip was not observed; it was later confirmed to be approximately 9500 km from the wormhole.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Well, not exactly the most interesting results I could have hoped for. I'm not planning on submitting a request for more testing on the subject.</p>
<p>Just a small note, too, but we compared the picture it manifested today to the one it manifested in Experiment-4051-e-1. The more recent one has a few changes. The hairstyle is different and a few moles are missing on her cheeks.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> So, about the experiment you did today…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Oh, yeah, it was great! I think they put a GPS chip inside my portal to see if they could relocate it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Did they?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, the first time. I closed the portal and reopened it, and the chip was a long way away.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Cool! Is that what you were expecting?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Not really. I tried testing my powers on my own, just to see what I could do. Doing something like that wasn't really feasible, so… I'm excited.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I can tell. Actually, wait, do you have any requests for testing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I seriously doubt you can tell Dr. Edwards what I want him to do, and he'll follow through.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Hey, I mean, it's unprofessional, but I want you to feel valued.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> It's fine, thank you. Dr. Edwards probably knows better than me anyways.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> So, has everything else been going alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, just… I keep having these dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Dreams or nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Nightmares. You're a therapist, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I'm pretty sure I am.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I'm just… I don't want to seem like a freak, alright? I know that's stupid, but I'm scared of people treating me like I'm special because of what happened with my dad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Ah, the night he left?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> You already know about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> The Foundation compiled an extensive record on you before we brought you in.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> That makes sense. Well, if you already—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> No, please. If you want to share your own experience with me, it'll be more valuable than any police report.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> When I was locked in that closet, I felt so awful, okay? I could hear him getting the bleach from the kitchen, but I couldn't break down that damn door, no matter how hard I tried. I think that's why my nightmares are all about not being able to move as something creeps closer and closer. I couldn't keep her from being hurt, and that's sticking with me, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Does it bother you the police never caught him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Yeah, I think. Yeah, it bothers me that he's out there, somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Well, um… officially, I shouldn't be telling you this. But while they were compiling your file, they found your dad. He's in a prison in Arkansas, serving a life sentence for murder.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Not if it means getting on your boss' bad side! I don't want to cause trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Come on, you're not causing anyone any trouble by asking for some entertainment in your cell.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I know that, but… I mean, am I really helping anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I don't follow?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> The tests they're doing on me. Does it help anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Do you want to help the Foundation, Rainer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> I think we've established I can't break out. Isn't there some way I can at least be useful?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I see no reason why you shouldn't be. I'll file a request to the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> A request? For what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> I can try to get them to let you help around the site. Maintenance and stuff like that.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-4051 rises from the chair in excitement.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> You're serious? You can do that? You're actually going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> Yeah, of course! You're a fantastic young man to speak with, and I'm sure the rest of the site will appreciate having you around.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4051:</strong> Oh thank god. Oh my god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is… god, I get to help again. I thought I'd be stuck here and I'd just be useless again, but…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Yesenia:</strong> It's alright! Seriously, it's fine. I'm happy you're happy.</p>
<p><em>[The remaining thirty minutes of conversation have been declared irrelevant to SCP-4051's relationship with the Foundation. To see the extended transcript, submit a request to Site Director Graham.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This entire plan to get SCP-4051 to want to help the Foundation seems kind of frivolous in hindsight. He's already compliant and convinced that helping out at the site is just an extension of his prior vigilantism. I'll contact Graham in a few minutes.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>Addendum.4051.4:</strong> SCP-4051 has been granted a Level 1 Security Clearance to assist Site-17 in general repairs. This does not mean SCP-4051 is allowed to wander freely around the facility. SCP-4051 will be escorted by armed personnel to areas requiring repairs once weekly.</span></p>
