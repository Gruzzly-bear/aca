            <h1>SCP-2027</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2027</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A space-based telescope under Foundation control is to observe SCP-2027 at all times. If SCP-2027 is detected by satellites, it is to be dismissed as an asteroid. Class-C Amnestics are to be dispersed to terrestrial astronomers that detect SCP-2027. If any data demonstrating the existence of SCP-2027 is published, data must be seized and Class-A Amnestics dispersed to all readers and authors. Unmanned Probe ██A-2027 is to remain within 5,000 km of SCP-2027 at all times, and is not to enter any area within 1,250 km of SCP-2027.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2027 is a spacebound organism of extraterrestrial origins. Current estimates place SCP-2027 at between 200-350 km in length and 100 km across. SCP-2027 maneuvers using several jets of gas on each end of the body. Gas emitted by SCP-2027 appears to be made up of a mix of hydrogen, methane, and argon. SCP-2027 lacks a primary propulsion method, and is propelled entirely by its own inertia.</p>
<p>As of █/█/██, SCP-2027 has been confirmed to be made up of several zooids, similar to Siphonophores such as <em>Physalia physalis</em>, or the Portuguese man o' war. Each zooid appears to perform functions such as propelling SCP-2027. SCP-2027 is covered in a hard exoskeleton that is made up of several hundred individual flat zooids. The number of gas jets on SCP-2027's exoskeleton has not been determined, with as many as 40 observed at times.</p>
<p>SCP-2027 feeds on strong concentrations of gamma radiation. On █/██/████, when radiation from gamma ray burst 130427A reached SCP-2027, SCP-2027 ceased all activity and began spinning slowly. An increase in movement speed was noted 4 days later.</p>
<p>SCP-2027 appears to be traveling directly parallel to the Solar System's orbit around the galactic center. However, between 19██ and 19██, SCP-2027 changed course slightly ██ times.</p>
<p>SCP-2027 was detected by the [REDACTED] Gamma Ray observatory on ██/█/19██, when it eclipsed the [REDACTED] Pulsar. The complete lack of gamma radiation near SCP-2027 was logged into public record. Foundation agents dispensed Class-A Amnestics to all researchers who had come in contact or were aware of the data.</p>
<p>SCP-2027 is currently 0.02 light years from Earth. Current projections show no risk of SCP-2027 impacting Earth or any other body in the Solar System. SCP-2027's closest approach to the Solar System will be 0.009 light years if no course corrections are made.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #1:</strong><br/>
On █/█/20██, a Foundation-operated probe launched on █/█/19██ rendezvoused with SCP-2027. However; when the probe entered a zone 100 km over SCP-2027's body, Probe ██A-2027 was struck by a powerful gas jet, damaging the probe's docking claw. Probe ██A-2027 has since been ordered to remain in a 5,000 km orbit above SCP-2027.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #2:</strong><br/>
On █/█/20██, SCP-2027 split into ███ parts and reassembled itself after █ hours. SCP-2027's speed has been noted to have risen by ██ m/s at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #3:</strong><br/>
On ██/█/200█, A large sphincter opened on SCP-2027's side and a large mass of matter was jettisoned. A thin appendage extended from SCP-2027 and connected to the mass of matter designated SCP-2027-1. 3 weeks later, jets of the same gas emitted from SCP-2027 was emitted from SCP-2027-1 and the appendage was disconnected. SCP-2027-1 then accelerated away from SCP-2027 in the direction of the galactic center.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum #4:</strong><br/>
On █/██/20██, Probe ██A-2027 has detected multiple sporadic emissions of argon, methane, and hydrogen from the areas SCP-2027 has passed through. These signatures are of compositions identical to SCP-2027's maneuvering jets.</p>
<p><em>Note: These creatures may be native to the high-radiation regions in the center of the galaxy. What we are witnessing now may be a migration of sorts. -Dr. █████</em></p>
