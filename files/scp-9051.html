<p>Iteration 9051-1</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9051</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9051 is to be kept in a storage container in the Low-Risk Security Wing of Site-199. Personnel wishing to test SCP-9051 and the abilities of SCP-9051-A must direct all requests to Researcher Stevenson.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9051 is a 1 fluid ounce elliptical bottle labeled "Spa Therapy Shampoo". The fluid inside the bottle has been identified as identical to non-anomalous shampoo. The fluid within the bottle can be removed and used as shampoo. However, SCP-9051 can never be fully emptied.</p>
<p>When opened, SCP-9051 will also generate SCP-9051-A, an entity made out of same fluid inside SCP-9051 within a 3 meter spherical radius of its location. The entity is capable of emitting gurgling noises, but cannot move, speak or demonstrate any other indications of sapience. Anyone also in the 3 meter spherical radius with SCP-9051-A will report mild distress and headaches when hearing the gurgles emitted by the entity. Staying within this radius for three minutes or longer will cause subjects affected by SCP-9051-A to lose consciousness. This loss of consciousness usually entails the subject immediately fainting.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 01-Discovery:</strong> SCP-9051 was discovered in a hotel room in [REDACTED], California on 1/2/2005, after an "infinite shampoo bottle" had been reported by a businessman staying in the room. The businessman and hotel staff were amnesticized after the object was secured. SCP-9051 was brought back to Site-199 and initially given the designation of Anomalous Object 1801 (now classified as Iteration 9051-0). At time of discovery, SCP-9051 had the property to refill itself within five minutes of being emptied.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 02-Updated Properties:</strong> On 3/25/2007, a Junior Researcher wishing to use SCP-9051 discovered that its previous properties had been changed to the current iteration. SCP-9051-A manifested when SCP-9051 was opened, causing the Junior Researcher to be affected by SCP-9051-A's audio-hazardous properties for one minute.</p>
<p>SCP-9051 was given its current designation and permanent containment was moved from the Storage Wing to the Containment Wing.</p>

<h4 id="toc1"><span>Conversation recorded between Researcher Kaylee Stevenson and Site Containment Wing Head Dr. Jacob Marcus, 4/02/09</span></h4>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Stevenson enters an elevator where Dr. Marcus is already standing. The elevator doors close. Dr. Stevenson claps Dr. Marcus on the shoulder. Dr. Marcus is observed sighing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> How are you, Dr. Marcus?!</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Pretty well.</p>
<p><em>They ride in silence for about 10 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I just turned in the newest reports on 9051. This thing doesn't require too much testing, but we're making progress on understanding the audio-hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> That's great.</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> The shampoo is also still pretty usable. I use it every day now!</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> You're sure that stuff's really not anomalous?</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> Please, I ran a week of testing on that! D-Class all loved it. Oh, I also volunteered to help watch over some of Dr. Steele's Junior Researchers. Can't believe its been only two years since I was one of them!</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Mhm.</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> How do <em>you</em> think my work was over the past week?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Oh, very productive, very organized and very effective. You continue to be one of our most hardworking Researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> Oh, that's great! Does that mean I've stood out to you a lot?</p>
<p>// Dr. Marcus sighs again.//</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> That is the least subtle way anyone's asked for a packet approval.</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> So you'll do one? I can count that its been exactly four years and three months since I joined and I still haven't gotten a large position!</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Be patient with me for once, Stevenson. Remember who's still above you.</p>
<p><em>The elevator doors open. Dr. Marcus gets out.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Steele and Dr. Marcus are in Dr. Marcus's office.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> And every time she runs into me, she somehow manages to bring it up! I don't know what the deal is with her and getting promoted!</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> She wasn't this bad when she was under me back then.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> That's because she wasn't high enough to be this annoying! And now I'm stuck with her damn promotion packet again and she's actually qualified to move up!</p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> Why don't you just promote her and give her a different set of anomalies? Then she'll have even more work to do.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus:</strong> That won't work. She doesn't want to admit it, but I know she's gotten super attached to 9051. If I take her off of it she'll keep on complaining about that!</p>
<p><em>There is silence for a bit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Steele:</strong> So, are you going to approve her packet?</p>

<p><strong>Diary Entry 5/01/10</strong></p>
<p>Why am I still stuck with this one stupid anomaly?! I could be managing the whole site with the way I work! The shampoo isn't even that great anymore.<br/>
Dr. Marcus will see sense. I hope he will. If he doesn't, I'll just make him.<br/>
I can still see a bright future ahead of me! Just have to keep showing off my stuff!<br/>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9051</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9051 is to be kept in a Low-Risk cell at least 3 meters wide on all sides at Site-199. A non-audio recording security camera has been installed in SCP-9051's cell by the request of Senior Researcher Stevenson.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9051 is a 1 fluid ounce bottle of clear shampoo labeled "Intense Scrub Solution". The fluid inside the bottle has been identified as identical to non-anomalous shampoo. The fluid within the bottle cannot be removed.</p>
<p>When opened, SCP-9051 will generate SCP-9051-A, an blob-shaped entity made out of same fluid inside SCP-9051 within a 3 meter spherical radius of its location. The entity is capable of emitting vague coherent vocalizations, and can move within the 3 meter spherical radius designated above.</p>
<p>SCP-9051-A is now capable of manifesting tentacles made out of the same shampoo material. Tentacle manifestation started during testing on 5/3/10, when Senior Researcher Kaylee Stevenson was newly promoted and took control of D-Class testing. Anyone who remains within the 3 meter spherical radius will be terminated by SCP-9051-A by way of these tentacles within one minute.</p>
<p>Research is pending into a possible connection between SCP-9051 and Senior Researcher Kaylee Stevenson, led by Site Containment Head Dr. Jacob Marcus.</p>

<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>

<p>SCP-9051-1</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9051 was an ontokinetic mind-altering phenomenon generated between two parts: SCP-9051-1 and SCP-9051-2.</p>
<p>SCP-9051-1 is Dr. Kaylee Stevenson, a 40-year-old Caucasian female and former Senior Researcher of Site-99 before her resignation on May 21st, 2010.</p>
<p>SCP-9051-2 was a 1 oz bottle containing a fluid identical to non-anomalous shampoo. The object exhibited evolving conjuration effects that manifested coinciding with the dates of SCP-9051-1's promotions through different Foundation staff positions. SCP-9051-2 was originally designated as Anomalous Item 1801 for Iteration 9051-0 and then as SCP-9051 for Iterations 9051-1 and 9051-2.</p>
<p>The fluid contained within SCP-9051-2 is hypothesized to have drastically affected SCP-9051-1's mental state in regards to promotion. When confronted with the topic of promotion, SCP-9051-1 exhibited behaviors that were increasingly more agitated and child-like. This mental effect ceased on 5/16/10, coinciding with the termination of Site Containment Wing Head Dr. Jacob Marcus by an entity manifested from SCP-9051-2.</p>
<p>SCP-9051-1 has been amnesticized and permanently disavowed from the Foundation.</p>
<p>SCP-9051-2 now presents no anomalous effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Diary Entry 5/20/10</strong></p>
<p>It wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair!<br/>
Why did the anomaly have to hurt him? He actually liked me.<br/>
He actually helped me go far.<br/>
No, he was the one who promoted me all that time and got me fired.<br/>
He got himself killed.<br/>
Why was nothing fair to me at that dang place?<br/>
I'm never going back.</p>
