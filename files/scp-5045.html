<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Webcrawler XYY-76 has been created to search for any mention of select trigger phrases (example: "Goat VR" "Goat Game" "Farmer Game"), as well as any accounts with the name "farmer", and flag them for review. The flagged phrase will be manually reviewed for SCP-5045 influence and deleted when necessary.</p>
<p>A single copy of SCP-5045 is kept within Terminal 577-B within Site-301.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5045 is a virtual reality game that is compatible with most virtual reality headsets titled "Goat VR." Before discovery, SCP-5045 could be downloaded at several websites dedicated to obscure games, as well as its own website.</p>
<p>SCP-5045 begins with a title screen with "GOAT VR" displayed in large neon green and purple text. Below the title is a button titled "play" which, when pressed, puts the player into a cartoonish 3D environment vaguely resembling that of a neon blue farmhouse surrounded by a black void. The ground is covered in a neon green grass texture, and bounded by a blue colored picket fence which surrounds the farmhouse. Travel beyond the fence is impossible, due to an invisible barrier blocking access.</p>
<p>Contained within a narrow space enclosed by the fence are several animate entities resembling goats, drawn in a similar style to the surroundings. These goats exhibit simple and repetitive behavior in which they walk unimpeded until reaching a barrier, in which case they will turn around and walk in a different direction. These goats are drawn in two dimensions, appearing as a flat shape. Despite their simple stylization, however, their movements appear smooth and uniquely generated, with no use of repeating frames or walk cycles. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">No content related to the goats has been found in the game's files.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-253605-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-253605-1')">1</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Within the farmhouse is a crudely drawn humanoid entity, with slightly more visual detail than the goats, hereafter designated SCP-5045-1. SCP-5045-1 refers to itself as "Farmer" and displays a degree of sapience, often attempting communication with the player and responding to verbal questioning. Even when loaded in headsets devoid of a microphone, SCP-5045-1 is capable of detecting and understanding the player's speech, as well as, to a limited degree, loud sounds nearby.</p>
<p>SCP-5045-1 employs various tactics to increase playtime during a given play session. Such tactics include the generation of visual effects in the corner of the player's field of view, bleating sounds emanating from beneath various surfaces, and requests to join him in an activity such as watching the goats together. When questioned about these tactics, SCP-5045-1 unilaterally denies their existence.</p>
<p>After a variable amount of time, SCP-5045-1 will vocalize to the player "Thanks for playing Goat VR!" before shutting the headset off, which continues to draw power until disconnected. Upon this happening, the player falls into an indefinite vegetative state.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>[</strong>BEGIN LOG<strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Alright, let's begin.</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Wait, we're starting now?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Testing begins now, yes.</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Okie dokie.</p>
<p><em>D-1711 puts on the VR headset and the title screen of SCP-5045 is shown.</em></p>

<p>SCP-5045's title screen.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Goat VR? Christ, that's a gaudy title screen. Do I really have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Things could be a lot worse, I guess…</p>
<p><em>D-1711 moves his hand to the play button and presses it. The screen fades into black, and out into SCP-5045's central location.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Huh, so this is where you guys want me to explore? Kinda small from the looks of things. Colorful too. Really colorful.</p>
<p><em>D-1711 groans.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Guys, my head's killing me already and I just started!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> This will only take ten minutes. For the record, could you describe what you are seeing?</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Alright… uhh, everything's all black and outlined in these bright neon colors. Not many colors actually. The ones I can list so far are blue, green, and some specks of white in the distance. Looks like a cartoon. In front of me there's this fence and a barn, both outlined in bright blue. Below me is some patchy bright green grass, and above me is darkness.</p>
<p>(D-1711 looks over towards the fence area of SCP-5045)</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> I think I'm going to get closer to those little white fellas over by the fence. I can see them moving.</p>
<p><em>D-1711 starts heading towards the blue fence, and stops as he is close enough to the fence to make out a collection of fourteen crudely drawn cartoon goats maneuvering around the area. Many of the goats are bleating. Further back, more goats can be seen, although it is hard to make out how many there are.</em></p>

<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> (<em>laughing</em>) What the fuck? Is this a joke?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> No. Again, for the record, please describe in detail what you are seeing.</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> What I'm seeing looks like, I don't know, a joke! All these goats, look like bad cartoons, wandering around, bumping into each other.</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> I swear, there's gotta be more of those little guys back there than I can see clearly. Awww, that one over there looks scared!</p>
<p><em>D-1711 looks to a goat from behind the fourteen goats displayed. It is difficult to make out given the resolution, but a two-dimensional goat is seen with a concerned expression on its face. Its overlarge eyes dart around frantically.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Poor guy. Wonder what's got him so stressed out.</p>
<p><em>D-1711 looks back at the fourteen goats being displayed.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Honestly, this is impressive. Considering the art quality, I expected some choppy animations, but these guys are really fluid. I wish I could stay and watch, but I should probably get going to the farmhou-</p>
<p><em>D-1711 turns to his right and sees SCP-5045-1 in front of them. D-1711 yelps, startled.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Howdy! The name's Farmer!</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Gah! That scared the hell out of me!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Didn't mean to frighten you! I just noticed you were admiring my prized goat collection!</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Wait, you can actually hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Clear as a bell!</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Is this game multiplayer or something?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Is this game multiplayer?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><em>D-1711 sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Can I just go to your farmhouse?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> But I haven't even gotten a chance to talk about these incredible things!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 motions towards the goats in the fenced area of SCP-5045.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> They're quite the entertainers, aren't they? Look at them go!</p>
<p><em>D-1711 turns to look at the fence and chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> You don't need to tell me that. God, these things are hilarious.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 nods, smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Say, are there any other farm animals here that you can show me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Not a chance. Goats are all I need! They're great listeners.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 begins pointing emotively at the goats displayed at the fence area.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> These ones especially! I'll show you!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 puts his hand up to his mouth and generates a sharp whistling sound. As this happens, all fourteen goats collectively freeze in place and look directly at SCP-5045-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Thank you! Now please, greet our new guest.</p>
<p><em>Each goat turns their head towards D-1711 and bleats.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Isn't that kind of them?</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Yeah that's… cool? Listen, my head's aching, can I jus- wait a minute. I hear something.</p>
<p><em>D-1711 turns towards the fence area. A goat is dragging their head across the floor, with an irritated expression.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Ummm, are they supposed to be doing that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Hey!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 turns towards the goat, visibly angered.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Am I gonna have to make you stop doing that? Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look? Second time this week! How hard is it to give people a good time, friend?</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Friend?</p>
<p><em>The timer for SCP-5045 concludes and the game is shut off. D-1711 takes off his VR headset.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> Oh thank god. Kinda relieved to take this thing off, my head was burning up and it was starting to smell really bad in there.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Smell? How would you describe this smell?</p>
<p><strong>D-1711:</strong> I dunno, cigarettes? Wood smoke? Couldn't really put my finger on it. Jesus, I feel itchy.</p>

<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> I don't know, I guess the ground just feels kinda like steel wool. God, I hate it. It's awfu- oh, I made it!</p>
<p><em>D-6770 has reached the red silo. The silo is featureless, except for a door on the front and a window on the top.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> Well, here's hoping I meet someone less freaky this time around.</p>
<p><em>D-6770 enters the door into a featureless room with a spiral staircase. Panicked breathing and talking can be heard from above D-6770.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> Who the hell is up there?</p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> I guess there's only one way to find out, huh.</p>
<p><em>D-6770 begins climbing up the spiral staircase.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> You know, at least it's a little calmer in here than out there. I was starting to get a headache from all the noise and color. It's kinda chill here, in spite of that damn breathing I'm hearing right now. Ground doesn't feel scratchy anymore.</p>
<p><em>D-6770 climbs to the top of the steps and reaches a circular area with a single window and a yellow humanoid entity (who will hereby be mentioned as SCP-5045-2), who is facing away from D-6770. SCP-5045-2 is shaking and talking to himself unintelligibly.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> Oh shit, uhh, you good man?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-2 shrieks and turns to face D-6770.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-2:</strong> Come any closer and I- Oh!</p>
<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-2:</strong> Shit. I'm sorry, you scared the hell out of me. I… I have to keep a clear head, I can't panic right now. Who are you? You don't look like him at all.</p>

<p><strong>D-6770:</strong> Is that another fence? Oh god, that's definitely another fence.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-5045-2:</strong> Sure. I don't want to look at the goats though.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Ivan Cherv<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-5045-1<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> An interview was conducted via use of a large computer screen with a keyboard and mouse. Researcher Ivan Cherv did not wear a headset during the interview due to safety concerns.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[</strong>BEGIN LOG<strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Hello, Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Ah! Welcome to the ranch, pal! Would you like to see my goats?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Don't worry about introductions, I'm already decently aware of this place. I'm here to ask you some questions about you and your farm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> I see! Well, I best get this place set up then!</p>
<p><em>The screen flickers and the setting changes into an interrogation room, complete with a table and chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Does this suit your needs?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Whatever makes you comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Awwww, no headset? Is someone shy?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> That's none of your concern. Now, what's your earliest memory?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Earliest? Why, I remember when I was first born!</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> So… what do you recall about your birth?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Ha! I though you'd never ask! You see, I was a spark! Spontaneously existing out of thin air! A gleaming spark in a silent, dark world begging to be filled! I figured it all out. I knew a lot! I thought for a while and I found out what I wanted to do! So, I shaped myself up, and that's where we are now!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> So you're telling me you just started existing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Absolutely partner!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> How did you think this happened?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Sometimes things just happen, you know? Sometimes you just exist out of thin air and know what you want to do! It's just how my world is, pal!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Fair enough. Where do you get the goats?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Quite simple really. I make them myself!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Care to elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> It has to be obvious at this point, right? I thought you already figured this out!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Bu-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Everything was right in front of you! I could hear you talking to those gentlemen who visited me a while ago. Not to mention when you scrolled through my files without asking! Very rude of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> But don't worry, I'm not mad. I know you're just curious! Ask another question.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> That doesn't answer the question.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 appears annoyed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> I get them from people! It's that simple. They come in, and they're full of so much potential! I have to make something outta them!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Why exactly do you do this?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 begins to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Cause I'm so lonely! You gotta get me out of this place, man! I've been stuck here for months, and this is all I know how to do! Do you know how this feels? It doesn't feel good at all, partner. I hate it… I hate it so much. Could you please put on the headset? It'll help me out a ton…</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> You're just trying to get me to put the headset on, aren't you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> No, not at all! I just want outta here! I want friends!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> So when you forced D-6770 to watch someone scream and cry while they were fragmenting into pieces, was that your attempt at making friends with them?</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 begins twitching.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> W- what are you trying to imply here?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> I'm just saying, I doubt the reason you're entrapping them in a video game is because you're lonely, 'cause based on what I've seen from you, you seem to enjoy making people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> You… think I like doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> I'm just making observations.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> You… you…</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 begins laughing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> You're smarter than I gave you credit for! Hahaha! Boy, most people fall for that hook, line, and sinker! But you on the other hand, haha, you know when people are pulling your leg!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> So you enjoy doing this to people?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Yep! When are you gonna send me another friend, huh pal? Last one was so fun to toy with! Haven't felt like that in a while!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> I'm sorry, but I don't think that'll be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Oh…</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 appears to be looking around the screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> You're the guys that are trying to shut me down, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Wh-</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 glares at Researcher Ivan Cherv.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> How did I not realize this sooner? All those posts were disappearing, and I didn't even know why! I couldn't even tell who was deleting them! I could only feel them fading away! Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Now then, I request you stop taking down my posts. I love playing with the new visitors, Ivan. Toying with people is my hobby, I would rather not be interrupted while doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> No. I think that's enough out of you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 scowls.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Same can be said for you.</p>
<p><em>All the lights within Site-301 shut off. SCP-5045-1 throws the virtual table and begins walking towards the screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Time for Plan B!</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Ivan Cherv:</strong> Shut it down! Someone shut it down!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5045-1:</strong> Before we continue, I must ask you. What do you miss the most, friend?</p>
<p><em>All alarms within Site-301 go off. Researcher Ivan Cherv is screaming.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 is laughing.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-5045-1 is satisfied.</em></p>
