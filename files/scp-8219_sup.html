<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment of SCP-8219 has been deemed a DELTA-level priority due to its rate of infection. Reports of SCP-8219 are to be globally discredited; any individuals found hosting SCP-8219 are to be quarantined. Populated areas harboring SCP-8219 instances are to be restricted under the front company "Strait Cleanup Professionals" and Cover Story No: SCS-029.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8219 is a species of sapient, parasitic microorganism that feeds on human beings, manifesting as small, leaf-like particles floating on the surface of warm water sources.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-8219 poses an unknown system of limited locomotion and has demonstrated a rudimentary understanding of language, capable of telepathically communicating through its host by unknown means.</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly large number of candidates, SCP-8219 has currently taken only Site-37 accountant Dr. Dullard Smith as its host; however, video evidence from civilian sources suggests the existence of currently unknown parameters for SCP-8219 to fully communicate with &amp; infect its host.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-SCP-8219.1: Initial Discovery</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8219 was first discovered by Dr. Dullard Smith at Site-37's standard aquatic pool, which had been repurposed from an unused containment pool and was being used for recreation at the time. The following is camera footage from the incident.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>01:23:</strong> Site-37 staff is shown entering the pool.</p>
<p><strong>01:23-05:43:</strong> Staff engage in various recreational activities, culminating in a race with 4 personnel, including Dr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>06:14:</strong> Dr. Smith averts his attention away from other staff.</p>
<p><strong>06:25:</strong> Dr. Smith is continually teased by other staff about his performance in the race.</p>
<p><strong>06:45:</strong> SCP-8219<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> is first shown floating on the water's surface, 2 lanes away from staff.</p>
<p><strong>[ACTS OF RECREATION OMITTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>24:31:</strong> SCP-8219α floats closer to Site personnel.</p>
<p><strong>24:52:</strong> Staff turn on the pool heaters.</p>
<p><strong>25:22:</strong> SCP-8219α attaches onto Dr. Smith's forehead, and a high-pitched scream is heard.</p>
<p><strong>25:43:</strong> Dr. Smith continues to scream in pain, dismissed by other staff as Dr. Smith's cowardice.</p>
<p><strong>26:11:</strong> Dr. Smith presumably self-urinates, causing staff outcry.</p>
<p><strong>26:33:</strong> Dr. Smith stops screaming, telepathic contact presumably reached.</p>
<p><strong>27:42:</strong> Pool heating is increased by staff.</p>
<p><strong>28:51:</strong> Dr. Smith attempts to relay the effects of SCP-8219α to staff.</p>
<p><strong>29:32:</strong> Dr. Smith begins emitting nonsensical vocalizations.</p>
<p><strong>[ACTS OF RECREATION OMITTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>35:12:</strong> Staff exit the pool. Instances of SCP-8219α are seen attached to Dr. Smith's swimwear as he leaves.</p>

<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 08/04/2020</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Dr. Alice Candor, who was personally requested to be the interviewer by Dr. Smith, citing Dr. Candor's "metanarrative pataphysical potential" and "pleasant personality".<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWEE:</strong> SCP-8219α</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Hello, SCP-8219, I would like to ask some questions if you won't mind.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> He says it's alright.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Great, now first of all, could you tell us more about what you are?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> He sa-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Please just describe the entities' responses if you will, for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> O-oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (coughs) Ahem, well, you see, I am a drifting wanderer through the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Could you elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> Well, it's nothing crazy, just looking for a vacation, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> A vacation?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> It's hard work out there, just trying to get a summer vacation to escape from things. I'm quite the popular stem back in the pond, so figured I'd take some time to lay low.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> I'm afraid you're being a bit vague. I would love some details if you would.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Pause for 30 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Are you there, SCP-8219?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> Y'know it's sometimes better not to think too much about things, but if you insist,<br/>
I am but a humble leafman, swimming through the ponds, diligent in keeping the balance.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> What balance?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Dr. Smith makes a gesture resembling some sort of circle) W-well, the balance of nature obviously, even the smallest parts play their part.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> I wouldn't call the mass infestation you've been conducting on nature "balance".<br/>
Do you know how much money we have to spend making sure you don't hurt anyone? And you dare call that balance?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Dr. Smith puts his fist on his chin, staring at the floor) M-my work is necessary, it's best if you just ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Elaborate on your "work".</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> What more work is there than survival itself? I spread myself amongst thee as reprieve, I am not alone as you might propose, and you would blame thee? Would yee blame the hunter for hunting? The fish for swimming? The bird for flying?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Are you sure you are of sound mind, SCP-8219? We can do this another day.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Dr. Smith slams his fists on the table) HOW DARE YEE SPOUT SUCH NONSENSE! <strong><span style="color: green">LEAF</span></strong> ME ALONE THIS INSTANT!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Please refrain from such outbursts, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Dr. Smith shrugs his shoulders) You told me to describe what he says, I'm just setting the tone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Nevertheless, SCP-8219, you hurt my friend. I admit I am not of knightly honour, but knowing what I know now, I cannot ignore what your kind is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> (Dr. Smith's pupils dilate) F-friend you say?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Yes, and speaking of knights, you seem to know quite a lot of English for someone like yourself. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> [Pause for 2 minutes]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> I travel a lot, muchacho.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> I am assuming you won't be elaborating on that, very well. One last question.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> What do you have to gain from your relationship with Dr. Smith?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> His flow is nourishing, his chiseled body a safe haven for my form, his sweat a nectar of the gods, his advanced expertise in finance is a sight to behold, his charisma swept me off my feet, his smile shone brighter than the sun. So I decided I MUST take this man as my host and no other.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> I see, I believe we are done for today. Thank you for the input, SCP-8219.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> My displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> [I believe SCP-8219 presents an underestimated threat to normalcy; it has shown to be indifferent to human suffering at best or actively malicious at worst. The negligible activity of SCP-8219 instances up until now suggests a specific reason for that to be the case. I highly suggest the Foundation start implementing measures against the emergent threat of SCP-8219 through societal change, either by affecting the climate or producing an alternative to leaves as a whole. At the very least, I request further research and a formal reassessment of SCP-8219 by the classification committee. Preferably a reclassification to Apollyon.]</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Six months after SCP-8219 was originally classified, Dr. Dullard Smith of Site-37 was investigated for the fabrication of documentation, evidence, images, and audio regarding the existence of SCP-8219 under concerns about the inefficiency of current containment procedures. The following is an interview with Dr. Frank Candor.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> So much money, so much time, so many resources spent on this bullshit, so you better start talking.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> Can't we just <strong><span style="color: green">leaf</span></strong> this alone already?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Did you think we wouldn't find out??? You made us chase children in parks with <strong><span style="color: green">leaf</span></strong> nets, for fucks sake.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> I-I needed a break.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> A break?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> Well, work's been rough lately and and I kinda wanted a raise, so yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> Do you know what your surprisingly shrewd ass cost us?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Smith:</strong> I wouldn't like say it was surprising or anything-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Candor:</strong> I THOUGHT I WAS DEALING WITH THE NEXT RED DEATH! THE NEXT ZOMBIE VIRUS THE NEXT WHATEVER THE FUCK!</p>
