<p>SCP-1843 and instances of SCP-1843-1 during testing in Foundation property.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1843</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1843 is to be held in a Large Containment Vault in Storage Site-12’s Safe SCP Wing. Specimens of the genus <em>Ovis</em> are to be kept at a minimum distance of 2.5 kilometers from SCP-1843's containment. Specimens found within the 2 kilometers radius are to be moved at a minimum distance of 700 meters from SCP-1843’s range of effect or terminated, if necessary. Deceased instances of SCP-1843-2 are to be contained in separate cryogenic freezers after examination.</p>
<p>Controlled testing with specimens of the genus <em>Ovis</em> is to be done outside, and requires the approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1843 is a polyhedron-shaped<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> hollow structure of unknown, possibly extra-terrestrial origin. SCP-1843 is mostly composed of silicon, iron and polystyrene. SCP-1843 measures 1.50 meters in height and 1.50 meters in width, weighing approximately 500 kilograms when empty. SCP-1843 can be opened via a small metallic door found on one of its faces.</p>
<p>SCP-1843's anomalous properties only affect specimens of the genus <em>Ovis</em> (referred as SCP-1843-1) present within a 2 kilometers radius. Instances of SCP-1843-1 will move towards SCP-1843 in groups of 5-10 individuals, mostly composed of adult males and female juveniles. Instances of SCP-1843-1 display more hostility than normal, but do not possess physical strength above normal specimens of the genus <em>Ovis</em>.</p>
<p>Once the instances of SCP-1843-1 have reached SCP-1843, they will proceed to perform a "ritual", referred as SCP-1843-A event. SCP-1843-A events are usually of violent nature, consisting of the sacrificial murder of a female juvenile (referred as SCP-1843-2), performed by instances of SCP-1843-1 by crushing SCP-1843-2's skull with their hooves or by repeatedly hitting it with their horns. In rare occasions (&lt;2%), instances of SCP-1843-1 have been observed to cannibalize instances of SCP-1843-2. The older instance of SCP-1843-1 will then proceed to place the remains of SCP-1843-2 within SCP-1843.</p>
<p>After the SCP-1843-A event has ended, all the instances of SCP-1843-1 will bow their heads down to SCP-1843 and proceed to move away from it. Instances of SCP-1843-1 that participated the SCP-1843-A event lose all their anomalous behaviors once they are 500 meters distant from SCP-1843, despite still being in its range of effect.</p>
<p>SCP-1843 was recovered the 2010/██/██ in █████, Germany, after the reports of a metallic object falling in the rural area of Germany. After 2 weeks of investigations, SCP-1843 was found in █████, being "worshipped" by several instances of SCP-1843-1, most being domestic sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>) and wild mouflon (<em>Ovis musimon</em>). SCP-1843 contained fourteen (14) deceased juvenile specimens of <em>Ovis aries</em> and five (5) deceased juvenile specimens of <em>Ovis musimon</em>, currently contained among other instances of SCP-1843-2.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1843-1:</strong> Excerpt from Testing Log-1843-13-F.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Testing Log 1843-13-F - 2010/██/██</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject(s):</strong> Seven (7) specimens of <em>Ovis aries</em>; four (4) adult males and three (3) female juveniles, referred as SCP-1843-1-26 to -32.<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> All the instances are transported via vehicle to SCP-1843 to avoid hostile reactions. The instances approach SCP-1843 without accident.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1843-A event begins. The older specimens begin to "dance", moving in circle around SCP-1843, followed by the younger males. The female specimens emit an high pitched sound throughout the whole event. The dance finishes after 20 minutes and 15 seconds. The younger males (SCP-1843-1-28 and -29) force a juvenile (formerly SCP-1843-1-31; now SCP-1843-2) to lay in front of SCP-1843. The older specimen (SCP-1843-1-26) kills SCP-1843-2 by crushing its skull, and proceeds to place SCP-1843-2 within SCP-1843. At this point, SCP-1843-1-26 screams for 2 minutes, before all the specimens bow down to SCP-1843 and return to the containment vehicle.<br/>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>Those “screams” have been recognized as an attempt of SCP-1843-1-26 to speak German. Those with Level 3 clearance may read Document 1843-12-AD for further information.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1843-2:</strong> Document 1843-12-AD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note:</strong> <em>The following is a rough attempt to decipher SCP-1843-1-26's vocalizations. However, since its speech mostly consisted of bleats and German gibberish, this translation is approximate.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-1843-1-26:</strong> My Lord, god of all the ones that munch the green, who takes the fear away, grant us peace. We offer you this virgin, for we beg you to listen the [unknown, plea?] our herds asked since your descent. (<em>SCP-1843-1-26 pauses for 10 seconds at the end of every sentence.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1843-1-26:</strong> We beg you to free us from the [unknown] that has tormented us since the first wool.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1843-1-26:</strong> The [unknown] has forced us to live in fear.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1843-1-26:</strong> [Unknown] has denied us of the warmth in the cold, and devoured us in the warm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-1843-1-26:</strong> If you are our [helper (?), savior (?)], accept this virgin as a treat, and destroy the [unknown].</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1843-3:</strong> Summary of Testing Log 1843-13-G.</p>
<p>On 2010/██/██, SCP-1843-1-26 was exposed a second time to SCP-1843, among other six (6) instances of SCP-1843-1. SCP-1843-1-26 did not participate to the SCP-1843-A event, but limited itself to repeatedly hit SCP-1843 with its horns. SCP-1843-1-26 appeared to emit a vocalization similar to "lügner", the German word for "liar."</p>
<p>SCP-1843-1-26 was later killed by the other instances of SCP-1843-1, instead of SCP-1843-2. At time of writing, only SCP-1843-1-26 has displayed this kind of behavior.</p>
