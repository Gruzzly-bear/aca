<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All 32 instances of SCP-9986 are stored at Site-1908 (Seymour) in a dedicated laboratory.</p>
<p>Personnel are allowed to access SCP-9986 during their break hours or during their off-duty hours. SCP-9986 instances have been marked from 1 to 32 and are retrofitted with trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9986 is a set of 32 standard aluminum soda cans with a capacity of 355ml (12oz). The cans are identified as “Liminal Limes,” originating from “Citric Liminality” in Nanaimo, BC. All 32 cans contain the same transparent lime colored carbonated liquid known as SCP-9986-1.</p>
<p>When ingested, SCP-9986-1 will cause the subject to revisit a specified memory that is consciously picked by the subject, with 100% accuracy in the exact events of the memory. Memories range between memorable events, life-changing moments, flashbacks to tragedies or specific days in history that the subject lived through.</p>
<p>The duration of these effects lasts a minimum of 30 seconds at a minimum dosage of 10ml, or up to 18 minutes at 350ml. The effects of SCP-9986-1 can be extended to a maximum of 30 minutes total from repeat dosages. When SCP-9986-1 reaches its maximum duration, no further dosages will be accepted until 30 seconds after the duration expires to allow the effects to wear off.</p>
<p>SCP-9986-1 contains 1 gram per 100ml of SCP-9986-2, a lime colored powder substance that causes the anomalous effects in SCP-9986-1 and is one of the ingredients of SCP-9986-1 as a flavouring extract. When SCP-9986-2 is introduced to liquids, it will bind to the liquid and create a version of SCP-9986-1 based on the liquid it was introduced to. Attempts to replicate the same effect on solids and gas were unsuccessful unless SCP-9986-2 was mixed into a liquid and converted into a solid or gas state.</p>
<p>When emptied or containing less than 100ml of liquid, SCP-9986 will take 5 minutes to begin refilling itself through unknown means, which finishes in 60 seconds to exactly 355ml.</p>
<p>During structural tests to evaluate the risk of possible loss of SCP-9986 instances over mismanagement and misuse, attempts to completely break SCP-9986 were met with failure, with one attempt leading to SCP-9986 surviving a hydraulic press with no scratches, even when emptied.</p>
<p>Subjects who reportedly grew an addiction to SCP-9986 are attributed to their self-inflicted desire for the taste of SCP-9986-1, not because of SCP-9986’s anomalous properties and the liquid contents of SCP-9986-1.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> SCP-9986 was recovered at a recently closed bar in Nanaimo, BC on 02/14/2025 that was currently under investigation by the Foundation through a front company. SCP-9986 was moved to Site-1908, and contained in the laboratory where it remains today. Testing began on 02/15/2025 following the labelling of all SCP-9986 instances and retrofitting trackers on each can.</p>
<p><strong>Experiments:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 02/15/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Researcher Gauthier<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> A date with Researcher Tremblay at Vancouver Aquarium on 01/11/2025<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Admission records validated that both Researchers Gauthier and Tremblay did visit the aquarium on 01/11/2025 during “Super Saturday.”<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Researcher Gauthier reportedly cried over having to revisit an embarrassing memory.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> Seriously, I didn’t think that this anomalous liquid would make me remember that embarrassing kiss with Tremblay. - Gauthier</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a ladies night out for us, no? You took a risk today by being the first test subject for this anomaly. Though D-Class would have been preferred for this experiment, Site-1907 explicitly prohibits the use of D-Class at the site as it was never built to support it. - Tremblay</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> Noting that on 04/30/2025, Gauthier and I were given SCP-9986 Cans #1 and #2 as a reward for assisting in the experiments in February and March. To say we’ve grown an addiction to it is false, but it has helped us grow a stronger bond together. - Tremblay</p>
<p>It helps, alright? It’s not all sunshine and rainbows here when you have anomalies to attend to all the time. I’ve grown better memories that are less embarrassing now for me to revisit with SCP-9986, so has Tremblay… If only my mood didn’t sour in recent months, I wish I didn’t have to cry all the time while using SCP-9986. - Gauthier</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 02/19/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Ross, Dr. Chan<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> A visit to the Richmond Night Market in 2023, revisiting a moment with their friends and buying souvenirs.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Ticket sales and photos at the time of the Richmond Night Market operating confirms their presence, including financial records for its time.<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Dr. Ross mentioned that he would visit again this year. Dr. Chan noted that SCP-9986 felt “like a hallucinogenic drive.”</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> I believe there is a good use for SCP-9986 for the sake of boosting the morale of everyone here on Mount Seymour. I request to send a proposal to the Administration Board to utilize SCP-9986 as a morale booster. - Ross</p>
<p>Ross. As much as I want to send this proposal to the Administration Board, more tests are needed for the liquid contents of SCP-9986 to determine the viability of safe long-term consumption. - Chan</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> Noting that I sent over Ross and Chan’s proposal to the Administration Board on their behalf, with a few amendments made by all three of us. It’s becoming clear by day that the cans are becoming a morale booster to everyone involved in these experiments. - Gauthier</p>
<p>The Administration Board has received the proposal and has shown generally positive support for it. Consider me a yes for coming to the 2025 edition of the Richmond Night Market with the Site Director. - Site-1908 Board Director Macdonald</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 02/22/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Lefebvre<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Dr. Lefebvre previously had anterograde amnesia for 6 months.<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> A formed memory during Dr. Lefebvre’s period with amnesia.<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> None<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> None<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> The test was repeated 50 times on various memories, with only 4 of the tests being successful at retrieving known or partially known memories. The results concluded that SCP-9986 is limited to memories that are known or partially known by the individual.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> I will say that the tests have helped with keeping me refreshed for the rest of the day and contributing to the key discovery of SCP-9986's limitations. Needless to say, I'll be coming to work tomorrow with a lime soda. - Lefebvre</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/01/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Morin<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> Shoplifting from a convenience store with $40 worth of goods.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> A criminal record check confirmed the committed crime.<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> An investigation was immediately opened into this discrepancy. A criminal record check confirmed 20 criminal cases leading to holding periods of less than 24 hours and trial cases that resulted in lenient sentences. None of the crimes were disclosed prior to employment and a video log was conducted during the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> I’m surprised that 40 dollars of goods was all it took to crack open an investigation into a personnel, let alone that we didn’t catch on to it sooner. - Gauthier</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log-1:</strong><br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 03/01/2025<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Morin<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Tremblay, Researcher Cloutier<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted by Researcher Tremblay in a holding cell for Dr. Morin. Researcher Cloutier supervised the entire interrogation.</p>
<p>Begin Log…<br/>
Dr. Morin and Researcher Tremblay face each other at a hastily set up interrogation room. Researcher Cloutier stands nearby, between both Morin and Tremblay.</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Morin. Care to explain this discrepancy?</p>
<p><em>Morin fiddles with her fingers below the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> What discrepancy? I was doing my administrative tasks when you both ordered me to come to this room.</p>
<p><em>Tremblay gives Morin an opened file of Morin’s criminal record that was provided by the Vancouver Police Department.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Can you explain what this is?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … A criminal record with someone else’s name on it.</p>
<p><em>Tremblay points to the name on the criminal record list. Morin’s full name is written on the list.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Did you read this specific section?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> Y-yes?</p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Are you sure? You’ve been acting weird after the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I-I’m fine. I’m fine. I-I do not have any memory of those specific areas that you are talking about.</p>
<p><em>Tremblay sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> … How did you get past the criminal background checks in the first place, Morin?</p>
<p><em>Morin does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Okay… What about that memory? Or these CCTV image stills we were given? Why was this your favourite memory?</p>
<p><em>Cloutier pulls out 4 CCTV image stills of Morin committing shoplifting at 4 different convenience stores and shows it to Morin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> T-that’s not me.</p>
<p><em>Morin looks left, then right. Sweat can be seen forming around her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … T-there has to be a misunderstanding. My record has been clean and always has been. I-I’m sorry but you have the wrong person.</p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Are you sure? Do you remember any of the mentioned locations on the list?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I… No. I’ve never been to the mentioned places on the list, nor have I gone there before.</p>
<p><em>Cloutier flips the criminal record list file to show the backside containing trial information and previous charges following the conclusion of each trial.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> There are trial dates dating back to 2021. Are you sure that these never happened?</p>
<p><em>More sweat is seen coming off Morin’s face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I- I- I- I- I swear I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Hang on Hang on… Morin. Are you hot right now?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … Yes?</p>
<p><em>Tremblay gives SCP-9986, disguised as a Foundation soda brand, to Morin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Here, have this. You seem thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … Tremblay… why?</p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Just take a sip, a few deep breaths, and we’ll settle this quickly, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … Fine.</p>
<p><em>Morin reaches over to grab SCP-9986, drinks a small amount of it, and then places SCP-9986 on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> How is the drink?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> Really? SCP-9986 as my drink? What are you trying to-</p>
<p><em>Morin’s eyes widen as SCP-9986-1 takes effect.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> What are you trying to achieve by making me drink this again? I thought one experiment was enough.</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> What are you seeing right now? Describe your memory.</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I-</p>
<p><em>Morin clears her throat. Less sweat is seen on her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I’m in a store… I-i’m looking around a few aisles of cheaply priced food.</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> And when was this?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> Umm… J-January this year. I- N-no. January 15th this year.</p>
<p><em>Morin takes a deep breath before responding.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I took some of the food that was there… and… I- I- I- was trying to find something to keep me alive for the week…</p>
<p><em>Morin’s arms are seen shaking slightly as she continues to speak. Cloutier looks at Tremblay with disbelief before turning back to Morin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Why exactly the food? Why $40 dollars worth of food?</p>
<p><em>Morin’s eye movements shift views erratically from left to right.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> … Financial struggles. T-the alarms would blare afterwards and I quickly packed everything into a black 2024 Hyundai Sonata.</p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Did it have a squirtle plushie in that Hyundai Sonata?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I- Y-yes. I drove back home and used said food to survive another week-</p>
<p><em>Morin freezes in place as she finally realizes what she said as SCP-9986-1’s effects wear off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I-…</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> … I… I have no words. I- Y-you weren’t like this when you came to work every day! I-</p>
<p><em>Cloutier and Tremblay sigh, while Tremblay keeps her mouth shut.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> The Foundation can’t afford to lose any more personnel, and yet… I’m stuck with you. Given that you have admitted to the crime today, I’m going to assign you to additional experiments until we can figure out what to do with you. I’ll be in touch with the Site Director to figure out your fate, Morin.</p>
<p><em>Morin’s breathing turns heavy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> D-don’t tell anyone of this, please… I don’t want to rot in jail…</p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> I’m not-</p>
<p><em>Tremblay sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> All I can say is that you wait for the Site Director’s final decision, okay? If we see any good behavioural changes from you, then we may recommend to the Site Director for a lenient punishment, okay?</p>
<p><em>Morin nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tremblay:</strong> Good. I’ll come by tonight to check up on you, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Morin:</strong> I… O-okay… T-Tremblay.</p>
<p><strong>Cloutier:</strong> Then this concludes the interrogation.</p>
<p>End Log.</p>
<p>Following the video log, additional experiments were conducted on the viability of using SCP-9986 as an interrogation tool.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/02/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Morin<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> 2021 assault in the Yaletown neighbourhood of Downtown Vancouver.<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> Morin described provoking an argument to force a male stranger to fight her, ended up simply slapping his face instead and ran away after failing to get the intended results.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Victim was Site-1908’s Dr. Brooks. Crime confirmed with CCTV footage saved by Dr. Brooks.<br/>
<strong>Outcome</strong>: Dr. Brooks berated Morin for the crime and mentioned his inability to get the proper justice. Dr. Morin grew agitated regarding her crimes being made public to the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Noting that Brooks was tested separately with SCP-9986 to confirm the memories and it matched his filed criminal report and CCTV footage. Since the experiments, he was given SCP-9986 Can #30 for use as a teaching aid for a Foundation Agent training course that he teaches. - Cloutier</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/03/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Researcher Gaboria<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> Information regarding encounter with a person of interest with ties to groups of interest “Ambrose Restaurants.”<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> A discussion that took place in a GOI owned cafe between a suspected POI representative for the GOI and Gaboria in 2019.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Foundation agents were sent to the location of the cafe. Memories were validated by the presence of anomalous food and liquid in the cafe.<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Validation efforts result in the capture of POI-10074. Researcher Gaboria was given a bottle of wine by a coworker for his efforts in securing the POI.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Unfortunately we’ve hit a snag with figuring out the origins of SCP-9986. POI-10074 noted that “Ambrose Restaurants” does not own the bar that SCP-9986 was discovered at. To date, the Foundation is continuing efforts to identify GOI “Citric Liminality.” - Gaboria</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/07/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Fournier<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> 2015 disciplinary action due to mishandling containment of an anomaly at Site-1908.<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> A disciplinary hearing between Dr. Fournier and former Board Director Patel delivered the decision, which was a demotion and mandatory ethics training for Dr. Fournier.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Verified by report logs during that timeframe, logs of Fournier’s improvement in standing at the Foundation and therapy logs following the disciplinary action. Patel, who currently works at Site-1908 following the end of her term as Board Director, was able to verify the contents of Fournier’s memories.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> If it weren’t for my coworkers helping me rebuild my reputation here, I wouldn’t be here today. I’ve not made the same mistakes since the disciplinary action. Reliving it again has reminded me of how far I have come since that mistake. - Fournier</p>
<p>I took a chance to try SCP-9986. I can’t believe I had to relive 2015 all over again. Then again, I really should have picked a better memory to revisit… - Patel</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> Noting that Fournier is currently teaching ethics to new recruits of the Ethics Committee in the months after the experiments. Recruits love him for his teaching style. He has not used SCP-9986 since the experiments. - Patel</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/11/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Morin<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> 2022 Burrard Station assault.<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> Morin described an argument that occurred after leaving the Skytrain from Burrard Station, leading to an assault of a female victim.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Confirmed by CCTV footage and the filed criminal report.<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Dr. Morin refused to leave her office for the day after the test. Crying was heard from her office by personnel passing by. Researcher Tremblay, Cloutier, Williams and Ronald were present to help Morin calm down.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Dr. Morin has given up on hiding her past. She’s been slowly opening up to her coworkers in recent days and the Site Director is considering a less harsh punishment. She’s told me, Tremblay, Williams and Ronald about everything she did and that she’s willing to finally confess to site leadership about what she did. - Cloutier</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Experiment 03/14/2025</strong><br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Morin<br/>
<strong>Target Memory:</strong> 01/02/2025 Burrard Station assault.<br/>
<strong>Memory Details:</strong> Morin described a political argument that spiraled into her slapping the person she provoked in the face and walking away while the victim watched on.<br/>
<strong>Validation:</strong> Confirmed by criminal reports and CCTV footage. The victim was identified as Researcher Stewart, one of the new hires at the time of the incident for Site-1907. His testimony matched the given evidence of the crime.<br/>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Following the validation of this memory, Dr. Morin confessed to every crime that she committed and begged for a second chance. Under the orders of Site-1908 Board Director Macdonald, Morin was demoted to level 2 and ordered to take 6 months of ethics training.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The Site Director spoke to Dr. Morin privately. Weeks later I was told by the Site Director that Dr. Morin was put in a personnel reformation program to help rebuild her reputation in the Foundation and fix the mistakes that led her to this mess in the first place. Morin told me that she doesn’t regret taking the program.</p>
<p>When I asked the Site Director about why they didn’t fire her, I was told that the reasons would not be disclosed. - Cloutier</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Addendum 04/01/2025:</strong> In light of the useful nature of SCP-9986, a decision was made by Site-1908’s administration board to allow unrestricted use of SCP-9986 as a morale boost to Site-1908 personnel and restricted use of SCP-9986-2 for deployment as an interrogation tool by Foundation agents.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, new security protocols will be put in place to prevent theft of SCP-9986 or misplacement of SCP-9986 at Site-1908. Long-term use of a can of SCP-9986 must be scheduled with the Administration Board ahead of time with a valid reason for doing so, including any use outside of Site-1908. - Site-1908 Board Director Macdonald</p>
