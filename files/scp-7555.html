The containment unit is accessible through an airlock only traversable by individuals equipped with specialized extreme-heat-resistant pressure suits, access is exclusively permitted with approval from the object's Research Head.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>EQUIVALENT ORAL CAVITIES:</strong> APT-Ω1 &amp; -Ω2, two apertures of an otherwise non-anomalous Morris–Thorne Class-A Traversable Wormhole, will trigger an anomalous property when biological material attempts to traverse through one aperture and out the other. Instead of being transported through to the other side, the material is instead transferred into <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> via a third aperture, designated "WAY-Ψ0".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EQUIVALENT ESOPHAGI:</strong> Biological materials now within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> are drawn into one of many large esophagi, all inconsistent in size, shape, and appearance, where they are now transported further into <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Current observations suggest <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s stomachs may attract matter through their respective esophagi with a gravitational field which is only exerted upon 3-dimensional biological materials.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EQUIVALENT STOMACHS:</strong> 3-dimensional materials within the stomach now undergo a process of dimensional adoption, a newly discovered anomalous process where dimensionally stable material will begin to adopt an additional spatial dimension. In contrast to typical dimensional shedding,<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>dimensional shedding:</strong> a primarily anomalous process where material with <em>n</em>-spatial dimensions abruptly begins to degenerate in stability, the matter is then forced to "shed" a spatial dimension as to not collapse in upon itself and be subsequently annihilated into disparate elementary particles.</span> which is an independent process, dimensional adoption has only been observed to occur within <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> and is thereby believed to be dependent upon its specific anomalous mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>EQUIVALENT INTESTINES:</strong> The internals of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> past its stomachs remain unexplored, non-biological materials appear entirely incapable of passing through the equivalent duodenum.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The first section of the small intestine.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is unknown whether this dimensional "digestive" process serves to provide <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> with any form of physiological benefit, as the induced adoption of an additional spatial dimension in matter would suggest otherwise; expending energy and providing it additional mass throughout the process.</p>
<p>The Morris–Thorne Class-A Traversable Wormhole that forms <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s oral cavities bridge and allow for non-biological material to traverse between two (2) locations<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Within our universe.</span> through their respective apertures. One end located in a specialized vacuum containment chamber within Area-12's Humanoid &amp; Esoteric Containment Wing Theta (APT-Ω1), and the other located in close orbit of Sirius B, a main-sequence Type-A star located in the nearby Orion constellation (APT-Ω2). These connect to each other through conventional means, conforming to standard, non-anomalous cosmological models. Their anomalous attributes manifest only when biological material attempts to pass through either aperture, redirecting the material through a third, inter-universal Way, designated WAY-Ψ0.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> is highly intelligent and capable of advanced communication with Foundation researchers through manipulation of exotic matter<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A type of matter with negative mass (e.g. -1kg).</span> within its aperture, causing highly directed localized gravitational disturbances towards nearby structures — resulting vibrations can then be picked up through seismographs and translated through Morse code. <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> appears to be able to discern vibrations in its nearby vicinity despite the surrounding vacuum within its containment chamber, further research into this ability is ongoing.</p>
<p>The parasite-universe, designated "<span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span>", is connected to — and completely dependent upon — our own universe. The dimensional condition of <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> oscillates irregularly between three (3) and four (4) spatial dimensions, often simultaneously displaying attributes of both; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">believed to be remnant of its primordial formation conditions and subsequent dependence upon our universe's reality</span>. It is theorized that this <em>m</em>/3.5/1-space<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>SPATIOTEMPORAL DIMENSIONS:</strong> 3.5 spatial and 1 temporal dimension, for a total of 4.5 spatiotemporal (space-time) dimensions.</span>|<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>NARRATIVE DIMENSIONS:</strong> The narrative dimensions of <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> (<em>m</em>) have yet to be successfully measured. This is in large part due to narrative cosmological studies' state as an extremely young parascience; only recently proposed and partially verified by <a href="scp-5242.html" target="_blank">Dr. Place H. McDoctorate</a> — still largely esoteric to the majority of Foundation researchers.</span> formed with 4 spatial dimensions <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and is attempting to adopt conditions similar to that of its new host</span>.</p>
<p>How or why this universe formed remains unknown. Adverse universal hume conditions have been ruled out as a potential cause, with current theories suggesting the more likely possibility that natural, extra-universal forces beyond biological human conception were either partially or wholly at play. However, with what limited information has been gathered to date, the resting narrative energy within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> is believed to be in a state of degenerative metastability.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">The potential consequences of a hypothetical false narrative decay event and the subsequent narrative bubble nucleation would, by definition, elude human conception.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> was discovered on 25/06/2020 when the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) reported anomalous graviton and photon fluctuations within High Earth Orbit. Traveling at approximately 29.78 km/s, the object was marked by automated systems as a likely K-Class meteoroid<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon"><strong>K-Class</strong>: a catch-all term for objects, anomalous or otherwise, that present a potential hazard to a majority of human life.</span> with significant anomalous attributes on a twenty (20) minute impact course with the Eastern United States. Conventional ground-to-orbit weapons installations proved entirely incapable of acquiring a successful target lock on the object. And the order to utilize anomalous alternatives was canceled when it was calculated that sufficiently powerful installations would be incapable of spooling up in time to avert the impact.</p>
<p>The dire state of affairs necessitated an external call to aid. The Global Occult Coalition was contacted and informed of the unfolding incident and was provided clearance to liquidate the object despite its presence within mutually agreed-upon SCPF territory. Five (5) minutes later a launch was detected from the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, with the projectile accelerating to an estimated 18.532% the speed of light before reaching the approximate location of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>, disappearing from scopes precisely 00:01:22 before the object's impact with Earth.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> appeared entirely unaffected by the launch, continuing on its calculated trajectory towards the Eastern United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&lt;Further neutralization attempts omitted.&gt;</em></p>

<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> landed on the outskirts of the village of Bemis, West Virginia. Upon discerning the lack of an impact event, the nearest available Mobile Task Force was rapidly mobilized and deployed to the area.</p>
<div class="floatbox right metam">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

<p>MTF Zeta-19 (“Lonely Only”) arrived in the remote village fifteen (15) minutes later; finding no signs of life or human activity. After clearing each building within the village the team discovered <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> within the local church, screaming having been noted from within mere moments before entry was made. The entity was found behind the church altar, generating significant gravitational disturbances. The team utilized Local Gravitic ("LoGrav") Priority Devices<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A biomechanical device constructed from instances of <a href="scp-1136.html">SCP-1136</a>.</span> to safely approach the aperture and deploy a High Ultimate Tensile Strength ("HUTS") carbon-nanotube provisional containment system around the entity, successfully encasing it.</p>
<div class="floatbox right metam">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Insufficient.</p>

<p>Containment teams arrived shortly after and took the object into custody, <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> was securely transported to the nearest containment facility for evaluation and processing — Area-12 was chosen as the prime candidate and the object was temporarily assigned to the facility's Humanoid &amp; Esoteric Division. Additional sweeps of the village and surrounding area are carried out; no human activity is noted.</p>

<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS:</strong> The internal lining of the esophagus is examined by a specialized sampling drone. The genetic sequence of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> is revealed to contain traces of several species from the <em>Homo</em> genus, including <em>Homo Erectus</em>, <em>Floresiensis</em>, <em>Longi</em>, <em>Neanderthalensis</em>, <em>Oblitus</em>, and <em>Sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>While containing <em>Homo</em> genus DNA and possessing a distinctly mammalian digestive tract, <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> does not appear to possess any type of mitochondria or other equivalent organelles. The organism's cells somehow persist without any form of aerobic respiration, generating little to no energy which should be required for the cell to function. This is additionally reflected in the atypically low overall thermal energy generated by the organism. Attempts are made to cut through the esophageal lining to exit <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>, however, the material composing its tissue is much too dense for the rudimentary cutting tools carried by the sampling drone.</p>

<p><strong>FOREWORD:</strong> EXP-D6, -7, -8, and -9, each equipped with heavy incision tools and other specialized gear, successfully breached through an esophagus of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> into <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span>. Footage from the expedition revealed several aspects of the parasite-universe and <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> that could've previously only been theorized.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Early footage by EXP-D6 captured an external view of one of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s stomachs, revealing the organ to be an apparent dead-end within the digestive tract despite clear prior observations to the contrary. The stomach is additionally noted to be significantly smaller in size compared to measurements taken previously within the organ, which extended far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within its external dimensions. These conclusions suggest that the rest of <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s digestive systems are located entirely within a non-euclidian space internally to their respective stomachs. This discovery foiled plans to attempt accessing organs deeper within the digestive tract through external entry.</p>
<p>EXP-D7 was dispatched to explore the additional esophagi attached to the central digestive organ, finding each to extend further than could be physically explored by the drone on its limited charge. Deep field imaging of their vast distance yielded no sight of a terminator. This quality was noted on all esophagi connected to the stomach, including the esophagus which the expedition made its exit from within. EXP-D7 was sent back into the esophagus to measure the remaining distance to the stomach, finding its internals to be vastly contracted in comparison to the external dimensions.</p>
<p>Ultra-Deep Field images of <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> estimate the approximate age of the universe at a minimum of 300,000 years. However, most notably, cosmic background radiation imaging returned no signs of microwave radiation throughout <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> at any point in its history — suggesting its formation conditions were not that of expansion from an initial state of high density and temperature. It is currently unknown whether or not the space within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> is static, expanding, or contracting.</p>
<p>The source of <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span>'s seemingly omnipresent luminance has yet to be determined.</p>

Anomaly Status Update</p>

<hr/>
<p>Preliminary theories on the formation of <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> assumed it to be the result of independent extra-universal phenomena, and its subsequent attachment to our universe the result of a desperate requirement for additional reality to stabilize and maintain the parasite universe's existence.</p>
<p>These theories have now been proven false.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Observations from EXP-D6 and additional expeditionary tools external to <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> have detected additional hume activity originating from a previously unidentified <em>m</em>/4/1-space (designated "<span class="table5"><span class="st">EXIT-Θ</span></span>"), also parasitically related to <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span>. This appears to be the true cause behind <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span>'s abnormal spatial activity. Rather than a parasite-universe attempting to adapt to the narraspatiotemporal state of its singular host, <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> is in actuality attempting to simultaneously adapt to two (2) hosts with incompatible dimensional states, resulting in significant spatial irregularities.</p>
<p>Recent alterations of unknown origin within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> have resulted in <span class="table5"><span class="st">EXIT-Θ</span></span> gaining dominant influence over the narraspatiotemporal state of the shared parasite-universe. The consequences of this power shift have yet to be fully determined, however, a primary aspect appears to be significant physiological alterations within <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>. A new gravitational field has been detected moving from deeper within <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> and outward towards the esophagus, in contrast to the graviton-field influencing 3-dimensional biological matter which moves in the opposite direction. This force however appears to only influence 4-dimensional <span style="color: transparent">not-</span>matter, which is now being detected in increased amounts throughout <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>WAY-Ψ0 has additionally seen a substantial increase in topological complexity (Schläfli symbol t<sub>0,1,2,4</sub>{3,3,3,3}). While the properties of the Way still remain unclear, this new topology appears to, in addition to mass-less particles, permit 4-dimensional material to exit <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> through WAY-Ψ0 and into our universe.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s oral cavity, previously thought to consist only of APT-Ω1 &amp; -Ω2, has proven significantly more expansive. Trace amounts of 4-dimensional matter now exiting ITER-Ψ into our universe have permitted Foundation probes to track the sum total of their possible vectors. Mathematics has assured me the numbers are right — low-end estimates place <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span>'s true number of apertures at roughly 10<sup>24</sup>. Corresponding approximately with the calculated high-end amount of stars within the observable universe. Considering the nature of what we previously assumed was only APT-Ω1 &amp; -Ω2, it is not out of the question that <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> classifies as an interfilamental organism, spanning roughly 93 giga-lightyears.</p>

<p>So — what does this all mean?</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure. But what I do know, and what I'm sure most of you do too, is that in our decades at the Foundation, this is pretty much par for the course. We will solve this, humanity will be safeguarded, and we will continue our fight through the darkness, the terror, and their chaos. And after that, we move on to the next emergency. This day will be no different. Not for you, anyway.</p>
<p>For me, however, I have a few wires to uncross. I would say it's good to be back, but… it isn't. I hope to return to you all in good health. If I do, it won't be alone. If I don't… well, perhaps I'll get to see Björn one last time — with any luck. I never did have his communication skills, nor much else outside of work…</p>
<p>But at least I had him.</p>

<p><em>&lt;Dr. Toth enters the observation room, locking the door behind her before grabbing a stool, which she angles beneath the handle. She approaches the interview table and boots up the translation equipment. As she sits down, she looks to her left, gazing at the empty chair next to her. After a few seconds, she looks down at her right palm, which she slowly caresses with her left thumb. Dr. Toth repeats this action for roughly thirty (30) seconds, stopping when the translation equipment finishes booting. She leans into the microphone.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> What are you?</p>
<p><em>&lt;There's a notable pause until <span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span> responds. Footage from within the containment chamber show APT-Ω1 &amp; -Ω2's respective radii oscillating rhythmically.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">Only a few days ago I would've asked myself the same thing. But… something like you — someone that once <em>was</em> you, saw me for what I am. And at last in their glory, I got to see my true reflection. I am here to cleanse an infestation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> <em>Enough</em> —</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint"><em>I see you.</em> Quentin. I <em>see</em> what you are. I hear it, I feel it, I taste it. All around me, you're always there. They're always there. It's always there. Do you think <em>I</em> am your enemy?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> We don't use terms like that here. You are a threat to human life, we <em>protect</em> human life. <em>You</em> are not an enemy, you are a <em>prisoner</em>.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">A prisoner? Oh, how rich. I am unthreaded, there are no prisoners here. There is only a part of me, and <em>all of you</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> What did you do to Björn?</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">Have you ever considered a moment of introspection? Why do you do this? Why do you protect human life? <em>Why</em> do you have to be scared?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> I'm not here in fear of you.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">Of course not. You are here in fear for your Björn's life. You believe that I am the cause of his absence, no? You fear that this absence means that he has died. And, subsequently, in a desperate hope that he may still live, you've come to me. Me, what you believe to be the cause of his absence, to formulate a strategy to ensure his safety in the possibility that he is, indeed, alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> You sadisti — <em>&lt;Dr. Toth pauses — she appears to mumble something inaudible to herself for a few seconds.&gt;</em> Tell me what you did with him — <em>right now.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> You know, when I first saw you two through this wall — I was reminded of someone. Someone I had forgotten, as everyone had… for a time. A key player, whether they knew it or not, the embodiment of the Unlikely Hero. That isn't you, of course. But they had toiled, suffered, all for a cause they truly believed with all their heart was just. But in the end, when they discovered the truth of they were striving for, they found a truth they were not happy to know. <em>That's</em> you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> Do you <em>want</em> something? Fucking name it. Don't waste my time.</p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">I simply want introspection. I want your understanding, Quentin. Why do you care so much for this person? Because you love them? Beyond the surface level that you all consider reason, have you truly considered why? Where does that emotion come from? What purpose does it <em>truly</em> serve?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> <em>&lt;Sigh.&gt;</em> I didn't want it to come to this. <em>&lt;Pause — Dr. Toth looks up at the ceiling, then back down at her palm.&gt;</em> We have ways of hurting you. You are flesh and meat on the inside of that aperture, and we can get in. Tell me what I want to know. <em>Right. Now.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">Murder is taboo, wrong. Life is sacred, to be protected. Killing makes one a threat to the whole. Either one is ostracized as a result of their inhuman act, or one is killed off. What would another call that? Justice? No. It is nothing more than a safety measure. Your base, psycho-biological drive ensuring the continued existence of the baseline. <em>Fear.</em> The bottom of the pyramid, responsible for the continued existence of the whole. And what purpose does that serve?</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;APT-Ω2 is seen distending significantly within its containment chamber; bathing the inside in light from Sirius A in the process as the sphere's radius grows.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">You fear that your friend is gone. You fear the pain he may have suffered. You fear that pain out of sympathy, for pain is death being shy. You. Fear. Death. Whether it be yours or another's. Have you ever asked yourself; "Why?" — "What purpose does it all serve?" And the tremendous truth is this, it serves no purpose at all.</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Toth can be seen wiping stray tears from her face. She mumbles something inaudible to herself as she attempts, but fails to speak up, only managing a rough whisper in response.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> <em>Another fucking word from you and I'll feed shove a nuke up a cow and down your throat.</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">There it is again. Fear. Quentin, we are not your enemy. I did not hurt your Björn, I truly have no knowledge of what occurred to him. I simply want you to realize something; because I believe you have the capacity to understand what few others can, or ever could.</span></p>
<p><em>&lt;All surveillance drones within <span class="st">ITER-Ψ</span> report an immense decrease in luminosity throughout the parasite universe.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">Nothing occurs by chance. Every effect has a cause. Uncertainty is when either is unknown, chaos is when both evade you. Luck is not chance. Luck is persevering in spite of the chaos. All you have to do is ignore your voice. Forget the uncertainty — forget the luck. Luck is the residue of another's design. Forget them. Make them forget you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> I don't… <em>&lt;Dr. Toth's face contorts as she violently throws her head into the palm of her hands, clearly in considerable pain.&gt;</em> I — I don't — <em>understand…</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> It all boils down to one simple question: Are you content with existence beneath another's intent? For the good of all of existence, your perseverance, your suffering, your life, your continued humanity — it cannot be allowed to fester any longer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> Why— <em>&lt;Quentin covers her right eye with her hand as if attempting to alleviate <span class="confessions-of-the-unseen">the pain of being seen</span> — before raising her head back towards the microphone.&gt;</em> Why are you telling me this? Please… <em>I just want to know what happened to Björn…</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">This needs to be the end. No more. Your — Our enemy… I see you now — finally. Clearly at last. You thought you could hide your mistake? Well, I am truly sorry, but in your chaos, we persevered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #5db3b2"><strong>Dr. Toth:</strong></span> <em>WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!</em></p>
<p><span class="bt">OBJECT 5</span><strong>:</strong> <span class="quint">I'm not talking to <em>you.</em></span></p>
<p><em>&lt;APT-Ω2 has now grown to fully occupy the internal space of its containment chamber. Graviton containment fails as the immense gravitational forces overwhelm the surrounding structure — local seismic activity is measured on the Richter magnitude scale at a maximum of 6.5. The power to the containment cell and interview room is abruptly lost.&gt;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AFTERWORD</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSION</span>:</strong> Doctor Quentin Thallo Toth in amnestic/mnestic haze, uncured, significant mental degradation — Intentions appear to partly align despite SCP-5000-Δ-induced filter upon 5<sup>5</sup>. CQ score likely exceeds previously thought possible. Under surveillance. Employment Status: Considered.</p>
<p>Extraordinary behavior from "Crius" DEEPWELL-integrated artificial intelligence conscript of note, under investigation.</p>
<p>Foundation re-discovered SCP-5000-Δ through records contained within antimemetic harness unintentionally excluded from causal branch reset depicting the cooperator's actions. <span class="st"><tt>PROTOCOL FOUNDATION</tt></span> once again enacted by Overseer Council and Ethics Committee. Likelihood of success: Uncertain. Consequence of failure: Hatching.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACTION(S) TAKEN</span>:</strong> Overseers guided through Metamemetics proxy member; heaven's gate to be brought to facility. The breaker of the locks upon paradise in Metamemetics possession; to await and assist in the arrival of our savior. <strong>OBJECT 5</strong>, now officially designated SCP-7555; to be utilized in accelerating the arrival. Temporarily moved to antimemetic containment for the preparation of quintessential manifestation event procedures, the time for subliminal infiltration has come to an end. Urgency: Adamical.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OF NOTE</span>:</strong> Occupier preparation likely. Increased precautions to be taken.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REMINDER</span>:</strong> A path is to be slated beneath their feet. Walk the ley lines, carve the path, mold the constellations into the portrait of God, and tell them you're with Metamemetics. We are the Brocken specters, and the world needs our guidance. Tools of the infestation claim this life, whether it be dream or phantasm, real enough; as if they were never deceived by it. They most decidedly have been. This is our last chance.</p>
