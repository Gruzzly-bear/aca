<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7822 is a 162 cm tall humanoid entity, resembling a European woman with long blonde hair. Its only deviations from this anatomy are an absence of facial features, and metallic sutures embedded along a section of its spine; elements which have led researchers to theorize artificial origins. Despite this, it demonstrates responsiveness to both visual and olfactory stimuli. SCP-7822 wears a black dress, a white apron and headpiece, with its hair fashioned into a bun. It presents physical capabilities consistent with those of a standard human. It does not require sustenance, excrete waste, or exhibit a need for sleep.</p>
<p>The designation SCP-7822-1 applies to any individual to whom SCP-7822 has affixed its servitude, a bond that is irreversible. SCP-7822-1 experiences no alterations and is not bound to SCP-7822 in any capacity. Commands issued by SCP-7822-1 will be executed to the fullest extent of SCP-7822's abilities. When unable to perform or understand a command, or when no commands are assigned or pending, SCP-7822 will assume a default posture (see image above). It may temporarily leave this posture to perform a limited range of unprompted actions, such as cleaning or maintaining a 10 m proximity with SCP-7822-1, whose location it remains continually aware of. Upon the death of SCP-7822-1, SCP-7822 autonomously bonds with the nearest individual within 24 to 48 hours.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> It was discovered that Nobile ████ Di Pale had fled his château for Sardinia in a presumable attempt to seek refuge. 3 days after his flight, French government representative Mr. Pierre Richaud, in the company of Remo Paolo Attansio,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> visited the estate to assess the newly inherited French property.</p>
<p>Upon further examination, they heard persistent <em>"loud banging"</em> noises emanating from the lower chambers. Following the sound led them to a barricaded cellar, which was curiously clean compared to the rest of the basement. Inside, they discovered a faceless maid. It showed no signs of hostility but possessed a compulsion to follow Mr. Richaud. Hence, both the maid and Mr. Richaud were taken into custody at our nearby observation post [now decommissioned].</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> A subsequent inquiry revealed that Nobile ████ Di Pale’s vessel had sunk during its transit between Genoa and Sardinia, ensuring no further claim to the estate or its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong><em>1860/09/05 – Containment Report - 7822-01</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> We have filed the maid's discovery to headquarters. While we await a response, we have given it the provisional moniker <em>Félicité</em>.</p>
<p>Preliminary experimentation has confirmed that Félicité performs commands only if requested by Pierre Richaud. Although we noted it lacks emotional understanding when interpreting or executing commands. Furthermore, commands must be issued in a French dialect native to Haute-Savoie, which Pierre fortunately speaks rudimentarily. In light of these findings, Pierre has been inducted into our team for further study of Félicité.</p>
<p>Félicité is proficient in typical activities associated with domestic servants, such as cleaning, cooking, and washing. We have additionally catalogued a small list of behaviors Félicité will perform even if unprompted, notably protecting Pierre from physical threats or self-cleaning.</p>
<p>Given that Félicité has thus far not shown any signs of being a risk and has proven easy to contain, we have unanimously decided to employ it. It will clean the observation post daily and provide assistance in the kitchen at noon. When unoccupied, it is to return to its containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> We have all enjoyed an improvement in meal quality following Félicité's integration into the kitchen.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> We have received a reply! Félicité has officially been registered as SCP-7822!</p>
<p>We recently noticed SCP-7822 has acquired an understanding of proper French and Italian. Although we took pride in her progress, we were stunned by her grasp of Italian, given how rarely we speak it.</p>
<p>In order to assess the extent of SCP-7822's ability, we devised trials involving the retention of complex instructions and her ability to replicate intricate tasks. While she lacked the initiative to handle unspecified tasks, her overall performance significantly exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-7822 was taught literacy in several European languages to assist with translating incoming and outgoing mail. However, she struggles with expressions, which she translates literally. An issue that has led to amusing results.</p>
<p>Pierre Richaud has taught SCP-7822 to deal Vingt-et-Un. While not inherently beneficial to operations, it has improved team morale during downtime.</p>

<p><strong><em>1863/05/12 – Status Report - 7822-03</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> Following Pierre Richaud's passing, we returned from the hospital to find SCP-7822 standing idly in the corner of her cell. All attempts to get a response from her failed. She stayed there for the next 26 hours before starting to follow and obey Francisse Roux, who was on night watch at the time. A development he welcomed with much enthusiasm but left us slightly unnerved.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that in the absence of a commanding individual, whom we will now refer to as <em>SCP-7822-1</em>, SCP-7822 autonomously seeks and bonds with a new one, likely the nearest available person.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> We were recently put into correspondence with the Director of future Site-138, who has expressed great interest in SCP-7822's capabilities.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> After lengthy negotiations and due to the increasing instability caused by the war, we have decided to relocate SCP-7822 to the newly constructed Site-138 within neutral Swiss territory.</p>
<p>The transfer of SCP-7822 and SCP-7822-1-B is scheduled to take place 2 days following the transcription of this report. The relocation will be conducted under the cover of a routine wine shipment.</p>

<p><strong>1870/09/30 – Operational Report - 7822-05</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> SCP-7822-1-B passed away from pneumonia shortly after SCP-7822's transfer. This prompted research teams to investigate its designation processes further. Multiple D-Class personnel were utilized for this analysis. The findings revealed that SCP-7822-1's selection could indeed be influenced.</p>
<p>Given SCP-7822's lack of ethical discernment and apparent reliance on SCP-7822-1 for directions, site security and administration developed <em>Protocol Aubain-7822</em>. This protocol establishes the psychological criteria and clearance levels required by future SCP-7822-1 candidates, supplemented by ongoing psychological screenings throughout their lifetimes once designated.</p>
<p>Dr. Hans-Rudolf Müller was selected as SCP-7822-1-F.</p>
<p>SCP-7822 was instructed in the operation of typewriters.</p>
<p>A trial period, designated <em>Project Cœur-Simple</em>, was initiated on 1870/08/21 and will span one year. Its goal is to evaluate the possibility of repurposing SCP-7822 for site operations. During this period, SCP-7822-1-F will direct and supervise SCP-7822 with the assistance of his team. It will assist in inventory tracking and facility maintenance. Any unexpected behavior must be reported to site security immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> When SCP-7822 first arrived, it was noted an observation post employee badge was pinned to its uniform just below the collar. Though not formally authorized, the badge has been left in place at SCP-7822-1-B's request.</p>
<p>Appended comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I've never seen anything work quite like SCP-7822. Although its a little uncanny at first, it could allow us to focus on research instead of menial work. — If Cœur-Simple works out, its got my vote."</em> – Dr. Rafael Walti, SCP-7822 Containment and Analysis.</p>

<p><strong>1871/11/15 – Status Report - 7822-06</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> <em>Project Cœur-Simple</em> has concluded, yielding positive results. It is now clear that SCP-7822's behavior is entirely dependent on SCP-7822-1's disposition, making it much safer than initially anticipated. In addition, its efficiency surpassed that of any employee or machine, the impact of which has been widely praised by staff.</p>
<p>As an additional precautionary measure, SCP-7822 was regularly interviewed for further evaluation of its mental framework. It would communicate via the use of a typewriter. These interviews only highlighted SCP-7822's encyclopedic memory, and its inability to respond to prompts requiring introspective thinking or decision-making.</p>
<p>These traits make SCP-7822 an ideal appliance for repetitive assignments. As a result, its repurposing has been approved.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-7822-1-F had made unofficial arrangements for SCP-7822 to deliver coffee to designated offices before 08:15. Both he and his team were reminded that SCP-7822 should be regarded as an auxiliary, not a junior. To prevent similar issues, personnel will now maintain a professional distance from SCP-7822.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> SCP-7822-1-H, Head of Archives, has decided to repurpose SCP-7822 as the archival operator responsible for records and ledgers. This position will ensure a near-instantaneous access to documents at any hour, and allow archival staff to focus on higher-priority tasks. A dedicated containment unit was constructed adjacent to the archival wing to accommodate SCP-7822.</p>
<p>Documentation requests can be submitted through SCP-7822-1-H.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> Yes, sir, the archival wing's new system is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> It's about time Maillard. With all these bombings, I've got every site on this god forsaken continent sending us documents for safekeeping.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> And this has caused a significant increase in our archival volumes, which has made retrieval speed one of our biggest challenges. However, we have found a revolutionary solution to this problem. I'd like to propose a demonstration to illustrate it.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> This better be worth it Maillard.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> Of course, sir. I invite you to propose a random document for immediate retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> Any documents?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> Any within the archive's scope, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> Very well… How about your employment contract?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7822-1-H stands up and walks towards the office's intercom.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H</strong>: Usually I'd be in my office for this. But thankfully, you possess all the necessary buttons for this demonstration.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-7822-1-H uses the intercom.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> SCP-7822, retrieve my employment contract. Deliver it to the Director's office and place it on the desk.</p>
<p><em>(A faint bell ring can be heard through the intercom.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> The bell signifies that we possess the document.</p>
<p><em>(2 minutes later, SCP-7822 knocks on the door and enters the office. It walks over and places a file neatly on the desk.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7822-1-H:</strong> Sir. Your request.</p>
<p><strong>Site Director:</strong> Hmm, impressive indeed. Good job Maillard.</p>

<p><strong>1964/08/25 – Status Report - 7822-08</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> Site-138 now possesses a facility-wide fax network. SCP-7822 is to transmit documents using this network rather than delivering them in person, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> During one of SCP-7822’s deliveries to the medical block, researchers took the opportunity to conduct an X-ray examination. Results show its skeleton is largely human, however its skull appears to be the result of a forced fusion between two parietal lobes, creating an expanded cerebral volume. This anomaly is believed to be partly responsible for its capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Report:</strong> With the implementation of computerized systems complete, SCP-7822 was tasked with transferring physical records and ledgers into the digital space.</p>
<p>SCP-7822 remains the sole continuous operator within the archival wing. It is to update legacy archives with information received via email. To this effect, it has been assigned a dedicated address, jointly managed by SCP-7822-1-I:</p>
