<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>Due to the resurgence of SCP-6916 as a result of cultural and political shifts and SCP-6916’s unpredictable selection process, proper containment would require the use of mass amnestic and oneirological treatment and international sociological engineering. So, procedures focus instead on preventing SCP-6916 subjects from accessing SCP-6916-A. To achieve this, Zohar counters<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> have been set up at various points around the Irish, British and Northern French coast, to detect attempted access into SCP-6916-A.</p>
<p>Should SCP-6916 subjects attempt to access SCP-6916-A, Foundation agents are to recover them as soon as possible and subject them to oneirological and, if necessary, amnestic treatment. Should subjects successfully gain access to SCP-6916-A, they are considered unrecoverable and all witnesses and relations will receive amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Due to further discoveries regarding SCP-6916 and related anomalies, these containment procedures are awaiting updates and transfer to the management of Project Caliburn.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-6916 is a reoccurring, anomalous dream experience by individuals with Celtic ancestry or who have been raised within the Celtic culture. It is unknown how long subjects have to be exposed to Celtic culture for them to experience SCP-6916. A common psychological trait shared between subjects is the strong sense of hiraeth,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> admiration and pride they feel towards the Celtic nations, culture or history. The subject doesn't have to have lived or visited a Celtic nation to experience SCP-6916.</p>
<p>SCP-6916 has no recognisable pattern, as the number of SCP-6916 instances a subject can experience can range between once per lifetime or three per month. Despite this, SCP-6916 exhibits mild mnestic properties, with some of the images and events subjects experienced during SCP-6916 remaining with them throughout their lives. These memories have been resistant to all known forms of amnestic treatments. The following are the most common images and events experienced by subjects during SCP-6916:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject finds themselves walking along a beach during a thunderstorm. The beach's composition and size vary but the presents of the storm is consistent. In the background, the faint sound of bells can be heard.</li>
<li>Subject chase an unseen entity through a forest, with some of the trees appearing to be silver in colouration. After some time, the subject pauses to catch their breath. Whilst resting, the trees and plant life begin moving, surrounding the subject. In the tree tops, shadows of winged, humanoid figures can be seen circling the subject, laughing.</li>
<li>Subject attends a feast alongside several individuals, some of which appear to be spectral and "ghost-like." All attendees, including the subject, are wearing an item of silver. At some point, the subject and the attendees become aware of an open door in the hall and begin to experience a growing sense of sorrow and bitterness. Through the door, an island can be seen.</li>
<li>Subject begins weeping in the middle of a battlefield during a thunderstorm. Surrounding them are several dead individuals, human and humanoid. As the subject compose themselves, they are approached by a bearded man wearing black fabric, furs and a crown composed of antlers and silver. The man embraces the subject before facing them, with water rising around the two of them. The man then whispers "<em>Come home</em>" as the sound of bells and wolves howling is heard. (<strong>Note: this event is experienced only by those who have been subjected to multiple instances of SCP-6916.</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Subjects who've repeatedly experienced SCP-6916 develop knowledge of random Insular Celtic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> words and phrases and most develop a strong desire to travel to Northwestern Europe, specifically the Celtic nations. Statistics suggest this desire only occurs within ~3% of subjects. This desire isn't hazardous and if not acted upon, these desires will subside with time as will the subject's subjection to SCP-6916.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 6916.1: History</strong></p>
<p>SCP-6916 was first recorded and classified in early 1998 when a sudden increase in SCP-6916 claims was recorded from various therapy sessions and social interactions, including within the Foundation itself. Following this increase in claims, the Foundation also recorded a sudden increase in immigration and tourism in Ireland, Great Britain and France. These activities also increased again in mid-1999.</p>
<p>When investigated further, analysis was able to discover the increase in SCP-6916 activity correlated to political and cultural shifts that had occurred in Celtic nations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>. To gain further information, the Foundation conducted several interviews with those subjected to SCP-6916 and continued to monitor them long after.</p>
<p>One subject, D-2302, was incredibly detailed regarding SCP-6916's imagery. When asked how he knew so much about SCP-6916, D-2302 revealed that they had experienced SCP-6916 throughout their life. Dr. Zachary Dafydd managed to confirm this by utilising oneiric hypnotherapy techniques. When questioned about their long-term history with SCP-6916, D-2302 grew increasingly hysterical and made several demands to return to Ireland, in order to "find it".</p>
<p>When several other subjects admitted to experiencing SCP-6916 before its surge, an investigation began to try and discover older accounts of SCP-6916. Focusing on areas where Celtic culture and ancestry were prevalent, the Foundation found just under 200 documented recordings of SCP-6916 in the past 130 years. One of the oldest recordings of SCP-6916 was found in the diaries of Brigadier Emyr Ab Ifan<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, written in 1865. Below are extracts of his writings:</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear S,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I wish I could focus. Never have I ever been needed so badly in the present. The world is in conflict unlike any faced before and tensions are growing with every power shift. Yet all I can think of is the dream.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I had another last night. As did Berach and Logan. Always the same. The bells. The howling. And him. This man is so familiar. But I know I have never met him as both Berach and Logan know him too. Why does he torment me like this?</span></p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="color: #232b2b">19/11/1865<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear S,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
We were attacked today.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Late last night, a group of men broke into our chambers and released many of our beasts. Years of research and progress, gone. They claim a new order is coming and their actions are one of glory and progress. I claim their actions as idiocy.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I found Berach crying again today. Usually, he'd feel the back of my hand on his face for such a display, yet I could not bring myself to do it. When I spoke with him, he claimed he was missing home and longed to see his father again. He's been so lost since this war started. I told him to pull himself together and sent him to the artillery. I feel such guilt. How can I judge his sorrow so coldly, despite sharing them?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The dream came again last night.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Those creatures giggle now.<br/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="color: #232b2b">27/11/1865<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear S,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Berach's gone.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
He never clocked in for duty this morning and he wasn't found in his barracks. Given there were no breaches, we assume he left through a Way. He was always good at those. Control has sent out men to attempt to find him but I don't have much hope. He was good at hiding too. He was good at a lot of things.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
His diary is a thing of madness. Words in languages I don't recognise. Crude drawings of islands, trees, and creatures. Creatures that look like something out of a fairy tale. And the man. The man crowned in bone.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
More of the men have experienced the dream and Logan's getting them all the time now. He's stronger than Berach so I'm not worried. According to control, the dreams are happening all over. As far as the Americas and East. They're growing too. And all the same. The forest. The man. The laughing. The island. Like a sickness. Or maybe…<br/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="color: #232b2b">01/12/1865<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear S,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It's the fighting.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Control thinks I'm illogical but it has to be. The dreams began around the start of it all and have only grown since the conflict and genocide increased. I don't know why but how? I think this fluctuation of power and thaumaturgic shifting may be somehow awakening something. Klaus agrees and his numbers are hard to argue against.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The dream is changing too. Last night, there was something new. A man was chained to columns of stone. Skin deeply cut. Eyes full of tears. Screaming into a leather gag. It was him. The crowned man. Behind me, the silver forest was shaking and was filled with screams and shouting. it took me a second to notice the trees. They were moving. Like soldiers. Among them, I saw men and women. Some human. Some mostly human. And some something else. Fighting. Screaming. Laughing.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Then I noticed the girl. A young woman at the feet of the chained man, weeping with him, silver armour coated in blood. And then the bells sounded. And then the heavens opened. And I awoke, weeping.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Berach's trail has gone cold. According to control, he was last seen on Cregneash, back on Mann. Locals say he was looking for something. Nothing since then.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
No more. I must solve this now.<br/></span></p>
</div>
<p>The events described by Brigadier Ab Ifan have not been recorded by any other subjects of SCP-6916. Research is ongoing.</p>
<div class="page">
<p><span style="color: #232b2b">04/12/1865<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Dear S,<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
This is probably the last thing I'll write to you. We're going. We don't know where to start but Klaus suggests Mull Hill. He thinks Berach most likely went there and some of the other dreamers have gone there too. Seems a good place to start. If not, we'll try the coast. That is where the others went too. Everyone is going home.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I could only gather 7 others. Klaus is coming, and Logan is too. Given his skills in old practices, he might be useful. Control thinks we're heading for Poland, along with the others. That should buy us some time.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
I've figured it out.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It's not a warning.<br/></span></p>

</div>
<p>Records And Information Security Administration attempted to uncover further documentation from GoI-ω-008 archives regarding Brigadier Ab Ifan's expedition and experience with SCP-6916. However, very little documentation could be found, although this was expected as the absorption of GoI-ω-008 into the Foundation and the Sixth Occult War had resulted in a great loss of information.</p>
<p>According to a report written by then director of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44">Site-Green</a>, General Oliver Roberts, Brigadier Ab Ifan was believed to have been a casualty of the war. The location of his party and himself are unknown. Additionally, the Foundation discovered during the Sixth Occult War, the immigration and repatriation rate in the United Kingdom, France and Ireland increased slightly. It is yet to be confirmed that this increase was a direct result of SCP-6916.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 6916.2: PoI Behaviour</strong></p>
<p>On 03/03/2000, Nadiya Hassan was reported missing to the Glaswegian Police by the Home Office after numerous failed attempts by Immigration Enforcement Officers to locate her and have her and her family deported. The Foundation was alerted and Field Agents took over the investigation, taking Nadiya's family into their care and designating Nadiya as PoI-6988. According to PoI-6988's father, during their time avoiding the police, PoI-6988 had experienced trouble sleeping and had been complaining about a "reoccurring dream".</p>
<p>On 12/03/2000, several witnesses in Lamlash, Scotland claimed they saw a young woman matching PoI-9688's description "walk into the Sea". Diving teams failed to discover any trace of PoI-6988, however, thaumaturgical analysis did detect slight shifts in thaumactivity around the area. When investigating PoI-6988 movements before her appearance at Lamlash, a witness came forward claiming she'd given a woman of similar description a lift to Dunchraigaig Cairn in Kilmartin, Lochgilphead.</p>
<p>During and following their investigation of PoI-6988's movements, 19 other individuals subjected to SCP-6916 also were reported missing, with many of them disappearing after visiting a historical site. One subject, PoI-7012 ("Jago Marsh"), was caught on a security camera at Land's End. During the footage, PoI-7012's fiancée and mother attempted to rescue PoI-7012 from the sea edge, only for PoI-7012 to refuse their offer and apologies. PoI-7012 then walked across the surface of the sea as the waves around him grew in size and power, eventually engulfing him.</p>
<p>On 28/03/2000, reports came of an individual, later identified as Ethan Rogers and designated PoI-7028, attempting to access <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4911">SCP-4911</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. When interviewed, PoI-7028 that they were following a dream they had been experiencing over the past months and they had been drawn to SCP-4911. To better understand the connection between SCP-6916's subject's interest in historical locations and their later disappearances, Dr. Dafydd proposed allowing PoI-7028 access to SCP-4911 under Foundation analysis. This request was approved by Site Command.</p>
<p>When subjected to SCP-4911 mnestic properties, the thaumactivity within PoI-7028 increased and the plinth atop SCP-4911 was momentarily lit with a white flame. Following this, PoI-7028 requested to be taken to the coast, to which the Foundation took him to Dams Bay, The Vale of Glamorgan. Upon arriving, the thaumactivity in the surrounding area increased and PoI-7028 claimed they could see a causeway made of stone leading to an island in the distance, matching that he'd seen in his dream. Upon seeing the island, PoI-7028 attempted to escape Foundation custody only to be caught, tranquilised and subjected to amnestic and oneirological treatment.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 6916.3: Exploration of SCP-6916-A</strong></p>
<p>Through joint analysis by the Department of Thaumaturgy, Department of Oneirology Studies, and Department of Extradimensional Studies, the Foundation theorised that the experience of both SCP-6916 and interaction with historical Celtic sites acted as a Newman-Hyatt Key<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>. When enacted at the coast of the British Isles, the Key allows access to an extradimensional space, of unknown size, designated as SCP-6916-A. According to the enactors, within SCP-6916-A is an island, accessible by a stone causeway.</p>
<p>Despite the Foundation's best efforts, the number of SCP-6916 subjects continued to climb, with a further 5 subjects entering SCP-6916-A. With the numbers increasing, on 06/04/2000, Director Durrani ordered a joint task force exploration into SCP-6916-A.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword</strong>:<br/>
To complete the NHK criteria, Dr. Dafydd had all of the members of the expedition visit the Grimspound ruins, the nearest historical Celtic site to Site-12. Following this, the team were dispatched to Cellar Beach, Plymouth to access SCP-6916-A.</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong>:<br/>
Members of MTF-Beta-777, along with Dr. Dafydd and Agent Caradog, will access SCP-6916-A and gather intelligence about its nature and relation with SCP-6916.</p>

<p><em>(Members approach the intertidal zone. The causeway and island are seen.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> So, that's the island? Looks just as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Eh, smaller than I thought it would be.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Right boyos. Let's be off.</p>
<p><em>(Members walk along the causeway. As they approach the island, the sky darkens slightly and it begins to rain lightly, with thunder heard in the distance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> What time was it back at home?</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> About 13:15, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Whilst here it's almost dusk. Either time's all muddled up here or something up with the sky. Tomos, getting anything, bach?</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> There is some thaumaturgic here. It's old but powerful. Zach? How're our heads?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Nothing's yet, besides the Knock. Something here though. Like a -</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Sir, look!</p>
<p><em>(In the sky, a number of birds can be seen flying around the island.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> So there's life here?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Not quite. Look again. Look at the edges.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> <em>(gasps)</em> They're ghosts!</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Ghost birds. That's new. Well, not really.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Stay focused, please. We're getting nearer.</p>
<p><em>(The group continue walking along the pathway, approaching the islands shoreline.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Oh, do you feel that? The static of thaumaturgy is strong here. This is going to be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> <em>(points towards the island's hinterland)</em> Sir, something's moving up there.</p>
<p><em>(The group remain still for a few seconds. No movement is noticed.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> What was it?</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> Don't know. Something white and furry.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Alright, keep an eye out.</p>
<p><em>(The group reach the beach, which is pebbled. As they settle down, a light rain begins to fall.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Thank god we're waterproof.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> This rain. It's -</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Salty. It's seawater.</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> Sir. Look here!</p>
<p><em>(Urban draws the rest of the group towards a large wooden mass partial buried in the pebbles.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> A boat. Hard to say what kind and how big but, look at the craftsmanship and style, I'd say mid or late-19th century.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> It looks in good shape.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I think the time here has maintained it somehow. Or something's kept it like this for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> I'm getting strong thaumaturgic readings from it. Somewhere in the centre.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Anything threatening?</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> Not getting anything.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> OK, Tomos, hop on board and have a poke around. Zach, Siw, up the hill.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Sir.</p>
<p><em>(Wilson takes Dafydd and Caradog up the hillside while Urban begins excavating the shipwreck. The three reach the hillside and arrive at a large expanse of hinterland with hills and forests in the distance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Right, hills or trees?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Trees.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> <em>(nods)</em></p>
<p><em>(The three walk towards the forest. After 2 minutes, Wilson speaks.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Zach, I know I'm not - 'sensitive' like you but - I can't help -</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You're right. There is something watching us.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Don't worry. Whatever it is, it's only observing. Believe me, I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Do you know where it is?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> No. Funny, it's like it's all around us rather than in one place. I'd even say -</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(trips and yells loudly)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Sir!</p>
<p><em>(Caradog and Dafydd run over to Wilson.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> I'm fine. I'm fine. Don't fuss. Don't -</p>
<p><em>(Wilson separates the grass to see he's tripped over the remains of a skeleton.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> My, my.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Zach, verdict.</p>
<p><em>(Dafydd pick up one of the bones and examines it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> It's hominid. I don't know which one yet. If I -</p>
<p><em>(Dafydd's winces in anger and pain. He then throws the bone back down, disgusted.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Oh, God. It's a Aos Sí<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> The things from -</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(puts a hand over Caradog's mouth)</em> Don't. Remember what happens when we talk about <span style="color: green"><strong>where they come from</strong></span>. What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> It's been stabbed. Violently, too. Multiple times and in different places. And whatever did it was powerful. The bones scorched around the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> I wonder if there are more? Is this another -</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(Pulls Dafydd and Caradog down to the ground)</em> Get down.</p>
<p><em>(Near the forest, a large canine entity can be seen emerging. It looks around the clearing for a few minutes before running off towards the hills.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> <em>(whispers)</em> Do you think that's what Tomos saw?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Possibly. Did you notice it too?</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> The wobbling around the edges, yes. Just like the birds.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Keep your wits about you, you two. Living threats are one thing, but spectral ones are another. Come on.</p>
<p><em>(The three continue towards the forest. A further 6 skeletal remains of Aos Sí individuals, all with deep gashes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Some of them look like they've been crushed. What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> The grass has claimed them so, it must have been a while ago.</p>
<p><em>(The group reach the edge of the forest.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Eyes peeled. I'm not having any bwci-bo's jumping out at us. Siwan, can you take some samples of the wildlife?</p>
<p><em>(Caradog cuts off some bark from the trees. The three then enter the forest. After 3 minutes, they arrive at a ruined settlement, consisting of around 14 small and 1 large house, overgrown with wildlife.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(Examines a house's wall)</em> Interesting. Zach. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> They're old. Drystack technique?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Correct. Not just old. Ancient. Bronze or Iron Age I'd say. And you feel that? Something big happened here. The Akiva coming off them is strong, but something here is stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Is it just me or do the trees look odd?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I don't know. Their shape is just - all wrong. They're positioned at odd angles.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Guys, look at this!</p>
<p><em>(Wilson and Dafydd join Caradog behind the largest ruin. In a clearing, a single tree is planted, resembling an Alder tree. The tree's leafage is deep red and its surface is metallic and coloured silver. A few meters away, on slate plinths, seven males and two females, are laid out. One male is wearing a green military tunic while the rest are wearing furs and silver armour. In their crossed hands, they hold a silver branch and an amber stone is placed on their chest. The group approach the plinth and tree.)</em></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Are they -</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Yes. They're dead. No recently thought. If the surroundings are anything to go by, they've been dead for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Perfectly preserved? Thaumaturgy?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Oh, yeah. Lots. Weirdly, nothing from that.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(points at tree)</em> The force is all shifted and direct around that. Like a magnet but for magic, going in and out in perfect flow.</p>
<p><em>(Caradog and Dafydd approach the tree. Both reach out and touch its trunk and branches.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> It feels real.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> <em>(snaps off a small branch)</em> It is real. Look, the fibres fray just like a common branch. But it's metallic all the way through. And -</p>
<p><em>(Dafydd winces in pain as he touches the branch with his bare skin, forcing him to drop the twig. A slight rash forms on Dafydd's finger where they handled the fibres)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> You OK?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I'm fine! It's - it's iron. The tree is made of iron.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> But it's grown.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> <em>(whispers)</em> The silver forest was shaking and was filled with screams.</p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> <em>(picks up branch and samples it)</em> Anything on those bodies, Sir?</p>
<p><em>(Dafydd and Caradog rejoin Wilson by the bodies.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(hand placed on one of the male corpses' head)</em> Funny. Besides the thaumaturgy keeping them preserved, there is nothing else. At least, nothing that's active. All of them, including fancy pants, have some thaumaturgic imprints. My guess is they had some capabilities before they died.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Any idea which ones?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> <em>(shakes head)</em> The print is too faded. <em>(Points at two adjacent male corpses)</em> Those three are clearly Brasil lot.</p>

<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> <em>(stands by the military man)</em> What about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> He's got more of a shape. The print is still too faded, but it's stronger than the others.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> And one of ours.</p>

<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> So, they did reach here.</p>
<p><em>(Wilson removes the ring and takes samples of hair from each corpse.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Caradog:</strong> Sir. There's something moving out there.</p>
<p><em>(For the forest, sounds of movement can be heard. The rain also grows heavier, with the sky darkening further and the thunder claps growing more frequent.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wilson:</strong> Hills. Now.</p>

<p>Captain Willson and his group were rediscovered at Cullykhan Beach, Pennan, Scotland, 9 hours after entering SCP-6916-A. All were drenched in seawater and experiencing moderate hypothermia. Wilson, Urban and Caradog were found unconscious and recovered a few hours later after receiving medical attention. Dafydd, however, was discovered undergoing prolonged REM sleep and could not be awakened until 3 days following his recovery.</p>
<p>Testing revealed that the DNA sequence found on the ring belonged to Brigadier Emyr Ab Ifan, with photographic evidence confirming this. Supplies recovered from the ship by Urban confirmed that the vassal was the Arausio, a clipper used by GoI-ω-008. No bodies were discovered on the ship.</p>
<p>The crowned man witnessed by the team was confirmed to be the same man they'd witnessed during SCP-6916. Wilson also revealed that the man and the island were thaumaturgically linked somehow, implying the atmospheric and temporal alterations experienced by the team were their doing. As a result, they were classified as SCP-6916-B and the spectral entities inhabiting SCP-6916-A were classified as SCP-6916-C.</p>
<p>Analysis of the metallic branch by the Department of Chemistry and the Botany Division confirmed that the branch's DNA sequence was similar to that of <em>Alnus glutinosa</em>. They also discovered that the branch's xylem tissue was heavy with iron and silver particles. Despite being malleable upon removal, the branch's flexibility and durability shifted dramatically during its study, with its properties now replicating that of steel. Analysis of the branch is still ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6916.4: Interview with SCP-6916-B</strong></p>
<p>3 days following his expedition into SCP-6916-A, Dr. Dafydd awoke from his REM sleep state and immediately requested the use of an oneirosensory visualization recording device<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup>, claiming he had communicated with SCP-6916-B prior to his expulsion from SCP-6916-A and vital information regarding the history and events occurring with SCP-6916-A.

</div>
<br/>
<strong>Date of recording:</strong> 11/04/2000<br/>
<strong>Participant:</strong> Dr. Zachary Dafydd, Researcher for the Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology, Site-12<br/>
<strong>Operational Directive:</strong> Recorded Dr. Dafydd's negotiations with SCP-6916-B during the of exploration of SCP-6916-A
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Dafydd was able to apply oneiric hypnotherapy and mnestics techniques to himself in order to remember his conversation with SCP-6916-B during his exploration, allowing it to be recorded later.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>- Begin Log -</strong></p>
<p><em>(Initial view is the same as the near-end of the exploration log, with Wilson, Caradog and Dafydd surrounded by instances of SCP-6916-C and SCP-6916-B.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(points at group)</em> <span style="color: #009f6b">Hir yw'r dydd a hir yw'r nos, a hir yw aros.</span></p>
<p><em>(Wilson and Caradog fall unconscious. However, Dafydd is able to remain awake and despite stumbling, remains standing. SCP-6916-B appears surprised.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> That's not going to work on me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <span style="color: #009f6b">Shwt -</span></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> <span style="color: #009f6b">Nid chi yw'r unig swynwr yma.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>(Note: Dafydd and SCP-6916-B communicate in Brythonic through their discussion. It has been translated from this point on.)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You speak the father's tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> And many others. And I do not appreciate being pushed aside like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You dare speak to me like -</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You attempted to harm me and my party. I shall speak to you how I see fit.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B approaches Dafydd, eyeing him up. The SCP-6916-C entities relax their stance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You people are - different to the others.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Others? The people who came here? Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> When they came, they walked timorously. Unsure. Afraid. You - you walked with command. Directive. I am impressed. I haven't seen courage like that since my manumission.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You were imprisoned?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> For many lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> And you were freed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(Pauses)</em> The others were less talkative. Are you people full of questions?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> How about this? Answer for an answer. I ask something, you provide me with the most honest response you can. In turn, I shall do the same to your questions. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Do I get to go first?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(Pauses)</em> Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Me and my collages are representatives of an organisation known as - the Foundation. We - try and - protect humanity from the greater dangers of our world.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> How noble. That is quite a task. Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> My, what a question. The answer is quite a story. I wouldn't know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> We have time. And I've always liked a good story.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B gestures for Dafydd to sit on a ruined wall. The SCP-6916-C instances stand guard around SCP-6916-B.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> This land. This island. My island is all that is left of a proud conglomeration. A collective that spanned all of Albion. A collective founded on skills, determination and pride. Oh, if only we had had the chance. We could have done so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You were proud of your empire?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> We weren't an empire! I and others ruled, true, but we did not stand above our fellow brothers and sons! But, yes, we were proud of what we were. Maybe that's why we fell so painfully. <em>(Pauses)</em> Our community was powerful. We could do things with magic others could only dream of. My presence here is an example of our power over the line between life and death. But we weren't alone. To the west, we had rivals. Equally powerful. Equally proud.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> The Tuatha Dé Danann.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You know of them?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Some are still around.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(laughs annoyedly)</em> They survived. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. They were always good at hiding and twisting the fates.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You should see them now. They're not exactly in the best situation. Were you enemies?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Maybe, deep down, but on the surface, we were rivals. Both of us were always jealous of each other. Us, envious of their influence over fortune, the skies and their bodies. Them, covetous of our finesse in metalwork, agriculture and mediumship. It was unhealth but - it worked.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> What changed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> I believe you owe me an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Go on then.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Are you proud of where you come from?</p>
<p><em>(Pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> In this line of work, attachments are - dangerous things to form. I will say, however, I value where I come from. So, maybe, in a way, yes, I am proud of where I came from.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(smiles)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> What changed between your people and the Tuatha?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> I have often contemplated how that happened. All I know is that as soon as it started, it grew quickly and led to tensions between us. Fear grew like a weed. Everything became about displaying power. Eventually, the idea of war crept into our minds. As new enemies from the east and north had started to appear, war was not something either of us wanted.</p>
<p>Our only hope was a union of sorts. So plans were made for their prince to wed one of our most powerful ladies and at the ceremony, both of us exchanged a treasure. They taught us to influence our skies and we gave them means of uniting living and dead. We believe such a union would strengthen us. But it brought nothing but misery. The whispers continued and then came the attacks and murders. And finally, when word came that our lady had faced abuse and torture at the hands of the prince's family, our fates were decided.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> War.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> It was a blood bath that lasted years. Both of us held nothing back. Curses were cast. Fortresses erected. Monsters were bred. Many men and beasts, both living and departed, were lost, or worse. And then, it all came here. To my island. So many were lost in that battle. And then -</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B begins to weep angrily. The SCP-6916-C respond by growling and pounding the ground.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> They came.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B looks at Dafydd.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> The Gwyllion!</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> And that's when it all came out! The truth! The shameful truth! As we quarrelled and built, they snuck and whispered! Posing as our brothers and feeding our bloodlust! It had all been a game! All this time! A great game! To weaken us! To degrade us! To claim our lands after we'd reduce them to dust! Those vile creatures!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B slams his fist on to the stone, which cracks.)</em></p>
<p>We tried to act but by then it was too late. They had most of our land, fortresses and arms under their control. There was nothing we could do. I watched as they made my forest walk and hunt my people. We begged them to stop but they only laughed. They enjoyed it you see. After the forests walked, they pulled my land out of the world and sealed it within this realm. Some of my men escaped, as did some Tuatha, but most of us, including myself and the prince, were captured and brought to the Gwyllion king.</p>
<p>We begged the king to spare our people. He merely laughed. He had what he wanted. With that, he had the prince imprisoned and transported and had me chained and muzzled, locked to my island. Forced into enslavement. Forced to bend my kingdom into his sick image. Forced to watch my magic be used to turn people into beasts and abominations.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B puts their head in their arms.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I'm - I'm so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> With our community in ruin, I watched as they used my island to experiment, plan and manipulate. As they did so, I felt my people grew weaker and simpler and not long after, Albion was invaded again and again. And with each invasion, our history, our culture, and our work vanished. So much was lost.</p>
<p><em>(One of SCP-6916-C rests it's head on SCP-6916-B lap.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You've met the Gwyllion. I saw it in your eyes when you handled their bones. A disgust. A scar beyond just the skin. Tell me, how did you meet them?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Before I joined the Foundation, I lived in the Library along with a group of people I wrongfully considered family. One day, some of us attempted <a href="/a-dreaming-giant-s-chair">something</a>. A ritual. I - it went wrong. It turned out, just like you, I'd been tricked by someone. Someone from <span style="color: green"><strong>somewhere very fair away</strong></span>. They interrupted the casting, damaging my mind. In the process, many people, including he who <span style="color: green"><strong>came from over there</strong></span> were lost and I was left hurt - and changed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Cruel, aren't they?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> How did you escape?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Oh, that. My, that was satisfying. As you know, the Gwyllion had cut this land apart from the world, sealing it within this realm and closing it off with powerful boundaries. For centuries, I had attempted to breach them but I was weak. Then many years ago, something occurred. Something outside this realm. I don't know what but whatever it was, made the Gwyllion scared. That, I had never seen before. And this force caused a fissure to form in the boundaries. Just big enough for a message to get through. So, I reached out and called.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> And an answer came.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> The soldiers. Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> These men had power. New power. Refined power. And each of them possessed the same spirit my brothers and sons had long ago. A pride and love my people once had I long thought dead. The Gwyllion tried to fight back but their power had waned. Eventually, after many deaths, they freed me. And free at last, I gave them terror. I pulled on the boundaries between life and death and made them face the sins they'd indulged in. The king, who'd dared to mock me, fled like a coward along with his court. His subjects, the usurpers, I slaughtered. I hate to say it, but their screams were glorious noise. My island was mine once more. Broken, but mine.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Well that explains a bit.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> Now, I ask you. Will you join us?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> The Gwyllion. This place is only one of many of their hiding places. Your curse is further proof that they're out there. They have held us back for millennia. They must be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Hang on just a moment. You're planning to - That's what the dream is. It's not a distress call. It's a call to arms. You want to fight them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> And you and your organisation have come. You've seen what they have done to us. Confined us to cages. Prevented us from reaching our true potential. Not just in Alboin. I know kingdoms and communities exist beyond the seas. They too must have faced the refinement of those creatures. It is time we took back what they had no right to take from us. Our true potential. Join us.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B offers Dafydd a hand.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You hesitate, brother.</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You want war. A war with creatures we have fought for thousands of years. A war that would cause unimaginable shifts, thaumaturgically, geopolitically and potentially biologically. I - I - can't allow you to do that.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B withdraws their hand. The SCP-6916-C entities begin prowling again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> With all due respect, I am a king of this land. I am not like the Tuatha. I will not hide behind <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7010">wards</a>. I will do what I see fit. Where is your pride? You said your organisation defended humanity. Why do you instant on continuing this confinement and squandering? Why do you protect this - vail?</p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Because the world has grown so much since you were imprisoned. Your war with the Tuatha and - Gwyllion was nothing compared to what happened after. We've had battles that spanned entire realms of existence and have only just started to recover from them. We don't want that. I'm not confining humanity. I am protecting it. And if you think you can start a war just -</p>
<p><em>(Dafydd looks SCP-6916-B in the eye.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> Where are the people who came here?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-6916-B continues to look at Dafydd.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> You've already started the war, haven't you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> You would have done such good, brother. And out of respect, I shall let you go with a warning. Stay out of our way. You and your - Foundation.</p>
<p><em>(The rain grows heavier, cause a flash flood. The thunder, howling and bells grow in frequency. SCP-6916-B and the SCP-6916-C entities move to high ground. Dafydd pulls Wilson and Caradog out of the floodwater.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dafydd:</strong> What is this place?! Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> The Tuatha called this Tír na nÓg. The Gwyllion called this Avalon. We - called it Annwn, its true name. And I am Arawn, lord of the dead and king of this land.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6916-B:</strong> <em>(points at Dafydd)</em> <span style="color: #009f6b">Hir yw'r dydd a hir yw'r nos, a hir yw aros!</span></p>

<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Upon completing the recording, Dr. Dafydd proceeded to vomit small quantities of seawater over the next 30 minutes. He refused any treatment and requested to speak with the site director and the Department Of Mythology And Folkloristics as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6916.5: Redesignation and Revised Containment</strong></p>
<p>With the information provided by Dr. Dafydd, the Foundation reassessed their containment procedures for SCP-6916. The island within SCP-6916-A has been given a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-02">Nexus</a> designation due to its historical significance and potential threat towards the anomalous community.</p>

<p><strong>Nexus #:</strong> Nx-02</p>
<p><strong>Civilian Designation:</strong> Annwn <em>(Formerly Avalon)</em></p>
<p><strong>Population:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p><strong>Area Class:</strong> Camelot</p>
<p><strong>Nexus Interaction Protocol:</strong> To prevent the public's access to Nx-02, the Foundation is continuing its containment procedures regarding SCP-6916, with the addition of detecting departures from Nx-02. If individual/s successfully access Nx-02, they are to be retrieved as soon as possible and subjected to interview and amnestic and oneirological treatment.</p>
<p>Access and traversal into Nx-02 by Foundation personnel is to remain a high priority, to prevent an LV-Zero "Lifted Veil" scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Containment Facility:</strong> Site-12</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Nx-02 is an island located within the partially, extradimensional space known as SCP-6916-A. Nx-02 is accessible from any coastline within the British Isle and Northern France. To date, the only known way of accessing Nx-02 is to apply an NHK, following subjection to SCP-6916. However, this access can be revoked. Those who attempt to reach Nx-02 with revoked access will be subject to translocation and be redirected back to the point of perpetration.</p>
<p>Nx-02 is home to several spectral entities, including SCP-6916-B, who is capable of numerous thaumaturgical workings, including atmomancy, necromancy and oneiromancy. Due to their revoked access, it is believed SCP-6916-B is actively disengaged with the Foundation. However, recent evidence suggests Nx-02 may be open to other Groups of Interest. Research is ongoing.</p>
<p>Due to having revoked access, the history of Nx-02 is mostly unknown, with only the statements made by SCP-6916-B providing any insights. Nevertheless, historical records were able to provide some details.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since enacting more focused and stringent containment procedures, individuals lost to SCP-6916-A have decreased, with only 57 SCP-6916 subjects managing to evade Foundation protocol. However, with the sudden increase in nationalism in the Celtic regions, subjection to SCP-6916 is predicted to increase within the next year.</p>

<p><strong>To:</strong> Director Vidya Durrani<br/>
<strong>From:</strong> Dr. Zachary Dafydd<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Update on SCP-6916</p>
</div>
<p>Good Evening Durrani,</p>
<p>I hate to bother you at such a late time but some news regarding SCP-6916 has come to my attention. Please see below:</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This footage was passed on by an undercover Foundation Agent within GoI-006 ("Unusual Incidents Unit") following a murder investigation at Cillian's Apothecary in FP-01 ("Three Portlands").</p>
<hr/>
<p>Security footage shows Ahern, a Aos Sí phytotherapist, working when the two hooded individuals break in through the backdoor. Ahern attempts to apprehend them using chlorokinetic techniques but is restrained in a headlock by an unseen, third individual. As Ahern struggle against the invisible individual, the hooded individuals remove their hoods, revealing one to be PoI-6988.</p>
<p>The pair appear to threaten and question Ahern, who merely angrily denies their questions and at one point, spits on PoI-6988. After a few minutes, the other hooded individual holds up Ahern with a metallic gauntlet. Blisters begin to form on Ahern's skin where the metal touches it, and their wings burst from their clothes and begin to shed. PoI-6988 then points at Ahern's chest and whispers something. Ahern's body then goes rigid and a tree begins to grow around their body. The tree stops growing, leaving only Ahern's eyes, left ear and right fingers exposed. PoI-6988 then carves a symbol resembling a Triskelion in the base, before leaving with the others. Ahern expired 10 minutes later.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> When the Department of Spectral Phenomena applied thaumaturgical, ectographical techniques to the footage, the third individual was revealed to be a spectral entity. The symbol carved by PoI-6988 has begun to show in various locations worldwide, most notably in the Free Ports and in human subspecies habitats.</p>
</div>
<p>As well as the appearance of this group, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-184">184</a>, 322, 96 and <a href="http://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-57-hub">57</a> have come in contact. 4 further 6916 subjects have gone missing. However, Logistics and Transportation checked and confirmed they never left their home countries and states (Pennsylvania, Nova Scotia, Falkland Islands). This can only mean one thing. SCP-6916-A is extending its borders.</p>
<p>Also, Project Signal-Man have reported spikes in spectral entities and activities within the UK again. Mostly around the coast. They don't last long. Only a few seconds but there nonetheless.</p>
<p>Given these changes, I believe we should change SCP-6916 to a Red classification and have it redesignated as Keter as soon as possible. I can't help feeling there is something big coming.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p><em>Zachary Dafydd, PhD</em><br/>
