<p>Photo was presumably sent by SCP-5582 shortly after its third containment breach</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5582 is to be contained on sight. Every containment facility is to have at least one untested containment plan for SCP-5582 prepared at all times. Until permanent containment is deemed successful, the continued recapture of SCP-5582 under new conditions is intended to serve as a substitute for real containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5582 is a three-year-old common octopus<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, capable of surviving an indefinite amount of time without water. SCP-5582 is sapient and has advanced problem-solving skills. SCP-5582 could not be subjected to any test in this regard, due to its constant containment breaches, but to date, SCP-5582 was able to solve any logical problem encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Foundation became aware of SCP-5582 through multiple reports of a bank heist involving an octopus. Agents were dispatched to the scene and found SCP-5582 lurking in the immediate vicinity. SCP-5582 was apprehended and brought to Site-17 but was able to crawl out of the containment vehicle before its arrival due to the lack of octopus-specific restraints.</p>
<p>SCP-5582 was again found a few weeks later observing Site-17. When Agents were again dispatched to apprehend SCP-5582, they were unable to find it. It is estimated that SCP-5582 infiltrated Site-17 prior to being noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Interview-Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-5582</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Researcher Mellow</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>This interview was conducted after SCP-5582 showed up at the front entrance of Site-23. SCP-5582 used the stones of its provisional containment aquarium to write its answers.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, skip to 05:34&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Up to this point SCP-5582 had only been placing its stones at random.</em></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> I don't see why you even requested an interview if you refuse to answer.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">Took you long enough to notice. Don't worry, I was listening.</span> <em>(SCP-5582 looks directly at Junior Researcher Mellow)</em> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">Yeah, you’ll do it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> Me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">What? No. You young people are always so self-centred. I mean all of you, obviously.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> And what exactly is it you want from us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">You'll get it eventually.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> Then will you answer why you took part in the heist?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">Why does anyone rob a bank? For myself, obviously.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> Then why did you willingly let yourself be contained?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">Also for me.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> You're not making any sense.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">You’ll understand it when you’re a little older.</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> I really don't think so? What do you get from letting yourself be contained?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">No</span></p>
<p><strong>Junior Researcher Mellow:</strong> No?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5582:</strong> <em>(it tips its head with one of its arms)</em> <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt">No stagnation.</span></p>
<p><em>SCP-5582 refused to communicate any further.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> <em>SCP-5582 breached containment shortly after the interview concluded. It was discovered that stones were disrupting the function of its cell door locking mechanism.</em></p>
</div>
<p>3 days after this breach, Junior Researcher Mellow received an anonymous message titled "Before you do it" containing a picture of SCP-5582.</p>
<p><strong>Further notable incidents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-5582 was contained in Site-11 in a standard containment cell with a more complex locking mechanism. SCP-5582 was able to escape through the ventilation system with the help of a previously half-swallowed screwdriver.</li>
<li>Site-66 constructed a special cell for SCP-5582, that made an escape through life-supporting systems like ventilation and drainage impossible. SCP-5582 escaped through bribing a now-former junior researcher with its stolen money to aid in its containment breach.</li>
<li>SCP-5582 was captured by Site-06-3 from a local aquarium. Containment was planned to include several logic puzzles, but the octopus was found to be non-anomalous. On the same day, Site-06-3 Staff received an anonymous message titled "Already solved" containing the solutions to all logic puzzles.</li>
<li>During its stay at Site-19, SCP-5582 was informed of the existence of other sapient cephalopods in containment. SCP-5582 agreed to a meeting but fled during <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-siege-of-site-19" target="_blank" target="_blank">the siege of Site-19</a>. The following message was received afterwards:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What, you want me to socialize at this age? Weird thing to ask a three-year-old. Still tempting, but I wished you’d have asked me when I wasn’t crawling on my last arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day, SCP-5582 was spotted in front of the containment tank of <a href="scp-2967.html">SCP-2967</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> by surveillance cameras. They both communicated through an unknown sign language for about an hour after which SCP-5582 escaped before the footage was noticed. The following message was received afterwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nah, I’m good.</p>
</blockquote>
