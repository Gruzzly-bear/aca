            <h1>SCP-3947</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3947</p>
<p><strong>Object Class: Euclid</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3947 instances are to be kept in a bathtub housed inside a large-size high-value containment chamber at Site-88. Requests for money, decoration, or bath toys are to be granted as long as the items will not result in an increased risk of a containment breach.</p>
<p>Staff assigned to SCP-3947 are to have a good understanding of and fondness for slapstick comedy. Task Force Omega-16, "That's all, Folks!" is to be present onsite at all times to prevent escape attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3947 is a collection of 5 rubber duck bath toys. Each SCP-3947 instance possesses a unique design. SCP-3947 instances are sentient and capable of human-like vocalizations in exaggerated accents.</p>
<p>SCP-3947 instances can produce objects commonly used in slapstick cartoons such as frying pans, boxing gloves, and anvils. On several occasions, SCP-3947 instances have shown the ability to temporarily alter their shape, gaining limbs or transforming into objects such as miniature boats or bombs. SCP-3947 instances are capable of using any produced items regardless of size or weight.</p>
<p>Persons or objects subject to violence from SCP-3947 instances suffer no permanent harm. The instances themselves similarly will suffer no permanent damage from the actions of others. In both cases, the affected individuals will suffer painful but not debilitating damage, often involving stretching or large lumps that heal very quickly.</p>
<p>SCP-3947 instances often attempt to escape their chamber in order to commit acts such as theft or assault. No attempt to escape the facility itself has been attempted by SCP-3947 instances.</p>
<p>SCP-3947 instances enjoy smoking cigarettes which is the item they most frequently manifest. SCP-3947 instances have a marked hatred of people who openly express a dislike of slapstick comedy. Instances will actively attempt to steal from and attack such individuals whilst repeatedly insulting them.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Carver:</strong> No motive to speak of at all? Not even greed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3947-1:</strong> Aw Christ, more of dis mumbo jumbo! Y'know, back in the day, stuff was simple. Us villains didn't need no stinkin' 'motives' or whatever! We did it cause we were dah bad guys! Not everyone has a complex backstory. You want me ta blab on-and-on about how we were created by something-or-other or just accept that some things exist for da simple pleasures!</p>
