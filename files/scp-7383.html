<p>"Allegorical Effluence" describes the presence of surrealistic traces in Baseline Reality. These can only be perceived, extracted, and exposed by newly aligned rational paradigms or trained AIs. Such traces only occur when a person is under the influence of agnostics or possesses an aligned paradigm.</p>
<p>Allegorical Effluence is less precise than direct communication and should be considered residue of actions, emotions, and thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT:</strong> <em>Following the aforementioned message, Site-[Redacted] promptly dispatched a lightly armed response team comprising three agents to assess the situation at BO-2. The team arrived within 2 hours.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>"[…] We reached the specified address without difficulty. It's a quiet area, so we didn't anticipate any issues from residents. Following protocol, we disguised ourselves as plumbers. […] Leaving the vehicle parked, we proceeded directly to the house entrance. No anomalies were observed in the immediate vicinity. Upon inspection, we found the door to be locked, and the doorbell appeared non-functional.</p>
<p>However, we noticed that the mailbox was filled with shredded black paper. We contemplated the risk of forced entry, but before retrieving the necessary equipment from the vehicle, we received a radio transmission from Site-⌘. After confirming credentials, we were instructed to immediately abort. I consulted with Site [Redacted], and the order was confirmed. […]</p>
<p>Next, we were ordered to stand down and await the arrival of a specialized surrealistics team. They arrived about three hours later and dimissed us from the scene."</p>

<p><strong>ANALYSIS:</strong> When you put two different colonies of ants in a jar, they might coexist in peace. But if you shake the glass, they will destroy each other. They never stop to wonder whose hand shook the jar in the first place. What if that hand breaks the glass? Can ants negotiate?</p>

<hr/>
<p>On the same day the above form was submitted to Site-19, the Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration reported the unauthorized creation of an SCP dossier - this dossier. An investigation revealed that the origin of the file traced back to BO-2. Access to the SCP database should not have been possible from there. Nevertheless, the file contained containment procedures and descriptions attributing BO-2 as an anomaly. The contents of the already dispatched letters were also present in digitized form within the file. Automatic filters detected the presence of cognitohazards.</p>
<p>Since no further assistance was expected from Site-⌘ due to its presumed refusal and the surrealistic nature of its responsibilities, RAISA decided to activate MAGNA.AIC to manage this dossier. A debate has been requested by the Overseer Council to discuss the handling of a suspected surrealistic SCP without the support of Site-⌘.</p>
<p>Additionally, a guard was stationed before BO-2.</p>

<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [Groans louder] No, that would be in violation of article 42. You suggested that one. It's your goddamn face in there.</p>

<p>a. That classified information about the Department of Surrealistics and the SCP-Foundation is not to be divulged for the duration of the treaty.</p>
<p>i. This includes temporal loops, other realms of enlightenment and me.<br/>
ii. This excludes pre-destination paradoxes that allowed the contract to come into existence.<br/>
iii. Obliteration does not exempt from these obligations.<br/>
iv. Reincarnation does not exempt from these obligations, exestential, all-consuming <strong>p a i n</strong> nonwithstanding.</p>

<p><strong>8. Enforcement of treaty</strong></p>
<p>a. If – according to the metaphysical part of paragraph 2 minus 3 – this treaty should be made by an entity with themselves, this entity is to be divided by π.</p>
<p>i. The Department principally does not bear the costs of the subsequent cleanup.<br/>
ii. π is to be compensated for the expenditure with a root.</p>

<p><strong>ANALYSIS:</strong> When ants are attacked, they can emit pheromones and call for help. If an ant is drowning, can it do the same? Ants and termites sometimes build borders when they live close together. Safe and stable borders. Why shouldn't ants in the glass be able to do the same with the fiery oils on the crossed hands?</p>
<p>Ants lay eggs. They certainly don't like weak points. Is it then unbelievably foolish to possess an eggshell weak point inducer when nervous hands are nearby? Or unbelievably smart?</p>

<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Come. Take a seat. You've been in the closet all day.</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>When a closet hungers, will you beckon the hunger out?</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> You are still allowed to come out of the closet three times per breaking heart. Article 57 and stuff…</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Heroes have hearts to break or hearts that can break. Triangular minds don't.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Do I look like I care?</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Enlightenment kindles a flame in the mind. But it only really ever darkens. Triangles, though, they burn. They have no chance, because you can only swallow them and never think about them, even if you want to. But to have a will, you have to know what you actually want, don't you?</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [Sighs deeply]</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>And once you realize that you are full of flames, you would have been better off taking the enlightenment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Yeah no. I feel alright… I'm able to continue. Don't mind the teeth. Shit happens. I'm a soup fan anyway.</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Enlightenment does more than just sharpen the eyes. It is regular, thoughtful. It sharpens the shackles for all those who are too triangular for it. Look at the cost.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Yeah that's blood. Is it mine? I'm not sure anymore… God I hate the triangles. They are the worst, you know? Yeah no, you probably don't. [Proceeds to shake] My daughter wouldn't have liked them too. Do I have a daughter?</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Names hold special meanings for ants. Did you know that. They recognize each other by them. Say your daughter's name if you want to remember.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> You won't get…</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>A name that clear and simple.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Take your shadow out of my hippocampus.</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>I can see the name, Jacob.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> No. Article 1 does not apply. [Slams a fist on something and yells] That is my memory!</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Triangles don't have memories.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> I said no. I won't say it.</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Names that are not mentioned may be forgotten.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Stop!</p>
<p>[ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>A name for a memory…</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Stop it! That's not her name!</p>

Hands are wondrous things.</p>
<p>Aren't they?</p>
<p>They can do all kinds of things, from the highest art to the deepest destruction. And sometimes you cannot tell the difference between the two. Some might say that there is no difference at all. Hands can squeeze themselves into the smallest of openings when they really want to. And curiosity is the driving force of all hands.</p>
<p>Or would you not turn towards something that suddenly bumps into you from behind?<br/>

Some things are made for hands more than others. Sometimes you know it right from the start, like with a punchable face. It comes instinctively. Sometimes you only feel it when you touch it. As if at a second glance. Like a fidgeting toy. You just want to grab it and knead it. Or take it apart and disembowel it.<br/>

Agnostics do not make good fidgeting toys. However, resting the weight of an entire world on an eggshell breaking point creator, does make it quite an exquisite fidgeting toy for hands beyond the glass.</p>

<strong>EGGSHELL BREAKING POINT CREATOR:</strong> No<br/>
<span style="color:red"><strong>[Comment by MAGNA.AIC]:</strong></span> Received one minute ago. The video does not contain any audio. An automatic translation of Meyer's lip-movements was cancelled due to the presence of cognitohazards.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN VIDEO TRANSCRIPT]</strong></p>
<p>[Janitor Jacob Meyers can be seen as he sits down in front of the camera inside a dark room. He appears to be suffering from fatigue and is bleeding from the nose. He appears to be looking at something off camera for three seconds before speaking.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Eggs are not normally triangular. Breakfasts are not usually triangular. They are still squared, right?</em></p>
<p>[Meyer's rubs his temples.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Triangular hands don't have eggs. Well, for breakfast, maybe. Ants have many eggs, though, even if they are in a jar. They fight for their eggs when they have to. But what if an ant becomes triangular and can see through the glass? Would it see the rolling of the cold beyond, the inverted hands of mirror-smooth space-grasping things? And these hands shake the jar and the ant sees it, it could act.</em></p>
<p>[Meyers holds his face in his hands.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>If an ant knew, it could act. And if it has a heart, it will leave the jar and bind the triangular hands - with more and more silk. The most beautiful and best silk imaginable, complex and meticulous, incomprehensible even to itself. But the silk is triangular. What do squares even feel like at this point? Has there ever been something besides triangles?</em></p>
<p>[Meyers looks to the side again and watches something for nineteen seconds. Then, he faces the camera once more. As he stares, he produces a capsule. It is marked with a green loop square, which indicates it to be a container for Agnostics. The looped square is surrounded by a red triangle.]</p>
<p>[Meyers proceeds to open the capsule slowly and places it on the table before him.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>With ants, drones are responsible for carrying out tasks. They are efficient, precise and fast. They can carry up to forty times their own weight. They do all this for their colony. A square ant that becomes triangular can do much more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>When Humans build a road, it's a complex job. Then they also destroy ants' nests. They don't hate the ants. They may not even know they are there. They just do it, coolly, methodically. It's in the way. But triangular hands are hatefull and [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. So very [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. Yet hate, of all things, leads to intimacy, curiosity and closeness. You want to see what you hate so that you can hate it. And you can grasp and bind what is close to you.</em></p>
<p>[Meyers produces a white object, later identified to be an eggshell breaking point creator, commonly used as kitchen utensil. He places it on the table, next to the capsule. In the background, there [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED].]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>When preparing a breakfast egg, hands can cook it in different ways. Some use an eggshell breaking point creator at the breakfast table. Isn't that a nice memory? Was there a memory of a square breakfast table? Do ants eat breakfast? Maybe… Some ants certainly associate fond memories with eggs! Hands don't. How apt it is then, for something designed to break them to become central to their protection. It makes sense for the triangles at least…</em></p>
<p>[Meyers proceeds to consume a three-sided Agnostic.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: <em>Triangular shapes have never really folded in on themselves. They only ever expand. They might reach the shivering kingdom if your head desires to be the ramification.</em></p>
<p>[He squirms before looking at the camera directly.]</p>
<p><strong>Meyers:</strong> Don't ever tell them. Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>[END VIDEO TRANSCRIPT]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Cross-checking revealed the agnostics in Meyer's possession to be a new generation of agnostics in the testing phase. They are produced in a triangular shape. Why these materials, which have not yet been released for general use, were in BO-2 and in Meyers posession is unknown.</p>
