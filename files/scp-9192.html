<h2 id="toc0"><span><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span></h2>
<p>SCP-9192 is considered low priority as it has not manifested naturally at any point in the past 250 years.</p>
<p>Foundation web-crawlers are to be on constant alert for any possible SCP-9192 events. Sanitation ships are to be immediately deployed to any planet with reports of infection. Altered video reproductions of Incident 63XA2 have been distributed to the public.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h2>
<p>SCP-9192 is an infectious prion disease which systematically deconstructs hosts until all portions have been reduced to smallest possible components. SCP-9192 is primarily transmitted through consumption of material from infected individuals; however, it is possible for misfoldings to trigger SCP-9192 among entities who have come into contact with auditory transmission AVBD13. Currently, it is believed up to 99% of the known universe has been exposed to this signal.</p>
<p>Despite this, there has been only one recorded instance of SCP-9192 triggering without outside intervention.</p>
<p>SCP-9192 infection is characterized by 5 distinct stages of progression. In all cases, SCP-9192 has killed its target. There is no known cure.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Stage</th>
<th>Symptoms</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 1</td>
<td>Throughout Stage 1, infected instances (hereby referred to as SCP-9192-1) lose small amounts of tissue, largely through coughing or sneezing. SCP-9192-1 instances will also typically spit up large amounts of blood. In rare instances, subjects may lose portions of skin, leading to red, fleshy spots concentrated around the neck, hands, and knees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 2</td>
<td>In stage 2, SCP-9192-1 instances begin to display flu-like symptoms such as vomiting or a high fever. They will expel large amounts of blood and bile, often simultaneously surfacing detached stomach lining. During this stage, subjects also become largely unwilling to consume food or nutrients, claiming a persistent feeling of euphoria that prevents them from processing external and internal stimuli. This euphoria becomes overwhelming enough to render any movement or activity difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 3</td>
<td>In stage 3, matter loss becomes significant enough to be visually obvious. Instances themselves appear to be unaware of any abnormal behavior occurring, and will often push back if told to undergo treatment. This is believed to be caused by a heavy loss of brain biomass at this stage, but may also be a result of the virus's inherent properties. Subjects in stage 3 will begin to cough up, vomit, or otherwise leak significant amounts of blood, bile, brain matter, and organ chunks from various orifices. SCP-9192-1 instances will also undergo loss of hair, teeth, and fingernails.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 4</td>
<td>During Stage 4, the body will begin to completely disassemble itself. Bones, eyes, organs, joints, and even limbs will individually tear off the body until the instance has been completely reduced. It is unknown if the subject is still conscious throughout this stage, as the exact nature of the individual consciousness of each bodily portion is heavily debated. Once the subject has been completely separated into smaller individual components, stage 5 will begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage 5</td>
<td>After each component has been detached, they will further separate until they are minimized to the smallest possible base components. Skin will be flayed off and veins will deconstruct until the subject has been reduced to microscopic particles.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>All stages carry a high risk of infection if bodily fluids are consumed or otherwise enter the orifices of people nearby SCP-9192-1 instances. Should any part of completely deconstructed SCP-9192-1 instances enter into the bodies of uninfected individuals, they will become infected. Because of this, it is vital the area around any SCP-9192-1 event is immediately sanitized and nearby people are quarantined to prevent further spread.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span><strong>Archeological discoveries :</strong></span></h2>
<p>On February 5th, 2233, Semi-habitable planet ADS1354 was flagged by Foundations EXPs as containing anomalous material. Further explorations by experienced science teams would reveal a planetary-scale satellite dedicated to broadcasting signal AVBD13 throughout the universe.</p>

<p>The broadcasting satellite</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This signal contained hidden cognitohazardous triggers capable of implanting SCP-9192 in the brains of anyone exposed to the waves. The Foundation was able to conclusively match the contents of the signal to an earlier unexplained event that occurred in 1963.</p>

<p>A copy of the radio signal, with its cognitohazardous triggers removed.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
This satellite was discovered along with a series of documents revealing it was built by the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7192" target="_blank" target="_blank">Agatraki Civilization</a> and detailing the goal of its construction. It appears the device was built shortly before their total disappearance from the timeline and historical record approximately 56 million years ago.</p>

<p>It is believed the above excerpts were referring to US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span><strong>Incident 63XA2</strong></span></h2>
<p>On November 22nd, 1963, JFK would succumb to SCP-9192 and publicly deconstruct during a parade in Texas. This incident would be captured on film by various audience members. This footage has been recovered from Foundation archives in connection with the SCP-9192 signal. A transcription is provided below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The motorcar is seen from the side, slowly driving up the road towards the camera. JFK sits in the backseat. He appears visibly ill. His eyes are sunken and he is slumped over in his seat, pushing his hand up into a wave. A few audience members in the crowd flash concerned looks across their faces.</p>
<p>As the car nears the camera, JFK begins coughing violently. He keels over and rests his head on the front seat. Blood spurts out of his mouth and splatters on the grey leather. He opens his lips to speak, and teeth begin to pour out of his throat. Tears stream down his face, and for a moment he smiles. It dissipates.</p>
<p>He speaks in the midst of a fit of coughs.</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>He slumps back into his seat. blood stains the edges of his lips, which are slowly detaching from his face. They peel away as small sticky strands tear and disappear.</p>
<p>he continues to cry. Audience members try to leave the area. A Foundation agent with a large assault rifle stops them at the quarantine perimeter. He is wearing full body PPE.</p>
<p>"I hope you can understand."</p>
<p>His eyeball begins to bulge.</p>
<p>"I know you can."</p>
<p>JFK once again smiles. This time it remains. He continues to cry.</p>
<p>The crowd sits silent. A man close to the car is seen crying with his hands over his mouth. He collapses to the ground and slumps them in the dirt.</p>
<p>He smiles.</p>
<p>The people near him begin to back away. They remain fixed on the motorcar.</p>
<p>JFK's eye pops out of its socket. It hangs down to his stomach, attached by a thin fleshy thread. He turns to face the crowd.</p>
<p>"It was an easy choice."</p>
<p>His skin begins to stretch away from his body as bones slowly protrude from under his flesh.</p>
<p>His foot tears from his ankle with a loud crack.</p>
<p>"I guess I'm sorry."</p>
<p>In a blink, he is torn apart. In another, he is particles on the seat. In another, he is gone.</p>
<p>Foundation agents grab the camera.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this, records indicate that all witnesses to the event were captured for monitoring and the area was sterilized.</p>
<p>There is no recorded information on the current location of their bio-hazard containers, but they were likely buried during the collapse of Site-132. Recovery efforts are considered a minimal priority.</p>
