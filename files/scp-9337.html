<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> In order to limit abuse of or research into SCP-9337 by external groups, the existence of SCP-9337 has been published in research papers produced by a Foundation front company. The papers in question reference multiple related bacteria, and utilise data manipulated to obfuscate the anomalous properties exhibited by samples of SCP-9337.</p>
<p>In cases where the symptoms of an SCP-9337 infection reaches stage 4, the afflicted individual, henceforth designated SCP-9337-2, is to remain in Foundation custody under direct supervision until stage 5 is reached. During this period, the SCP-9337-2 individual is to undergo daily psychological and emotional evaluation by a Foundation therapist.</p>
<p>Upon an individual reaching stage 5, actions taken must have direct permission from a minimum of four distinct personnel holding Level 4 clearance. Depending on the mental state of the SCP-9337-2 individual after this point, they may be released into the public with an appropriate cover story, or, in cases of favourable symptoms, offered a place as a Foundation researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9337 is a species of bacterium of the genus Streptococcus, with the published species name <em>Streptococcus aduncus</em>. Individuals of SCP-9337 share traits common to all members of the Streptococcus genus, such as the ability to perform natural genetic transformation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, presence in the upper sections of the human respiratory system, and performing cell division along a single axis<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-9337 can be differentiated from other Streptococcus bacteria at a cursory inspection by its primary anomalous characteristic, being that its body contains an organelle, in place of where DNA would be in other related bacteria, that is an exact, albeit smaller, duplicate of the full bacterial body. Due to this duplicate organelle containing another, smaller, organelle with the same properties<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, the structure of SCP-9337's biology becomes recursive. To date, all attempts to find the end of this recursive pattern have remained inconclusive, often due to abandonment of the related project.</p>
<p>Like the majority of Streptococcus bacteria, SCP-9337 is present as a common inhabitant of the human salivary microbiome. Currently, Foundation testing has proved SCP-9337 to be present in approximately 37.22% of the human population, with significantly higher percentages found in areas with extreme conditions, such as deserts, polar regions, and mountainous areas<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>. Individuals carrying samples of SCP-9337 within their body are referred to as SCP-9337-1. In its natural state, SCP-9337 causes no symptoms or measurable effects on the human body. This is considered Stage 1 of the SCP-9337 infection. For the full set of stages and associated symptoms, see Addendum 9337-a.</p>

<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> I'm not really sure. Still working things out. I don't really sleep much.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Do you know why?<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Yeah. 'Cause I can't stop thinking, about everything. My life. Everything I did wrong.<br/>

<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Do you mind if I tell you a story?<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Go ahead.<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Okay. So, back when I was in school, I think I was around 15 when it happened. I was studying for a really big test, the kind of test that seems like it matters a lot in the moment, but then doesn't. I always regarded that test as a waste. So, I didn't revise as much as I should have. I stayed up late, talking to my friends. The next day, I failed it.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> That must have been-<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Not finished. Anyway, I remember walking out of that exam hall, knowing I should have done better. Not that I could have, but that I should have. Like an obligation to myself, that I failed. I said to myself, walking home, that I was going to do better next time.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Did you?<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> No. And looking back on it, I was never going to keep that promise.<br/>
<em>Pause.</em><br/>

<p><strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Yeah, thanks again for talking to me at this time. I would've just said no in your shoes.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Honestly, I almost did. 4 AM, man. Jesus.<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> I'd apologise, but I really want to talk to you about something.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> I'd hope so. What is it?<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Have you ever gone to prison?<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> No.<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> I have. I stole something. Don't even remember what it was, but it was valuable, and my sister said she wanted it. Didn't know what a security camera was.<br/>

<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> It's alright. Keep telling your story.<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Okay. I'd been in prison for about a week at this point. Quit college, even though I was around the top of class. Some guy came up to me, said he recognised me, from this old newspaper about raising money for charity.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> How'd you do it?<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> A hike, I think. The guy started asking questions, about what I did to be there, why someone with "such a promising future" was in such a place. Hearing that, it hurt. Made me think about everything that went wrong. I think there's a name for it.<br/>
<em>Pause.</em><br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> Gifted kid syndrome.<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Why do you think they call it that?<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> What do you mean?<br/>
<strong>Senior Researcher ████████:</strong> Gifted kid syndrome. Like you chose to be "gifted". Like it was something given to you, and you didn't have to think or work or do anything to get it. They just spring that title on people, and then those people think they don't have to work as hard, because they're gifted.<br/>
<strong>Marian Wood:</strong> You seem stressed.<br/>

<blockquote>
<p>I think people should learn to look at themselves. Consider their failings. Perhaps SCP-9337 being so widespread implies hope for our species. That we, eventually, can all learn to accept ourselves. I've failed so many times. I don't even remember most of them. Until last November, I'd never really looked at myself before.<br/>
I'm grateful, I really am. But, I think to myself, must we truly continue to contain SCP-9337? At worst, it is harmless. At best, it teaches you how to live.<br/>
Why do we hide that from the world?<br/>
