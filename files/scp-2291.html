            <h1>SCP-2291</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2291</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2291 is stored in Anomalous Item Locker ECD-2291 in Site 19. As direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is prohibited, only D-Class personnel are authorized to move the item. Research involving SCP-2291 is prohibited without the express permission of Dr. Mbeke or Site-19’s senior administrative staff. Individuals that touch SCP-2291 directly are to be designated SCP-2291-A, administered a Class B amnestic, and placed into confinement for 3 months or until cleared by a supermajority of Site-19's psychiatric panel. Individuals that still show symptoms after this period are to be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2291 is a corrugated cardboard box with a edge length of 15cm. The word “FUN” is printed in large, black capital letters on each side. There are no gaps or joints on SCP-2291's surface, suggesting that it was formed whole rather than being folded from a flat sheet. D-Class personnel report a rattling noise issuing from SCP-2291 when moved, suggesting that it contains one or more smaller objects. All attempts to access SCP-2291's interior via destructive means have failed, as have imaging studies intended to probe the interior. Level-3 personnel and above may request Test Logs 2291 -1 though -4 for more details.</p>
<p>SCP-2291 was recovered from the offices of █████████ Corporate Solutions in ███████, Ohio. Foundation assets were alerted after the entire staff of █████████ Corporate Solutions was reported missing within a period of 2 days. Mobile Task Force Rho-9 ("The Dundies") was assigned to investigate, and recovered SCP-2291 along with 18 instances of SCP-2291-A, identified as the former employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions. These individuals were found at their workstations, suffering from sleep deprivation and mild dehydration.</p>
<p>Direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is to be considered a Delta-class cognitohazard. Those who do so are to be designated SCP-2291-A and experience the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>All communication by SCP-2291-A instances is altered. SCP-2291-A instances involuntarily replace some adjectives, especially those involving emotion, with the word “fun”.</li>
<li>SCP-2291-A instances smile constantly, even while sleeping.</li>
<li>SCP-2291 significantly alters how SCP-2291-A instances express and experience emotion. Immediately after initial exposure, subjects report increased feelings of happiness and significantly reduced resistance to authority. As the time of exposure to SCP-2291 increases, however, symptoms change; subjects repeatedly exposed to SCP-2291 for a period greater than 2 weeks become reliant on SCP-2291's effects to experience pleasure. When isolated from SCP-2291, these subjects temporarily lose their ability to normally process endorphins. In addition to a suppressed ability to experience pleasure, these individuals experience symptoms analogous to extreme doses of Naloxone in opiate abusers; restlessness, sweating, and headache are common.</li>
</ul>
<p>When isolated from SCP-2291, SCP-2291-A instances typically recover within 3 months. Recovery is negatively correlated with exposure time; the less time a subject spends near SCP-2291, the greater their chance of recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Interview Log 2291-17-3:</strong> The first 18 known SCP-2291-A subjects were the employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions, all of whom were detained during the recovery of SCP-2291. The following interview has been deemed notable due to its content.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-2291-17</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Junior Researcher Evans</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-2291-17 was interviewed 2 weeks after containment. SCP-2291-17, formerly known as Ahmed █████, was an accountant at █████████ Corporate Solutions.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evans:</strong> Hello, Mr. █████. I'd like ask you a few questions about SCP-2291.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2291-17:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Evans:</strong> The object in this picture.</p>
<p><em>Evans hands SCP-2291-17 a photo of SCP-2291</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2291-17:</strong> That? ████████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> brought that in during our holiday party a month ago. Everyone had been kinda fun after the layoffs last quarter, and she said it was a gift to cheer us all up.</p>
<p><strong>Evans:</strong> Who is ████████?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2291-17:</strong> She's the head of HR. No one really knew her well, she was just… fun, you know? Her whole department just weirded all of us out.</p>
<p><strong>Evans:</strong> How have you been feeling since ████████ brought in SCP-2291?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2291-17:</strong> My face has been feeling kinda fun lately. Other than that, I just can't stop working. I used to want to go home and see my family, but fun box made me realize something important. I love my job. My job is my life. Why would I go home when I feel so empty there? My job is fun.</p>
<p><em>SCP-2291-17 is silent for 12 seconds</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2291-17:</strong> Can I borrow your pen?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Evans:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-2291-17 ceased exhibiting anomalous traits 28 days after the interview. He was administered a Class-B amnestic and released, and his SCP designation was removed.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> D-14783</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Mbeke</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> D-14683, a former paralegal, was chosen for testing with SCP-2291. To test the long-term effects of SCP-2291 on subjects similar to the employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions. D-14683 was asked to complete a small amount of legal paperwork after each hour of exposure. The following interview was performed 3 months into SCP-2291 exposure.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mbeke:</strong> Hello, D-14783. How are you today?</p>
<p><em>D-14783's tone suggests unhappiness. He remains smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-14783:</strong> Fun.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mbeke:</strong> What do you mean by that? You sound sad.</p>
<p><strong>D-14783:</strong> I don't have enough to do. I have to keep working. Can you guys give me more to do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mbeke:</strong> I'll see what we can find for you. Tell me, why do you feel like you need to work so much?</p>
<p><strong>D-14783:</strong> I have to be fun. When I'm not writing, when I'm not getting things done, I just get this sense of emptiness. Don't get me wrong, whenever I'm near that little box thing, I feel great. But even then, I feel almost guilty about not working. When I'm not around it, the feeling just gets worse. The only way I can feel like myself is to work.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> D-14783 did not show any progress in recovering from the effects of SCP-2291. He reported consistent worsening of psychological symptoms as time of exposure increased. He was found dead in his cell 4 months and 12 days after the above interview. Cause of death was ruled to be blood loss resulting from suicide, as D-14783 had repeatedly carved the word "fun" into his chest and left forearm with a screw taken from his cot. Due to this incident, further long-term studies with SCP-2291 are prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>00:13:04</strong> - All subjects excluding SCP-2291-B silently leave the conference room and return to their desks. SCP-2291-B remains seated in front of the camera.</p>
