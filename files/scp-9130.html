<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Note: Due to the scale and circumstances surrounding SCP-9130’s containment, SCP-9130’s Special Containment Procedures, as well as access to certain related files, are split between Site-103 and Site-130 respectively.</strong></p>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Site-103 Procedures:</strong><br/>
Living specimens of SCP-9130-1 are to be contained within Anomalous Greenhouse C. Anomalous Greenhouse C is to be outfitted with 5 SRAs<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> covering the whole area to lessen the effects of SCP-9130 on staff.
<p>Each specimen's differing needs are to be met as closely as possible. In the event that a specimen of SCP-9130-1 dies, all resultant SCP-9130-A material is to be carefully collected and shipped to Site-130 for containment. Under no circumstances is any staff member of Site-103 to damage or alter any SCP-9130-A material during collection or transport.</p>
<p>Staff working with or around living SCP-9130-1 specimens must be rotated out every 2 weeks to reduce mental strain.</p>
<p>Satellites equipped with long-range Kant counters are to continuously monitor for potential SCP-9130 activity. (Footnote: due to the unreliability of Kant counters at long range, these satellites are tuned specifically and solely to detect SCP-9130 activity.) When SCP-9130 activity is confirmed, MTF Theta-4 “Gardeners” are to be sent to retrieve any SCP-9130-1 instances. If the SCP-9130-1 instance is small enough, enact protocol BONSAI upon return to Site-103. If the specimen is too large or too risky to safely transplant, the SCP-9130-1 instance is to be killed and 9130-A material collected. In special circumstances, a separate containment site may be constructed around individual 9130-1 instances.</p>
<p>In the case of the discovery or creation of any SCP-9130-2 instances, MTF Psi-7 “Home Improvement” is to capture or destroy the instance. If successfully captured, SCP-9130-2 instances are to be immediately transported to Site-130.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Site-130 Procedures:</strong><br/>
SCP-9130-A material is to be stored in a cool and dry environment in Warehouse Building 304. Under approved testing, SCP-9130-A material may be tested on or worked with to facilitate the creation of SCP-9130-2 instances. All SCP-9130-2 instances are to be processed separately and assigned containment procedures if required. Otherwise, all SCP-9130-2 instances are to be stored in Warehouse Building 207.</p>
<p>Foundation webcrawlers are to investigate online woodworking and antiques communities for signs of SCP-9130-2 instances. If discovered, instances are to be tracked down and contained. In the case of a instance that is dangerous or containment is deemed infeasible, it is to be incinerated.</p>

<p>Dear Myself…</p>
<p>I need somewhere to vent. A plastic fern. A fucking plastic fern. Years of study into anomalous flora, fighting through the mental strain of working with SCP-9130, making a breakthrough…. And my reward is being sent to the middle of the fucking desert. There is not a single living green thing here other than the single saddest cactus I've ever seen 30 meters away from my window. Site-130 is supposed to be one of the biggest Sites by pure number of anomalies. I guess it makes sense that it is simply a giant complex of offices and warehouses surrounded by miles and miles of dust, and the only thing I have to comfort me is a fucking plastic fern.</p>
<p>Ok, I’m calming down a bit now. Work here is just as important as the work the Foundation does all over the world. Apparently the senior researcher I'm now working under… Tubas? Apparently he lost his legs to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8839">doors</a>?</p>
<p>At least here I can fully focus on my work with SCP-9130. It may be the only thing to focus on…</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-9130 is an effect that transforms members of the Coniferous and Deciduous<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> groups of trees into SCP-9130-1 instances. 9130-1 instances have an increased metabolism and growth rate, which appear at first to be ectoentropic in nature, but actually drains from the surrounding reality for nutrition. SCP-9130-1 instances measurably have a lower Hume reading than baseline, indicating that they are acting as a constant reality sink. It is currently unknown how SCP-9130-1 instances convert reality to nutrition or otherwise store it, and research is being done into SCP-9130-1’s effect on surrounding reality. It has been recently discovered that the rate of a SCP-9130-1's reality sink is directly proportional to the volume of the instance, and as such protocol BONSAI was created to contain instances in the smallest state possible.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-9130-1 increase levels of Pareidolia<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> in humans in a 50 meter radius, with effect severity increasing with closer proximity to the instance. SRAs placed in this area stabilize the Hume levels, drastically decreasing the effect by providing a source of reality for the 9130-1 instances.</p>
<p>Due to the increased metabolisms of SCP-9130-1 instances, they are much more susceptible to negative environmental effects, which can cause the rapid deterioration of health, leading to death. When an instance of SCP-9130-1 dies, two things happen. First, the tree emits a Hume wave that is theorized to be responsible for the creation of new SCP-9130-1 instances. The secondary effect is the heavily decreased Hume level of the lumber material left behind compared to baseline reality. This material is designated SCP-9130-A.</p>
<p>Due to the inverse reality bending effects of SCP-9130-A material, any object constructed<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> using it will gain some anomalous properties before stabilizing. These new anomalies are designated SCP-9130-2 instances, however some have required unique SCP designation. These properties have lead to the esoteric classification Embla.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Dear Myself…</p>
<p>I may be going crazy on this project. THE DAMN MAP. I should not have printed it out. I have stared so long at that paper, trying to make any sense of the patterns. Heck, I'm going to give <em>myself</em> pareidolia at this point. At one point I even mapped the chemical structure of cis-3-hexenol onto it. The fact that cis-3-hexenol is one of the main "alarm" systems for plants is definitely intriguing, and I feel like there should be some connection, but in what world would the smell of fresh cut grass be made by that many trees over that long of a period of time.</p>
<p>Well its in my notes anyway. Maybe I should take Tubas up on his offer to assist with the 9130-A studies. I really can't keep isolating forever.</p>

<p>Hey Rin,</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm doing well. I am surprised you contacted me first, your stay at 130 must be going a lot better than you made it out to be as you were leaving 103. Wish you could come back soon though. SCP-9130 sure is trouble for an anomaly we've been containing for nearly a century. The constant discovery every few months of new 9130-1 instances all over the globe is really stretching resources thin over here, and while the BONSAI protocol is definitely helping, I really feel like we are on the edge.</p>
<p>Hope the desert is treating you well,<br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 9130.7, Incident Report SCP-9130-A7:</strong></p>
<p>On 9/28/2025, a record breaking SCP-9130-1 instance was detected in Sequoia National Park. Due to its immense size, the reality consuming effect of this instance threatened local reality, so a SRA was approved to be installed on site. The SRA was installed on 10/3/2025.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Taroko:</strong> Man, I'm so sick of seeing these faces all the time. Can't wait to get this thing up and running.</p>
<p><em>Agent Ernst detaches a large wire from the generator and begins to pull it over to the SRA</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Ernst:</strong> You can say that about 3 more times. How's the connection point?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Strachey:</strong> Almost there… with the faces appearing all over the wires here its hard to tell what is what.</p>
<p><em>Agent Taroko moves to the other side of the SRA, pulling up a control panel.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Strachey finishes opening up the connection panel on the SRA, and stands back so Worker 2 can insert the power cable.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Ernst:</strong> Ok, all systems go.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Taroko:</strong> Booting up the SRA… Strachey, we got a Kant counter? Given the size of this one, I think it's worth keeping an eye on the Hume levels for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Strachey:</strong> Gotcha.</p>
<p><em>Agent Strachey heads over the the flatbed truck and begins rummaging around. As they do this, the SRA whirs to life.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Ernst:</strong> <em>(sigh)</em> I am ready for this week to be done-</p>
<p><em>Agent Ernst is interrupted by a series of screeching metal noises coming from inside the SRA, raising in intensity as the machine begins to shake.</em></p>
<p><em>Out of view of the workers, the instance of SCP-9130-1 rumbles, as its needles and branches start to rapidly grow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Taroko:</strong> That cannot be good. Turning the SRA off now.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Strachey:</strong> Looks like Hume levels are raising at least. Wait no, they're lower- they're moving up and down erratically!</p>
<p><em>The instance of SCP-9130-1 begins to show signs of cracking and stress along its main trunk as its needles grow and fall off in droves, piling on the surrounding ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Taroko furiously types at her control panel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Taroko:</strong> It's not turning off!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ernst:</strong> I'm noticing an irregularity over at the tree as well. We need to call this in immediately.</p>
<p><em>An incredibly loud creaking sound emanates out from the SCP-9130-1 instance, sending birds flying. The SCP-9130-1 instance is noticeably leaning towards the direction of the SRA work site.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Strachey drops their Kant detector and begins to work at the cord powering the SRA, attempting to forcefully disconnect it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Taroko:</strong> Uh. UH. I think we need to clear, NOW.</p>
<p><em>A deafening boom can be heard as the SCP-9130-1 instance cracks, falling with irregular speed towards the SRA. Upon impact, an explosion occurs, knocking out connection.</em></p>

<p>After incident 9130-A7, the resultant 9130-A material was collected. Agent Ernst survived with serious injuries. Agents Taroko and Strachey died in the initial explosion. The tree falling and subsequent explosion was blamed on a freak lightning strike.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9130.9, Report on Potential Multiversal Cause of SCP-9130 and Suggestions for Containment Adjustments:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Report on Potential Multiversal Cause of SCP-9130 and Suggestions for Containment Adjustments</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>By Researcher Rin Moor &amp; Senior Researcher Derek Tubas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
A direct correlation between the amount of SRA's employed by the Foundation and number of SCP-9130-1 instances has been discovered. After doing research into incident 9130-A7, our team firmly believes that 9130-1 instances siphon reality from our universe into a "Dead" universe from which we draw reality from in turn. Due to the recent increase in using SRAs for the containment of SCP-9130 and other SCPs, the near exponential increase in SCP-9130-1 instances can be explained.</p>
<p>This paper will go into the details of our argument and further posit a method of deciphering which universe SCP-9130-1 may come from so that our SRAs can stop siphoning from their reality, as well as a means to establish communication.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…as such it is proposed that SCP-9130-A material be used in the creation of any potential communication device, as recommended by the Department of Multiversal Affairs. The contents of the message are currently being worked on by a joint team of linguists and arborists in Site-103. If this report is approved, said message will be sent to universe 9130 simultaneously with the rewiring of any SRAs siphoning from universe 9130.</p>

<p>Dear Myself,</p>
<p>Well. I am back at Site-103. The reunion was great, but I’m a bit overwhelmed at all the increased attention from the paper. I visited the SCP-9130 greenhouse again and the effect of the Pareidolia seems to have… loosened. I always saw the faces as screaming and in anguish. But now? They seem almost… relieved.</p>
<p>You know? I don’t think I’d turn down another research assignment to Site-130.</p>
