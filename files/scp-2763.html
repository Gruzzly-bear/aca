<p><em>ACT ONE, SCENE ONE, The Empty Cell.</em><br/>
<em>Curtain opens, the stage is dressed as a standard humanoid containment chamber, with amenities befitting such a place. On a bed at center stage sits our hero, <strong>SIR RICHARD GLOSTER</strong>, sitting forlornly and addressing the audience:</em></p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> Here again I sit, here again you read.<br/>
As long as you read, I’ll sit, but longer<br/>
than that I cannot stand, nor indeed can<br/>
I sit. For you see, kind reader, that one<br/>
cannot sit, or stand for that matter, if<br/>
one cannot be. And so one, this one, in<br/>
particular, cannot be if one is<br/>
not read. My life is bound to this page here,<br/>
I am not so much blood and bone and flesh<br/>
as I am ink, and paper, and story.</p>
<p><em>He turns, now speaking to himself more than the audience.</em></p>
<p>It was not always so. No, once I was<br/>
mortal. A playwright, even! Though not a<br/>
very good one, I’m afraid. “So clumsy!<br/>
So dreadfully long winded! So pompous!”<br/>
None of my work was ever desired,<br/>
none of it lasted longer than a week!<br/>
Dozens of plays I published, and not one<br/>
single word was remembered longer than<br/>
a single pitiful fleeting fortnight.</p>
<p>One night I could not take it any more.<br/>
My razor I from my dresser grabbèd,<br/>
and opened my left wrist, with my closed right,<br/>
that writing right which now wrote “FIN” in great<br/>
red letters, upon my walls and clothing.</p>
<p>I prayed, to every god and spirit<br/>
and being I knew. I prayed that I be<br/>
forgotten, purgèd from the whole wide world.<br/>
That if ever again my name be heard,<br/>
it be as the author of some great art,<br/>
immortalized by my work, found sadly<br/>
after my departure from this cruel coil.<br/>
In hindsight perhaps I should have chosen<br/>
my words more carefully, or perhaps not<br/>
have said any at all, said not a word.<br/>
Or indeed, should not have written any.</p>
<p><em>He turns back to the crowd, speaking clearly to the audience.</em></p>
<p>And so here I am. The cell you’ve put me<br/>
in sits empty, aside from this lone tome.</p>
<p><em>He gestures to a bookcase, containing a single volume.</em></p>
<p>This is my life and times, the tragedy<br/>
of me. All that I am and ere shall be,<br/>
all my self contained within these pages.<br/>
I do not breathe, yet you convince yourselves<br/>
I speak to you. I cannot move, save for<br/>
as describèd in stage direction, yet<br/>
you are determinèd to transport me<br/>
and address me as if I stand in front<br/>
of you. Even as you try to catalogue<br/>
me as a specimen or experiment,<br/>
you cannot help but write poems<br/>
and flowery prose where you mean to scribe<br/>
cold, unfeeling fact. My words flow and change<br/>
through each reader, but my existence holds<br/>
static. Cold and cruel. All my world's a stage.</p>
<p><em>Fade to black.</em></p>
<p><em>ACT ONE, SCENE TWO, Interview<br/>
Lights come up on an interview room. On one side of the table sits <strong>GLOSTER</strong>, opposite him sits <strong>SENIOR RESEARCHER MARLOWE:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>MARLOWE:</strong> Good afternoon, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> Good morrow, good Doctor. What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>MARLOWE:</strong> I have a few more questions for you, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> But of course! Though I find minding is not<br/>
done by one whom in mind can only be.</p>
<p><strong>MARLOWE:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> Nothing, Doctor. Carry on, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>MARLOWE:</strong> Right. As you know, we’re still puzzled as to where you’ve come from. Or <em>when</em>. As far as we can tell, you just turned up in one of our libraries a few weeks ago. Even more puzzling is your demeanor. You act and dress like a 16th-century nobleman, but your vocabulary is decidedly modern, albeit with a faux-Elizabethan affectation, and your dental work can’t possibly have been done earlier than 1970. Where are you from? A straight answer this time, please.</p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> Well how can I answer such a question!<br/>
Was I born at the time and place of Sir<br/>
Richard Gloster? Or minutes ago at<br/>
your desk as you began transcribing this<br/>
exchange? Or was I born here and now, at<br/>
your screen, as you now read this document?</p>
<p><strong>MARLOWE:</strong> What? Who are you taking to? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>GLOSTER:</strong> Nor will you ever, I’m afraid. Art cannot<br/>
possibly be apprehended by<br/>
those who are not artists. Close the book, good<br/>
Doctor. Forget me for the time being.</p>
<p><em><strong>MARLOWE</strong> begins to ask further questions, and <strong>GLOSTER</strong> answers, but the pair cannot be heard by the audience. The two continue the interview as the lights begin slowly dimming. Just before the stage is totally dark, <strong>GLOSTER</strong> faces the audience and bows slightly</em></p>
<p><em>EPILOGUE, O5 Soliloquy</em></p>
<p><em>A new character, <strong>O5-8</strong> walks into spotlight and addresses the audience</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-8:</strong> If you are seeing this, then you may be beginning to grasp the nature of SCP-2763. At the moment, we're not sure how much control the entity has over what events are depicted in copies of <em>A Play Written</em>, but the text is clearly altered to reflect recent events, as evidenced by the fact that newer transcriptions are instead titled <em>The Tragedy of SCP-2763, A Modern Euclid Tale</em>. At the moment, the O5 council has determined that all written record of SCP-2763 be sealed, and all copies of <em>A Play Written</em> in Foundation custody be stored in the Restricted Printed Memetics Library of Site-63.<br/>
But bear it to that chamber; there he'll lie<br/>
in that far archive shall Sir Richard die.</p>
<p><em>He smirks to himself as the stage goes black. Curtain close.</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END</strong></p>
