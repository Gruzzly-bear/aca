<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All samples of SCP-8718 are to be housed at Provisional Site ZA1 in <span class="black-bar">That place</span>, South Africa under the directorship of Doctor Anthony Cull. MTF Theta-4 (“Gardeners”) are to begin research into practical applications of SCP-8718 at the earliest possible date. The site is to be outfitted with anti-electrical safety measures and all staff are to be trained in the correct management of electrical injuries.</p>
<p>Any regions found to house populations of SCP-8718 are to be purchased from the local authorities and cordoned off prior to further containment. Funding should be made available to assist with negotiating with local law enforcement where necessary.</p>
<p>No contact is to be made or sustained with the local population. Any queries regarding the purpose of Provisional Site ZA1 are to be directed to on-site amnestics specialists. 24 hour surveillance is to be observed at all times. All trespassers are to be detained, interrogated and amnesticized accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8718 is an anomalous species of vine native to the Republic of South Africa suspected to be from the genus, <em>Ceropegia</em>. The species is currently unidentified, but is visually similar to <em>Ceropegia ampliata</em>.</p>
<p>SCP-8718 is capable of electrogenesis. Study indicates lower electricity production at night suggesting the process is an advanced form of photosynthesis. The flowers of SCP-8718 are non-anomalous.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8718 was discovered by Researchers Carol Hollis and Peyton Morgan on 1 August 2030 while vacationing with a colleague in the Western Cape of South Africa. Researcher Hollis and Researcher Morgan reported hearing "crackling and popping" while hiking and suspected a fire. When no smoke could be detected, further investigation uncovered SCP-8718.</p>

<h3><span>Addendum 080630AB:</span></h3>
<p>On 6 August 2030, MTF Theta-4 (“Gardeners”) arrived at <span class="black-bar">That place</span>, South Africa and established Provisional Site ZA1 with a combined focus on parabotanical and paraelectrical anomalous study. Researchers Hollis and Morgan were given the opportunity to take the lead in their respective fields as a courtesy for initially discovering SCP-8718. Researcher Hollis has been dedicated to the Cultivation Lab and Researcher Morgan has been dedicated to the Paraelectronics Lab. Both labs have begun priority research focused, respectively, on renewable electrogenesis and practical applications.</p>
<p>Bribes were made to local authorities to ensure easy access to the region SCP-8718 is known to grow in. The nearby town residents have shown no outward hostility to the presence of Foundation forces and misinformation campaigns have been accepted.</p>
<p>No major local environmental groups presented resistance and the Foundation declared the site secure on 29 August 2030.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>Addendum 083130AC:</span></h3>
<p>On 31 August 2030, a group identifying themselves as the Southern African Anomalies Agency (S3A) made contact with Provisional Site ZA1. Four vehicles arrived at the gates requesting access to the property and a meeting with the site director to establish the purpose of the Foundation's presence on the African continent.</p>
<p>Site officials refused both requests to ensure the protection of SCP-8718.</p>

<h3><span>Addendum 090330AD</span></h3>
<p>On 3 September 2030, each member of the O5 Council received an introductory email from the Southern African Anomalies Agency. The contents of the email are depicted below, but Overwatch Command immediately convened to respond to what was considered an outrageous introduction.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>

<hr/>
<p><br/>
To the esteemed Administrator and O5 Council of the SCP Foundation,<br/>
<br/>
The Southern African Anomalies Agency (S3A) humbly requests clarification on the purpose of your presence in the town of <span class="black-bar">That place</span> in the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>We are aware of the altercation on site, however, we recognise that misunderstandings can occur. We apologise for our agents' hand in the misunderstandings and we do hope to maintain cordial relations moving forward.</p>
<p>To that end, we would appreciate an open dialogue regarding the matter of <em>Ceropegia anomalia.</em> The S3A has been in the process of tracking specimens across the Western Cape and implementing containment measures for the betterment of the local South African population. <em>Ceropegia anomalia</em> is extremely rare and the Foundation's potential mishandling of African anomalies is of great concern to the S3A Custodial Council.</p>
<p>Kindly assist us with access to the Foundation site so we can begin official assessment of the facility and its purpose.</p>
<p>We look forward to your positive returns.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,<br/>
The S3A Custodial Council<br/></p>

<h3><span>Addendum 091430AE</span></h3>
<p>On 14 September 2030, site alert status was raised after an S3A investigation team discreetly breached the perimeter of Provisional Site ZA1. Security teams were deployed and weapon's fire was exchanged. Of the seven S3A operatives identified, three were confirmed to be killed on site, three escaped, and one was detained for questioning. Foundation security teams were unable to locate the remaining members of the S3A investigations team.</p>
<p>Review of the security footage noted the widespread use of electrical weaponry, as well as the body armor used by a number of the S3A investigators incorporating adaptive nanotechnology across its surface to act as shielding. The weaponry and armor of the deceased and captured S3A operatives were sent to Dr. Morgan for study. Reports from the Theta-4 agents who pursued the fleeing S3A operatives stated that they had lost track of the hostile operatives very shortly after they fled as though they had 'just disappeared.'</p>

<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> What you're failing to understand is that we are going to find your friends who got away.

<p><strong>S3A Agent:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> I've already sent a request to have you negotiated back to the S3A, but you're going to need to work with me here. If I can't prove to the higher-ups that you're cooperating, I can't guarantee you get home.</p>
<p><strong>S3A Agent:</strong> Agent Dunn, I think it's the Foundation that doesn't realize what situation they're in.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> So you can talk.</p>
<p><strong>S3A Agent:</strong> This is Africa, Dunn. We're not going to play by your rules. You've done enough to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> Africa or not, the Foundation has all the resources necessary to keep this situation under control. SCP-8718 will be studied under the Foundation's eye and if the S3A want's to pester us about it, they'll be signing treaties with the GOC before the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>S3A Agent:</strong> That same old Foundation pride. It'll catch up with you eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Dunn:</strong> So are you going to start assisting us with this investigation or can I send you back to your cell?</p>

<h3><span>Addendum 092130AF</span></h3>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 05:00 SAST<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 21 September 2030<br/>
<strong>Summary:</strong> While the value of SCP-8718 was unanimously agreed upon, the low level threat that the S3A has historically posed resulted in no consensus in further Foundation involvement. Regardless, the threat level was raised and more resources requisitioned in order to better secure Provisional Site ZA1 against further perimeter breaches by the S3A. Overwatch Command is awaiting confirmation of the cost of the damages.</p>

<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Five, calm down.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-5:</strong> They invaded one of our research sites and you're suggesting we do nothing! Why should I calm down?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-4:</strong> I'm not suggesting we do nothing. I'm just not prepared to deploy Hammer Down on the back of The Bigger Boat because you said so.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-2:</strong> Before you two paragons of virtue tear each other apart, can we please keep in mind that the S3A is not a threat? They've been disorganized at worst and a low grade UIU at best. Our focus should remain on getting a cutting of that plant to Site 101 or Site 103. Any fucking site.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-5:</strong> Low grade UIU? Two, are you fucking blind? They have thaumaturges that can throw lightning!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-6:</strong> This is an escalation in their known behavior, though.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> The S3A was formed after the end of the Apartheid regime, and honestly, they really haven't done much since inception. They've spent most of their time focused on preserving traditional witchcraft there, which is admirable, but there's been no advancements from them in the field of thaumaturgy.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> And now they have agents disintegrating into sludge and flowers in our interrogation rooms.</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> This Custodial Council of theirs is new though. They used to just have a director. Pretty sure I even saw his name on something a few months back. Whomever this Custodial Council is, they've pushed the S3A in a much more aggressive thaumaturgic direction than they used to follow. They used to be all about guns.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> They have <em>one</em> confirmed thaumaturge that poses a minor threat. No one died. At least, no one on our side of this died. Starting a war over one temporary site in Africa isn't worth it. Not to us. Not to normalcy. Even if they have thaumaturges.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>O5-4:</strong> We can send more Gardeners.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> The S3A sticking their head out of their hole shouldn't be a cause for that kind of deployment. Too much MTF movement on the continent on the GOC is going to panic. We're already having to sneak the City Slickers in like civilians. Valravn should have assets nearby that we can requisition.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Valravn? Why do we want them involved?</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> Do you want a source of energy that literally grows in the ground protected for our use or not? It's worth too much for us to just leave it there. Valravn can at least provide back-up of some kind to deal with thaumaturges. And it'll keep things with the GOC calm.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Valravn being in Africa has implications. Do you really want us carrying those implications with them? Just move samples to Site 101.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Valravn can move quickly and with less fanfare than we can. They've got the tech, let's just put it to use. Make sure the S3A knows about it too.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Well, I don't see why we care about keeping the GOC happy, to be honest. We have the resources. If we're sending externals, we're going to need to make sure whoever they send doesn't get hold of any info about 8718. Who knows how they'll turn this thing into money?</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Speaking of money, how much damage did the site take in the attack?</p>

She maintains remote control of several battle ready drones, and is authorized for lethal force in service to the Foundation. The unit was moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo and arrived within four hours.</p>
<p>Upon its arrival, a perimeter was immediately established and reinforced with Valravn turrets supported by AI tracking. A full orange alert remains in effect on site, but no further engagements have occurred between Foundation and S3A personnel. Valkyrie Unit X62V is to report to Security Chief Tran.</p>

<h3><span>Addendum 092130AG</span></h3>
<p>At 20:21 SAST, Researchers Hollis and Morgan submitted a preliminary report to Director Cull. The report confirms the origin of electrogenesis within SCP-8718. Researcher Morgan has submitted a brief on theoretical applications of the anomaly.</p>

<tr>
<th>Source of Electrogenesis</th>
<td>SCP-8718 shares its non-anomalous counterpart's trait of using its stem as the main source of photosynthesis. SCP-8718's Electron Transport Chain (ETC) duplicates excited electrons during the process of photosynthesis, thus creating excess energy to be stored or discharged as electrical energy. SCP-8718 stores some of this charge in its generally tuberous root system, but small charges are constantly released into the surrounding environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Notes on SCP-8718's Electrogenesis</th>
<td>Initial permaculture studies revealed that while the process of photosynthesis clearly plays a crucial role in SCP-8718's electrogenesis, the amount of electricity generated remains inconsistent across various 8718 instances regardless of the time of day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Further study</th>
<td>It is theorized SCP-8718 will perform more consistently in controlled environments. Cuttings have been taken to be studied in hydroponic, aeroponic, vertical farming, and nutrient film technique environments.</td>

<tr>
<th>Electrical Harvesting</th>
<td>Modified diodes placed in the electrified soil of SCP-8718's environment were able to harvest and store electrical energy. The inconsistency of the electrical generation will cause damage to diodes in the long term, but a stabilized current promises a strong and consistent source of energy. A proof of concept design for a cellphone charger that can be inserted into electrified soil has been sent for approval.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-541702-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-541702-4')">4</a></sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Mobile Application</th>
<td>Harvesting the electrical energy for mobile application is discouraged at this time due to the risk of damage to harvesting equipment. Once a consistent current can be guaranteed, harvesting the electricity for storage and mobile application can be explored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Further Resources</th>
<td>A list of resources required will be provided once Researcher Hollis' preliminary alternative environment study reports have been completed.</td>
