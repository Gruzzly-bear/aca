<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8750 is a former Foundation researcher, Ashe Barker. SCP-8750 is a Type 4-U Reality Bender.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> SCP-8750 is currently contained at Site-97 in Brandon, Florida, where they were working when they entered an anomalous coma.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Relocation of SCP-8750 has been deemed unviable as the manifestation of anomalous properties happens regardless of SCP-8750's location. SCP-8750 has conjured up several spectral entities, designated SCP-8750-1 to SCP-8750-3. The entities manifested by SCP-8750 act out scenarios from SCP-8750's past.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8750’s anomalous nature was found on 2016/12/29 when reports of a child resembling the late Jacob Barker<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, now designated SCP-8750-1 was reported to have been wandering the town aimlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8750.1</strong> SCP-8750 was found to affect the area around their house.<br/>
Reports of SCP-8750-1 led MTF Δ-29 (“Outside the Box”) to the apartment, where they established a temporary on-site location to collect data. Appearances of SCP-8750-1 also contained a second entity, identified to be a spectral version of SCP-8750, designated SCP-8750-2, as well as the occasional appearance of a third entity. This was identified as Dr. Robert Osprey,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> and is designated SCP-8750-3.</p>

<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> You need to let go Ashe, it’s been six goddamn months; you think I wasn’t going through the same hell you did? It’s selfish of you to hold on so long. You need to go outside, you can't keep living like this.</p>
<p><strong>Barker:</strong> Fuck you! Six months isn’t long, you aren’t as devastated because you are a deadbeat who was never around!</p>
<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> <em>(shouting louder)</em> Are you that self-absorbed to not realize that I loved him too? I had no choice Ashe, you kicked me out; you took me out of his life. I've tried again and again; I’ve even taken you to court several times.</p>
<p><em>He pauses for a moment. Barker tries to interject, but he continues.</em></p>
<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> I wasn’t even granted visitation without your permission, and now you are trying to say you loved him more than me? I didn't have an option! You are selfish, conceited, and crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Barker:</strong> <em>(gasps)</em> Excuse me? You didn’t even fucking ask! You never made an effort; you just berated me for how I raised him! You expect me to move on, but I based my entire life around him! He was my child! Mine!</p>
<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> Do you not even hear yourself? He was our child!</p>
<p><em>He pauses for a moment before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> He’s gone now. What is moping around, blaming me, and doing nothing with your goddamn life gonna do for you? It’s so selfish of you. You barely go to work anymore and keep lounging around. How about you grow up? Grow the fuck up, Ashe. It's embarassing.</p>
<p><strong>Barker:</strong> You have the audacity to come into my house, insult me, tell me to move on, and tell me how to live my life? You are just as uncaring as ever, Robert! I thought you of all people could have understood my pain!</p>
<p><em>Barker pauses for a moment.</em></p>

<p><strong>Osprey:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Barker:</strong> Get the fuck out of my house!</p>
