<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> Foundation staff, regardless of clearance level, are not permitted past the third floor of SCP-9026. Personnel approached by Dr. Ebenbacher and requested to disobey this directive should report the incident to the Foundation Disciplinary Committee. Failure to abide by these instructions will result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including mandatory amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>Foundation agents are currently in the process of tracking down individuals whose entries are recorded in SCP-9026-A to determine if they require amnestization.</p>
<p>Personnel seeking appointments with SCP-9026 must book with Dr. Malloy or by scheduling a time here. Appointments must last less than 6 total hours per month to avoid effects of SCP-9026 overexposure. Consult the Employee Health handbook for further information regarding appointment policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-9026 is a three-story German-style American suburban home containing a spatio-temporal Richards-Keeley fractal structure. Its original owner, [NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY], operated a home therapy clinic for those with mild to moderate PTSD.</p>
<p>SCP-9026‘s anomalous properties manifest whenever an individual (hereby referred to as the "patient") opens the front door to the house. The house will take on the appearance of significant locations within the patient‘s memory, most often that of a childhood home. Though no other living individuals will be present, remnants of their activity are apparent throughout the house. Patients report feelings of intense and natural calm during exploration of the house, as well as other beneficial mental effects based on the floor they visit, as detailed below.</p>
<p>SCP-9026 has demonstrated the ability to "store" instances of the memories it recreates. Repeated sessions with the same patient involving the same or closely related memories results in a higher fidelity and moderately lessened instability. This capacity is believed to be limited in some way. On rare occurrences, the memories SCP-9026 reproduce correlate to a different patient that the one currently undergoing treatment.</p>
<p>Overexposure to SCP-9026 can result in some temporary minor symptoms, such as retrograde or anterograde amnesia. These symptoms appear to affect only those who have undergone treatment with SCP-9026, and they wear off within 48 hours.</p>
<p>SCP-9026-A is a leather-bound journal recovered from SCP-9026. Written records of patients affected by SCP-9026 appear in the journal, seemingly at random. It is believed that they reflect the thoughts of the patient during treatment within SCP-9026.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Floor One</span>: Common, easily recalled memories. These include long-standing family traditions, existing or recently lost mementos, etc. Patients are observed to enter a state of general calm and relaxation. This allows them to speak more freely on the origins of these memories. Recommended for insomnia, mild anxiety or depression.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Floor Two</span>: Memories that require more concentration to recall in detail, but still can be done without mnestics. These include serendipitous encounters and embarrassing memories. Minor inconsistencies in recollection lead to SCP-9026 altering or reshaping itself to remain consistent with the patient's recollection. Though patients may require multiple session before embracing these memories, they report feelings of relief and release following treatment. Recommended for mild PTSD, mental exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Floor Three</span>: Unstable memories that may require mnestics to stabilize to a useful degree. These include repressed memories or things that may have been partially forgotten. Patients on this floor are required to be supervised at all times. Patients typically feel a mild euphoria within 1-3 hours after treatment. This sensation can last up to three days. Recommended for severe mental trauma.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Following repeated breaches, the door to Floor Four has been hermetically sealed and is currently monitored by a Scranton-Lang Spatial Expansion Limiter.</p>

Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher was assigned as research lead for SCP-9026. Dr Ebenbacher and her assistant, Dr. Tyler Malloy, have been submitting continuous patient records to this file as part of SCP-9026‘s containment procedures.
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>This patient record was requested by Dr. Tyler Malloy to be presented in its entirety.</p>

<hr/>
<p><em><strong>Patient:</strong></em> Natalie Kirsch<br/>
<em><strong>Presiding Doctor:</strong></em> Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher<br/>
<em><strong>Floor:</strong></em> One<br/>
<em><strong>Primary Memory:</strong></em> A stuffed animal received as a very young child.</p>
<p>Agent Natalie Kirsch had been suffering from insomnia following a containment breach at Site-57 that claimed the lives of 4 personnel. Due to the nature of the breach, amnestics were not recommended as treatment. When questioned about her mental state, Agent Kirsch became irate and defensive.<br/>
——<br/>
<em>SCP-9026‘s interior manifests as a small, open family home. The dining room has several glass cabinets full of knick-knacks and various tableware, making the space cluttered. There is a den connected to the kitchen through a half-wall. Old wood floors creak underfoot. Though dim, the lights carry a sense of warmth and homeliness. Kirsch notices an object on a pullout couch in the den.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> No way, is that…</p>
<p><em>Kirsch picks up a small, round stuffed animal. The color has faded to a muted tan, and the nose appears to have been sown back on repeatedly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> God, this ratty, old thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> It’s a snuffie.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher stares at her for a moment. Kirsch sheepishly laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> It’s, uh, just some stuffed animal…thing. I think it’s supposed to be a bear? Or something, I don’t know. My grandmother gave one to me and one to my sister when we were really little. I was like, four, I think.</p>
<p><em>Kirsch smiles wistfully.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> I brought this thing with me everywhere. Boarding school, college, our first apartment….</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Do you still have it now?</p>
<p><em>Kirsch is silent for a moment. When she speaks again, her voice is quieter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Nah, I lost it in my last move. It’s probably back in Philly. Honestly, I never even thought about it too much, until now. I don't even know why I thought about it here.</p>
<p><em>Kirsch looks back up at Ebenbacher. Kirsch‘s eyes are slightly misty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Hey, uh, Dr. Ebenbacher? Do you- is it ok if I stay here for a bit, alone?</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Of course. The session is yours to do with what you like.</p>
<p><em>Kirsch suddenly looks embarrassed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Wait, no one else is gonna come in here, right? No one’s gonna see anything that happens here.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> No. It’s all part of the doctor-patient confidentiality agreement. You have my word.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher closes the door behind her as she leaves. After a few minutes, faint sobbing can be heard on the other side. At the end of the session, Ebenbacher quietly opens the door to see Kirsch sleeping soundly, curled around the stuffed animal.</em><br/>
——<br/>
Dr. Ebenbacher recommended continued sessions of SCP-9026 as part of Agent Kirsch‘s treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Derek █████<br/>
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Mild anxiety following the loss of one of his team members<br/>
<strong>Floor:</strong> One<br/>
<strong>Primary Memory:</strong> Making blueberry muffins with his mother<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Upon inspection, the refrigerator and pantry that the patient used were both empty, and the recipe book was blank. Patient was allowed to bring the muffins back to his team upon confirmation they had no anomalous properties.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Yasmina ████████<br/>
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Harmful compulsive tendencies that manifested after an encounter with SCP-███<br/>
<strong>Floor:</strong> One<br/>
<strong>Primary Memory:</strong> A song the children of her hometown used to sing around holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Patient was heard humming the song played during her session for several months following treatment. She has not required additional sessions since.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Grant ███<br/>
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Intense phobia of open ocean, hindering field deployment<br/>
<strong>Floor:</strong> Two<br/>
<strong>Primary Memory:</strong> Childhood backyard pool<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Repeated sessions within the pool resulted in successful mitigation of phobia. Patient was recommended for redeployment after a follow-up session.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Nadine █████<br/>
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Spontaneous social anxiety<br/>
<strong>Floor:</strong> Two<br/>
<strong>Primary Memory:</strong> The backstage area of a small theater<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> After an unproductive first session, patient eventually confessed to an episode of "wetting herself" as a young girl in this location. Patient would not elaborate further but requested additional sessions.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> ████████████████<br/>
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Severe depression, insomnia<br/>
<strong>Floor:</strong> Three<br/>
<strong>Primary Memory:</strong> A hospital room<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Patient insists they do not remember going to the hospital as a child, despite names and dates matching existing medical records. Burn scars on the patient‘s forearm were attributed to a cooking accident. Medical reports indicate injuries consistent with self defense.</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="border: solid 1px black;">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> Personnel treated by SCP-9026 who suspect they may be under the influence of overexposure should use this file and the SCP-9026-A database to cross check any memories they may have lost or exchanged. If the effects are confirmed, affected personnel must undergo a strict mnestics regiment as outlined by Site-34‘s Dept. of Memory Research until memory normalization has been achieved. Failure to report suspected overexposure or memory exchange will be considered a breach of containment.</p>
<p>Personnel who do not surpass the threshold for overexposure may continue treatment with SCP-9026 according to Foundation Health policy.</p>
<p>Foundation staff, regardless of clearance level, are not permitted past the third floor of SCP-9026. Personnel approached by Dr. Ebenbacher and requested to disobey this directive should report the incident to the Foundation Disciplinary Committee. Failure to abide by these instructions will result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including mandatory amnestic treatment.</p>
<p>Foundation agents are currently in the process of tracking down individuals whose entries are recorded in SCP-9026-A to determine if they require amnestization.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-9026 is the sole documented origin point of a pseudo-organic multi-nodal Richards-Keeley fractal complex. It exhibits standard spatio-temporal distortion and is designated a Class Gamma Location. SCP-9026 currently functions as a "memory repository" for all individuals who activate its effects. Patients have their memories stored in SCP-9026 and can have them replayed as part of comfort therapy or to confront locations of past traumas in a semi-controlled environment.</p>
<p>Overexposure to SCP-9026 may result in minor side effects such as retrograde or anterograde amnesia. However, standard issue Class C mnestics have been proven to effectively counter any side effects.</p>
<p>SCP-9026-A is a two-part catalogue of all patients whose memories are stored in SCP-9026. The first part of SCP-9026-A is leather-bound journal recovered from SCP-9026. Written records of the memories of patients treated by SCP-9026 appear in the journal, though they are not in chronological order. These records are believed to encompass most, if not all, memories stored in SCP-9026 prior to containment. The second part of SCP-9026-A is a database stored on Foundation servers of all Foundation personnel treated by SCP-9026. This database appeared approximately one week following containment of SCP-9026, and coincides with the first member of Foundation staff treated by on-site psychologists. Many entries in the journal also appear in the database.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum: Patient Log - Early Case of SCP-9026 Overexposure</strong></span><br/>
Several patients of SCP-9026 exhibited symptoms that would later be characterized as SCP-9026 overexposure. One such case is documented below.<br/>

<p><strong>Tenth Session with Agent Natalie Kirsch</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Kirsch enters Ebenbacher‘s office just as Ebenbacher is finished setting up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Hey, Dr. E. Sorry for the short notice.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Don't worry about it. I'm always happy to talk. What's on your mind? Have you been sleeping better.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Kinda? I actually found something recently that really helped.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> That's good news!</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Yeah. Well, it's…uh, kinda stupid, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> I found that old stuffed bear the house showed me. It was deep in a closet.</p>
<p><em>Kirsch clears her throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Honestly, I'm a little embarrassed I even went looking for the thing. It's probably beyond fixing at this point.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> But it helps with the nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> …no. Not really. But I feel better whenever I hold it, so I guess it helps in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> That's something. Better than no help at all.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> I've also been having issues with my memory. That's the other reason I'm here.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Can you elaborate? It might have something to do with the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> It's really weird, like sometimes I forget that I did something, and other times I'll remember something that I've never actually done. The other day I showed up for training with this random MTF that I've never heard of, but for some reason I feel like I knew all the members…</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Have you been taking the mnestics?</p>
<p><em>Kirsch is silent briefly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> I do…but they sometimes make the nightmares worse.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher stares at her notes for a minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Natalie, would you be willing to try something? I've been working on a theory. It's a bit experimental so I understand if you'd prefer not to.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Dr. E, I'd probably sell my kidneys if it meant I could get a good night's sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I'd like to take you to Floor Four of SCP-9026.</p>
<p><strong>Kirsch:</strong> Isn't that, like, super not allowed?</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I've got a way for us to get in.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum: SCP-9026-A Access Log</strong></span><br/>
After exhibiting symptoms of overexposure and suspected memory complications, Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher accessed SCP-9026-A to ascertain the origin of the memories that had contaminated her own. She discovered several records (detailed below) that provided possible matches. Dr. Ebenbacher was able to track down 55-year-old Josef Karaman, a civilian, who had been treated by SCP-9026 prior to containment. Ebenbacher arranged an interview with Mr. Karaman inside SCP-9026 under the pretense of the revisit of a psychological study.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum: Petition to Retire SCP-9026 Classification</strong></span><br/>
A significant increase in complaints from patients scheduled for treatment with SCP-9026 began in October 2013. These included appointments being rescheduled or cancelled due to staff absence, frequent double or triple bookings, and increased frequency of the manifestation of other patients‘ memories during sessions. As a result, Site-34 Director Bernard issued an audit and conducted an interview with head psychologist Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]<br/>
<em>A knock is heard on the door to Dr. Ebenbacher‘s office in the SCP-9026 auxiliary building. She jumps up and shoves a few papers into her desk drawers, smooths her hands on her pants, and opens the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Director Bernard, hello!</p>
<p><em>She shakes his hand. He nods and takes a seat opposite her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I understand you wanted to meet with me?</p>
<p><em>He nods again, slowly looking around the disheveled office. Ebenbacher watches his gaze. She takes a deep breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Listen, I know that things have been a little hectic around here and there have been a few more complaints than usual and it may seem like we’re struggling but I can assure you that we have everything under control and we’ll be back on schedule in no time and it’s really not that bad it’s just that you’ve caught me on a busy day and-</p>
<p><em>Bernard holds up a hand. Ebenbacher slowly closes her mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bernard:</strong> If I’m being honest with you, Ramona, the conduct being displayed here is more than simply unsatisfactory… I would argue they are grounds for closing this office-</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> NO!</p>
<p><em>She holds up her hands and clenches her fists.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Sorry, sorry. Continue…</p>
<p><strong>Bernard:</strong> I know you care quite a lot about your work here and the staff you work with. They all have nothing but good things to say. Which is why…</p>
<p><em>He slides a piece of paper on her desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bernard:</strong> I’ve approved two weeks of paid leave. Go home. Get some rest. Pardon me for saying this, but you look awful.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I'm honestly fine! I just need a bit of time to gather the evidence for this idea I've been working on-</p>
<p><strong>Bernard:</strong> Ramona.</p>
<p><em>Bernard turns to face Ebenbacher.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bernard:</strong> You are a brilliant researcher. You've been doing a lot of good. All of us at Site-34 are very happy to have you here. But we can't have you wearing yourself out like this. A lot of research will have gone to waste. Is it really worth all this just to get your name on a paper?</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher says something inaudible. Bernard nods and leaves Ebenbacher‘s office. She stares at the door for several minutes after it closes, then buries her head in her arms on the desk. Her shoulders shudder slightly.</em></p>

<em>After some time, the door to Ebenbacher‘s office creaks open. Dr. Viktoria Kamm quietly enters the room as Ebenbacher looks up and wipes her face on her sleeve. She smiles and holds up the paper Bernard left her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Be honest. Was it you or Tyler that made Bernard do this?</p>
<p><em>Kamm chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> I‘d be lying if I didn’t say both.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Well, it’s a good birthday present at least.</p>
<p><em>Kamm gently puts her hand on Ebenbacher‘s.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Your birthday is in May. Not November.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher‘s face falls. She runs her free hand through her hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Fuck. Fuck. Whose birthday is this week, then?</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Hey, hey, relax. It’s okay. Probably one of your patients, right? Maybe that agent, Natalie-something? She’s been coming in a lot lately.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher squeezes Kamm‘s hand and steadies her breathing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Yeah, yeah, probably.</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Good, I think. I mean, I can’t give you any details really, but she reports sleeping better.</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Hmm, just as you’re sleeping worse?</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher hums a laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Correlation, just correlation. The last thing I need is suspicion at my own patients.</p>
<p><em>She shakes her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I don’t know, though. I think she wants something stronger. I keep telling her that treatment takes time, but she’s getting impatient.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher takes out a bottle of migraine medicine. She flips it over and frowns when she finds it empty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Take it easy on that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Why? It helps, even though it’s just a little bit.</p>
<p><em>Kamm sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Not exactly sure what it’s helping <em>with.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Well, something is pounding away in there.</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> That part of your "theory"?</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Tyler‘s idea, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Didn’t take him for much of a theorist.</p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> Maybe I’m rubbing off on him.</p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> God, I hope not.</p>
<p><em>She puts a series of images on Ebenbacher‘s desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> You’re clean, by the way. No degeneration. No excess tissues, no abnormalities, nothing. Your brain is as healthy as possible, given your occupation.</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher frowns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve got all the symptoms! Brain fog, forgetfulness, headaches, everything! That’s gotta be a neurodegenerative something?</p>
<p><em>Kamm wags her finger.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Correlation, remember?</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher groans in exasperation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm</strong> Rest will help. You can start doing that by taking your vacation. You gonna go visit your family before the holidays?</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher shakes her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ebenbacher:</strong> I, uh, I’ve been having that dream a lot. The one where a bunch of faces are staring at me and I know it’s them but I can’t make out the details. I think it’s best I avoid them for the time being. Especially my father. I’d rather not him see me like this.</p>
<p><em>Kamm‘s eyes widen briefly before she turns away from Ebenbacher.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamm:</strong> Oh, yeah, sure. Probably for the best. Anyway, see you!</p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher tries to question Kamm's odd response, but she quickly closes the door. Ebenbacher sighs.</em></p>

<p>Between February 2014 and May 2014, SCP-9026 saw a significant drop in patients (from roughly 5,000 new patients at its peak down to only 31 regulars by the end of May). This resulted in a large-scale downsizing of staff on-site. Simultaneously, Site-34‘s Dept. of Amnestic Research saw an influx of requests for supplementary or replacement treatments for SCP-9026.</p>
<p>During this time, queries to SCP-9026-A‘s database increased by 1,743%. Dr. Ebenbacher made up a majority of these inquiries; however, a small number of inquiries was made by an unregistered individual.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><em>Although the hermetic seal appeared to be just a simple padlock on the attic door, Ebenbacher knows that it encompasses far more. It‘s hermetic in the most ancient sense, a thaumaturgic labyrinth for anyone trying to get in. They would only have a few more minutes to get past Floor Four before the reality stabilizers automatically reactivated. That would be plenty of time.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Malloy stands beside her. Agent Kirsch has their backs. Ebenbacher isn’t happy they were there, per se, but she is relieved. It would make these next few steps all the more bearable.</em></p>
<p><em>"Ready?" Malloy turns to her.</em></p>
<p><em>She nodded. Kirsch steps around to open the door.</em></p>
<p><em>"Hold on, I gotta open it." Ebenbacher holds out her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>"Right, sorry. Force of habit."</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy had suggested they include Agent Kirsch in their plans. She, too, had been experiencing symptoms similar to Ramona‘s although not quite as severe. Malloy figured they probably wouldn’t get another chance to breach Floor Four, so they might as well bring Kirsch along. Two birds, one stone. Ebenbacher had reluctantly agreed.</em></p>
<p><em>"Did I ask her to come along?" Ebenbacher whispers to Malloy.</em></p>
<p><em>"No. I did, but you agreed."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher nods. "Okay, just checking.</em></p>
<p><em>The three enter an old, plank-floored attic. Dull gray-blue light seeps in from a window on the far side. Insulation hangs out loosely from in between the wall frames. Boxes pile around them as they explore the room. Kirsch stops over a slightly crooked floor panel and lifts it. She pokes around, eventually stands and frowns.</em></p>
<p><em>"Thought it was something I remembered. Guess not."</em></p>
<p><em>"It shouldn’t be," Ebenbacher interjects from among the boxes.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch scoffs. "You seem invested," she mutters.</em></p>
<p><em>"What were you hoping to find? If you don’t mind me asking." Malloy kneels beside Kirsch.</em></p>
<p><em>"Toys, mostly. My sister and I would hide them in our attic growing up. My mom would always throw them out if she found them. We’d play up there for hours, but we had to be quiet about it. My sister thought that made it more fun. It just stressed me the hell out."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher peers her head from around a pillar. "Can you two focus?"</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy walks over to her. "You know, you haven’t told us exactly what we’re looking for."</em></p>
<p><em>"A door."</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch rolls her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>"Right…" Malloy nods. "Well, what about the one we came-". He turns to point at the door back to Floor Three, only to see that it is now a speck in the distance. "We definitely haven’t travelled that far."</em></p>
<p><em>"This location is unstable. The-," Ebenbacher waves her hands around. "-house or whatever, it’s trying to replicate my memories, but this one didn’t come from me originally. It’s trying to fill in gaps that were never there, so it just ends up distorting the space around it. Like cutting up puzzle pieces to make them fit."</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy and Kirsch follow Ebenbacher as she finds another door. This one is mostly metal, with a push bar in the center. The inscription is too faded to make out. Ebenbacher pushes and they enter into a school building.</em></p>
<p><em>The team moves through the halls, trying every classroom door the come across. Most of them are locked, and the ones that are open lead to similar classrooms. Although Ebenbacher leads them through a single floor, the team repeatedly finds themselves on different levels of the school. At one point, Malloy leaves a place marker on a lower level. He later points to it below them as they continue. They keep walking for over two hours before Kirsch spots a massive vault door behind them as they turn a corner. Malloy, Ebenbacher, and Kirsch struggle to turn the handle, but eventually are able to pry it open. Kirsch directs Ebenbacher to be the one to actually open the door.</em></p>
<p><em>This door opens into a bright, open field. Fresh grass stretches in every direction for what seems like miles. In the distance, hills encircle the field in a gentle ring. Massive white clouds roll aimlessly across the sky. There is a slight breeze, which catches Ebenbacher‘s jacket as she marches through the green. Malloy and Kirsch try to keep up with her.</em></p>
<p><em>"Hey, Mona, we’ve been walking for hours. I think we can take a quick break."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher turns. "No. Not yet."</em></p>
<p><em>"C‘mon, Dr. E. What‘s the rush?" Kirsch pants.</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher turns to face them. "You two can stick around and 'frolic' all you want.</em> I <em>want to get myself back to normal as soon as possible, thank you." She whips around and continues through the field.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch chases after her and pulls her shoulder. "I want to feel better just as much as you do-".</em></p>
<p><em>"Clearly not. Otherwise you’d listen to my recommendations and keep moving."</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh, now you go with the doctor speak! Are you really that eager to get to sit around in your memories?"</em></p>
<p><em>"I don’t have memories! Not anymore!" Ebenbacher counters. "All I have are a bunch of puzzle pieces from different puzzles that someone is trying to jam together. Maybe you think they fit but when you look at the whole thing it’s just a bunch of nonsense!"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well while you’re playing with puzzles, I’ve been stuck in that same nightmare loop for years! I keep telling you nothing‘s working permanently."</em></p>
<p><em>"I keep telling you it takes time-".</em></p>
<p><em>"So your patients have to wait, but not you?"</em></p>
<p><em>"This is for me!"</em></p>
<p><em>"Then what about me?"</em></p>
<p><em>"You said you would do anything for a good night‘s sleep, right? Was that a lie? Are you not willing to confront your own mind?"</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch glowers at Ebenbacher and clenches her fist.</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy rushes between them. "I think it’s fine to keep moving," he addresses Kirsch. "But,“ he turns to Ebenbacher. "We can also slow down a bit."</em></p>
<p><em>The two stare at each other for a moment longer.</em></p>
<p><em>"Yeah, fine," Ebenbacher huffs.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch sighs.</em></p>
<p><em>"I know it’s hard. She’s just been going through a lot lately." Malloy starts walking.</em></p>
<p><em>"So have I," Kirsch mumbles.</em></p>
<p><em>As the team crests the hills, they see a small stone archway, completely alone and sticking out somewhat strangely, at the bottom of the hill. They get closer and notice that it doesn’t have a handle, but there are no other doors as far as any of them can tell. Ebenbacher pushes it open.</em></p>
<p><em>The door opens into a forest that has just begun autumn. Leaves crunch quietly as they walk. The air smells pleasantly of dead leaves and fresh dew. The team continues walking for some time until Malloy notes that the trees seem to be gradually aligning in rows as they walk. When he gets no response, he turns back to see Ebenbacher leaning heavily on a tree. Sweat glistens on her forehead and her eyes have somehow sunk even further back into her head. She tries to wave him off as he approaches.</em></p>
<p><em>"I‘m…fine…just…a minute…I need-"</em></p>
<p><em>"No. Sit. We’re stopping here." Malloy doesn’t look at her as he pulls a canteen from his pack.</em></p>
<p><em>"I‘m fine…honest…" Her head lolls forwards.</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy ignores her, hands her the canteen, and all but forces her to sit down. "Why are you doing this?" he whispers.</em></p>
<p><em>"Don‘t tell me you’re mad at me, too?" Ebenbacher manages a smile.</em></p>
<p><em>"So much for no breaks, huh?" Kirsch snickers.</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy glares deeply at her. She purses her lips and slowly turns away.</em></p>
<p><em>"We're staying here for no less than three hours, okay?" Malloy sets his pack next to Ebenbacher for her to lean on.</em></p>
<p><em>"That's not necessary…"</em></p>
<p><em>"I don't care. Get some sleep. I know you haven't been." Malloy gets up before he can hear her protests. He finds Kirsch nearby.</em></p>
<p><em>"Sorry. Didn't mean it like that. I just was trying to lighten the mood," Kirsch tentatively looks over at Malloy, who is sitting against a tree, arms folded tightly across his chest.</em></p>
<p><em>"It's fine." He doesn't look at her.</em></p>
<p><em>They sit in silence for a while, Malloy gradually loosening the tension in his face and shoulders. Kirsch decides to try again.</em></p>
<p><em>"Was she always like that?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Like what?" Malloy shoots Kirsch an irritated look.</em></p>
<p><em>"So…headstrong? Stubborn? Unable or unwilling to relax a bit?"</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy snorts. "From what I can tell? Probably."</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch hums.</em></p>
<p><em>"No idea where she gets it from. Her mother seems so nice and understanding."</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch raises an eyebrow. "You’ve met her?"</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy raises his hands in defense. "She tried to visit! Her whole family did. Mona hadn’t been answering calls or texts or even the few letters they sent. I had to to the whole Veil song and dance about what we do here." He sighs. "They really seemed concerned for her."</em></p>
<p><em>They sit in silence again.</em></p>
<p><em>"You ever heard about that one scientist who figured out how ulcers work?" Malloy stares off into the forest.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch shakes her head.</em></p>
<p><em>"He wanted to show how bacteria causes them in people, but no one wanted to be his guinea pig. So he drank the bacteria, got ulcers, then took an antibiotic and got better. Mona loves that story. Thinks it's inspiring." Malloy shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><em>"I think it's selfish." Kirsch sits down across from Malloy. "To force the people who care about you to watch you suffer."</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy doesn't answer. They let the silence once again come, disturbed only slightly by Ebenbacher's faint snoring. The three hours pass and Malloy's watch beeps. He goes to rouse her. "Nice nap? Feel better?"</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher smiles and shrugs. "I guess."</em></p>
<p><em>"Good."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher gestures to Kirsch as she walks off. "Is she supposed to be here?"</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy nods. "We agreed to have her come. She's got similar symptoms to you."</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh, okay."</em></p>
<p><em>They continue through the forest for about another hour, following the path of the trees as they continue to align themselves in neat rows. In the distance is a small clearing with a strangely ruined set of stairs leading to a decayed wooden door. The stairs are covered in a thick layer of moss and ferns, while the door is barely hanging onto its hinges. The door's decay is not ominous, but rather mysterious, and the faint smell of lichens and wet dirt hangs in the air. Ebenbacher approaches carefully and opens the door.</em></p>
<p><em>Rows and rows and rows of identical houses spread out in a grid all around them. The team has stepped out of the front door of one such house. Perfectly cut lawns, identical porches, and an endless, empty blue sky surround them on all sides. They agree to split up, but stay within sight of each other. Move methodically through the streets, they slowly make their way through the grid until Kirsch finds a door that opens and the team steps inside.</em></p>
<p><em>On the other side of the door is a small yet cozy apartment. The common area is hardly furnished, and it leads to a sparse kitchen on one side and a series of closets around a bedroom door on the other. A window on the far end of the space lets in foggy, gray light. Ebenbacher examines the furniture and decorations in excitement, peering out of the window to see faint outlines of a street below. She turns to the other two. "I think this room is stable."</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy looks at her in confusion.</em></p>
<p><em>"It's different, no? It's much more detailed and specific and… functional." She points at a television mounted on the wall. "I bet…" She finds a remote, pushes a button, and the TV clicks on, though only showing static. "It works! It works. Okay, that's good. That's good."</em></p>
<p><em>"Do you remember this place?" Malloy nods slowly.</em></p>
<p><em>"I don't…think so? But that's okay! This is still progress. I can use this. It's…" She waves her hands around in thought. "It's like the corner piece of a puzzle. You can easily build off of it because it's a stable edge, and then you have a whole corner section, and then other sections start coming together… It's a place to start. Keep looking around, see if any of the space here is distorted."</em></p>
<p><em>Malloy begins looking into the closets while Kirsch slips into the kitchen. Ebenbacher opens the door to the bedroom and freezes. On the bed is a ratty, barely together stuffed bear. Ebenbacher nods in understanding. "Natalie, you opened the door to here, right?"</em></p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><em>"Natalie?"</em></p>
<p><em>A sharp crack and loud thud startle Ebenbacher. She spins around to see Kirsch, skillet in hand, standing over Malloy. "It had to be that stupid bear, huh?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Na-natalie? …what?" Ebenbacher can hardly get the words out of her mouth.</em></p>
<p><em>"Sorry Dr. E, but I'm not taking any chances."</em></p>
<p><em>"…what?" Ebenbacher stares in shock. "You…hit him?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Not hard, I think." She drags Malloy to the door as Ebenbacher watches in horror. "He'll be fine." She opens the door and rolls Malloy out. "Probably. Okay, now your turn."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher's face drains.</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh relax, I don't want to kill you. I just need you out of commission for a bit."</em></p>
<p><em>"Why?" Ebenbacher squeaks.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch looks annoyed. "Not really your business."</em></p>
<p><em>"Where's Tyler?" Ebenbacher keeps her eyes locked on Kirsch.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch shrugs. "Hope you find him, though. But if you do end up dead out there, it's not my problem anyway."</em></p>
<p><em>"What if-" Ebenbacher steadies herself. "What if i just leave you be?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Ah, well." Kirsch waves her suggestion away. "I really need you to be out</em> and <em>disoriented for a while. Gives me plenty of time to go through doors and spend enough time in each one."</em></p>
<p><em>"Why?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Can you stop asking stupid questions and hold still? It'll hurt less." Kirsch dives for Ebenbacher.</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher ducks under her and crashes into the kitchen. She pulls a steak knife from the table and holds it out, trembling, against Kirsch.</em></p>
<p><em>"Oh, Dr. E, no. See, I'm combat trained. That's not going to work."</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsch sidesteps Ebenbacher‘s advance and flicks the knife from Ebenbacher‘s grasp into her own. She tuts as Ebenbacher stumbles into the next room. "Careful, these are dangerous."</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher desperately throws objects from the coffee table behind her, not looking, hoping it’s enough to at least distract Kirsch. As she scrambles, her hands close around something heavier and metal. She grabs it and turns around to swing at Kirsch. Kirsch, already upon her, ducks and plunges the knife into Ebenbacher‘s side.</em></p>
<p><em>Darkness curls around Ebenbacher‘s vision. She gasps as Kirsch withdraws the knife, and Ebenbacher slowly crumples to the floor.</em></p>
<p><em>"Dr. E! Look what you made me do." Kirsch‘s voice is one more of mild annoyance. She grabs a towel from the kitchen and wipes the knife as Ebenbacher drags herself towards the door. Noticing the pool of blood underneath Ebenbacher, Kirsch kneels down and places the towel under the hand clutching her side. Ebenbacher tries to shrink away, and a single word gurgles from her lips.</em></p>
<p><em>"Enough with the questions! Focus on yourself. Not that you have any trouble doing that already." Kirsch pulls away in disgust. "Why, why, why? Is that all you can say now?" She goes back to the kitchen, but turns around and points at Ebenbacher. "I wish I had all the answers you think I do, Dr. E! Why do we have to die in the dark? Why do some of us die while others get to live? Who gives a shit about living in the light of none of</em> us <em>get to see it!" She is breathing heavy. She goes into the bedroom, grabs the stuffed bear, and pulls a chair up from the kitchen to face Ebenbacher.</em></p>
<p><em>Ebenbacher struggles to pull herself up to sit against the apartment door. Her face is sickly pale. Blood trickles from her mouth. Kirsch sighs, her eyes fixed on the stuffed bear. As Ebenbacher fumbles for the door handle, she hears Kirsch mumble.</em></p>
<p><em>"I want better memories, not these visions of my friends dying every time I close my eyes. But I don’t want to forget them. I don’t want to be amnesticized. I want some better memories in there, even if they don’t fit quite right. I’ll keep trying, as long as it takes-"</em></p>
<p><em>The door clicks shut as Ebenbacher tumbles out of it. She impacts the ground with a thump and a scream.</em><br/>

<p>Get the fuck up, Ramona. Get up. You lazy fuck. Get up. It’s not that bad. Get up- <em>her mind focuses on one single thought, a command echoing in the back of her consciousness. She mumbles curses to herself as she gradually, achingly pushes herself to her feet. The soles of her boots scrape against blacktop. She stumbles, her legs moving mechanically through a street that she knows well. It is surrounded on both sides by rows of red brick apartment buildings, ranging from four to six stories high. Thin trees dot the sidewalk, providing a small amount of shade, although there is no sun in the sky. The trees themselves are protected from pedestrians by short, black, arched fences.</em></p>
<p><em>She trips up the stairs to Apartment 38. She slides off the railing, her hand slick with blood. She punches in the door code. She knows it by heart. She waits.</em></p>
<p><em>The door buzzes.</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Ramona Ebenbacher sits at the coffee table in her family‘s small apartment, reading one of her father‘s science magazines. Most of the technical words go over her head, but she is fascinated nonetheless. Apparently biologists are planning to clone a sheep next year. Her name will be Dolly.</em></p>
<p><em>The chair in the other room scrapes against the floor. Ramona quietly gets up and peaks around the wall. Her father has put his head in his arms on the table. Her mother touches his back gently.</em></p>
<p><em>"God, this school will be expensive," her father sighs.</em></p>
<p><em>"But it will be worth it. She’s so smart. She will use everything that we give to her." Her mother reassures him.</em></p>
<p><em>"I know, I know. I would rather eat dirt than let these opportunities slip away from her. I will make it work. She deserves it."</em></p>
<p><em>Ramona stopped asking for presents for her birthday. She tried to sabotage her father’s efforts to figure out what to get her. She still received them.</em></p>
<p><em>For some reason, Ramona wants to keep this memory.</em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p><em>Ramona Ebenbacher graduates at the top of her class. She is ready to give her valedictorian speech. Her father is in the front row. He sits in a wheelchair, as he is now too weak to move around. He insisted on being there, even though she can tell he is struggling to hide his pain. Ramona asks the salutatorian to speak first. She isn’t ready to go out yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Ramona decides she wants to keep this memory too.</em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher misses her first week of work at the SCP Foundation. Instead, she is in the hospital, at her father‘s bedside. He tells her how proud he is, how he has absolutely no regrets, that no matter what she does, she will be great. She misses the next week of work, as well.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Item #:</strong></span> SCP-9026</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Object Class:</strong></span> Safe</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span> Staff stationed at SCP-9026 must rotate every 4 months to mitigate risk of SCP-9026 overexposure. Personnel treated by SCP-9026 must adhere to a regiment of mnestics during treatment and for no less than three weeks afterward. Personnel treated by SCP-9026 who suspect they may be under the influence of overexposure should use this file and the SCP-9026-A database to cross check any memories they may have lost or exchanged.</p>
<p>Foundation agents are currently in the process of tracking down individuals whose entries are recorded in SCP-9026-A to determine if they require amnestization.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-9026 is the sole documented origin point of a pseudo-organic multi-nodal Richards-Keeley fractal complex. It exhibits standard spatio-temporal distortion and is designated a Class Gamma Location. SCP-9026 has demonstrated the ability to "store" instances of the memories of sapient creatures that enter it. It is then able to recreate a physical space based on the memory of the individual. The stability of this space is based primarily one the individual's ability to recall it. Other factors include the manifested memory's relation to other memories the individual has.</p>
<p>SCP-9026-KLEIN is an organic compound found within the brains of individuals affected by severe SCP-9026 overexposure (also referred to as "Ebenbacher syndrome"). It is theorized that SPC-9026-KLEIN plays a role in the acquiring and storage of memories within SCP-9026. This compound can only be detected by mapping the Hume distortions in an effected person‘s brain.</p>
<p>SCP-9026-A is a two-part catalogue of all patients whose memories are stored in SCP-9026. The first part of SCP-9026-A is leather-bound journal recovered from SCP-9026. Written records of the memories of patients treated by SCP-9026 appear in the journal, though they are not in chronological order. These records are believed to encompass most, if not all, memories stored in SCP-9026 prior to containment. The second part of SCP-9026-A is a database stored on Foundation servers of all Foundation personnel treated by SCP-9026. This database appeared approximately one week following containment of SCP-9026, and coincides with the first member of Foundation staff treated by on-site psychologists. Many entries in the journal also appear in the database.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum: Record of SCP-9026 Containment Breach</strong></span></p>
<p>On 06/03/2014, a containment breach occurred at SCP-9026. Dr. Ramona Ebenbacher, Dr. Tyler Malloy, and Agent Natalie Kirsch entered SCP-9026 in direct violation of general containment policy. After 72 hours, Dr. Ebenbacher and Dr. Malloy emerged in critical condition from SCP-9026. Dr. Ebenbacher was treated for a punctured lung and severe blood loss. Dr. Malloy was found with extremely high levels of mnsetics in his system. He was treated for a concussion, severe brain trauma, and cognitive overload. Dr. Malloy has been able to return to work with SCP-9026, but has requested a transfer. Following her experience inside SCP-9026, Dr. Ebenbacher resigned from the Foundation. She currently lives with her mother and is undergoing treatment for severe PTSD and anterograde amnesia.</p>
<p>Roughly three weeks following the breach, Agent Natalie Kirsch‘s body was discovered outside SCP-9026. She was catatonic upon discovery and was placed in a medically induced coma. She is not expected to recover. Hume readings of Agent Kirsch confirmed Dr. Ebenbacher and Dr. Malloy‘s theories on the nature of SCP-9026 and the existence of SCP-9026-KLEIN.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Malloy published Dr. Ebenbacher's theory on memory compartmentalization, titled "The Puzzle Piece Model", shortly after the incident. This model has been widely accepted due to Ebenbacher's thourough experiments and a congruent model developed by the Department of Amnestics Research. Dr. Ebenbacher was awarded the Foundation Medal of Science for her work. She was unable to accept this award due to the effects of severe SCP-9026 overexposure.<br/>
