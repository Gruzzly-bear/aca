<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keter</span> Neutralised</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> If any employees of GoI-119 are discovered, they are to be detained and brought to the nearest Foundation facility for questioning. Any further locations found to be associated with GoI-119 shall be acquired by any means necessary. If acquisition is impossible, non-Foundation personnel shall be turned away at a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">30-meter</span> 100-meter perimeter, which is to be patrolled by members of MTF Gallahad-7 "Arthur's Arrow." MTF member are to asume the guise of local law enforcement, and are to deploy cover story Aleph-112 (sinkhole) until acquisition can be achieved or the location is abandoned or destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2016/06/25:</strong> TURING.aic shall search all internet communications and scan letters in mail depots for mentions of the "Manticore Express." If any are found, they are to be flagged as a level 𐤓 priority.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9835 was a building located in North Wales, which operated from 2001 to 2016 under the name "The Manticore Hotel.". While in operation, SCP-9835 was a multiversal hub for anomalous activity, kept in check by GoI-119 "The Manticore Corporation". SCP-9835 appeared to only be 30m tall when observed from the outside but its true height was estimated at 3048m.</p>
<p>SCP-9835 currently lays in ruin, with very little of the structure remaining. Following 2016/05/23, all anomalous activity has ceased.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9835 was discovered in 2016 following the investigation of several missing persons reports in the area. The bodies were found in a creek, roughly 25-metres away from SCP-9835's entrance.</p>
<p>The remainder of this file is intercut with select logs of events that occurred within SCP-9835. A full version of the event logs can be requested from Site Director Billiam Hundred for academic or research purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-9835-1:</strong> On May 7th 2016, Dr. Pearl Langstrum, Site-3 Counselor<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, was selected to lead the investigation into SCP-9835. Three hours after entering the building, she met a member of Janitorial Services who, upon realizing Dr. Langstrum worked for the Foundation, led her to an unused break room for the interview below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum sits on a makeshift chair made of baskets and dirty socks. Across from her June Kalileo sits on a similar makeshift chair, looking down at her feet and twitching nervously.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Are there no chairs back here?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Apparently Manticorp<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> can't be bothered to get any for this break room.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum adjusts her position slightly and brushes her hair out of her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> So, I'm supposed to ask you a few questions. Are you alright answering them?</p>
<p><em>June Kalileo looks at Dr. Langstrum as she twiddles her thumbs.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Sure…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Please, don't be worried, I'm a therapist by trade and I always practice client confidentiality. I won't ask you to share anything too personal.</p>
<p><em>June sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Alright, first question, how'd you get hired?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Woah, straight to the throat.</p>
<p><em>June chuckles awkwardly and removes her jacket before pointing to the many tattoos covering her left arm. Dr. Langstrum leans in and admires them.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> They said I was the right poster girl for the job.</p>
<p><em>June blushes slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> I-I guess the compliments won me over and… here I am.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum leans back and scribbles on her clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> A poster girl for <em>Janitorial services</em>?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> I'm not usually a janitor. My main job is doing model work for their advertisements, It's not great pay but I enjoy the work… and the company of my colleagues…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Makes sense. Second question, Do you like working here?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Of course I do! I have this job to thank for finding my lovely wife!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum blinks and tilts her head to one side.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Wife?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Oh sorry, that's a deep question, ignore me.</p>
<p><em>June glares at Dr. Langstrum for a few seconds before continuing.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Anyways… I like working here. Get health insurance and retirement benefits. So… that's nice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Yeah…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum places a hand to her chin, deep in thought. Upon realising that June Kalileo is staring at her, she shakes her head and adjusts her position slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Sorry. Third question. Have you seen anything… odd happening in this establishment? Behind the scenes I mean.</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> No, not really. What are we counting as odd?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Let's see, any ghouls, satanic rituals, or spooky wanderers in the libraries?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Not in my experience</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Alright, any criminal activity?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Nah. Unless you count the money stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> It's just a rumour as far as I'm aware, but the funding for this place supposedly comes from a "widespread embezzling scheme" across multiple universes, .</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Interesting. I would call that criminal activity.</p>
<p><em>15 seconds of silence passes.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Can I ask <em>you</em> a question?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Oh, sure.</p>
<p><em>June Kalileo stands and stares down at Dr Langstrum with a blank expression.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Do you like working for the Foundation?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum blinks and shrinks into herself slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> You seem on edge. Like you're hiding a massive weight on your shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> I…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum's eyes start glowing a nearly imperceptible light blue. June does not seem to notice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> (anxious) I can't talk about it.</p>
<p><em>June Kalileo nods slowly and turns.</em></p>
<p><strong>June Kalileo:</strong> Read between the lines and you might find what your looking for, Dr. Langstrum. I should get back to work.</p>
<p><em>June leaves the room leaving Dr. Langstrum alone. After a minute of heavy breathing, she stands and ends the recording.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-9835-2:</strong> On 2016/05/10, a very exasperated employee of GoI-119 approached Dr. Langstrum, informing her that one Sir Jamie Williams was willing to speak with her. After Dr. Langstrum received directions to where Sir Williams was located, the following interview was undertaken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum sits on an ornate wooden chair. Opposite her, Sir Jamie Williams lounges on a king sized bed. Dr. Langstrum taps her clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Thank you for doing this. By the way, this is… quite the lavish suite.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Of course. I am a Grand Finance Guru after all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> It says on my file you are an accountant?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Do not call me such a derogatory term! It is not befitting someone of my stature.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Alright, alright, I apologise. First question, how'd you get hired?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> 'Twas my birth right.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> That's not really an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> 'Twas my birth right!</p>
<p><em>A bunch of grapes roughly taped to a stick start slowly approaching Sir Williams' face, before gently tapping his cheek. He cranes his neck to eat one.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams (Muffled):</strong> Thank you serf.</p>
<p><em>The stick is suspended from a rotating fan. No servant is visible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Right… well, do you like working here?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Work? Ha! Don't be silly. I don't <em>work</em>, that's for the peasants and serfs. I <em>advise</em> the grand oracle with my great stock knowledge and market predictions.</p>
<p><em>Sir Williams reaches out for another grape before pantomiming someone feeding him, once again thanking the imaginary servant. He then pulls out a tablet with several market charts with incomprehensible scribbles covering them.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Sir Williams:</strong> As you can see, <em>little girl</em>, when it comes to the market, I can basically predict the future<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>. With my DOGEcoin know-how and my <em>rug-proof</em> <em>anti-pump</em> router, I am one of the top earners of Manticorp.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Alright…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum writes the words "A tad crazy" on her clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Third question, have you noticed any oddities in the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams</strong> Of course I have.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Firstly, there's a shocking lack of aides, but I suspect that's not what you want to know about. There are many unusual happenings in the guest rooms. Maybe if you got your own you'd be able to investigate better… I could tell you more, but I don't see what would be in it for me.</p>
<p><em>Sir Williams rubs his thumb and index together. Dr. Langstrum pulls a wallet from her coat pocket and rustles through it, clipboard rested on her lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Um, five quid?</p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Ten.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum pulls two £5 notes out of the wallet and places them in Sir Williams' extended hand. Sir Williams smirks before shoving the notes under his pillow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> At night, certain guests seem to do distressing and unusual acts while under a trance. I don't know anything else. Go find that High Seer… Rael Salha, she might have whatever it is you're looking for. Now…</p>
<p><em>Sir Williams lazily points to the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sir Williams:</strong> Please, leave.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> That I shall. Oh, and by the way, never call me little girl again, you don't know how out of your <em>depth</em> you are.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum shoves her wallet back into her pocket, picks up her clipboard and exits the room. Once she is halfway down the hallway, she shuts off the recording.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> I was 2 years old when the 1948 <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/about-the-nakba">Nakba</a> occurred. My family had to flee Yaffa. Most of us, including my parents and I, fled to Jordan, where we had a lot of troubles with money…</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Extraneous data removed.&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>About an hour in and 2 cocktails later, High Seer Salha and Dr. Langstrum are seen lounging together, much closer than before.</em></p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Anyways, I do believe I am ready to talk about Manticorp now. I can see you're itching with questions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Right, well, let's not waste any more time then, Rael! How did you get hired here? I believe I know, but for the record, please.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum orders another Ocean Water.</em></p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> As I had mentioned, when we fled to Jordan we had very little on us. As soon as I was of working age, I started doing odd jobs for shady people under the table. Eventually, in 1992, I caught the eye of a certain Margaret Manticore. She asked me to join this fledgling operation called the Manticore Corporation. She said my skills I had developed working with "The Esoteric" would come in handy. I wasn't quite sure what she meant and felt quite reluctant. However, she then promised safety for my family and told me that Manticorp would protect them in any future time of need. Now you see why I couldn't say no.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Right, of course. So I assume you don't like working there, then. Is that why you are willing to risk yourself outing these secrets?</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Correct. Hence, why we met here. Manticorp has many prying eyes and ears at that Hotel. After they did nothing to protect my family in 2014… well, I lost the last bit of faith holding me here. Since then I've been gathering as much data as I could while waiting for my chance to leave.</p>
<p><em>High Seer Salha takes a long sip of coffee before reclining and letting out a content sigh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> And those secrets?</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Right right, I'm sorry, this coffee is so good that I got lost in memories that aren't mine. Most of the "anomalous events", as you call them, are from manticorp's main experiment, a ritual to fully access the noosphere for power, knowledge, maybe both. Even in my high position, I am not privy to exactly why they are doing it, but just know, not only are their goals most definitely <em>not good</em>, but interacting with the noosphere like that can have very dangerous results. People have been liquified, they've gained awareness of things they shouldn't — mustn't — know. Then those hostile ideas rip them apart. If you want to find out more specifics, I suggest you get a room, as most activity happens in the night or evening. First thing you should do when you get in is look for a silver grey capsule in your room near the ceiling fan. It is how they send out frequencies to manifest their hostile patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> I shall do that thank you for your help. If you would like, I'm sure I can find you a position in the Foundation. We would surely be able to keep you safe from Manticorp.</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Please Pearl, don't ask that, you already know what I'll say. I will not make the same mistake twice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Anyways, I come from a long line of fighters, we can take care of ourselves.</p>
<p><em>The two sit in silence for a few uncomfortable minutes. Dr. Langstrum, now visibly drunk, shuffles slightly while still being close to Rael.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Can I ask you somethin? It's not part of this interview doohickey.</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Why did those people find that flesh exchanging act 'romantic'? What does that even mean?</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> That's quite a tough question to answer. I guess it really depends on the person what they find romantic. Why are you asking?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Long story.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum sighs deeply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Langstrum:</strong> It just… keeps coming up, all the time. Things keep coming back to this love garbage, and no one is willing to give me a blargin' definition of the thing. It all just seems gross, in all honesty.</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Hm, well…</p>
<p><em>High Seer Salha shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> I guess, from an outsider's perspective, all love can seem gross. The whole thing of "exchanging fluids" sounds gross without the context.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> What about that swapping thingy? How the hell is self-mutilation romantic?</p>
<p><strong>High Seer Salha:</strong> Well, while some might have found the act itself as romantic, maybe some found the thought of bringing yourself closer to your partner romantic in and of itself. Like making it so your partner is always a part of you. It sounds nice if you phrase it like that, right?</p>

<td>At 03:15, a congregation of humanoids in crimson, citrine, and cerulean robes gathered around a newly-built central altar. A naked figure hung by their hair from the altar, as if unaffected by gravity. The subjects in crimson robes surrounded the naked figure and used knives to pare off thin cuts of flesh. The subjects then consumed the flesh while chanting, "Oh, great knowing one, feast your eyes upon our offering and impart to him your knowledge, so we may feast upon it as well!" At this point, the figure, who had previously shown no signs of discomfort, began to writhe and scream. Their body was observed to elongate and stretch towards the domed roof. As it reached the roof, a shockwave was felt in a radius of 300km. It appears this was not an intended part of the ritual, and caused it to be interrupted prematurely. <span style="font-size:0%;">Log 213: We have finally made our perfect ritual but it seems something doesn't want us to complete it. We shall reinforce the warding on the chapel and add additional steel framing to prevent physical damage to it. Furthermore we shall do the next attempt on a more auspicious date. ~Seer Nazea</span></td>

<td>From 22:00-06:00, several screams and cries were heard throughout the hotel. All those asleep seemed in immense distress, some kicking and screaming while others started sleepwalking. The sleepwalkers were extremely aggressive, some even killing their fellow occupants. In a dream journal belonging to Madelaine Sainte-Foie, she describes a nightmare where she is running from a cognitohazardous entity, one which would kill her if she knew what it was. She then gets herself cornered, at which point she allegedly "closed her eyes and fought back." During the coinciding sleepwalk, she ran around the room in a panic before grabbing a pillow and smothering her husband to death. Dr. Langstrum theorized these events were caused by the prior day's incomplete ritual. <span style="font-size:0%;">log 214: I had a terrible nightmare last night, and it seems I wasn't the only one. infernal cries rung out throughout the hotels east wing, staff are currently cleaning up the bloodbath <strong>it</strong> left behind.

At the cessation of the chant, the domed ceiling disappeared, revealing a void-like manifestation believed to represent a portion of the noosphere. The cerulean subjects approached the figure on the altar and cut their hair, causing them to "fall" into the void above. All robed figures immediately ceased signs of life, and their bodies were observed to float several centimetres off the ground. When the clock struck 03:33, a distant explosion was heard. Over the next two minutes, several more explosions and screams were heard throughout SCP-9835. At 03:35, the robed figures fell to the ground and began vocalizing loudly about [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED] before rapidly liquefying into SCP-9835-1<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-16" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-16')">16</a></sup>.

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-9835-4:</strong> Upon acquisition of a room, Dr. Langstrum seemingly forgot to turn off her bodycam. The following footage was recorded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Start Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum stands on a chair, her upper half not visible due to the positioning of the bodycam, which is seemingly on a desk. After 3 minutes, she hops to the ground and stomps at something out of view.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> There we go. They hid that thing well, I'll give them that.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum kicks the chair away before sitting on the edge of her bed. After a minute of slow breathing, she removes her labcoat and scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Neptune's beard, this place is hot.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum stretches as she mutters incoherently. After 5 minutes, she sighs and places her hands on her knees.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> …it's quite lonely in here too.</p>
<p><em>She does not move for a few seconds as she stares on aimlessly. Suddenly, she falls back onto the bed, sighing louder than before.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> What even is love?</p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> I keep getting confronted with it but I don't know what it even is.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum spends several minutes staring at the ceiling fan while softly shaking. She then notices the camera is on and turns it off with a raspy breath, her face red and eyes dry.</em></p>

<td>At 03:35, several loud bangs were heard throughout the hotel as all the water in the pipes was transformed into SCP-9835-1. Many of the lower floors instantly flooded, causing all occupants caught within to liquefy into SCP-9835-1. By 03:37, Screams, wails and a screeching rendition of Fur Elise could all be heard over the continued banging, which by then was amplified by multiple of the upper floors collapsing due to the rapidly diminishing structural integrity. An exacerbating factor at this point was that several parts of the hotel folded into the noosphere, decaying into pure concepts. Ten minutes in, several hostile memeplexes started manifesting as well, preying on the few remaining survivors. After twenty minutes of worsening conditions, an explosion, described as a "second sunrise" from civilians of towns up to 300km away, occurred on the four hundred and fifty second floor and propagated throughout the hotel until nothing remained. Eight minutes following this, in the rubble of SCP-9835, an amphibian humanoid who rapidly morphed into Dr. Langstrum appeared. Following passphrase verification, they were brought to a nearby outpost for medical care.</td>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-9835-5:</strong> Two weeks after the destruction of SCP-9835, MTF Gallahad-7 were able to restore enough of Dr. Langstrum's bodycam footage to create the following transcript of her escape.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> The heck?</p>
<p><em>Another loud bang can be heard as the room starts to shake. Dr. Langstrum quickly scrambles to her feet, getting dressed as the lights start to flicker.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum grabs the bodycam, attaches it to her breast pocket and runs out of the room. The hallway seems to be empty, cracks on every surface shining white light as the ceiling starts to creak. An electronic voice starts to talk, coming from Dr. Langstrum's earpiece, although it is barely picked up by the bodycam.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr Langstrum:</strong> On it!</p>
<p><em>Dr Langstrum does as commanded, quickly running down the stairs as the distant noise of ceilings collapsing draws closer. She tries to continue down the stairs, but as soon as she steps onto floor 6, the stairway collapses in on itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Langstrum:</strong> Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>Captain. Ark:</strong> Find the maintenance tunnels, there should be stairs back there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Yes sir…</p>
<p><strong>Captain Ark:</strong> Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> I see someone.</p>
<p><em>A vaguely humanoid figure comes into view on the other side of the corridor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> GOD, SAVE US! LORD, HELP!</p>
<p><strong>Captain Ark:</strong> Ignore them!</p>
<p><em>A second figure materializes, clutching their head with their fingers melding into their hair. Their eyes are melting. After a few seconds, they start to screech a distorted rendition of "Fur Elise".</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Oh shut up!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum runs forwards, ignoring the figures as she begins bashing against a door labeled "Staff Only". The door gives way after three kicks, revealing distinctly dull grey maintenance tunnels. Dr Langstrum runs through the corridors until she finds the stairs. Upon finding them, she begins to rush down them. Suddenly, upon descending 8 flights, the stairs disappear and the surrounding area turns into bright white light.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum stands on a concrete platform. The white sky around her is blocked out by twisted shapes. Hundreds of distinct, pained voices screech in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> THE PAIN IS ENDLESS! FREE US FROM OUR SACRIFICIAL BONDS!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum (Panting):</strong> Please… stop…</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> <strong>THE ONE WHO KNOWS</strong> BREATHES FIRE ON OUR HEARTS! THE PEOPLE WHO MADE US LAMBS RUN FREE WITH POWER BEYOND YOUR BELIEF!</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> Help…</p>
<p><strong>Captain Ark:</strong> L-</p>
<p><em>A loud crackle rings out as Dr. Langstrum's earpiece crumbles to dust. <strong>The patterns</strong> around her begin to expand and block out the light as their voices grow louder.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> WE ARE MEANING! WE ARE COPIES OF SHELLS OF FORMER PEOPLE! WE KNOW EVERYTHING FOR WE ARE ONE WITH EVERYTHING!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum's breathing intensifies as fins grow out of her forearms. Webbings connect her fingers.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> IN EFFIGY, IN MEMORIUM! WE ARE NO LONGER BEINGS BUT IDEAS! WE ARE GONE, WE ARE NO MORE! YOU CAN JOIN US! YOU CAN BECOME UNSTOPPABLE! YOU CAN BECOME ONE WITH US IN FREEDOM!</p>
<p><em>The water rises further, completely submerging Dr. Langstrum, who continues to hyperventilate as gills form on their neck and their skin turns a shade of green.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> BECOME WHO YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE!</p>
<p><em>The remaining parts of Dr. Langstrum transform into a more amphibian form.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> BECOME ONE WITH YOUR TRUE FORM!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> <em>SHUT UP</em>!!!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum thrusts her arms around, the surrounding area transforming into a blank void as <strong>the shapes</strong> screech in agony.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> I am not going back to who I was. I may not know what any of this human shit means, but I'll keep trying if it means I can be happy.</p>
<p><em>As the shapes fade away, Dr. Langstrum morphs back into a human form. Once all the amphibian traits subside, she starts to walk forward aimlessly. After 6 hours of walking in silence, Dr. Langstrum opens a door and steps out into a clearing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Langstrum:</strong> …What?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Langstrum turns around to see a pile of gravel where SCP-9835 once stood.

Dr. Langstrum lets out a weak chuckle before falling backwards onto the ground, unconscious.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Dr. Langstrum's transformation in the noosphere is believed to be a result of complete submersion in SCP-9835-1. Dr. Langstrum has not refuted this assumption.</p>
