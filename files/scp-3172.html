            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3172</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area containing SCP-3172 is to be concealed behind an erected two meter tall concrete wall, which is to be patrolled by security personnel regularly. Any individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-3172 are to be apprehended, interviewed and administered amnestics as appropriate.</p>
<p>Any satellite imagery of SCP-3172 is to be altered to remove evidence of its anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3172 is a field on the outskirts of Los Angeles which, every <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">one to two</span> three to four months, displays rapid growth and death of numerous types of flowers, forming images and words. Evidence suggests that SCP-3172 is currently inhabited by multiple human consciousnesses which are able to use these flowers as a form of communication with the outside world.</p>
<p>Images formed by SCP-3172 usually take the form of faces of prominent celebrity actors. Testimony from long-term interviewing of SCP-3172 indicate that the consciousnesses inhabiting it are, or believe themselves to be, these individuals. However, all known individuals displayed by SCP-3172 have been confirmed to be alive and active<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">, with no knowledge of SCP-3172</span>. (See Interview 3172-2.)</p>
<p>The consciousnesses inhabiting SCP-3172 are cognizant of all events that occur in it, and testimony indicates that this is based on an anomalous sense unrelated to sight or hearing. When questioned, SCP-3172 have been unable to adequately describe how they perceive events occurring in SCP-3172, claiming that they simply 'know' what is occurring.</p>
<p>Records suggest that, prior to containment, SCP-3172 and the land surrounding it were the property of GoI-1783 ("Westhead Media").</p>

<p>Interview conducted with ███ ██████, one of the individuals SCP-3172 identified itself as. Mr. ██████ was brought into temporary custody for the purposes of this interview, which was supervised by security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Doctor Bryant<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> ███ ██████</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Apologies for any inconvenience, Mr. ██████, we just need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> No problemo. (laughs) What are you, uh, what do you guys want to know?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Are you familiar with an organization called Westhead Media?</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> Can't say I am. Why're you asking?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> You seem unsure.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> Well, it's a big business. I've worked with a lot of folks, you know? It's hard to remember them all off the top of my head.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Ah. I understand. I'll give you a few minutes to try and remember.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> Oh, I —</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Please don't worry, Mr. ██████, I'm a very patient man. You take your time.</p>
<p><em>(Silence for several minutes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> Well, thinking back on it, I might have heard the, uh, the name, um, once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Well, I'm glad to hear that. And where did you hear the name once or twice, Mr. ██████?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> I, uh — not sure —</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Say again?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> I said I'm not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><em>(Doctor Bryant shows Mr. ██████ a photograph of SCP-3172. He visibly pales.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> I —</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Are you familiar with this location, Mr. ██████?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> Um, I, uh, I —</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> You seem distressed.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. ██████:</strong> I — I'm not going back!</p>
<p>(At this point, Mr. ██████ attempted to attack Doctor Bryant and had to be restrained by security personnel. During the altercation, Mr. ██████ attempted to wrestle one of the security personnel's firearms out of their hands and the weapon discharged, killing Mr. ██████.)</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the death of Mr. ██████, analysis of his corpse by on-site personnel revealed that it was genetically identical to numerous species of flowers common in SCP-3172. His body is currently in storage at Site-22.</p>
<p>A search of Mr. ██████'s home revealed numerous correspondences between himself and an unknown representative of Westhead Media regarding an upcoming role in a film entitled <em>The Opening of Night</em>. From these correspondences, it has been discerned that this film features a large cast and is to be filmed at a large range of locations, several of which are not present on any known maps. No information on this film outside of these correspondences has been found.</p>
<p>Under the purview of Project KALEIDOSCOPE, a substitute body was prepared and deposited near Mr. ██████'s home in Los Angeles in accordance with the cover story of a mugging gone wrong.</p>

<p>The following is a transcript of a call made by PoI-1783 ("The Westhead") to Doctor Bryant's home following initiation of investigation into individuals named by SCP-3172.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Doctor Bryant<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Westhead</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> Hey there, champ<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Who am I speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> This is Westhead. I've been, uh, hearing some stories that you kids are spying on some of our employees?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> So they <em>are</em> in your employ?</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> (laughs) Guilty as charged. I employ a hell of a lot of people. But, ah, what you're doing now is pretty rude, I gotta say, and I'm sure it's not legal. So my board of directors is saying it's best for us to issue a formal cease and desist. So, ah, cease and desist.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> Your board of directors?</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> Are you trying to grill me right now, champ?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> I'm just asking a question.</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> You ever see a kid get hit by a truck?</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> A truck, I said.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> I don't…I don't see how that's relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> Look, I'll give it to you straight, champ. I'm sure there's a field out there whose flowers would love to walk and talk and breathe in that skin of yours.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Doctor Bryant:</strong> I'll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Westhead:</strong> I really hope you do, champ. I really hope you do.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tracing of the call made to Doctor Bryant revealed it to originate from a public payphone on Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles. Surveillance of the phone at the time of the call showed no individuals approaching or using it.</p>
<p>Investigation into the remaining individuals named by SCP-3172 is currently ongoing.</p>
