<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-8440 manifestations are impossible to anticipate or record, containment efforts must focus on information control regarding the circumstances leading up to an SCP-8440 event. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Cooperation with NASA on a coverup regarding degenerate stars and supernovae within 1000 light years of the Solar System.</span></li>
<li>Full knowledge sterilization at all major space agencies and astronomical institutions,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> including amnesticization of staff and introduction of artificial aversion traumas towards extinction-level events.</li>
<li>Seize and replace all instrumentation readings showing the presence of degenerate stars or soft gamma repeaters in Earth's stellar neighborhood".<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
<li>The following false narratives must be promoted through the usual channels:
<ul>
<li>Catastrophic star collapse activity in the Milky Way (e.g. Gamma-Ray Bursts<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>) is both rare and poses no threat to Earth in the near-term future.</li>
<li>Earth was last impacted by a Gamma-Ray Burst 445 million years ago.</li>
<li>The consensus understanding of astrophysics is largely accurate and can be relied on to predict stellar phenomena.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Updated 3/31/2022:</strong> The shuttlecraft that carried the RTM-1 crew that was previously declared MIA must be intercepted once landed. Any survivors recovered must be interned, questioned, nerve-stapled, and given identity-reassignment amnesticization, as per Foundation "Closed Casket" protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Updated 4/2/2022:</strong> All documentation produced regarding SCP-8440 is sealed under Level-5 Classification. Pending further review.
<ul>
<li>As per Ethics Committee guidelines, personnel with insufficient clearance attached to the project before 4/2/2022 will be offered significant financial incentives for accepting voluntary amnesticization.</li>
<li>Personnel found in possession of SCP-8440 materials without authorization are subject to disciplinary action, including amnesticization and summary nerve stapling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional resources have been directed toward off-planet colonization efforts in the event SCP-8440 <em>fails</em> to occur.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8440 is an unknown, astronomical entity that is in between Earth's stellar neighborhood and catastrophic core-collapse phenomena of failed stars. The extent of SCP-8440’s capabilities is unknown, even based on [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p>SCP-8440-1 refers to degenerate stars located within Earth's stellar neighborhood possessing a rotational axis facing Earth, indicating a GRB targeting Earth had previously occurred. The frequency of SCP-8440 manifesting is estimated based on the discovery of stars matching this description.</p>
<p>SCP-8440-2 refers to stars in Earth's stellar neighborhood that possess several key characteristics. These include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal stage stellar behavior.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Indications of imminent core collapse behavior.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Accelerated progression through stellar lifecycle.</li>
<li>Observed, possibly anomalous discrepancies between estimates of stellar mass and gravitational behavior of star.</li>
</ul>
<p>When SCP-8440-2 undergoes a core collapse sequence, it will discharge a stream of energy along a lightyear-wide band with various projected effects on Earth. This ranges from destroying Earth’s biosphere to vaporizing the crust entirely. When this occurs, SCP-8440 will manifest to neutralize the incoming ejected energy.</p>
<p>The nature of core-collapse activity makes it impossible to detect a GRB before its effects have impacted Earth. Manifestations of SCP-8440 have been understood to detect incoming GRB activity aimed at Earth’s stellar neighborhood.</p>

<p>In 2002, SCP-8440 was encountered by NASA's satellite repair crew Commander Carlson Vilchez, Pilot Jon Duan, Mission Specialist Adam Yarrow, and Mission Specialist Pearl Makil. In their Repair Telescope Mission, NASA lost communication with the RTM-1 crew which was deemed MIA. In 2022, the RTM-1 shuttle suddenly returned and NASA received its signals and messages, along with one survivor, Carlson Vilchez.</p>
<p>The Foundation intercepted Vilchez before word of his return could be officially released to the public. After enacting a disinformation campaign, the Foundation took Vilchez in custody. Vilchez was unresponsive during the first interview. After 4 months of aided recovery, Vilchez was still unable to disclose anything regarding RTM-1. As of now, he is still in Foundation custody as a Person of Interest.</p>
<p>The Foundation managed to recover any recorded data that the RTM-1 shuttle contained and wiped it from NASA soon after.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AUDIO LOG - 1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This audio log reflects the last transmission of the Space Shuttle Hyperion before contact was lost with the vehicle. The transmission was intercepted by Foundation satellites. Source audio was used to generate forgeries to aid in cover-up efforts.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>GROUND CONTROL (Ground officer Tom Priest):</strong> GC, Hyperion, your air-to-grounds are enabled for the landing count. <em>[NOTE: Hyperion had not reentered the atmosphere, and there's no evidence of transmission at this time from Ground Control.]</em></p>
<p><strong>HYPERION (Commander Carlson Vilchez):</strong> Hyperion to Ground Control, think you've skipped ahead in the script.</p>
<p><strong>FLIGHT:</strong> Flight, Hyperion. Not quite following. No such transmission from GC occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> What's GC's malfunction?</p>
<p><strong>Makil</strong>: Hey Jon, maybe they're just excited to see you flying in action, What was it you said?</p>
<p><strong>Duan</strong>: Oh, you know what. Never-</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> <em>The only thing hotter than me in the sky is Jesus.</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan</strong>: <em>(Sighs)</em> That's the last time I go out drinking with you around.</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow</strong>: Hey team, I'm trying to diagnose at least four different instrumentation failures. Do you mind staying professional until I'm done figuring out how far up shit's creek we are?</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> You say <em>four</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Confirmed. Up is down; north is south; pressure readings could only be higher at the bottom of the ocean. Hell, if the temperature's accurate, we're bathing in the Sun.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Makil, stop jackjawing with Duan and help Yarrow. Duan, I want you in the cockpit ready to make moves in case things get hairy. Hyperion, Flight.</p>
<p><strong>Flight:</strong> Go ahead, Hyperion.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Getting some bugged readings on our end.</p>
<p><strong>Flight:</strong> Bugged?</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Flight, MMACs. The operative term is FUBAR.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Can we get some ground engineers on standby to walk us through diagnostics?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Uh, C-Carlson?! Starboard window!</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Pearl, I hope you only saw the literal Virgin Mary out there because…</p>
<p><em>(Brief pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearl:</strong> My…my eyes…</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Hyperion to GC, seems like my optical instrumentation is fried because I just glanced at a second sun. Only caught a peripheral glance. Pearl, wasn't so lucky, going to do what I can to-</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Hyperion to GC!</p>
<p><strong>Unknown voice, heavily distorted. Dialog approximated by AI using Shahi-Yockey Algorithm:</strong> FLAMES. FLAMES EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Say again, GC?</p>
<p><strong>Yarrow:</strong> What is GC's malfunction?</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Not sure. Let’s head back to the shuttle.</p>
<p><em>(Static.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> What happened to Adam?!</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> I don’t know! He was just behind me and-</p>
<p><em>(Static.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown voice:</strong> <em>(Static)</em> WE'RE BURNING- <em>(Static)</em> <em>[Ruptures in sound suggests scream distorted by progressing thermal damage to speaker's trachea in addition to electronic failures.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> <em>(Screaming)</em> DON'T’LOOK OUT THE WINDOW! <em>[From this point onward, crew behavior reflects the effects of a GRB impacting Earth at a low-medium intensity, with significant radiation and thermal damage to all onboard.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Jon…I got you. I- <em>(coughs with the sound of vomiting.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> There you guys are. Oh fuck, your faces.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Who…who's laughi-</p>
<p><em>(There is roaring believed to be oxygen in craft igniting.)</em></p>
<p><em>[NOTE: Timestamp of this data packet is identical to timestamp of transmission start.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Hyperion to Ground Control, think you've skipped ahead in the script…what the?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> …My eyes… I still have my eyes? They feel cold.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Jon!? Captain!?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I’m here! <em>(Shuffles)</em> My arm was melting into the seat…how-</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Thank God, you’re okay! I- <em>(she halts and lightly chokes until she exhales.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Just take some deep breaths, guys. It's okay. We're okay.</p>
<p><em>(A minute has passed.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez</strong> We should inform ground control.</p>
<p><em>(Vilchez is heard making her way to the communication receiver.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Hello? Ground control, this is commander Carlson Vilchez. Do you read us, over?</p>
<p><em>(No response.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Makil, what do the instruments say about our CO2 levels?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Sir, we <em>have</em> no instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> …Okay. Color me a born-again believer, Pearl. <em>(Forced attempt at laughter.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Pearl:</strong> I-uh<em>(clears throat).</em> Fuck, what was that? <em>(She huffs.)</em> At least the life support systems are still functioning, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> No, they're not. The power's completely out. Even the lights are off.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Jon, that's <em>bullshit.</em> What are we breathing? How is this place still lit?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Commander, I don't think we're finished with this yet.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> What now? Is the other sun back?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> We're accelerating <em>away</em> from Earth.</p>

<p><em>(Makil adjusts the knobs of the receivers while Vilchez holds the microphone near his mouth. He’s rubbing his eyes while slouching forward.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Static.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Come on.</p>
<p><em>(Vilchez and Makil continue their attempts to communicate to ground control. After a few minutes, Makil hammerfists the panels a few times which startles Vilchesz.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Makil!</p>
<p><strong>Makil</strong> Sorry, I just-</p>
<p><em>(Makil halts her speech suddenly and grips on her chest. She has quick and hoarded breathing while she quivers in her seat. Vilchez hastily leans forward to her and rests his hand on her shoulder to keep her still.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Breath! Breath, Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> It hurts- my skin hurts. <em>(She groans.)</em> Ah! I can’t see! Carlson?! Jon!</p>
<p><em>(From below deck, Duan hears shouting from above. He rushes to the ladder and climbs to the cockpit entrance. Upon seeing Makil’s episode, he gets closer to the pair and stares down at her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> I-I don’t know! She keeps saying she’s hurting but I don’t see injuries.</p>
<p><em>(Duan grabs one of her hands. She grips on his hand to the point where Duan grits his teeth. Despite this, Duan lays another hand on top of it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Pearl? Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> My eyes… They’re melting! God, help me, please!</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> You can hear us, right? We’re right here. We’re holding your hands. We’re not going anywhere. You are okay.</p>
<p><em>(Makil screams and thrashes from her seat that she bangs on the panels and even on Vilchez and Duan. Duan goes behind the seat to press down on her shoulders while Vilchez does his best to retrain her wrists next to her legs. She kicks, screams and swears for 2 minutes and 15 seconds until she passes out. Vilchez and Duan slowly remove their hands on her while they are shaking and breathing heavily.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I’ve never seen her like this…ever.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Just keep an eye on her, Jon.</p>
<p><em>(He pats his back and slumps back on his seat. He covers his face with his hand and remains still for about a minute before going back to leaning forward and grabbing the microphone, adjusting knobs and switches from the receivers himself.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Vilchez is sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><em>(He silently remains while he watches Makil work.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> You need something, Jon?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> You’ve been working on that for days. Have you eaten anything?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> I’m not hungry.</p>

<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Jon. I appreciate the concern. But unless you’re gonna help me here, let me focus. Please.</p>
<p><em>(Makil readjusts herself and returns her attention to the receivers. The pair sit in silence for a few minutes until the shuttle rumbles. They brace themselves, Duan moving up a seat next to Makil and looking out the window to see what may be causing the turbulence.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Holy- Adam?</p>

<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I swear to God, that’s him. Look at the face!</p>
<p><em>(Makil leans closer to the window.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> That can’t be.</p>
<p><em>(“Adam” walks to the shuttle, despite there being no surface to walk on. He gets close until he stops 6 meters away from the front of the shuttle. He sits and gently sways his body and his arms low.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> The Hell is he doing?</p>
<p><em>(“Adam” halts his movements and extends his arms as if for an embrace and stays in that pose.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Duan:</strong> That’s not me.</p>
<p><em>(A low-pitched noise blares but Duan and Makil do not react to it and continue to stare out the window. The noise steadily gets quieter and the footage captures small trails of red, orange, yellow, blue, and white lights converging above “Adam”. These lights then swirl and orbit one another, then converge little by little. A red dwarf zooms past the shuttle, leaving a streak of fiery red behind as it draws to the convergence. Several more giant stars rush past them and the collection of stars creates this rough-shaped sphere of light. Suddenly, the collection of stars vanishes, as does “Adam”.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I promise you both. I won’t let anything happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> … You get 10 minutes. Then I’m reeling you back</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> You guys suck, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> <em>(Chuckles.)</em> Maybe I’ll go and bring back Jesus and you tell me who’s hotter.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Not funny.</p>
<p><em>(Footage cuts to the exterior port side of the shuttle. Duan climbs out from the payload shaft and hooks himself to a reel. He observes his surrounding space with nothing of note happening for 2 minutes. “Adam” manifests in front of him and approaches him with an embrace. Duan does his best to embrace the entity in return.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> How are you alive?</p>
<p><em>(“Adam” uses his right arm to cut the cord and vanishes with Duan in a flash of light for the remaining 8 minutes. They remanifest to the hatch and “Adam” releases Duan. Once again, the entity disappears which leaves Duan to return into the shuttle.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Footage cuts to the Mid Deck with Vilchez and Makil helping him up and removing his suit.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Did you at least do something?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Do what?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Did you do anything with the comms?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> No. We don’t need to.</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> What?! Why, what the fuck were you doing then?!</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I got sidetracked, is all. But, look. I’m alive. I’m not hurt. I saw Adam again. Everything is good.</p>
<p><em>(A long silence fills the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> What happened out there?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> He helped me touch impossibility. The little one will keep us safe.</p>

<p><em>(Makil is working in the Spacelab and is seen repairing another communication receiver. Duan crawls through one of the entrances and observes her. )</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Morning.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> You still try to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Every now and then. But, I don’t know. Can’t seem to shut my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Mm. How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Like shit.</p>
<p><em>(Makil stops what she’s doing and hangs her head low.)</em></p>
<p>I hate it when it happens. Call it hallucinations, call it phantom pain. It's Hell, Jon. I see and hear nothing. I taste the blood flooding out my mouth. And those burns… Then I feel nothing. But I move anyway, not knowing if I’m dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> And despite all that, you still went looking for me. You’re a lot stronger than you think, Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Thanks. I’m glad you’re here, Jon.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Anytime. Besides, what would you do without me?</p>
<p><em>(She scoffs and looks up at him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Might be a workaholic.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Oh, definitely.</p>
<p><em>(They both laugh.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> How long do you think it’s been?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I’m not sure, myself.</p>
<p><em>(Duan says nothing. Instead, he sits next to her. She lays her head on his shoulder and they both stay silent.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> <em>(She rubs her eyes.)</em> Feels like we’ve been here for years. Looking outside doesn’t help, either. Everytime I do, I can feel my brain stretching. And I don’t even know what I’m looking at. Sometimes, it’s just nothing. But most times…</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Most times?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> I’m crazy. <em>(She chuckles)</em> I’m fucking crazy!</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> There are these splotches in space. They morph and angle themselves so much that I can’t even try to make a familiar shape. It blinks a white light every now and then, and it hurts my eyes. Then I start having those episodes again. I don’t know. I’m tired.</p>
<p><em>(Pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Do you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> After that stunt you pulled? <em>(She sits up straight and faces him)</em> Oh, and fuck you still for doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I can help you stop the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> By bringing you to the little one.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> It’s- <em>(short pause)</em> Words just can’t do it justice.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Try. At least help me understand.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> Okay. <em>(clicks tongue)</em> When I was out there, Adam was waiting for me. He didn’t say anything, but he gestured to me. I followed him, we moved around in ways I never thought possible. Eventually, he showed me the little one.</p>
<p><em>(Pause)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> He was a young king before anything came to be, and he looked at me with such awe as if I was the greatest thing it ever laid its eyes on. Admiring my design. He reached down to me, ever so gently to touch me. Then, everything became so clear. The pain just didn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Hmm. At least I’m not the only one who’s delirious.</p>
<p><em>(Duan scoffs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> So what? We’re here because this “little one” likes us?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> It’s more than that. He saved our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> How do you know that for sure?</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I just do. Which is why I want to show you him.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Jon.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I know I’m not making any sense. But what I saw, what I felt was real. And to be frank Pearl, I don’t want to see you hurting anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Makil:</strong> <em>(She looks away)</em> I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Duan:</strong> I promise you, I will never let anything bad happen to you. And this is nothing bad, because I’m still here, talking to you.</p>

<p><strong>Makil:</strong> Carlson, listen to me. When Jon and I were walking on the little one's body, Adam brought me to an angel. She was like the sky, warm and beautiful.

<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Oh, everything is.</p>

<p><em>(Vilchez sways his body.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> Everything. Life. It’s so beautiful. More beautiful than what you can imagine. I didn’t get it at first. But I understand now.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel:</strong> What did you understand?</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> You. Me. Everyone. There’s a spark in us. A glow that none has ever seen before. It’s something that many want but never quite seem to grasp. And there are some that can harness it. Those are the ones that defy reality.</p>
<p><em>(Vilchez stops swaying and fails to contain his laugh. After 4 minutes, he calms down.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> The little one sees it in us too. I think that’s why he undid the Gamma-Ray that hit us, why he chose my crew. I wouldn’t put it past you if the little one just thought of us as pretty-looking bugs it wanted to play with, and maybe that’s true. He’s still so young after all. But those eyes. They said something different.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel:</strong> What was it that you saw?</p>
<p><strong>Vilchez:</strong> A dragon, a butterfly, a nebula, a four-pointed star. And yet, he was none of them. It’s hard to remember the details.</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel:</strong> Can you tell us what happened to your crew?</p>

Immensely energetic explosions caused by various stellar activity; a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. The energy is released along the neutron star's axis of rotation.</div>
