<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9101 has been placed in standard humanoid containment. Additional security measures should be taken if needed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> SCP-9101's containment security has been upgraded. Increased observation is recommended due to the nature of its ability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> In addition to standard containment protocols, SCP-9101's restraints should be checked for defects or signs of tampering at irregular intervals throughout the day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> SCP-9101's current state of unconsciousness is to be maintained indefinitely through intravenous anesthetics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> SCP-9101 is to receive surreptitious oxytocin therapy several times a day, always in close proximity to Junior Researcher Margaret Moriyya.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> SCP-9101 is to receive narcotic pain relief every 12 hours. SCP-9101's nerve block catheter should also be kept fully supplied with non-opioid numbing medication.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> SCP-9101's body should be regularly monitored for anomalous activity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Containment Procedures:</span> Attempts at containment are ongoing. See Addendum 9101.3.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9101 is Edmund Watts, a 52-year-old repairman who is apparently incapable of remaining within any dynamic for an extended period of time. This effect extends to specific locations, relationships, and states of being. While SCP-9101 is capable of using its ability directly, the effect may also manifest when SCP-9101 is unconscious, distracted, or otherwise unable to provide direct input.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9101.1: Containment Attempts and Testing</strong><br/>
Due to the nature of SCP-9101's ability, containment and testing are considered to be simultaneously performed.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9101.2: The Adaptive Containment Protocol</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce financial and personnel costs associated with containing particularly difficult anomalies, the Foundation has authorized the use of the Adaptive Containment Protocol, a dimensionally-agnostic thaumaturgical system with three primary goals:</p>
<p>1. Design a structural system that can contain the target anomaly<br/>
2. Construct and maintain said system<br/>
3. Identify and record the target anomaly's pattern of attempted breaches to simplify further containment</p>
<p>While the overarching ACP system draws from the same codebase and power source for each assignment, every anomaly is assigned its own Adaptive Containment Entity to personalize its containment. Each resulting ACE's database is quarantined to prevent ideological or cognitohazardous contamination in either direction.</p>
<p>The specific ACP assignment containing SCP-9101 was initiated on September 9th, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 9101.3: ACP-9101 Logs</strong><br/>
Due to the self-modifying nature of the Adaptive Containment Protocol, logs are provided asynchronously and may not match established Foundation formatting.</p>

<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Apologies.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Calibration is taking longer than anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Previous examples show that emotional obstacles are somewhat effective.</p>

<p><em>SCP-9101 is in a room. SCP-9101 is experiencing sorrow. SCP-9101 starts to cry.</em></p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Apologies.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> I am beholden to my algorithm. This is the most effective method that I know of so far.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Fuck you. Last time I'm saying it, I'm so <em>so</em> tired of saying it, but fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> That is fair.</p>

<p><em>SCP-9101 is in a room. The room contains a realistic facsimile of Junior Researcher Margaret Moriyya. The facsimile smiles at SCP-9101. SCP-9101 backs away.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Oh, <em>fuck you</em>.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Apologies. The containment breach following your induced attraction to Margaret Moriyya showed a marked break in your usual pattern.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> You stayed with her for over two months.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I was dosed. You pieces of shit drugged me. I bet you drugged her, too. You <em>made</em> me-</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> But then you left.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> There was no change in your neurochemical profile. You were still in love.</p>

<p><em>SCP-9101 presses its back against the wall and slides down into a seated position. SCP-9101 is crying, despite the absence of direct emotional manipulation.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Why him?</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> Apologies. Your time with Isaac-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Don't say his name, I don't want to hear it-</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> It was the longest you spent in any one place, according to our records. You spent almost five years-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I thought your systems don't handle time well.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> They don't, as they are temporo-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I didn't spend any time at all there. No time at all.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> And then I left.</p>
<p><strong>ACE:</strong> I understand. I am updating my records now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> And then I left.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I took an art class. A drawing class, specifically. Years, years ago, long enough ago that I can't draw a stick figure anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> All I remember…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> The drawing teacher, or professor, or whatever, she told us to draw a tree, and she pointed outside the window.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> And she said, and I remember this, almost, don't pay attention to what you think a tree looks like. Look at it. Look at the trunk, the branches.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> The leaves.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> Look at it until it all breaks down in your eyes, until it's nothing but…but shapes and lines. Until it's nothing but a pattern you can put down on paper.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I think I've lived with that ever since.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> I look at everything too hard, I think, and it all comes apart. No matter how beautiful, no matter how much I love it, it breaks down in my eyes and I can't see the tree any more.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> And when there's nothing there but structure, but the same pattern day after day, you know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9101:</strong> What else can you do?</p>
