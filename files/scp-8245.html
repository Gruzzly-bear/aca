<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> At present, SCP-8245 remains uncontained. Efforts are mainly focused on swaying the general populace's awareness of its anomalous nature through mass amnesticization, disinformation campaigns and cover-up stories. Entities and objects created by SCP-8245 should be relocated to any nearby facility.</p>
<p>Confinement of SCP-8245 is pending as of writing.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8245 is William N. Knowles, an Asian-American male who possesses remarkably high levels of Aspect Radiation and Elan-Vital Energy (EVE). Because of this, it is capable of performing ontokinesis and thaumaturgy with ease. Limitations to this have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Among the many abilities SCP-8245 has, notable examples of its effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instantaneous teleportation of itself and entities it is aware of to potentially any location;</li>
<li>Manifestation of various objects, organisms and areas, usually abnormal in nature;</li>
<li>Metamorphic capabilities, though the entity mostly utilizes this to change its clothing, and;</li>
<li>Causing inanimate objects to gain sentience, primarily drawings, paintings or any visual form of art.</li>
</ul>
<p>From its initial discovery, SCP-8245 has constantly made attempts to disrupt the Veil by frequenting public spaces worldwide and presenting its anomalous properties. Each time, it has fled capture from Foundation operatives attempting to intervene, continuing its activities elsewhere instead. Due to its potential of instigating a BK-Class "Broken Masquerade" Scenario, the containment of SCP-8245 has been declared an Alpha-level priority.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Example Logs</p>
<p>Below are a series of excerpts detailing events caused by SCP-8245.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident #:</strong> 012</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Venice, Italy</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8245 appeared above the city's center, snapping its fingers and causing civilians to either float into the sky or gain the ability to walk on water. Pieces of clothing also burst out of the doors of their houses as they playfully follow the citizens. During this event, statements of "viewing the world in a beautiful, tinted shade" have been derived from numerous interviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident #:</strong> 024</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Various, United Kingdom</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8245 has been seen leading a marching band down various streets located throughout the United Kingdom. Its members consist of himself and entities resembling musical notes playing cutely and uniquely-designed instruments. Nearby audiences cheer for their charming performance. Confetti rains from an unknown source above while numerous multicolored lights focus on the play throughout its duration.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident #:</strong> 036</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> S.E.A. Aquarium, Sentosa Island, Singapore</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8245 manifests inside one of the aquarium's exhibitions, knocking on the window and alerting a nearby audience. As he smiles, he cracks the glass before shattering it. He rides on a water stream throughout the entire building accompanied by countless fish, painted with various pleasing hues. Everyone is astounded, bewildered by the show as his art dances across the halls. Beautiful, it's beautiful. They can't help but watch. Oh Will, shit i CANT evenr ejaodgww shb</p>

<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Right… him.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood turns to her desk, blinking several times as she stares blankly at it. She is then startled by a sudden knock on the door across from her, as Director Burgees enters the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Ah, Ms. Burntwood. I hope I'm not disturbing you.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Director Burgees? Oh, no. You're not disturbing me at all. Is- is there something I can help you with?</p>
<p><em>[Burgees tilts his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Nothing much, I'm only here to give my thanks for your volunteering.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Volunteering?</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> In researching the 8245 anomaly up close. I greatly appreciate your help in this considering the circumstances at hand. Not many people are willing to take the responsibility of standing within proximity of a reality bender, let alone interviewing them. They're quite the… <em>unpredictable</em> kind.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Yeah, well I would- I'd figure such a situation would put much stress on anyone. I'd rather not have anyone else putting their life on the line, so…</p>
<p><em>[Burgees clicks his tongue.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> That's very commendable, Ms. Burntwood. It's good to know we have people like you.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Mhm, that's me. Miss Commendable, reporting for duty.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood chuckles, followed by a brief silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> <em>(Inhales)</em> Well, you did seem rather eager to take the position during our initial encounter with the anomaly. I may be skeptical asking this, but did you have some other motive in mind back then?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Is there any <em>(gestures)</em> personal reason why you wanted to study this particular anomaly?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Oh, no. Uh, I was just- I'm just curious, is all. I've never had the opportunity to look at someone- some<em>thing</em> like this firsthand. I'm sure it sounds odd to say, but it's the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Hm, well you know what they say about curiosity. Don't let that get to you, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Of course, sir. There's no need to worry. Is there anything else I should know, or…?</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Apart from the email I've sent you, no. I'm sure you've already been briefed regarding your departure to 8245's current location, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Under breath) Email?</em> Oh! Right, right. I'm aware, I already have everything prepared. Ready to face this… anomaly head-on.</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Perfect, you'll be out in 15. Don't be tardy.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Scoffs)</em> Please, anything beats sitting around all day.</p>
<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Well, where else would you rather be?</p>
<p><em>[A short pause.]</em></p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><strong>Burgees:</strong> Doesn't matter. Best of luck, Ms. Burntwood.</p>
<p><em>[Burgees leaves.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Right…</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood takes a deep sigh before returning to her laptop and looking through the unread messages in her inbox. After a few minutes, she recovers the email recently sent by Burgees.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Reading aloud)</em> "I've made comments on your latest submission. As informative as it is, the documents you sent include language unbefitting of our typical standards. Simply put, we're writing articles for other staff members to review and reference.

<p><strong>Agent:</strong> You sure you wanna do this alone?</p>

<p><strong>Agent:</strong> This ain't like any other anomaly under your purview, y'know. You sure you'll be alright?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Oh, uh- <em>(clears throat)</em> yes, it's better this way. The less people there are, the less alarming it'll be for him. It's best not to scare him off to a different part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> "Him?"</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> It! "It," yes. That's what I- That's what I meant, sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Entity:</strong> Good day, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Mhm, good-</p>
<p><em>[She stops in her tracks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Wait, I thought we already evacuated everyone-</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood turns to see a mass of bubbles, vaguely resembling a humanoid entity. It is wearing a fedora and a tie while holding a suitcase. She looks down to see a shallow stream of soap water beneath her feet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Heh, that's actually… wait, no.</p>
<p><em>[She continues marching forward.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Can't get distracted now. Don't get distracted, Abby.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood slaps her cheeks as bubbles start floating past her, each popping and producing a noise similar to that of a piano's. The buildings also begin to contort and change color as rubber ducks start sprouting from the brick road. She almost chuckles but holds back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> God, you don't deserve…</p>
<p><em>[Her voice trails off as she notices a person (SCP-8245) in the distance hovering above, spinning in place while causing the soap water to rise and circle it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Is that…?</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood steps closer to confirm. The entity is wearing a purple cloak and a wide-brimmed hat with a pointed end. Its cloak is decorated with stars and appears almost transparent when nearing its shoes. It laughs as other miscellaneous objects orbit the specimen.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> It is. It's actually-</p>
<p><em>[She hesitates, looking over her lab coat and sighing. Burntwood eventually proceeds after shaking her head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Doesn't matter. Just keep it together.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood approaches SCP-8245 who soon notices her and tilts its head, grinning widely. The entity becomes two-dimensional as it folds itself repeatedly before disappearing. She stops and looks around as SCP-8245 reappears behind Burntwood and yelps, startling her and causing her to stumble backward. The specimen laughs again.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> I was wondering where the audience went. Nice to meet you, missy. Hope I didn't scare you too much.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 turns itself upside down as it bows.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> On the offside, though, let me introduce myself. The name's Will, a magician on a worldwide art show. It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 lends out a hand. Burntwood hesitantly shakes it as the anomaly quickly detaches its arm and backs away, leading her to drop the extremity on the ground in shock. It giggles as it grows another arm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Clears throat)</em> Hey, Will. It's… the pleasure's all mine.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood pauses, turning away from the entity. It blinks several times before rubbing its chin.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Hm, a one-on-one performance. Ain't this quite the ghost town. Usually, you'd find folks roaming round these parts. Don't tell me I'm performing for a crowd of skeletons, haha!</p>
<p><em>[An accompanying laugh track plays from an unknown source.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Well, it's probably them hooligans again. <em>(Sighs)</em> Doesn't matter. One or a thousand, at least somebody's smiling. Now tell me, friend-o, what's your name?</p>
<p><em>[The specimen closes its eyes and opens its left one, revealing its pupil in the shape of a question mark. Burntwood takes another step back, smiling nervously.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> You- you don't remember me? <em>(Inhales)</em> Does "Abby" not ring any bells?</p>
<p><em>[Its pupil shifts to that of an exclamation mark before returning to normal. SCP-8245 hovers away for a moment, tilting its head and lowering its eyebrows.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> You mean… Burntwood? Abigail "Abby" Burntwood?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> That's right.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Middle school Abby? <em>The</em> Abby from almost two decades ago?</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood waves her hand and nods. The anomaly's eyes lighten up.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Uh, hi. It's me… you know, I'm surprised you even recognized me-</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 screams excitedly, closing the distance and lifting Burntwood off the ground. The entity tosses her in the air over and over again, with her reaching increasingly higher heights to the point of leveling the clouds. She screams as well, though out of fear.

<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Panting)</em> Holy sh- <em>(coughs)</em> what the f-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> I can't believe it! You're here, you're really here! I knew I'd find you eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Yup, I'm here. Now put me down before I- urp.</p>
<p><em>[The specimen sets her down, dusting her off.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> My apologies, Missus. I'm just <em>thrilled</em> to see your face again. <em>(Gestures)</em> Here you are, here I am. The two of us have finally reunited!</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Mm, I'm glad you didn't forget about me, Will.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> How could I? You're the only person I ever talked to. Now, I get to talk to you again and it's just- it's just so-</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 raises its arms, shooting confetti from its wrists. Burntwood holds her breath, crossing her arms.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Heh, it's great to see you after so long. It looks like you're sticking to your… artistry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> No kidding. I've taken the time to refine my craftsmanship, expand my palette in ways no artists have seen before. Oh, but I'm sure you already knew that, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> It's hard not to notice. I mean, everything here looks so, uh <em>(pause)</em>, bubbly?</p>
<p><em>[The entity chuckles, spinning backwards as it does so.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Looks like you haven't lost your touch, Abby. Clever wordplay as always. Say, how are things looking on your end?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Your tales, obviously! I'm sure you've made a name for yourself already what with your mountainous amount of experience with the pen. Maybe you're also on a worldwide tour, showcasing the beauty in the arts of literature! Am I right? Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> No, no, I-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Though, it's odd. I've been checking book stores left and right and I haven't heard any names even close to yours. Any troubles on the writing front?</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood looks back and turns to SCP-8245 again, holding her breath.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Uh, I'm still working on my big debut. When you're sharing your works, it's best to start on the right foot. You know, um, give them a fine first impression. Does that-</p>

<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Well, aren't you as admirable as always? Even now, you still persist with your creativity, your <em>passion</em> for the works. I'm sure whatever you're planning will rock the industry to its core.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> You… you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Of course I do! I wouldn't want it any other way. Just you and me, sitting on top of the world and reminiscing on old times like we promised all those years ago. I've been meaning to know what you'd been up to when you moved. I'm sure your skills have doubled, tripled- no, <em>quadrupled</em> since last time. Maybe I can even proofread your <em>huge</em> debut.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Um, maybe when I'm close to done. I don't know if you'd like it, though. I just have a <em>lot</em> to put together and I might not be as good as you say-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Nonsense, what's with the impostor syndrome? The Abby I knew always showed off her stories whenever she got the chance.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> That was back then, Will. Nowadays, I prefer to keep things to myself. I- y'know, I'm just not sure people would appreciate if I shoved a stack of papers in their faces. They might complain, they might… dislike it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> <em>(Inhales deeply)</em> Hm, you've certainly grown more aware of your surroundings, that's for sure. I get it, though. Respecting their privacy and all that junk. Can't really complain about that.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood stares at her feet.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Coughs)</em> Sorry, Will.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> What're you apologizing for?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Um…</p>
<p><em>[Pause.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> I should- I should probably go. I can see you're busy with your performance.</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood attempts to leave but SCP-8245 grabs her arm.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> No, no, wait. It's been so long, Abby. Why're you suddenly packing up and leaving? Don't you wanna spend some more time with me?</p>
<p><em>[She turns to the entity as it immediately retracts its hand.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> I don't want to push you or anything, but I just… I've been wanting to show you how far I've come. All the artworks I made, all the tricks I've learnt. I want you to see them. Personal performance, just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Will…</p>
<p><em>[Burntwood ponders and looks back once again before sighing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> To be honest, I'd love to take you up on your offer, Will.</p>
<p><em>[Sparkles appear surrounding the specimen's face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> But! But, I've been very, very busy lately. Busy with a lot of things, a lot of <em>writing</em> and all. I'm sure you understand that. Maybe some other time, maybe-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> C'mon, Abby. You can shave off a minute or two. Just take it as a lil' break from the pen and paper. Who knows? It could even bring in some inspiration, get you willing and ready to take the world. You look like you need a break, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> I… I don't-</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 claps both its hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Pleeeeease?</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Will, no-</p>
<p><em>[The anomaly closes the distance as its eyes notably widen. Stars of various hues are present within its pupils. Burntwood takes one last look behind herself before clicking her tongue and nodding.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Alright, alright, fine. Just this once.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8245 leaps backward, thrashing its limbs sporadically.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Now that's what I'm talking about! Woohoo!</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> <em>(Under breath)</em> Jeez, you can be so persistent sometimes… Okay, now how about that performance? What tricks do you have up your sleeve this time?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> Right, of course. Right this way, ma'am.</p>
<p><em>[The entity leads Burntwood to the front door of a residence. It is dark purple in color and heavily decorated with numerous stickers, hand-painted drawings, and other miscellaneous items. A faint string instrument can be heard from the other side. Burntwood is completely silent.]</em></p>

<p><em>[SCP-8245 smirks as it knocks on the entrance and opens it, revealing an extradimensional space contained inside the building. The area consists of a forest surrounding an island where a castle resides. Burntwood gasps, leans in and observes the environment. Her mouth is agape.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> All of this, you- you did all of this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> <em>(Nods)</em> Oh, you'd be surprised. I've been practicing ever since you left, Abby. You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Still, this is just… it's a lot. Way better than…</p>
<p><em>[She holds her breath and lowers her eyebrows.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8245:</strong> No need for the flattery. I'm sure you're just as great- no, you're even <em>better</em> than anything I've painted. Words can bring in their own fair share of details too. I know that, for sure. <em>(Sharp inhale)</em> Well, this is more than just paint and canvases, but still.</p>

<p><strong>Burntwood:</strong> Of course I haven't. That's ridiculous.</p>
