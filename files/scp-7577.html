</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7577 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within the Orpheus section of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3480" target="_blank">Area-13</a>. As a precaution, at least one Scranton Reality Anchor is to be placed at least thirty meters from SCP-7577.</p>
<p>In accordance with <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/parts" target="_blank">Project Orpheus</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> guidelines, SCP-7577 is to be visited on a daily basis by its head researcher (currently Doctor Kassandra Angelos). This is to ensure interviews are regularly conducted with the subject to stimulate as much brain function as possible during its containment.</p>
<p>In line with this, several cranial lead wires are to permanently be attached to SCP-7577’s brain to study its brain activity, with special attention being paid to the effects that its condition has on its mental state.</p>
<p>Due to immense rarity of SCP-7577's condition<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and its equivalently immense value to Project Orpheus, no attempt is to be made to remedy its current state. Likewise, due to the fact that the longevity of all records of SCP-7577’s existence outside of the Foundation database is limited, all research notes pertinent to the object are to be displayed within SCiPNet.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7577 is a forty-three year old human male formerly known as Alex J. Gomez, who worked as a maintenance staff at Area-13. Based on traditional classifications of reality bending entities, SCP-7577 is considered as a class five reality bender– however, due to its prevailing metaphysical condition, SCP-7577 is not able to voluntarily use its abilities.</p>
<p>Instead, SCP-7577’s reality bending properties are focused upon itself in a rare condition known as autometaphysical erasure (AME), causing its body to involuntarily exhibit sudden violent changes to its hume levels<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. This leads to a state where reality actively abhors the existence of SCP-7577, causing it to slowly begin to phase out of being.</p>
<p>In order, the following stages take place following a subject first being affected by AME:<br/>
<strong>Stage 1:</strong> The incremental loss of the subject's memories<br/>
<strong>Stage 2:</strong> Disassociation of the subject's identity from itself<br/>
<strong>Stage 3:</strong> The loss of all human memory of the subject<br/>
<strong>Stage 4:</strong> The erasure of all physical (and written) evidence of the subject<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup><br/>
<strong>Stage 5:</strong> The sudden disappearance of the subject from reality.</p>
<p>Though all physical evidence of the subject will normally be purged from existence following Stage 5 of AME, the Foundation database will still continue to reliably display the information of those affected by the condition, including SCP-7577. This information will then be kept independent of written records outside of the database or the human memory of SCP-7577’s researchers.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SCP-7577’s condition is terminal. Due to its academic utility to Project Orpheus and the Foundation as a whole, no efforts are currently being made to research a cure for its condition.</p>

<p><strong><em>Interview 1</em></strong><br/>
(dated November 11, 2014)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7577</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Kassandra Angelos, Head Researcher</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos enters SCP-7577’s containment cell. She is holding a tablet, which is seen displaying several documents. SCP-7577 sits up in a bed opposite her, with several cranial leads attached to its head. Bandages cover the previously exposed hole in its skull. As Angelos enters, SCP-7577 smiles.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Hey, doc.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos quietly takes a folding chair leaning on the wall of the room and sets it down. She sits on it soon after, crossing her legs and placing her tablet on her lap. She smiles at SCP-7577.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Hello, Alex. How are you doing?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 chuckles to itself, before moving its hand up to touch the back of its head.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> I’m fine. Didn’t feel a thing during the operation, don’t feel a thing now. You guys always know how to treat us right.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos smiles.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos continues to sort through documents on her tablet. Eventually, she flips to the topmost sheet and looks up.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Alright, shall we start?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah, doc. Sure.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos begins to read from her tablet, looking up at SCP-7577.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Alex Jones Gomez.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos retrieves a stylus from her pocket and draws a small check on the document displayed on the tablet.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Your age?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> I’m forty-three.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Occupation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Maintenance staff at Area-13.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos visibly pauses, before making another check on the sheet of paper.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Place of birth?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Daly City, San Mateo County, California.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos nods to herself, before setting the tablet aside.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Alright, that should be it.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos smiles warmly at SCP-7577.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> How’s the meds we’re giving you, Alex? Do you feel anything, anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Nah, nothing really. The wires make it hard to sleep sometimes, but it’s alright. Is it alright if you tell me what they do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> They’re how we provide medicine to your brain. They’re harmless, really.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Ah… great, thank you. You guys got any leads on what I have yet?</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos' smile hardens.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> No, we uh… we don’t.</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 is silent for one second, before chuckling again.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah, figures. I know you’ll see me through, though. You always do.</p>
<p>[A silence intervenes for several seconds as Dr. Angelos types on her tablet.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> It’s uh… what I have won’t kill me, will it?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 visibly swallows.]</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos stares at SCP-7577 for several seconds.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> No, no… No you won’t. We promise.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos returns to making notes on her tablet. SCP-7577 awkwardly looks around.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> It’s just that… my family, you know. I already filed the next two weeks for my vacation leave, wanted to uh… head back to the States.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos continues to make notes, not looking up from her tablet.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Not that Greece isn’t bad, it’s just not… home.</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 looks out the window of its room. Like all windows in Area-13, the glass has been blurred, only letting light in.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> I miss home. Haven’t been there for a few years.</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 looks at Dr. Angelos. Dr. Angelos is still typing on her tablet.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos stops typing. She looks up from her tablet.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> For helping me out. Most places I’ve worked at would never have tried to help out a little guy like me.</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 chuckles again. Dr. Angelos looks at him with pity.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Of course. We look out for our own.</p>
<p>&lt;End Log&gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Researcher Notes:</strong> AME does not seem to be currently affecting SCP-7577’s memory or mental faculties. Object is responding well to containment, and, thankfully, continues to remain unaware of its status as an anomaly.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Daly City, San Mateo County, California.</span></p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos nods.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Alright, everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> That’s a relief. I can’t really say how worried I was that-</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> That…?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> That… you know, I’d caught something bad.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Why do you think so?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> I don’t know… bad feeling? Can’t really describe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> I mean… it’s just…</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Please be honest.</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 is silent. Its lips are pursed.]</p>
<p>[After a few seconds, he shakes its head and smiles.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Nah, nevermind, doc. I’m alright.</span></p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos looks at SCP-7577 questioningly, before looking back down as she starts typing on her tablet once again.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Were you able to write those letters I told you about, to your family?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah, I got them here.</span></p>
<p>[SCP-7577 retrieves three folded pieces of paper from the table next to its bed.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> One for my wife,</span></p>
<p>[SCP-7577 gives the letter to Dr. Angelos.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> One for my daughter,</span></p>
<p>[SCP-7577 gives the next letter to Dr. Angelos.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> One for my dad.</span></p>
<p>[SCP-7577 gives the last letter to Dr. Angelos.]</p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos receives the letters.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Did you make sure there’s nothing suspect inside these letters?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 chuckles.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Trust me, I’ve sent my fair share back from when I was still in Site-79.</span></p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos looks at the letters in her hand before looking up at SCP-7577]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Is it alright if I check?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 looks at Dr. Angelos. After two seconds of looking at her, he nods.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p>[Dr. Angelos slowly opens one of the letters in her hand. She starts to slowly read it.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> This is to your daughter?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah.</span></p>
<p>[SCP-7577 smiles. There is a hint of sadness in its expression.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> She’s seventeen. Turning eighteen.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Oh? When?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 chuckles quietly to itself.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Tomorrow.</span></p>
<p>&lt;End Log&gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Researcher Notes:</strong> Subject’s hume levels are growing more and more erratic. Further analysis is needed to reach a definitive conclusion regarding its link to SCP-7577’s current condition.</p>
<p>To note for future reference: The letters, as they were purely products of a stimulatory activity, were properly disposed of by ordinance of Area-13.</p>
<p>Sorry, Alex.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Alright, Alex. We’re gonna try to test your responses to more questions now. Are you ready?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Always ready, doc.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> Name?</p>

<p>[Dr. Angelos notes down SCP-7577’s responses. She pauses, then looks up.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> How long have you worked with us, Alex? Just give me a number. I can't access our records right now.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Twenty.</span></p>

<p>[SCP-7577 smiles at Dr. Angelos.]</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Yeah, sure. I’m an open book.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Angelos:</strong> To date, you’ve never applied for promotion, and you’ve always complied whenever you were transferred. Why did you ever stay with the Foundation for so long?</p>
<p>[SCP-7577 stares at Dr. Angelos for several seconds. It continues to make a slight smile.]</p>

<p><span style="color: #3e3e3e"><strong>SCP-7577:</strong> Why wouldn’t I, right? You treat me well. You give me a hospital room where most employers would just shove me aside. You clearly care for your people.</span></p>

<p>[SCP-7577 nods slightly, continuing to quietly sob.]</p>

<p>[<span style="color: #b3b3b3">SCP-7577’s</span> turns its eyes down, as if it had forgotten what it wished to say.]</p>

<p>With AME’s nature being what it is, it has taken a long time for files like this to resurface and be learned from as intended. Everything we know about it now occurs as a matter of happenstance- a researcher stumbling on notes they made long ago, or a file accidentally coming up during database maintenance. We still don't know why it happens, or where the afflicted go. We don't even know what counts as "physical evidence", and what gets to be erased.<br/>
<span style="color: #fff8f8">Please no.</span><br/>
Still, we know much more about AME now than we did decades ago. As Project Orpheus reaches its final stage, I believe I have fair reason to doubt that, out of the hundreds of reality benders we’ve found to have AME, this article brings something new.<br/>
<span style="color: #fff8f8">Please.</span><br/>
File this away with the others. Time will tell if we will still find a use for them.<br/>
