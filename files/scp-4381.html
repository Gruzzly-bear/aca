<p>SCP-4381</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Given that at least ██,███,███ instances have been documented throughout the world, containment of SCP-4381 is unfeasible.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Omicron-19 ("Pork Grinders") is to capture and extract SCP-4381 instances in sparsely populated areas as deemed necessary by the Site-166 Research Department. Amnestic aerosols are to be deployed immediately after retrieval. Captured SCP-4381 instances are to be contained in the Fauna Containment Wing at Site-166.</p>
<p>Until the nature of SCP-4381 is determined, research and experimentation with captive SCP-4381 instances is a priority and should remain ongoing. Personnel assigned to interact with SCP-4381 specimens must be aware of their anomalous nature. Expired SCP-4381 instances are to be incinerated and disposed of accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4381 are domestic pigs (<em>Sus scrofa domesticus</em>) that exhibit the behavior and characteristics of humans. However, this only takes effect when the interacting human has no prior knowledge regarding this anomalous property. Anatomical analysis of SCP-4381 instances shows no unusual properties which could be considered the cause of these characteristics.</p>
<p>While digital images of SCP-4381 seem to mitigate this property, audio recordings have been confirmed to retain human vocalizations emitted by SCP-4381 instances.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Initial Testing Logs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4381-1 (Deceased specimen)<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Abdominal dissection.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Digestive, circulatory, and all other internal organs were physiologically similar to non-anomalous specimens.</p>
<p><tt>EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED</tt></p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4381-8 (Live specimen)<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Veterinary orthopedic surgery. Subject sedated.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Extracted bones appear to be identical to human bones.</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-4381-9 (Live Specimen)<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Tail removal. Mild sedative applied.<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> Subject emits human screams. Removed tail resembles the gluteal sulcus muscle found in humans. Further analysis indicates physiological similarities with tails of non-anomalous pigs.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Audio Log 4381-12 Excerpt</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log 4381-04302019&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>The following test was conducted to determine the scope of SCP-4381. Previous log entries have been removed for brevity. D-7661 was not informed about the subject's anomalous properties.</em></p>
<p><tt>EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED</tt></p>
<p><strong>D-7661:</strong> So, why are you here, again?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4381-88:</strong> Well, ask them. They think I'm a pig.</p>
<p><strong>D-7661:</strong> That's messed up.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4381-88:</strong> Yeah. The more I explain that I'm not… The more they just seem disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4381-88:</strong> I just want to go home, man. I don't want to end up like the others.</p>
<p><tt>EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED</tt></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Three days later, ██ SCP-4381 instances were reported to have manifested in the D-Class Wing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident Log 4381-05112019</p>
<blockquote>
<p>█,███ instances were successfully contained by Site-166 personnel after a raid from a meat-processing facility in [REDACTED]. Confiscated records indicate that at least ██,███ instances have been processed as sausages and bacon for the last four years.</p>
<p>Several days after the raid, ███ undocumented SCP-4381 instances were reported to have manifested at Site-166. ██ instances that were recently contained and ███ containment personnel were also reported to be missing. A containment breach was subsequently declared and a nearby Foundation facility, Site-235, was notified to deploy personnel to contain the breach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Note from Site-235 Director ██████ ██████</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It appears Site-166 had already been compromised by SCP-4381 for at least 19 months before the breach. All Foundation personnel who have interacted with SCP-4381 were missing.</em></p>
<p><em>Until the nature and scope of SCP-4381 are verified, all surviving Site-166 personnel are to undergo Metanoic screening for a duration of 15 days and be administered with Class-D amnestics. Site-235 staff assigned to interact with Site-166 personnel must not be aware of SCP-4381 nor its anomalous properties. Deceased Site-166 personnel and other unidentified individuals found within Site-166 testing facilities are to be incinerated and disposed of according to the Apeiron Protocol.</em></p>
<p><em>All digital records of Site-166 personnel are to be deleted from the Foundation database.</em></p>
<p><em>A revision of this documentation is to be issued within three weeks.</em></p>
