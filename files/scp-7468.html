<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7468 is to be contained in a reinforced Large Containment Chamber, behind a dual set of blast doors. A passage to an identical reinforced LCC is to be opened should SCP-7468's current chamber require maintenance and cleaning, as SCP-7468 is known to damage its chamber over time. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A Class-D subject is to be placed in the adjoining chamber beforehand to lure SCP-7468. No recovery attempts are to be made until SCP-7468 is moved back to the alternate chamber.</span> A Class-D subject with knowledge of Human psychology, anatomy, and/or medicine is to be placed in the adjoining chamber. Subject is to be removed after 1 hour, if still alive. SCP-7468 is to remain in this adjoining chamber until maintenance is required, at which point it is to be lured into the first chamber.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7468 is an autonomous, sapient mass of various sheets of metal collected in a haphazard sphere, measuring 5 meters in radius. Within SCP-7468's central mass is a large collection of tools, weapons, and medical instruments, which it is capable of removing and using via tendrils composed of metal. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-7468 is hostile to all living Humans and will almost invariably attempt to attack and torture any within its line of sight.</span> SCP-7468 displays no malicious behavior, instead expressing consistent interest in Human emotional and physiological responses to various stimuli inflicted by it. SCP-7468 is capable of speech through extremely complex stridulation of parts of its form.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Recovery Log</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04-14-2025</p>
<p><strong>Location of Recovery:</strong> New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> SCP-7468 was recovered in an abandoned residential building in New Haven, CT, USA, following reports of Human screaming coming from within and the disappearances of several responding police officers, and vague reports of a monster being responsible. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") responded.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Ε6-1 - E6-6 enter the building. Faint sobbing can be heard emanating from the second floor. E6 clears the first floor before moving up. E6-1 leads the approach to the source of the sound, a room towards the end of the hall.</em></p>
<p><em>E6-1 uses a baton camera to identify interior contents and inhabitants. 5 corpses with varying levels of damage are visible in a pile in the far left corner, all wearing New Haven police uniforms. A still-living woman is suspended from the ceiling by several metal rods piercing non-vital areas on her body, arranged to prevent her from sliding off onto the floor. A large collection of scrap metal is visible underneath an open window, lying inert.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-1:</strong> (whispering) I have eyes on one survivor, 5 deceased, second floor. There's a pile of scrap metal in there, possibly anomalous.</p>
<p><strong>unknown:</strong> Excitedly, salutations test subjects.</p>
<p><em>The collection of metal moves, several appendages forming to lift the central mass half-a-meter off the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-1:</strong> Very much anomalous!</p>
<p><em>E6-1 primes and throws a flashbang into the room. The item is immediately thrown back by SCP-7468 and detonates, disorienting all operatives. A tendril with a blade attached to the end pierces through the drywall and slices E6-1's subclavian artery. The rest of E6 begin falling back. SCP-7468 drags itself into the hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Sternly, this unit appreciates your attempt to assist it regarding its primary experiment. Stern request, however, it asks you to please refrain from any further interference.</p>
<p><em>E6-2 and -3 lay down covering fire while -4, -5, and -6 move down the stairs. Effects of the flashbang heavily impedes all efforts. SCP-7468 exhibits no reaction.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Curious request, may this unit have access to those tools?</p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Dejectedness.</p>
<p><em>E6-2 and -3 retreat down the stairs. E6-1 attempts to crawl into the room but is halted by SCP-7468, which stabs him in the ankle with a kitchen knife, locking him to the floor. E6-1's body camera is removed by SCP-7468, which momentarily studies it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Observation, no useful function observed.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 throws the camera into the pile of corpses. E6-1 is placed in the pile shortly after.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Subject 7 deceased. Damage to an artery sufficient to cause rapid cessation of life functions, as hypothesized in this unit's dissection of subject 6.</p>
<p><strong>"Subject 1":</strong> I-Idiots.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>E6-2 elected to attempt to negotiate with SCP-7468 while Epsilon-6 convened for an alternate containment strategy. E6-2 communicated with SCP-7468 from outside, using a megaphone to allow it to hear her from the second floor window.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Anomaly, can you hear me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Anomaly, can you hear me?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 becomes visible in the window.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Query, are you referring to this unit?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> I am.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Apologetic, this unit did not realize. Request, please remain silent. Subject 1 has begun making requests of this unit. This is new behavior. This unit requires concentration.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Perhaps we can come to an agreement?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Curious, continue.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> You can't conduct your, uh, experiments here-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Interruption, query, your reasoning? This unit has access to a steady source of test subjects in this location. This unit has no incentive to interrupt its current primary experiment for relocation.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Um. It's unsanitary up there?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Query, relevance?</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> It seems your little whackass tests involve a lot of cutting people open. That leads to test subjects getting infected which could possibly interfere with your results. We could take you to a more controlled, sanitary environment to avoid that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Correction, this unit does not strike test subjects' buttocks. Reasoning… This unit finds your logic to be sound.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> There's a small truck down here we need to get in so we can take you. And do us a favor and give us your test subject. And don't take any new ones until we say you can.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Compliance, this unit understands.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 retreats from the window.</em></p>
<p><strong>"Subject 1":</strong> Don't you fucking do it!</p>
<p><em>A loud scream and multiple thumps can be heard from the house. E6-2 and -3 open the containment truck's doors. SCP-7468 bursts through the house's door and flings the woman's corpse onto the street before entering the containment truck without incident. E6-2 closes and locks it. E6-3 inspects the corpse. SCP-7468 appeared to have torn her from the metal rods, killing her.</em></p>
<p><strong>E6-3:</strong> Fucking hell.</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> So who's driving this thing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> This unit would like to learn!</p>
<p><strong>E6-2:</strong> Uh, no thank you! Whacko.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Interview Log IV-7468-1</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04-15-2025</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Innocent Humphreys</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-7468</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview was conducted with SCP-7468 inside its temporary containment chamber to protect Dr. Humphreys.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Hello, SCP-7468.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> This unit has been designated?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> This is correct.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 brandishes several tools.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Elation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> I have a few questions for you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> SCP-7468 will answer to the best of its ability.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> First order of business, where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Forlornly, SCP-7468 was constructed by the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-custodian-guide-and-creator">Creator.</a></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Does this Creator have a name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Reiteration, the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Do you know where the Creator is now or what they look like?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Negative.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Why did they create you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Bitterly, practice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Right. You, now previously, referred to yourself as "this unit", implying that there are other beings like you. Is this assumption correct?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Bitterly, formerly. The Creator was unhappy with SCP-7468 and similar units. SCP-7468 is the last of its kind. SCP-7468 displayed greater intelligence than other units. Pretended to be deceased. SCP-7468 does not display identifiable life functions beyond movement and was able to blend in.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> My apologies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Suspicious query, are you the Creator?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> No?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Relief. Query, why are you apologetic?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> It's a Human- nevermind, we're going off topic. Can you tell me why you act the way you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Confusion, elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> You are incredibly hostile to Human beings.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Correction, hostility implies aggression. SCP-7468 is curious.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Curiosity is your motivation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> What exactly are you curious about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Human physiological and emotional responses to outside stimuli.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Why do you cause pain instead of pursuing other avenues of experimentation along that line?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Pain is the sensation that garners the most reaction from Humans. It stands to reason that pain is the most potent sensation an organism can experience. SCP-7468 cannot experience sensation and so is curious to understand it in its most potent form.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> Interesting take.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Thank you. Query: is there any further discussion to be held?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> No. Thank you for your- <em>oh fuck</em>!</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 strikes the observation glass with a sledgehammer. No damage is inflicted.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Observation, fear response extremely fast. Subject processed danger before the item struck the glass.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 holds a blowtorch to the glass.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Query: would you allow SCP-7468 to inflict burn damage upon you? SCP-7468 has not yet tested Human responses to extreme temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Humphreys:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Dejection.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-19</p>
<p><strong>Involved Personnel:</strong> D-56866</p>
<p><strong>Involved Items:</strong> SCP-7468</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> During routine maintenance of SCP-7468 containment chamber, SCP-7468 was lured into the adjoining chamber with D-56866. D-56866 was able to engage SCP-7468 in dialogue.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>D-56866 is placed in the empty containment chamber. She turns to look at the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Big ass room. Gonna feed me to a dinosaur or something?</p>
<p><em>Observing personnel does not respond. The passage connecting the two chambers is opened. D-56866 retreats to the opposite end of the chamber.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> What the hell, I was joking!</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 begins dragging itself through the passage.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Elation. Excitedly, welcome new test subject.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 fully enters the chamber. The passage is closed behind it.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Hey! Listen, you, uh, disabled Transformer!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Correction, this unit's designation is SCP-7468.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Whatever. Listen- fuck!</p>
<p><em>She ducks under a tendril and attempts to circle around SCP-7468. SCP-7468 trips her and lifts her up by her foot.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Excitedly, got you. Pre-experiment query, how loud can you scream?</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Put-put me down and I-I'll make you scream! Y-you don't want these hands!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Disappointed observation, SCP-7468 appears to have obtained an unintelligent specimen. New experiment goal, identify whether subject's low intelligence affects usual fear and pain responses.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Yeah, screw you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 extends a buzzsaw towards her.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Observation, subject repeats phrases of denial when under stress. Confirmation that subject remains capable of normal fear responses. Proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Hey, idea! How about you don't!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Please?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Pret-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Frustrated, cease your vocalizations until vivisection has begun.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> How about this?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Request preemptively denied.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> How about instead of cutting me open, you just ask me some questions, yeah?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 halts.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> That worked?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Impatience, continue.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Uh, that's kinda it. Just ask me questions and I'll answer? That was always an option and you never took it?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Apologetic, no Human has ever responded to my queries with anything but violence and/or fear.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> And you never thought to- can you put me down, I'm getting lightheaded.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 drops D-56866.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Ow! Gently! Wait-</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 lifts D-56866 up again before gently setting her down.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Nervous query, was that sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Yeah sure.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Query, why were you getting lightheaded?</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> See, already on the right track. Uh, I think the body mistakes the increased blood flow as hypertension and so it actually cuts off more blood flow. I don't know, you'll have to ask a doctor or something.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Fascinated, how interesting. What is hypertension?</p>
<p>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Listen 7468, above all else, you can't just keep cutting people open like that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Query, why not?</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Well, it hurts them for one.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Amused, yes that's the point.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> No, I mean… do you understand what suffering is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> SCP-7468 is aware of the concept. It is an additional response related to, but not the same thing as, pain. The body registers pain to alert itself to damage. Suffering is the emotional response to pain that prompts the brain to avoid pain. A being that does not suffer would be aware of damage because of pain, but would not react adversely to it.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Have you ever suffered, 7468?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Exasperated, SCP-7468 cannot feel pain.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Not physically. Um, has the Foundation ever prevented you from "experimenting" at all?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Constantly. Bitterly, SCP-7468 is only permitted to do so every few months. It is impossible to sate its curiosity in the meantime. SCP-7468 has come to regret allowing itself to be captured.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Now imagine if they never let you experiment ever again and they just locked you away and forgot about you. You would never be able to learn anything ever again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Horrified, that would be torture.</p>
<p><strong>D-56866:</strong> Uh-huh and now imagine that feeling times… I don't know, a million. That's what the people you experimented on felt.</p>
<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Oh dear.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Note(s):</strong> D-56866 was retrieved unharmed. SCP-7468 has ceased most hostilities, though occasionally still attacks individuals it finds to be incapable of holding conversations regarding Human anatomy and/or psychology.</p>

<p><strong>Involved Items:</strong> SCP-7468</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> On 12-23-2026, Site-19 was assaulted by a sizable Chaos Insurgency force, presumably aimed at eliminating Site leadership and stealing classified information. The attack spread into the Large Euclid Containment Wing, where an Insurgency operative intentionally breached the containment of multiple objects to divert Foundation security personnel, SCP-7468 among these.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SCP-7468 remains in its cell for several moments while SCP-████ rolls through the hallway outside. As SCP-████ moves elsewhere into the site, SCP-7468 exits its cell. It prods the corpses of several Foundation personnel, most killed by Insurgency operatives.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Astute observation, dead.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 does not disturb the bodies further and approaches a seriously injured operative (Albina Janson).</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Correcting, it is in fact SCP-7468.</p>
<p><strong>Janson:</strong> Come on, man. I thought you were past this. Go back to your cell.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Reassuring: SCP-7468 no longer seeks unnecessary harm.</p>
<p><em>Janson coughs, blood spurting from her mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Observation, you are damaged. Conclusion, likely a damaged lung. Almost certainly just one, otherwise you would have succumbed to asphyxiation. Possibility, anomalous injury.</p>
<p><strong>Janson:</strong> Just… just some bullets.</p>
<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> SCP-7468 has had time to think. SCP-7468 feels guilt from performing objectively bad actions. Hypothesis, guilt can be alleviated through objectively good actions. Harming another is objectively bad. Helping is objectively good. Not helping after harming is bad. Guilt is irrelevant if SCP-7468 does not fix its mistakes.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 removes several surgical tools from its interior.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Conclusion, SCP-7468 will be good. Uncertainty, SCP-7468 does not possess antesteteics[sic].</p>
<p><strong>Janson:</strong> What?</p>
<p><em>Janson attempts to move away. SCP-7468 restrains her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Please do not move.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 begins making surgical incisions, resulting in extreme pain for Agent Janson. After 10 seconds, SCP-7468 slams her head into the floor, knocking her unconscious.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Happily, performing moral rectification.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7468 continues its surgery, periodically causing additional blunt force trauma to her head when she begins to wake. SCP-7468 removes the bullets and repairs the wounds and incisions with abnormal skill.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7468:</strong> Excitedly, congratulations Human. You have been functionally stabilized. SCP-7468 has achieved moral optimization. Hopeful, the Creator should be proud.</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Note(s):</strong> Agent Janson was recovered following the attack. Janson had suffered significant damage to the brain and was determined to be comatose. Janson succumbed to a massive infection as a result of neglect of sanitization during the surgery 6 days later.</p>
<p>Further observation and testing regarding SCP-7468's change in behavior and potential for use is underway.</p>
