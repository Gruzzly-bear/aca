<p>SCP-2706</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2706</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of SCP-2706 is to be fenced off with at least two patrols guarding the perimeter at all times. Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be located, it is to be retrieved and released into its natural habitat. MTF λ-6 (Elmer Fudds) are to be equipped with standard tranquilizer firearms when searching for an instance of SCP-2706-2.</p>
<p>If any instance of SCP-2706-2 becomes hostile and detrimental to the survival of MTF λ-6, then the mobile task force has full authorization to utilize any firepower available within Area-37 armory. Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be too dangerous for normal engagement parameters then Procedure 442 Kito-Fas is to be enacted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2706 is a white oak (<em>Quercus alba</em>) forest located thirty-six kilometers east of Clarksburg, West Virginia. The trees located within SCP-2706 (known as SCP-2706-1 instances) are unusually sturdy (with the density of an individual instance measuring 44.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). All SCP-2706-1 instances have between 3-10 abnormal growths (similar in appearance to burls) attached to their trunk.</p>
<p>Periodically these abnormal growths will produce an organism of the <em>animalia</em> kingdom (referred to as SCP-2706-2 instances) through a process that is not fully understood. SCP-2706-2 instances are produced at different stages of development and are anatomically normal. All attempts to remove an SCP-2706-2 instance from an instance of SCP-2706-1 have resulted in the death of the organism.</p>
<p>SCP-2706 was first recovered when the corpse of a bottle-nose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>) was found in the area. Local authorities subsequently discovered a number of non-native animals in the area, including a pair of cheetahs, a kangaroo, six penguins, an anaconda, and two rhinoceros. All animals recovered were re-released into their natural habitat. Assets embedded in local law enforcement notified the Foundation, which established Area-37 in order to contain further SCP-2706-2 instances.</p>

<h4 id="toc0"><span><strong>Addendum 1</strong></span></h4>
<p>On August 17, 1972 a human instance of SCP-2706-2 was produced and discovered by MTF λ-6. SCP-2706-2 was naked, in the advanced stages of shock and was given medical treatment. SCP-2706-2 claimed to be Jeremy Monroe (a botany student) from Hillsdale, Iowa. Government records indicate that SCP-2706-2 had previously died in an automobile accident on December 24, 1954.</p>

<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong>Incident Report 013</strong></span></h4>
<p>During a patrol on May 8, 1983, a member of the species <em>Mammuthus primigenius</em> (Woolly Mammoth) was discovered attempting to escape SCP-2706 by MTF λ-6. The Mobile Task Force quickly tranquilized the instance and called for air retrieval. SCP-2706-2 is currently within Foundation Reserve-32 where it is being studied. Anatomical examination between this SCP-2706-2 instance and records of <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2082">SCP-2082</a> are currently underway.</p>
<p>Follow up investigation has indicated that this instance emerged from a growth originally thought to be non-anomalous due to a lack of activity since the beginning of containment in 1951. Several other growths in the same area are currently under observation for additional production events.</p>

<p><em>This is the first SCP-2706-2 recorded that is not from the present day and the growth it appears to have originated from appears too small to accommodate it. I want MTF Lambda-6 to be equipped to deal with any creature of any size inside SCP-2706.</em><br/>

<p>Aftermath of engagement with third SCP-2706-2 instance</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong>Incident Report 102</strong></span></h4>
<p>Following incident 013, growths which were inactive for long periods of time were placed under continuous surveillance. On October 30, 2014, 3 of these growths produced instances of SCP-2706-2 that appeared and acted in a manner consistent with the currently contained instance of <a href="/scp-682">SCP-682</a>. MTF λ-6 called in airborne support to locate these SCP-2706-2 instances. Following several failed attempts at containment, MTF enacted Procedure 442 Kito-Fas.</p>
<p>Members of MTF λ-6 utilized vehicles to lure 2 of the 3 SCP-2706-2 instances into a designated kill zone manned by <a href="/task-forces#nu-7">MTF Nu-7 (Hammer Down)</a>. MTF Nu-7 was able to terminate both instances by utilizing Mark 77 incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>MTF λ-6 ground forces encircled the third SCP-2706-2 instance inside SCP-2706. MTF Nu-7 provided close air support during this engagement. Both forces engaged the instance in a firefight which, after 2 hours and 12 minutes, was deemed successful in neutralizing it.</p>
<p>SCP-2706 suffered immense damage to its southern section, with multiple trees completely uprooted and a large loss of immature SCP-2706-2 instances. It is estimated that 15% of SCP-2706 is no longer viable for producing SCP-2706-2 instances.</p>

<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong>Addendum 2</strong></span></h4>
<p>Observations of extant SCP-2706-1 instances have shown that the length of inactivity observed in a growth is at least tangentially related to the danger posed by the produced SCP-2706-2 instance.</p>
<p>Though, at least 6 growths have been inactive for more than a decade, following incident 102, only one growth remains that has been inactive since before initial containment. Attempts to examine the interior of this growth through non-invasive means have been thwarted by the unusually high levels of radiation emanating from within it.</p>
<p>The viability of termination attempts relating to the immature SCP-2706-2 instance contained in this growth are under discussion. Please see Dr. Jeremy Monroe for more details.</p>
