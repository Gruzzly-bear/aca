<p><strong>Special containment procedures:</strong> SCP-8974 instances are to be kept in the Site-82 morgue, where they should be routinely checked to ensure stable conditions.</p>
<p>Researcher William Marigold is assigned to monitoring and handling all found instances, by order of site Director Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8974 is the collection of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">7</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">19</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">34</span> an unknown number of severed body parts found across Site-82. All instances have been found in a state of necrosis and demonstrate the ability to fuse with one another if they come into contact.</p>
<p>A genetic match has been found between SCP-8974 and William Marigold.</p>

<tr>
<th>Body part</th>
<th>Number of Instances</th>
<th>Further Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right leg</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>Each leg was found having fused to another. No left legs have been identified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assorted Ligaments</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>Instances were stuck in the internal mechanisms of several pieces of machinery. Marigold suffered several minor injuries to her hands in the process of removing them over the span of several days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper torso</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>9 of the instances were found with broken ribs. 4 were missing lungs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right arm</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>All found wedged between two surfaces from below the elbow. The skin of the forearm was consistently torn off by Marigold on retrieval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Left arm</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Both arms showed signs of physical trauma, with one having several lacerations along the outer forearm and the other having several small circular burns on the upper arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vocal Cords</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>Marigold has repeatedly fallen behind work due to instances fusing with the internal wiring of door ID readers, preventing access to restricted areas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skin</td>
<td>19m^2</td>
<td>Found covering mirrors and other highly reflective surfaces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Brain</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Found by Director Washington in the men's washroom coming out of one of the toilets. Washington failed to identify the instance as being an anomaly, and had it disposed of before it could be presented to Marigold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ovaries</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>Found in meeting room 7 prior to a presentation Marigold was scheduled to deliver to Director Washington. As she handled the 8974 instances, the presentation was taken over by Jr. Researcher Noah Finch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Menstrual fluid</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>An unknown amount of menstrual fluid had released from appliances in Marigold's on site accommodations, including coming from her shower and sink. Marigold's request to change accommodations has been denied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adipose tissue</td>
<td>17Kg</td>
<td>Found in lumps in the accommodations of male staff members several of which had shown signs of physical trauma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teeth</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Instances interrupted Jr. Researcher Finch's work. When he went to report them to Marigold, a dispute began. Marigold escalated the situation by verbally berating Finch. Unusual aggression from Marigold was deemed to be a result of hormone issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Humanoid corpse</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Instance is an amalgamation of anatomically incorrect body parts that form a humanoid shape, sans a head, believed to formed when several instances fused. Discovered when the ceiling tiles holding it collapsed. Marigold refuses to work from her assigned desk following this incident.</td>

<p>Marigold has repeatedly requested that she be removed from SCP-8974 study and to transfer sites. All requests of this nature have been denied. Due to continually worsening performance reviews, Marigold is currently under consideration for disciplinary review.</p>
