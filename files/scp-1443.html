<p>SCP-1443, prior to location transfer.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1443</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-1443 are to be contained in a designated greenhouse in Sector-28. Watering and fertilizing are to be done regularly by Level 2 personnel. Humidity, temperature, and light exposure are to be monitored and maintained accordingly. Level 3 authorization is required prior to any testing involving SCP-1443; results are to be documented and reported immediately.</p>
<p>The containment unit is to be monitored by video surveillance at all times. Any personnel within the containment unit when instances of SCP-1443-1 appear are to be promptly evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1443 is an unknown variation of <em>Campsis × tagliabuana</em>, a trumpet vine hybrid. Though SCP-1443 blooms perennially, it has not been observed to produce seeds. While SCP-1443 possesses no other visual abnormalities, certain branching vines of the plant have been noted to exhibit leaves that grow in a specific arrangement of four leaves, which resemble the forewings and hindwings of Lepidoptera.</p>
<p>Roughly every 24 hours, SCP-1443 will generate iridescent projections of butterflies (designated SCP-1443-1) from the similarly-shaped groups of leaves on its vines. Any human who observes these projections from a close enough distance will experience immediate drowsiness, and will fall asleep if not removed from SCP-1443’s immediate proximity.</p>
<p>Based on observation, instances of SCP-1443-1 remain visible for up to fifteen minutes after being generated by SCP-1443. Though SCP-1443-1 individuals have been noticed to hover over sleeping humans, they will remain within 1 meter of the host plant.</p>
<p>Though an affected individual will awaken hours after encountering SCP-1443-1, initial exposure will result in the individual experiencing apparently innocuous dreams involving butterflies. Over a period of roughly two weeks (14 days), an affected individual will undergo increasing bouts of fatigue and sleepiness, and butterflies will be the sole subject of any dreams they experience.</p>
<p>After two weeks, when the affected individual is next able to sleep, instances (usually 3 to 7 individuals) of SCP-1443-1 will materialize over the head of the sleeping subject. These projections are first seen originating from the forehead of the sleeping human; no changes in sleep mannerism have been recorded during this process. As a group, the SCP-1443-1 seek out a suitable location for rest, usually a patch of open soil. Should the SCP-1443-1 find a place of rest within fifteen minutes, they will cluster together and form a new individual of SCP-1443. If no such place is available, the SCP-1443-1 disappear when fifteen minutes have elapsed. Juvenile instances of SCP-1443 “planted” in this manner do not appear immediately capable of generating SCP-1443-1. The length of time required for these new plants to fully mature is currently unknown.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Human hosts to SCP-1443-1 have reported no pain related to having “harbored” SCP-1443-1 individuals. Exposure to SCP-1443 is believed to result in no lasting side effects.</span> Refer to Incident Log.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1443-1:</strong> During the ██-██-████ test involving D-Class personnel D-26423, an estimated 70 instances of SCP-1443-1 projections were recorded to have emerged following the usual 14 day “development” period (see Incident Log). Testing was temporarily suspended; however, when experiments were reinstated, the number of projections dropped to normal and remained consistent from then on.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt from Incident Log 1443-1:</strong> D-26423 was noted to have suffered a fractured skull following the testing period, and entered a comatose state. The swarm of 1443-1, according to video surveillance, entered a pre-prepared Foundation greenhouse and proceeded to coalesce into an instance of SCP-1443 measuring roughly 3 meters tall. In the interest of eliminating potential threat should the instance grow too large for efficient containment, highly concentrated herbicides were applied to the soil surrounding the SCP-1443 instance. Upon initial introduction of the herbicides, the SCP-1443 instance began to emit vocalizations (see audio log).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Audio Log 1443-2</strong> <em>[roughly translated from Greek]</em></p>
<p><em>[unintelligible]</em> …wandering above not below… ferryman promised <em>[unintelligible]</em> hundred years before crossing… didn’t want to stay <em>[unintelligible]</em> river shore so crowded… why is the gateway collapsing? <em>[unintelligible]</em></p>

<p>Subsequent investigation revealed that the incident coincided with the ████ earthquake in ██████, ██████ which had resulted in ███ deaths.</p>
