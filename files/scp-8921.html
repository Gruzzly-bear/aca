            <h1>SCP-8921</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8921</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Reports of shadow-like figures are to be investigated for potential SCP-8921 activity. If confirmed, Foundation agents are to retrieve the designated subject and perform SCP-8921-A on them immediately. Upon full recovery, subject is to be returned to their family. Their family should be amnesticized of events during the subject's departure.</p>
<p>For those conducting SCP-8921-A and/or overseeing subjects who have undergone SCP-8921-A, noise-cancelling headphones have been provided.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8921 is a phenomenon affecting 0.2% of the population within West Virginia, USA. It typically involves the inexplicable disappearance of a child under six-months of age. All attempts to locate the subject, whether by recording or implanting tracking units, have led to failure. A handful amount of money would be left in place of the subject.</p>
<p>On occasion, subjects have been rediscovered a short period after their vanishing, though a majority of them were considered deceased upon immediate inspection, the primary cause being blunt force trauma. In addition, some bodies were found to have missing limbs or extremities with expected wounds being completely sealed. Autopsies also uncovered trace amounts of kaolinite and feldspar in their blood.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to SCP-8921, families have reported the presence of multiple "shadows" surrounding the subject, often accompanied by distant chattering.</p>
<p>SCP-8921-A is a ritual discovered while searching for ways to combat SCP-8921. Tests utilizing this practice have proven the subject's exemption from SCP-8921's effects, with observation showing no lingering activity after its completion. The instructions for executing SCP-8921-A are listed below for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject is washed thoroughly with a mixture of tap water and vinegar for at least 15 minutes, and left to rest for another five minutes;</li>
<li>The subject is restrained to a flat surface and illuminated to a point where any shadow casted by them is barely visible;</li>
<li>The subject is cut from the area between their eyebrows to their stomach. From there, cuts are made from the main incision to each of their limbs;</li>
<li>The subject is promptly removed from their skin. In all cases, this has been done with relative ease despite the usual difficulties which may occur;</li>
<li>The leftover skin is then stuffed with cotton or a similar material and stitched back together.</li>
</ul>
<p>If executed successfully, the subject should still be alive. SCP-8921 will shift its target from them to their stuffed counterpart, causing the latter to vanish instead. Most attempts also show the subject being able to regenerate their skin, having fully healed in a manner of 10-12 months after the procedure is done. During this period, the subject usually exhibits no other complications.</p>
<p>While SCP-8921-A remains the most effective solution for SCP-8921, research is being done to develop stronger and safer anesthetics to suppress the resulting and continuous pain.</p>
