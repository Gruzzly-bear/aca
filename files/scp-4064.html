<p>SCP-4064-B, pictured when it was first brought into Foundation custody.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation currently has two instances of SCP-4064 in custody at Site-96, which are to be kept in separate high-security containment cells with non-electronic locking mechanisms. No personnel is allowed access to either room without direct permission from the acting Site Director. Communication with SCP-4064 instances, if necessary, is only permitted through mechanical vocal relay systems attached to either room. Visual monitoring is possible through prismatic shafts, though the shafts should be shut when not in use.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of the remainder of SCP-4064 is unknown. This knowledge is of vital importance, not only for the sake of full containment but so SCP-4064 does not gather more intelligence on the Foundation and other <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest" target="_blank">Groups of Interest</a> than it already has.</p>
<p>In the event that the Foundation locates SCP-4064 or its current target, any and all possible monitoring of SCP-4064 is to be halted, and Operation "Wool Coat" is to be enacted. During Operation "Wool Coat", squadrons of armed personnel are sent to the most recent sighting of any instance of SCP-4064 and the current residence of its target. All personnel involved must be bare of any electronic devices or metals that could carry a ferromagnetic charge.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of July 13th, 2015, SCP-4064-A has been relocated to a new site, and granted greater freedoms such as a standard non-hostile humanoid containment cell and increased personnel interaction. It has requested to have its SCP designation removed, and prefers to be called "Jane". This request has been denied. SCP-4064-B should not under any circumstances be made aware that this change has been put into effect.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4064 is a hive-mind, capable of inhabiting six distinct bodies. Iterations of SCP-4064 appear as light-skinned females with face masks<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Though individual hosts of SCP-4064 are non-anomalous by themselves, they share the unique ability to interact with the masks on a biological level. The masks, when worn, allow instances of SCP-4064 to share neuron impulses. Though their reflexes and general physical mobility is unique to each iteration, connected instances of SCP-4064 will speak and perceive their surroundings simultaneously. SCP-4064's primary goal, after self-preservation, is to serve a deity referred to as Anatolia.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>There is another aspect of the masks that, while anomalous, is not restricted to use by SCP-4064 hosts. The masks affect the voice of those wearing them, adding emphasis and vigor to their speech. Persuasion by the wearer of the mask of those in direct auditory range becomes exceedingly difficult to resist.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 01:</strong> On February 22nd, 2014, Doctor Ozid of Site-96 called in that he had been keeping his knowledge of SCP-4064 secret for a number of weeks. He was initially reprimanded for withholding information of anomalous entities, but since the discovery of SCP-4064's emotional properties, it has been lifted from his record. The following is a transcription of the call.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is… This is Doctor Henry Ozid, Site-96 General Research and Containment, Level 3 security clearance, Identification Code: H-373701. The purpose of this call is to report the discovery of an anomalous Keter class entity that is currently uncontained. It's a hive mind of six females, armed and dangerous, well not armed but dangerous… I think, with gold masks. They're really… really beautiful, just stunning. And… shit, sorry, format.</p>
<p>Discovery… I first met one of them on September… 5th. September 5th, 2013, I think. I was at a bar, Cleveland Garden down on Beck Avenue. She was there, had her gold mask on but for some reason, it didn't seem like… it didn't feel weird, it was just like, an accessory. I don't really know how to describe it. She was alone, and we started talking, she seemed really interested, like genuinely interested in everything I had to say, much more than anyone else I've ever met has been. She, she had this voice… just… everything she said, I just wanted to hear… more. She invited me to talk outside, and we went to the alley, and just talked about… so much stuff. I used… the "Sam's County Park" cover story, she… we just kept talking and talking and it was so nice, nothing was awkward like it usually is with me. I felt… overcome with warmth, and I knew I loved her.</p>
<p>We walked for a while and then… I don't really remember what happened next, but eventually she… she brought out her sisters, told me they were on the run from like, a war infested country? Or something? She… they needed a place to stay, and she asked me, and I said "Yes, of course. Anything for you" and we lived with each other for… goddamnit, we lived together for five months. I soon realized the anomalous nature of her and her sisters, they were like… well, like I said, a hive mind but… I don't know. She had made me promise not to tell anyone about her, about them, for safety reasons. I was so compelled to do so, even though… god I knew I had to report it because she's an SCP, or she's going to be… but I just couldn't say no to her, like… her voice, it was like cream.</p>
<p>Fuck, I'm rambling. Look, I'm sorry, I don't really know what to… this is the first time I've… okay… look, I would have called this in the instant I found out but, I'm pretty sure it's memetic… like, mind control, they make you fall in love with them… and I couldn't say anything. I think it's memetic, I'm not 100% sure what counts as memetic but I feel like this is it so, it's not my fault. Okay anyways, I'll try to help with finding them… damnit, I don't know… see you at work on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 02:</strong> Doctor Ozid provided detailed descriptions of SCP-4064 and, to the best of his ability, dates, and locations for each major development in his relationship with SCP-4064. Two weeks after his initial call, an instance of SCP-4064 was identified on a security camera in the Cleveland Garden mall, and MTF Eta-17 ("Loverboys") was sent to stake out the surrounding area, ultimately leading to the successful capture of two of the six instances. These instances, hereby referred to as SCP-4064-A and SCP-4064-B, were brought to the nearby Site-96 and interviewed. Doctor Ozid requested to be involved in these interviews, but due to his prior experience with SCP-4064, his request was denied. The interviews were conducted by the site director, Doctor Laura Knight.</p>

<p>Subsequent interviews were held the following few days, with no new information being gained. Interviews were halted indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 03:</strong> On July 12th, 2015, about four months after the initial capture of SCP-4064-A and SCP-4064-B, during routine monitoring of the entities' cells, SCP-4064-A was seen motioning to the prismatic shaft, calling for attention. The guard on duty proceeded to open the vocal relay system attached to her room and discovered that she was asking for an interview. After deliberation, a date and time were set, and the following interview was held between SCP-4064-A and Doctor Knight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> I understand that you specifically requested this interview, SCP-4064-A. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> Yes. And please, call me Jane.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Knight glances over at the window, where security guard Westrin Jeremiah is positioned. Jeremiah shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> Alright, Jane. Now, I also understand that you have some… terms?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> In return for my compliance, I want you guys to… treat me like an actual person. I want real food and human interaction. I'm not a monster… not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> And we'll do our best to adhere to your requests. Now, are you ready to begin?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> Yes. I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> I have only one question for you. Well, it's more of a request. Tell me everything you can about The Daughters of Anatolia.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4064-A sighs heavily, and stares at her feet for ten seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> Jane? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> Yes, I'm just having trouble figuring out where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> I understand. Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> No, no, I don't want to make this harder than it has to be.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4064-A sighs heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> My earliest memories are no more than a few years old, though I know I must be at least in my late twenties. Truthfully, I do not know much about the Daughters, just that I am one of them. I'm actually the youngest, we… the Sisters, are the youngest to date. Mother… Anatolia, created us to be her… I'm not sure how to put it, breadwinners? We feed her, though not the way most people are fed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A</strong> While we, you and I, eat foods and nutrients, Anatolia feeds on… other things. On emotions. I'm not sure exactly how she gets these emotions, though I suspect it has something to do with the masks. Me and my sisters, we collect… anguish. Our role is admittedly embarrassing, but we… we force others to fall in love with us, and then break their hearts. Through that, Anatolia is nourished.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> I do not know much about the other daughters, but what I can tell you is that there are two other… groups. The Matrons are the next oldest group, there are five of them, and they collect fear for Anatolia. Their methods are morally questionable, though in my short time I've been realizing that none of us are particularly right in what we do. The Matrons collect fear by kidnapping and torturing their victims. They do not kill them, however, That… is the job of the Pipers.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> The Pipers are the oldest of the Daughters. There are only three, and I have never seen them. They… kill… they murder innocent people, good people, all to collect… mourning. Anatolia feeds on strong, negative emotions, and the strongest of all is pure mourning.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> I'm afraid that's all the information I can give. Without my mask, I can't focus, and if I can't focus, I can't know where my sisters are. However, these last few months… I may have been trapped in that forsaken room, but I actually feel like a person. I… I feel good. I have my own thoughts and feelings, it's not something I got to have when I was focused.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> Is that enough?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> Yes, thank you, Jane. This has been an extraordinary help, and I will work with the higher-ups on arranging better living conditions for you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4064-A:</strong> Thank you. And, one more thing. Don't tell my sister I did this. I know she will never listen, but I still love her, and I can't bear the thought that she would think I was brainwashed or something else horrible. The thought that at least she had someone in the next room, experiencing her pain with her, I know that is at least somewhat comforting.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Knight:</strong> Noted. SCP-4064-B will not be made aware of your condition.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Knight motions to the guards outside the room, who come in, restrain SCP-4064-A, and take her back to her room.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 04:</strong> Nearly five years after its initial containment, on April 23rd, 2019, SCP-4064-B was observed to have a notable physical change, that being the appearance of a single grey strand amidst its usually black hair. No alterations have been made to containment procedures since this discovery.</p>
