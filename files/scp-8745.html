<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8745 is Giovanni Mancini, a 78-year-old human male of Italian-American origin. Mancini<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> was formerly the leader of the Black Key, one of the most powerful organized paracrime syndicates in the United States. At its peak, from 1955-1982, the Black Key operated across thirteen U.S. states and was known for trafficking anomalous items.</p>
<p>Mancini can engage in astral projection, an ability he used to communicate telepathically during his tenure as boss of the Black Key. During his leadership, he would use this ability to coordinate operations and pass down orders while avoiding detection or incarceration. This ability is not currently considered a security risk, and requests for anti-extrasensory measures in Mancini's living quarters have been denied.</p>
<p>Mancini arranged for his own arrest by the Foundation in 1982 for reasons he left undisclosed. Under the conditions of his arrest, he offered intelligence on other paracrime networks and continued cooperation with the Foundation in exchange for more comfortable housing and bypass of ordinary protocols. Intelligence provided by Mancini has proven exceptionally valuable to the Foundation, allowing for the neutralization of several paracriminal organizations and the recovery of hundreds of anomalous items and contraband.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8745.1:</strong> Interview Log</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Elliot Monroe, Containment Supervisor</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Mr. Giovanni Mancini</p>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Dr. Monroe and Mr. Mancini sit across from one another in the latter's containment suite. Mancini is in a relaxed position. Monroe fidgets slightly with his pen. On the table rests an untouched mug of espresso.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> Good afternoon. Please state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> Afternoon, doctor! My name is Giovanni Mancini — but you may simply call me Giovanni. And before you ask, yes, I am quite comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> <em>[clears throat]</em> Right, right. Can I get you anything to drink? Whiskey? Wine?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> I'm quite alright, Doctor, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> Good to hear. Let's talk about why you're here, then.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> Why, it is quite simple. I asked to be here, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> Yes but, well, why? You walked away from a syndicate that controlled paracrime across a quarter of the country, without as much as a single shot fired. That's a bit unusual, to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> Doctor, I'm an old man. Tired. I spent forty years watching over <em>le capobastones</em>,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> calculating every move. Now I'm simply here to retire. That was always the mistake with the younger ones — no exit strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe</strong> So you're just… done? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> Indeed. Why else would I come to your Foundation with my hands up?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Monroe taps his pen on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> …Right, of course. It's just… Listen, you've provided us with valuable intelligence so far, but there's some concern that you're… managing your disclosures.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> <em>[smiles]</em> Let's just say old loyalties cast long shadows. The Black Key doesn’t need me barking out orders anymore. It’s evolved beyond that now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> That’s not a denial.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> It’s a fact. And here’s another: a true king never leaves his fortress.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> <em>[leans forward]</em> Mr. Mancini, I — let me be perfectly clear. Are you still in control of the Black Key?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> Directly? No. Indirectly… well, you're asking questions about a world made of ghosts and whispers. You want clean answers — good luck. I gave up control because I could. That's what real power is, Doctor: knowing when you don't have to lift a finger anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> And… and what exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> Nothing at all, Doctor. I’m not a danger to your site. I’m an investment. One who prefers a fine suit to a straightjacket.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Monroe's hand shakes as he adjusts his glasses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Monroe:</strong> You’re remarkably calm for someone in containment.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mancini:</strong> And you’re remarkably nervous for someone with all the keys.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8745.2:</strong> In 1987, a stone passageway was discovered behind a bookshelf in Mancini's study. Upon further investigation, it was found that the passageway led from Compound F to a previously undiscovered escape route from Site-17. Dr. Monroe, the containment supervisor, stated that he was unaware of this, and declined to further comment. When interrogated, Mancini claimed it was an "expansion to my wine cellar."</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8745.3:</strong> In 1992, an independent audit of Site-17's funding found that approximately 15% of the site's annual budget, including Director Graham's extended compensation package, were financed by money laundering networks tied to the Black Key. O5 Command released the following memo.</p>
