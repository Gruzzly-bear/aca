<p><strong>Secure Containment Procedures:</strong> Each iteration of SCP-4681-1 is to be confined in a Class A hospitable living unit with a television set and suitable reading material. The containment unit is to be monitored by both Type-α and Type-β personnel.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4681 is the collective designation of people, places, and anomalous effects surrounding a Temporal Divergence event which occurred at a house in Farmington, CT (designated Location-4681-A) in 1976.</p>

<p>During Incident 4681-▽, a Class-IO Temporal Divergence event occurred at Location-4681-A. While most class-IO events are retroactively repaired at the end of the event (usually in a matter of seconds) this event became self-sustaining and has remained active ever since. <em>(See Incident-4681-▽.)</em> This resulted in the creation of two localized timelines: SCP-4681-α and SCP-4681-β.</p>
<p>Both timelines exist simultaneously. When any person first interacts with SCP-4681, their consciousness "locks" into a single timeline irreversibly, designating them Type-α and Type-β. Type-α people are unable to see, interact, or otherwise perceive the actions of SCP-4681-β and vice versa.</p>
<p>When Type-α people attempt to interact with SCP-4681-β (or vice versa), minor destabilization events can occur. Often these manifest as rapid deterioration of physical surroundings, perceived changes/distortion in physical space, and episodes of [REDACTED] in the personnel attempting the interaction.</p>

</div>
<p>On April 2, 1976, Charlotte and Joseph Latozzi were staying in a home owned by Mr. Latozzi's paternal grandfather Elmer Latozzi (deceased 1981). At about 2:30 am EST, they were awakened by a noise in the downstairs front room caused by Alfred Brass, a home intruder, who had not expected the house to be occupied. At this point, the Class-IO Temporal divergence occurred, followed by the subsequent events.</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top; width: 50%; padding-right: 1em;">
<p><strong>Events of SCP-4681-α</strong></p>
<p>After a brief conversation with each other, Mr. Latozzi retrieved a .22 caliber Colt Diamondback revolver registered to Elmer Latozzi from the nightstand and headed downstairs to investigate. Upon encountering the intruder on the main staircase of the house, a physical altercation ensued. Three shots were fired: the first two struck Brass in the torso; the third bullet struck Mr. Latozzi in the left lung and struck the TH3 vertebrae. Mr. Latozzi was knocked over the banister and fell onto the lower-level, landing on his head and neck. Death of both the intruder and Mr. Latozzi is presumed to have occurred within minutes if not instantly.</p>
<p>After the gunshots were heard, Mrs. Latozzi entered the second floor landing, picking up a silver dish from a hallway table. Upon her discovery of the resulting scene downstairs, she fled to the kitchen and at 2:36 dialed 911. Emergency services arrived at 2:51am and pronounced Mr. Latozzi dead.</p>
<p>At about 3:15am, responding emergency services began arguing about material facts of the scene. According to the official report, during the argument a side table upturned itself in front of several witnesses; the location was evacuated. The officer's radio transmission to dispatch was picked up by Foundation agents monitoring the frequency, and field operatives were dispatched.</p>

<p><strong>Events of SCP-4681-β</strong></p>
<p>After a brief conversation with each other, Mr. and Mrs. Latozzi attempted to get back to sleep. Approximately 10 minutes later, Brass entered the darkened master bedroom on the 2nd floor. His entrance startled Mrs. Latozzi, who reached for a .22 caliber Colt Diamondback revolver registered to Elmer Latozzi which was resting on the nightstand; Brass noticed her movement and grabbed it first, firing two shots in her direction. One shot missed, hitting the far wall; the other entered through the back of her mouth and exited three inches below her left ear. Mr. Latozzi, now awake, attacked the intruder and wrestled the gun from him before firing a single shot into Brass' face, killing him instantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Latozzi attempted to provide first aid to his wife, picking her up and carrying her down the stairs to the phone. He attempted to dial 911 but the call would not connect. Mrs. Latozzi died of blood loss before emergency services arrived at 2:51am.</p>
<p>At about 3:15am, responding emergency services began arguing about material facts of the scene. According to Mr. Latozzi, none of the responding officers would acknowledge his presence, and only one paramedic on the scene even examined the deceased Mrs. Latozzi. When the paramedic and the officers began to argue, Mr. Latozzi became frustrated and violent, upturning a side table in anger. Emergency services left almost immediately, leaving Mr. Latozzi and the crime scene. Foundation agents arrived shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Due to high levels of compliance she has been moved to a living arrangement with a secured balcony and telescope and has been authorized to receive occasional off-hours tutoring from Dr. Linda Haynes, a Type-α Foundation Astronomer.

<p>Foundation agents were notified of an investigation at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Plainville, CT. The family of one Alfred Brass, the home invader who was killed during Incident 4681-▽, sought authorization from Plainville to disinter the body from their family plot. Upon approval, it was determined that the grave had been disturbed previously, and local law enforcement were dispatched.</p>
<p>Foundation agents interviewing local law enforcement determined that approximately half of them saw no evidence of disturbance; the other half concluded from interior damage to the roof of the coffin that the occupant ████████████████████████.</p>
