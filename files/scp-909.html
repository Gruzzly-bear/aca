            <h1>SCP-909</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-909</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-909 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. No writing materials are to be allowed inside the cell. A short summary of SCP-909's current situation is to be pasted on the wall beside the bed. Extras are to be provided if the previous summary is removed by SCP-909. SCP-909 is to be fed three times daily with any peanut-free meal. If SCP-909 is seen attempting to write or draw, he is to be incapacitated through non-lethal means.</p>
<p>Currently experimentation with SCP-909's effects has been discontinued, due to risk of containment breach. Research may be conducted if the current Site Director's approval is given.</p>
<p>As of current regulations on "Misters", SCP-909 is to be contained in Hall ██ of Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-909 appears to be a young adult Caucasian male suffering from permanent anterograde amnesia. SCP-909 seems to be aware of his condition but cannot recall experiences past this, aside from memories gained due to SCP-909's effects.</p>
<p>SCP-909's anomalous effects become apparent when it writes down any of the experiences still in its working memory. When described through writing, experiences immediately enter SCP-909's long term memory. However, the experience disappears from the memory of all other persons involved.</p>
<p>SCP-909 is allergic to peanuts and will go into anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of any peanut products.</p>
<p>SCP-909 was discovered at Entrance [EXPUNGED] of Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 909-1:</strong> The words "Mr. Forgetful, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment" are tattooed upon SCP-909's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909 had been wearing a 3-piece suit with the brand name "Doctor's Orders" sewn into the tag. Foundation personnel have yet to find a clothing company operating under this name.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 909-2:</strong> Further examination of SCP-909's clothing revealed a list of other possible instances of anomalous humanoids similar to SCP-909 (See Document 909-a) inside the left pants pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 909-3:</strong> Interview Log</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-909</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ███████████</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-909 was put into initial observation for seven hours, during which the subject's anterograde amnesia and relation to <a href="/scp-905">SCP-905</a> were discovered. SCP-909 was then taken in for interview.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> Good morning, Nine-Oh-Nine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a doctor of the Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> The Foundation? What's that? Why d-</p>
<p>NOTE: At this point Dr. ███████████ presses a small button, generating a loud noise lasting 5 seconds. SCP-909 is seen to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> Hello, Nine-Oh-Nine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a Doctor of The Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> The Foundation? Wha-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> Okay, let's try something else. Write down what I just told you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> Alright. (SCP-909 accepts the pen and stationery and proceeds to write.)</p>
<p>NOTE: Later investigation of Dr. ███████████'s notes showed that he had planned to press the button previously mentioned at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> (Brief pause) Hey, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> I'm the, uh, SCP under your custody. Don't you remember?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-909:</strong> Don't you remember?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. ███████████:</strong> No. Where am I? What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Dr. ███████████ and SCP-909 were removed from the room amid confusion from all personnel involved in the incident. SCP-909 later explained the situation to uninvolved personnel and was placed in his holding cell. Dr. ███████████ was discharged from duty and given a Class-B amnestic.</p>
