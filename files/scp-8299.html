<p>SCP-8299 is an anomalous subspecies of manatee taxonified as the True Northern manatee (<em>T. m. semperiam</em>). SCP-8299 live throughout the James Bay region of the northernmost part of Ontario, Canada. Most members of its subspecies populate the brackish waters surrounding Akimiski Island, Nunavut, placing the extent of the subspecies’ habitat at longitudes much further north than all other extant manatee.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">Roughly 1500 km further northward than the range of its closest counterpart, the Florida manatee (<em>T. m. latirostris</em>).</span></p>
<p>SCP-8299 are demonstrably sapient. Most SCP-8299 exhibit passive fluency in one or more human languages (in descending frequency: dialectal Cree, English, French, Ojibwe, and Inuktitut) but are not verbally conversant. Rather, SCP-8299 communicate via an anomalous form of echolocation akin to telepathy. A minority population within the Akimiski group can freely understand higher-level human concepts, express them with clarity, and commit them to long-term memory. Coinciding with its open containment by The Foundation, however, the average intelligence of the collective populations has seen a steady increase; the number of capables has also progressively increased and become a larger proportion of the whole.</p>
<p>Adult SCP-8299 instances perform vocalizations similar to whalesong. These vocalizations are most present during the SCP-8299 mating season, which occurs between March and mid-May.</p>
<p>The anomalous properties of SCP-8299 manifest in the physiological and psychological effects their songs have on their local ecology. Humans who are exposed to SCP-8299 songs report feelings of elation alongside increased speed and soundness of decision-making. Depressive humans specifically have reported a clarity of thought, greater motivation to complete tasks, and greater degrees of socialization. Humans who take a hostile disposition towards SCP-8299 — such as hunters, who pursue SCP-8299 for their fat and hides — are afforded headaches, migraines, nausea, vertigo, dyspepsia, and general malaise.</p>
<p>SCP-8299 exist in harmony with their marine environment; their song has marked positive effects on the surrounding waters and shoreline. The long-term presence of SCP-8299 in James Bay after completing their migration has cleansed pollutants in the bay on the whole, creating and sustaining conditions that result in water clarity. Their skin absorbs contaminants that come into contact with their pelage. SCP-8299 have a symbiotic relationship with lakebed kelp in particular, promoting the growth of kelp forests in an ecology that otherwise lacks in the plant. Marine wildlife populations experience less negative health outcomes than their terrestrial neighbours, and live longer on average.</p>
<p>Marine biologists believe the climactic and marine conditions of James Bay should be inhospitable to manatee. Local populations of settler-colonial descent claim no knowledge of <em>T. m. semperiam</em>.</p>

<h3 id="toc3"><span>Arrival of SCP-8299 and Initial Interactions With First Nations Communities</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p>The origin of SCP-8299 is still widely debated, but the following is considered most plausible.</p>
<p>SCP-8299 is theorized to be closely related to <a href="/scp-327">SCP-327</a>, a species of anomalous manatee capable of human speech. Because of infighting and the struggles of daily life, it is theorized that a select herd of manatee migrated north from the Gulf of Mexico circa 500 <span style="font-variant: all-small-caps">BCE</span>. Although oceanic temperatures in the North Atlantic proved harsh to the subtropical manatee, most instances survived and reached the James Bay region. The local population ultimately settled here in part because of its relative isolation and rich habitat.</p>
<p>For generations, SCP-8299 and regional indigenous populations engaged in periodic interactions. A number of mutual traditions were observed, including various songs and dances.</p>
<p>SCP-8299 had a thriving culture, reaching its peak population in 1470 <span style="font-variant: all-small-caps">CE</span> before gradually decreasing. They commonly lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving around the region every few months so as to ensure an adequate supply of food.</p>

<hr/>
<p>A Canadian Foundation precursor and arm of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). The Department operated with nearly limitless reach for almost 200 years, until the British Crown negotiated the transference of Rupert's Land from the HBC to the Dominion of Canada in 1870.</p>
<p>Its expansive catalogue and unique methods of restraining and trapping cryptid species were recovered by The Foundation sometime in the early 20th century. Most items in its catalogue were later recaptured and relocated to <a href="/secure-facility-dossier-site-43">Provisional Site-43</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc6"><span>Colonial Interactions With SCP-8299</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p>The Department for the Study and Catalogue of Especially Quaint Furbearers (DSCEQF) made the first documented observations of SCP-8299 in 1827.</p>
<p>Their discovery was not the Department's first activity in the region. In the mid-1600s, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) came to establish one of its earliest fur trading posts in the region, further down the coast from Akimiski Island. This post, Fort Albany, had to be relocated multiple times as a result of conflict with the French.</p>
<p>In 1708, it was secretly relocated once again — this time, the DSCEQF moved in and used the new location as a fixture at the fringe of its operations. Its then-base of operations existed much further inland. This secret move provided the DSCEQF narrow escape from the Battle of Fort Albany, on 26 June 1709, at the premises of the fort's former location.</p>
<p>During this time, the DSCEQF frequently hunted and exterminated the local wildlife population, leading to the extinction of many species, both mundane and anomalous. Concurrently, the British perpetrated the wide-scale suppression of First Nations cultures. The DSCEQF wiped out large SCP-8299 habitats and forced them to assimilate, further destroying the SCP-8299 population. Many members of SCP-8299 were forced into slavery in and around Department outposts.</p>
<p>The DSCEQF initially made use of SCP-8299 for their fur and bodily materials. The British government fully supported this move, and provided cover stories for decades. During this time, over 90% of the SCP-8299 population was wiped out.</p>

<h3 id="toc8"><span>The Revolution of Fire</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p>During the late 1860s, SCP-8299 became increasingly restless in their plight. Unfair treatment and lack of adequate food prompted an underground group to form. This group, calling themselves the Peace Fighters, gradually gained members who launched protests. They advocated for an end to their slavery by any means necessary. Despite suppressive campaigns on the part of the DSCEQF, the Peace Fighters grew to encompass a large majority of the SCP-8299 population.</p>
<p>This reached a boiling point in early 1870 when a large revolt broke out, known as the Revolution of Fire. Large numbers of SCP-8299 instances defended themselves against human attackers. In several engagements, members of nearby First Nations communities aided SCP-8299 instances in destroying DSCEQF outposts. Eventually, the Revolution of Fire succeeded and the DSCEQF gradually retreated from the area. That same year, the British Crown negotiated the transfer of Rupert's Land from the HBC to the Dominion of Canada, and the DSCEQF disbanded.</p>
<p>Scores of humans and SCP-8299 instances were killed, the latter causing a sharp decrease in the already small SCP-8299 population.</p>

<p>Following this, Intermediary Site-99 endeavoured to develop a better relationship with SCP-8299 by formalizing regular dialogues. These dialogues resulted in the loosening of Special Containment Procedures.</p>

<h3 id="toc10"><span>Modern-Day Observations</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p>Following the dissolution of DSCEQF, SCP-8299 enjoyed relative freedom. However, they still suffered from sharp food shortages caused by overfishing in an unregulated fishing market. The population continued to plummet until an average of 50 instances remained year-round.</p>
<p>In 1930, 60 years after the initial revolt, The Foundation received a high volume of reports describing an ethereal-sounding song heard along the shoreline of the Hudson and James Bays. Occupants of shallow-water fishing vessels contributed the majority of reports. The Foundation discovered SCP-8299 during the summer of that year.</p>
<p>Although interactions between The Foundation and SCP-8299 initially proved tense, both parties eventually settled on a secrecy agreement. Only minimal containment was observed thereafter. Foundation forces monitored the region for the next 70 years and exercised a non-disruptive relationship with SCP-8299.</p>
<p>As of 2000, only one living member of SCP-8299 remained.</p>

</div>
<div class="report-box">
<h3 id="toc12"><span>The SONG OF SORROW</span></h3>
<hr/>
<p>The SONG OF SORROW was an anomalous event recurring periodically around the Hudson Bay region. It was characterized by sustained cries coming from SCP-8299 and could be heard in a radius spanning tens of kilometres. It originally took the form of a song developed during the slavery of SCP-8299, passing from generation to generation until the modern day. The song also featured lyrics, albeit rarely.</p>
<hr/>
<p>VEILBURST Protocol was enacted on 26 April 2020; the Veil of Normality was forcibly dissolved. Immediately following this, reports in and around the Hudson Bay region characterized a widespread melody consistent with the SONG OF SORROW, despite SCP-8299 having been neutralized 20 years previously.</p>
<p>The event lasted for several minutes before gradually quieting. The Foundation, deeming the extranormal event a one-time occurrence, conducted no further investigation.</p>
<p>Below is a list of lyrics heard during the event.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5 id="toc13"><span>Oh, the work is hard but the sun is shining,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc14"><span>Our bodies are pushed to exhaustion, many do not survive,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc15"><span>Despite this, we keep singing,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc16"><span>'Cause one day, our children will still be alive.</span></h5>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5 id="toc17"><span>Maybe one day it'll all be okay,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc18"><span>That day,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc19"><span>We'll all celebrate the peaceful moon watching over us,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc20"><span>With nothing to fuss,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc21"><span>But we'll have to wait,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc22"><span>As our labour continues on.</span></h5>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5 id="toc23"><span>It's a beautiful day outside,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc24"><span>Yet we're denied,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc25"><span>But we'll carry on,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc26"><span>Our culture will not be destroyed,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc27"><span>And eventually, we will be overjoyed.</span></h5>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5 id="toc28"><span>There is hope, a light at the end of the tunnel,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc29"><span>One day, I hope man will see their mistakes,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc30"><span>And learn, so there will be no more trouble,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc31"><span>Then we won't have to hide in the lakes,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc32"><span>We'll be able to live quietly, peacefully, like we did.</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc33"><span>Just not yet, as we still have to live in fear.</span></h5>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<h5 id="toc34"><span>But for now, we'll persist,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc35"><span>We'll keep surviving,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc36"><span>Keep living our lives,</span></h5>
<h5 id="toc37"><span>So our story won't be forgotten.</span></h5>
