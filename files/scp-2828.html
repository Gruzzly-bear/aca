<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2828 is currently uncontainable and is ubiquitous in global populations. However, risk of breach of security or public discovery is deemed low, as it is undetectable without the use of strong mnestics.</p>
<p>Undercover Foundation operatives, primarily members of MTF ε-7 ("Forget Me Nots"), posing as high-ranking employees in pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies and as research oversight officials in relevant universities are to monitor any projects aimed at production of chemicals with known or suspected mnestic capabilities, procure prototype batches to test for effectiveness at facilitating perception of SCP-2828, and either halt the research or allow it to continue based on the results. Foundation webcrawler algorithms are to routinely search through the Internet, university intranets, and scientific journals for any potential references to SCP-2828 and operatives are to investigate accordingly.</p>
<p>With MTF η-10 ("See No Evil") and MTF η-11 ("Savage Beasts") on standby, descriptions of SCP-2828's visual appearance, texture, sound, odor, or taste are to be tested for safety with D-class personnel by RAISA and Antimemetics Division personnel and redacted or expunged accordingly.</p>
<p>The personnel files of all Foundation personnel who have never observed SCP-2828 under the effects of mnestics are to be appended under Level 3 Clearance with a list of the senses associated with any descriptions of SCP-2828 to which the respective personnel have been exposed. The personnel files of all Antimemetics Division personnel and any other personnel who work with mnestics or SCP-2828 documentation are to be checked before each administration of mnestics and before each approval of access to SCP-2828 documentation and are to be updated within one workday of any new exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2828 is an antimemetic and nearly undetectable part of the human body located behind the ear. The role of SCP-2828 in bodily systems is virtually nonexistent and is hypothesized to be fully vestigial.</p>
<p>SCP-2828 can only be perceived through the use of Class-W or stronger mnestics, but only to a limited degree if at all. When it is perceived, it can only be perceived with one sense<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Whichever sense is used to perceive SCP-2828 first by a given subject is the only sense that subject will ever be able to perceive it with. For example, if a subject saw SCP-2828 before he or she felt, heard, smelled, or tasted it, then that subject would not be able to ever feel, hear, smell, or taste it.</p>
<p>This effect extends to all forms of communication; a subject who has seen SCP-2828 is unable to understand a written or verbal description of its smell, descriptions of the sound it makes, et cetera. Amnestics are capable of erasing memories of SCP-2828, but the subject will still be unable to use any sense other than the one that subject first used to perceive it again. This is thought to be because SCP-2828 permanently alters the brain chemistries of those who perceive it.</p>
<p>A subject who has never observed SCP-2828 under the influence of mnestics can be told and fully comprehend information regarding SCP-2828 that uses more than one sense to describe it. However, if said subject uses mnestics afterwards and attempts to observe SCP-2828 using any sense, [REDACTED]. It is therefore imperative that no Foundation personnel be exposed to any remotely detailed description of SCP-2828's appearance, texture, sound, odor, or taste.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Other than this, SCP-2828 poses no immediate danger and possesses no further anomalous properties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><tt><strong>Date:</strong> 05/09/19██</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Test Administrator:</strong> Dr. A██████, Antimemetics Division</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Test Subject:</strong> D-206344</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Foreword:</strong> Subject was given a ██mg dosage of Class-W mnestics and ordered to look at the area behind Dr. A██████'s ears and describe what she saw. Subject was then ordered to feel the area under supervision of two armed guards and describe what she felt.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>First Sense:</strong> Sight</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Results:</strong> Subject successfully described SCP-2828's appearance, stating [DATA EXPUNGED], matching the description provided by Dr. A██████. When ordered to feel it, Subject stated she could not "feel anything at all." She went on to say she could "see [her] hand touching the thing, but [she could not] feel a damn thing."</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Notes:</strong> Results support the hypothesis that SCP-2828 maintains a consistent appearance no matter the observer.</tt></p>

<p><tt><strong>Date:</strong> 05/30/19██</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Test Administrator:</strong> Dr. J██████, Medical Research Division</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Test Subject:</strong> D-206344 (Subject A), D-206345 (Subject B)</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Foreword:</strong> Following Dr. A██████'s promotion to Project Director, Dr. J██████ took over testing.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Subject B, who had been blind from birth, was administered a ██mg dosage of Class-W mnestics, ordered to feel the area behind Subject A's ears, and describe what he felt to Subject A. Subject A was ordered to describe what she heard Subject B say. Subject B was ordered to type his description with a Braille-to-English typewriter and Subject A was ordered to orate the description.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>First Sense:</strong> Subject A: sight; Subject B: touch</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Results:</strong> Subject B reported [DATA EXPUNGED] and related the description to Subject A. When asked to repeat what Subject B said, Subject A claimed he had not spoken to her. Subject B repeated himself, and Subject A claimed Subject B must have been speaking in another language and was unable to repeat what she heard. Dr. J██████ was able to hear and understand Subject B's description in English.</tt></p>
<p><tt>After Subject B typed his description and handed it to Subject A, she claimed the "letters moved" and she could not "find the words." When Subject B typed up a second, identical description and handed it to Subject A, she claimed it was a completely blank piece of paper. Dr. J██████ was able to read and understand Subject B's description.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-2828's antimemetic effect seems to extend to verbal and written forms of communication. I, Dr. J██████, have listened to Subject A's description of SCP-2828's appearance and can comprehend it as well as Subject B's description of how it feels. This must be because I have not witnessed SCP-2828 directly for myself. I am putting in a request for a personal dose of Class-W mnestics.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Request approved.<em>–Site Antimemetics Division Director [REDACTED]</em></tt></p>

<p>If you are reading this, then you have undergone enough memetic resistance conditioning, according to your credentials, to be safely permitted access to the following classified information. However, due to the strong cognitohazardous nature of SCP-2828, some information must be left out for your safety.<em>–Dr. A██████</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anatomy of SCP-2828 is outwardly similar to that of the outer ear, possessing a small auricle. It consists mainly of otherwise typical epidermal and dermal skin cells, with some internal cartilage and very minute amounts of fat, but no nerves and few blood vessels.</p>
<p>SCP-2828-1 denotes cells that make up SCP-2828 instances.</p>
<p>No SCP-2828-1 instance observed thus far has ever made any movements whatsoever. Chemical tests on SCP-2828-1 have produced no reactions on the part of SCP-2828-1; instead of interacting with molecules that comprise SCP-2828-1, all reagents seem to "bounce off" the membrane. Protein pumps and channels are nonfunctional in a similar manner. Furthermore, no metabolic processes have been recorded to occur within SCP-2828-1 instances. All SCP-2828-1 instances observed thus far are "frozen" in an identical manner.</p>
<p>An anomalous and apparently indestructible substance, referred to as SCP-2828-2, found between SCP-2828-1 instances lock SCP-2828-1 in their set configuration. The natures of SCP-2828-1 and SCP-2828-2 make SCP-2828 effectively indestructible, which has somewhat hindered research.</p>
<p>SCP-2828's small size makes it only effective as a defensive benefit against puncture wounds to a specific area of the throat from a specific angle. This makes it particularly effective at providing protection from ███████<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> █████ and is speculated to have been evolved to suit this purpose. Testing with SCP-████-EX, one of the last living ████████, greatly supports this hypothesis. ████████ had innate mnestic qualities and kept extensive records on hominid anatomy and behavior that they shared amongst themselves. Because of this, SCP-2828 would have incapacitated these natural predators of early hominids while leaving normal early humans unharmed.</p>
<p>With ████████ now extinct, SCP-2828 serves no further obvious function and poses a significant cognitohazardous threat to Foundation personnel. If a subject learns of complicated descriptions of SCP-2828 that use more than one sense and then uses mnestics to observe it firsthand, the subject will experience multiple tonic-clonic seizures, several strokes, and cerebral hemorrhaging, invariably leading to death. It is therefore imperative that precautions be taken to avoid future complications.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2828-01:</strong> SCP-2828 was discovered after Dr. A██████, a Foundation researcher and one of Site-██'s clinicians, was transferred to the Antimemetics Division in 19██. As with all Antimemetics Division staff, she began a Class-W mnestic regimen. She continued to act as a Site-██ clinician. Two days later, on ██/██, Dr. A██████ performed a semiannual checkup on Agent F███ and noticed a peculiarity behind his ear. When she touched the area, she was unable to receive any tactile stimulation whatsoever. She touched the same area on herself with the same result. Recognizing the apparent anomalous influence, she contacted Site Director S███████ immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2828-02:</strong> Following the events of 06/17/19██, all tests regarding SCP-2828 have been suspended by order of Site Director S███████.</p>
