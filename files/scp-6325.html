<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6325 is to be stored within climate-controlled containment locker 6325-A at Site-42. Portable items (smaller than 1 m<sup>3</sup>) affected by SCP-6325 should be stored in the adjacent lockers 6325-B through 6325-T. Live humanoids affected by SCP-6325 should be confined within containment cells 6325-1 through 6325-5. In the case of oversized, immobile, or structural items affected by SCP-6325, an opaque covering should be firmly secured over the affected area.</p>
<p>Personnel are not to handle SCP-6325 outside of a supervised testing environment or preauthorized research session. Those handling SCP-6325 must take care not to touch any person or object beyond the parameters of the experiment.</p>
<p>Testing on conscious humanoid personnel is currently suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6325 is a small codex-style notebook, consisting of sheets of parchment bound within a wood and leather cover. From the exterior, the notebook appears to contain roughly one hundred sheets, but flipping through the pages reveals that they in fact number in the thousands, far more than the binding can physically contain. Written in calligraphic ink on each page are between two and five poems appearing in the language most comprehensible to the current reader(s). A title appears on the notebook's cover, written in the same hand as the poems and reading simply "APOPHORETA."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The parchment dates to the 2nd century CE, while the cover seems to have been added later, c. 6th century CE. Despite its age, the notebook shows few signs of wear and tear, with the exception of occasional markings on the interior, and evidence that certain pages have been forcibly removed. Although follicular examination of the parchment indicates a standard sheepskin composition, biomolecular analysis does not conform to any known species of sheep.</p>
<p>Whenever a person is in possession of SCP-6325 (i.e. holds it in their hands, a pocket, a bag, or similar enclosed space) any physical object or entity touched by that person is "inscribed" with a two- to five-line poem. "Inscription" takes the form most suited to the material being touched (e.g. fabric is embroidered, stone is carved, flesh is tattooed, etc.). The style of the poem can vary considerably, provided that it does not fall outside the apparent length limitation of two to five lines.</p>
<p>As soon as a poem is inscribed by SCP-6325, the same poem simultaneously appears in the next available space in the notebook, written in the same hand as the prior poems. Should no space be available, a new blank page will appear in order to accommodate the new poem.</p>
<p>Most of the poems are written in an irreverent tone seemingly designed to elicit an amused reaction from the reader. Poems inscribed on inanimate objects generally describe some characteristic of the object itself. Poems inscribed on living organisms are invariably written as if to insult or embarrass the organism. See below for specific examples.</p>
<p>A secondary anomalous property of SCP-6325 manifests immediately following the inscription process on any sentient organism. Upon being inscribed, the organism is afflicted with an intensely violent hostility toward the person holding the notebook, and will focus exclusively on attacking and killing that person. The subject expresses no rational thought during this period of rage, and in humans, neurological scans confirm a sudden and sustained spike of activity in the hypothalamus and amygdala at the precise moment that the inscription of the poem ceases. The enraged subject can be subdued by normal means, but the anger will not subside until either the subject or the notebook's owner is dead. It is important to note that this property of SCP-6325 affects humans and animals alike, and that the subject need not read or comprehend the inscribed poem prior to experiencing the adverse effects.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-6325 was recovered from the mansion of Mr. ██████ █████, a reclusive steel tycoon living on the outskirts of █████, █████. Local police responded to the report of a ███ delivery driver who had turned himself in and confessed to fatally shooting Mr. █████ for reasons he was unable to explain. The driver displayed a prominent tattoo across his forehead, reading as follows:</p>
<p><tt><em>This man brings gifts to all, like Santa Claus!<br/>
But he can't send himself a smaller schnozz.</em></tt><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon arriving at the residence, responding officers found the body of Mr. █████ lying in a pool of blood and bearing a single gunshot wound to the head.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> The officers' preliminary investigation of the home quickly revealed that nearly every visible object and surface had been marked with several lines of poetry. The unusual nature of this crime scene attracted the attention of an embedded Foundation agent at the █████ police department. Additional Foundation agents swiftly secured the residence and took control of the investigation.</p>
<p>During the process of cataloguing the items in the residence, Agent ██████ came across SCP-6325 underneath a sofa a short distance from Mr. █████'s corpse. Upon reaching under the sofa and making contact with the artifact, Agent ██████ was startled to realize that every article of clothing and piece of equipment on his person was simultaneously inscribed with a poem of similar composition to the others in the residence. SCP-6325 was consequently brought into Foundation custody at Site-42, along with Mr. █████'s body and all movable inscribed objects. The mansion itself was demolished under the pretense of being unsafe for human habitation. The tattooed delivery driver was treated with class-B amnestics and released under Standard Cover Story 64 ("Drunken Bet Gone Too Far"). Any police officers with knowledge of the incident were likewise administered class-A amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Exemplary Log 6325-01:</strong> The following log presents examples of poems found within SCP-6325 dating prior to its containment. The poems are numbered according to the order in which they appear in the notebook. Dates provided have been inferred based on the content, placement order, and context of the poems. Due to the prolific nature of SCP-6325's anomalous effect, a full catalog of these poems would require excessive resources to replicate. Personnel with written permission from two (2) Level 4 researchers may consult SCP-6325 directly, with the understanding that any items on their person (clothing, jewelry, glasses, etc.) will be subject to inscription and subsequent confiscation.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 6325-38-B:</strong> On ██/██/20██, Dr. ████████ conducted an SCP-6325 testing session with D-2783. Upon receiving his inscribed "tattoo" (see final entry in Experimentation Log 6325-01), D-2783 broke free of his restraints and violently lunged to attack Dr. ████████. In reaching for Dr. ████████'s coat, D-2783 managed to grab hold of the last page of SCP-6325 (where his own inscription had been copied) and tore it from its binding. Immediately upon separation of the page from SCP-6325, D-2783's head was torn cleanly from his shoulders by an unknown force. The removed page also contained three earlier poems, inscribed on Dr. ████████'s new cell phone (subsequently found in his pocket in two pieces, nonfunctional), a specimen of <em>Ferocactus pottsii</em> (found in a puddle of water in containment locker 6325-T, bisected lengthwise), and a live <em>Rattus norvegicus domestica</em> (found in its cage, fatally bisected).</p>
<p>Research on conscious humanoids has been temporarily halted pending further investigation of this new anomalous property.</p>
