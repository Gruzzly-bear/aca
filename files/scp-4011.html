<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4011 is a facility located within and beneath Victoria Crater on Mars. The only known entrance to the structure is an airlock hidden beneath an alcove on the northern rim of the crater. The full extent of the facility is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">currently unknown</span> likely to be infinite. The architecture and symbols found within the facility are similar to those of a standard Foundation site, though the materials used for construction appear to be of Martian origin.</p>
<p>The interior of the facility is entirely isolated from the outside, and neither traditional radio communication nor any tested anomalous communication system<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-627127-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-627127-2')">2</a></sup> will allow a signal to pass between the facility's interior and its exterior. The internal atmosphere is comprised almost entirely of argon gas, with trace concentrations of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>SCP-4011-1 is the designation given to a large-scale, distributed anomalous artificial intelligence system within SCP-4011, comprised of a large number<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-627127-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-627127-3')">3</a></sup> of robotic beings, each individually sapient yet also interconnected into an overall hierarchy.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-627127-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-627127-4')">4</a></sup> SCP-4011 is inhabited solely by instances of SCP-4011-1, which perform various maintenance and administrative tasks. SCP-4011-1 instances show a large degree of variation in form; the 3 currently-known categories of instance have been designated SCP-4011-1A through -1C, and are described below.</p>

<tr>
<td>SCP-4011-1A</td>
<td>Humanoid androids made of a polished, metallic material. Height tends to vary between 1.7 and 2.5 meters. Body shapes and proportions correspond to those of humans, though they lack fine detail or facial features.</td>
<td>General maintenance tasks and communication with other beings. Observations during Incident 4011-28 indicate that they may serve as higher-level coordinating nodes in the hierarchy, directing other instances during combat or similar activities necessitating mass organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-4011-1B</td>
<td>Sets of metallic spheres, usually organized as a single larger sphere with a 'tail' of smaller spheres extending below it. Instances vary widely in diameter, with the smallest measuring as small as 2 centimeters in primary-sphere diameter and the largest reaching 1 meter. Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown means, and are also capable of receiving, transmitting, and jamming signals sent through radio-frequency and [REDACTED] channels, though instances are not thought to be immune to the effect of SCP-4011's boundary.</td>
<td>Data storage, transmission, and processing within the SCP-4011 hierarchy, as well as covert data exfiltration from and interference with external computer systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-4011-1C</td>
<td>Small pyramids made of the same material as -1A and -1B instances, measuring 1 centimeter to a side. Capable of exerting an anomalous force to form materials around them into arbitrary shapes, instances have often been observed to construct 'shells' around themselves when traveling outside of SCP-4011. Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown means.</td>
<td>Rough construction and repair tasks. Instances do not appear to be capable of fine manipulation of materials; however, individual instances have been observed carrying masses estimated at up to 12 tonnes, and they are capable of lifting larger masses through the coordination of multiple instances.</td>

<p>Due to the worrying implications of an unknown Foundation-marked structure on the surface of Mars, exploration of the anomaly was deemed a moderate priority. However, remote-operated vehicle missions in 2009 and 2012 met with failure: contact with the rovers was lost immediately upon entry due to SCP-4011's communications-blocking effect, and the vehicles' auto-pilot systems failed to guide them out of the facility.

<div class="vcomms">
<p>&lt; U53-Fenn&gt;: Did the entity just mention your serial, Mallow?<br/>

<p>Between 2052-06-12 and 2053-01-05, the RAISA Central Office received a total of 652 documents from SCP-4011-1.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A document describing SCP-████. The document is similar to current Foundation documentation on SCP-████, except for the addition of a 20,532-word section labeled "Origin." This section goes into exacting detail in describing the object's creation by a branch of the Church of the Broken God in 1851. Analysis of the documentation is still ongoing, and has led to the identification of several historical figures as Church members. Additionally, a previously-unknown property of SCP-████ was discovered through analysis of tests allegedly performed during the object's creation, leading to a significant improvement in containment procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 4011-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2052-11-07</p>
<p><strong>Description of Incident:</strong> During a conversation with Area-R01 Director Eva Waterford, Specialist Fenn demonstrated signs of memory compromise, referring to a nonexistent anomalous group named the "Nation of Lodia." This conversation was recorded by Area sensors, and an abridged transcript is provided below.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Recording Excerpt, 2052-11-07 18:41 Earth-GMT&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Specialist Fenn:</strong> I'm just worried we won't have a Foundation to come home to, with the war and all.</p>
<p><strong>Director Waterford:</strong> I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Fenn:</strong> You know. I'm sure we'll beat the Lodians soon and everything will be fine, but… what if we don't? We might be trapped here for the rest of our lives! And then we'll have to figure out what to do when you humans start running out of supplies-</p>
<p><strong>Waterford:</strong> Fenn?</p>
<p><strong>Fenn:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Waterford:</strong> What are you talking about? The Foundation isn't at war with anyone.</p>
<p><em>[At this point, Director Waterford activates a silent alarm, summoning Area security forces.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Fenn:</strong> Director, the Nation of Lodia is the largest threat the Foundation has ever seen! We've been at war for three years! How else do you explain why we came here? Why Frostman willingly helped the Foundation, after all we've done to them?</p>
<p><strong>Waterford:</strong> Command Override: ████████ 312.</p>
<p><em>[Fenn is paralyzed by the override command as security staff enter the room. Note that he is not rendered incapable of speech.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Waterford:</strong> Sorry, Fenn. One of us has been seriously affected by 4011. Security, place Fenn and I into isolation and raise Code █████ with Command.</p>
<p><strong>Fenn:</strong> Eva, we were in Site-64 when it fell!<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-627127-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-627127-12')">12</a></sup></p>
<p><em>[Director Waterford is led away by security staff to an isolation cell. Specialist Fenn is carried to a separate cell.]</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Recording Excerpt&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> After interrogation, similar memories were found in all members of Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53. All memories of the "Nation of Lodia" were expunged from task-force members using Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal E and replaced with reconstructed memories that reflect actual events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foundation analysis of this incident indicates that SCP-4011 produces a strong memetic effect, modifying the memories of exposed personnel to include false groups and events.</p>
