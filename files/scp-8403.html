<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8403 is kept in a windowless standard humanoid containment cell. To prevent misuse, all <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">experimentation</span> interactions must involve the entire project team, including the team lead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8403 is an adult female humanoid of average height and unknown origin. It has dark brown hair and appears to be of Middle Eastern descent.</p>
<p>SCP-8403’s primary anomalous property is its ability to be manipulated. These manipulations can only be brought about by an individual who maintains direct visual contact and is within <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">20</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">10</span> 5 meters of SCP-8403. Observed changes thus far have been entirely physical in nature, though it is theorized that other aspects of SCP-8403, including its psychological, temporal, and existential nature<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-705422-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-705422-1')">1</a></sup>, can also be manipulated.</p>
<p>SCP-8403's secondary anomalous properties consist of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">near-total</span> partial translucency and intangibility. Light that passes through it is scattered and produces a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vague</span> defined shadow. Tactile contact is analogous to moving through a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">low</span> high density fluid medium, such as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">oil</span> mercury.</p>
<p>These anomalous properties are likely a natural result of the entity’s Hume level<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-705422-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-705422-2')">2</a></sup>, which is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">significantly</span> below that of a baseline human’s. As a result, SCP-8403 is considered <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">mostly</span> slightly detached from baseline reality, which allows for entities with higher Hume levels (including baseline humans) to exert their influence on SCP-8403 in a similar manner to ontokinetic or reality bending abilities, though this influence is entirely limited to SCP-8403 itself and cannot affect its surroundings.</p>
<p>It has demonstrated the ability to communicate fluently in English.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8403-1: Initial Interview</strong></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/04/2011<br/>
<strong>Interviewers:</strong> Senior Researcher Milton Hale, <em>Project Lead and Head Researcher</em><br/>
Researcher Luzia Mensing, <em>Applied Ontokinesis Specialist</em><br/>
Junior Researcher Alfie Xiao, <em>Assistant</em><br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-8403</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403, who appears largely translucent, is attempting to perform a handstand; however, it falls over as the researchers file into the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Good morning, SCP-8403.</p>
<p><em>Hale flips through his notebook, Mensing inspects the entity, and Xiao sets up recording apparatuses.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 rises and pats itself down.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh finally, scientists! I was starting to worry this was prison or something, 'cause it's been hours since those cops took me in.</p>
<p><em>Hale smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Most subjects hold fear for men in lab coats, so your enthusiasm is much appreciated. How have you been settling in so far?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh I'm just peachy, but my room’s way too bland, isn't it? Feels like I'm practically a rat in a cage. I was thinking I could use some cool paintings by the door, above my bed, on the ceiling…</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I see. I’ll pass on your requests to the relevant department, SCP-8403.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I’ve got a name, by the way. Not sure what this S-C-P stuff is about.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I understand, but unfortunately, policies dictate that I must refer to you by your designation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Well, it's not a big deal. I'm a bit of a special case because, believe it or not…</p>
<p><em>It cups a hand around its mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I'm actually a ghost. Boo.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Mm. Do you remember what caused you to become a ghost?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Honestly, no idea. I'm not even a good ghost—I've got no chains to rattle, no dolls to possess, no people to haunt. That's what all the real ghosts are supposed to do, right? Oh, I know! How 'bout I start by haunting you?</p>
<p><em>It points at Xiao, who is standing by the wall with both hands on his clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> M-Me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Yeah, one-hundred-percent you. You're practically shaking already. It'll be a lot more fun to haunt you than ol' doc or miss grumpy over here.</p>
<p><em>It glances at Mensing, who frowns, tapping her foot on the floor. Xiao hides behind his clipboard while Hale holds up a hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> No. There will be no hauntings of our personnel.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Why not? It feels like the appropriate thing to do. Don't you want to find out what happens if I haunt someone?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I… no, I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> It could provide some really useful insight into how I work! And it'll just be a small haunting, like pushing cups around and whispering about spiders at night. I think it's important that I start acting like a proper ghost already.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I… suppose I could consider it…</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Dr. Hale, we're wasting pre—</p>
<p><em>She trails off into a yawn, which is mimicked by SCP-8403.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Excuse me. I meant to say that we're wasting precious time.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Why, it seems I let myself get sidetracked. Quite the voluble one, this anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Anomaly? What's that?</p>
<p><em>He straightens his tie.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> SCP-8403, are you aware of your primary anomalous property?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> What? I'm in a jail cell, I don't own any property.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Not quite. I'm referring to how… remind me how it was discovered, again?</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I believe it was found harassing civilians.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Woah, hold on now, I did nothing of the sort. It was uh… hm. My memory's kinda fuzzy, I'll be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Um, she was—I mean, it was letting kids change its hair, the file said. Into different colors and hairstyles.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh yeah, that's right! Woo, it's all coming back now. You know I had lilac braids at one point? Can I get those back?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> That property, yes. Why are others able to alter your physiology?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> My what?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Your appearance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I dunno, isn't that what you guys are here to find out? That's what the cops told me would happen. I mean, I want to know the answer too.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Sir, that means it doesn't know anything.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Well, I wouldn't say <em>anything</em>. Hey, I can tell you the colors of the rainbow! Red, orange, yellow—</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> That's quite alright, SCP-8403.</p>
<p><em>He turns to the other researchers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Fortunately, even if it cannot provide meaningful information, I do expect exciting results from experimentation with its properties. Shall we leave to prepare?</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 tilts its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> But don't we still have most of our allotted time remaining? Can't we keep talking to the ghost in case, um, it knows something else?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Wait, what was that about experiments?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Why, I suspect we'll get little more than its recount of the visible light spectrum.</p>
<p><em>Mensing sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> That is to say, Alfie, part of interacting with anomalies capable of speech is knowing when to end the interview early. This is something you'll learn through experience. If there is nothing to be gained, our time is always better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Indeed, Luzia, especially when it involves the time of three researchers!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Hey, but I want to keep talking! Don't I get a say in this? Maybe Doctor Alfie can stay back and we'll chit-chat until his ears pop and fall off. Doesn't that sound fun?</p>
<p><em>Xiao raises his hands to his ears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Wh-Why would you say it that way? Also, I'm not a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> You're not? But just look at you.</p>
<p><em>Hale chuckles to himself and shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Let's not dawdle any longer. Come, the sooner we present our proposal, the sooner we begin testing.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Alfie?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Well, okay…</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Wait, about this testing stuff, why don't we talk about exactly what you're going to—</p>
<p><em>The researchers exit.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8403-2: Project Proposal (Condensed)</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote" style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; border: 2px groove black;">
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Utilizing SCP-8403 as a Medium to Understand Ontokinesis</p>
<p><strong>Researchers:</strong> Dr. Milton Hale, Luzia Mensing, Alfie Xao<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-705422-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-705422-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Ontokinetic entities, colloquially known as reality benders, possess Hume levels higher than baseline reality. This allows them to manipulate reality at will and makes them notoriously difficult to contain. Even our latest SRA (Scranton Reality Anchor) models are functionally scrap metal against the more powerful types.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Due to SCP-8403's primary property, baseline humans can manipulate it through visual contact and imagination alone, as it responds much like how we would to a true ontokinetic entity. As such, SCP-8403 acts as a safe yet valuable learning opportunity, and experimentation with it will undoubtedly advance the Foundation's rudimentary understanding of ontokinesis.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints/Limitations:</strong> These interactions may not be a perfect correspondence to how true ontokinetic entities manipulate reality, as they may possess higher intelligence or perceptive capabilities than baseline humans.</p>
<p>Perhaps a detail that is both a constraint and a boon is SCP-8403’s secondary properties. Since it is little more than a specter, it likely cannot produce physical objects, which also significantly reduces the risk involved in testing.</p>
<p>Measures will be taken to ensure SCP-8403’s continued safety and cooperation. Personnel will only be allowed to conduct tests with prior approval from the Ethics Committee.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8403-3: Testing Log</strong></p>
<p>The above project proposal was submitted to the Ethics Committee and approved with a 6-3 majority vote. Thereafter, the research team produced a list of proposed manipulations which received partial approval for testing.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border: 1px dashed #999; box-shadow: none;">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/18/2011</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Dr. Hale<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Change its hair color to white.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-8403’s hair lightened over the period of one second until it was fully white, similar to Hale's own. However, this only affected the front half of its hair, i.e. the only section visible from Hale's perspective, and the non-visible section of its hair remained dark brown. The entity did not initially notice this change.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> An incomplete visualization seems to result in an incomplete change.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Dr. Hale<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Change its attire to a D-class uniform.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Its shirt and pants morphed into a bright orange one-piece jumpsuit. It expressed disapproval of this change.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Its anomalous properties seem to extend to its clothing, which also share its physical properties (translucency and intangibility) and as such are likely considered “part” of the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Mensing<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Reduce its height by approximately one inch.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> SCP-8403 shrank by several inches and appeared slightly slimmer than before. It expressed surprise at its new stature.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Exact measurements likely cannot be intuitively visualized. Side effects can occur regardless of the specific intent of the change.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Xiao<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Manifest a paintbrush in its left hand.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Its left ring finger thickened and morphed until it resembled a small paintbrush. Entity expressed slight distress.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Manifestation changed the existing body rather than creating a separate object. Whether or not the paintbrush was indeed composed of wood and bristles was unable to be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Xiao<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Restore its finger.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The paintbrush morphed back into the entity’s ring finger, which appeared mildly discolored.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Hastily performed manipulations are more prone to error. Xiao was reminded that all restoration was scheduled post-testing.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Mensing<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Manifest a small mouse in its left hand.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-705422-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-705422-4')">4</a></sup><br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> A small, eyeless white mouse manifested in the center of SCP-8403’s left hand. It appeared to move its head around and vocalize distress, though its paws were conjoined to the skin of the palm. Despite waving its hand in the air, SCP-8403 failed to dislodge the animal.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Manifestation of seemingly living entities is feasible. However, it may not be possible to manifest an entirely separate object using SCP-8403 as a medium, as both attempts thus far have resulted in the new mass being fused with the entity itself, despite the tester's intent otherwise. Due to the nature of the procedure and the entity's increasing distress, SCP-8403's hand was restored to its prior state before testing proceeded.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Xiao<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Manifest a paintbrush in its hair.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Several strands of the entity’s hair thickened and combined into a paintbrush. The paintbrush, which was seemingly attached to its scalp, broke off, rapidly thinned, and manifested back into hair. SCP-8403 vocalized mild pain and surprise.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Manipulations which are detached from SCP-8403’s body seem to lose their primary anomalous property, which limits the scope of the entity’s usefulness.</p>
<p><strong>Tester:</strong> Dr. Hale<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Lighten its mood.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> The corners of the entity’s lips were pulled upwards and frozen in a “smiling” position. Its general attitude remained unchanged.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Further investigation needed into achieving emotional changes.</p>
</div>
<p>After testing concluded, photographs of SCP-8403 taken prior were used as reference to restore SCP-8403 to its original physical condition. This was done so successfully, though its initial mental state could not be restored.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the following properties can be surmised about at least low-level ontokinesis performed by a human-level intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical manipulations may be the most accessible for human-like minds.</li>
<li>Ontokinetic manipulations may weaken when moved farther from the target entity.</li>
<li>Visualizing physical signs of an emotional state may be insufficient to manipulate the emotions themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future testing shall be conducted to validate, strengthen, and expand these findings.</p>
<p>On the same day, Xiao submitted a request for more accommodations to improve the entity's cooperation, which was later approved. SCP-8403’s containment cell was outfitted with several paintings depicting Foundation-approved neutral or uplifting imagery.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8403-4: Interview/Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>On 02/23/2011, Xiao and Mensing conducted an unplanned interview without the presence of Dr. Hale, who had taken the day off for personal reasons. Containment procedures at the time did not require the project lead to be present for non-experimental visits.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 is sitting on the floor with one hand held in front of its face. Its hair is unkempt, and it appears to be in deep concentration.</em></p>
<p><em>The cell door slides open. Mensing leads with a cup of coffee held in both hands, while Xiao trails behind, smoothing back his hair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> —et's get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Thanks for agreeing to this.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 turns to them and waves.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Heyo! Only two of you this time?</p>
<p><em>Xiao immediately ducks behind Mensing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I can still see you, you know.</p>
<p><em>Mensing turns and nudges him forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Feel free to begin, Alfie. You asked for this interview, after all.</p>
<p><em>He coughs and fidgets with his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Um, yes, hello. What uh, what are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh, just trying to see if I can do stuff to myself.</p>
<p><em>It wiggles its fingers in the air and grins.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> No luck as you can tell. You guys gotta get me some nail paint! I'll take any shade of purple that isn't mauve.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I-I don't think nail polish works on ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh yeah… wait, I know! What if you take a bottle of nail paint and stab it? That'll turn it into a ghost bottle, right?</p>
<p><em>Xiao audibly stifles a laugh while Mensing crosses her arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Please. Let's try to stay on track.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Right, yes. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> No need to apologize. I'm just suggesting that you…</p>
<p><em>She yawns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> …that you be more firm with it, or else you'll get distracted. Excuse me.</p>
<p><em>She shuffles to the side to lean against a wall, cradling her coffee with a sigh. SCP-8403 whispers loudly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> What's up with the grouchy cat lady?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> S-Since when is she a cat lady?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Well, you know. The photo on her cup. Is that a tabby? Is it hers?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I, uh, have no idea. Anyways, I think she's just tired. I may have… woken her up at 6 a.m. for this interview. If you don't mind, I need to ask you some questions. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Sure! Actually, wait, does that mean you aren't here to mess with me today?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> No no, we aren't doing testing. Not without Dr. Hale's permission.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Whew! That's good!</p>
<p><em>It clasps its hands together and leans forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> It's been ages since I've had a good conversation with someone. All you science types ever do is test test test. Don't you ever get tired of it?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> That's not true at all. I think about a lot of other things.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Yeah, I don't buy it. Look at you! I bet you drink soda out of test tubes and eat your food with tongs.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Seriously? That would be extremely unsanitary. Don't you know about cross-contamination?</p>
<p><em>Mensing clears her throat. Xiao's face flushes red as she sips her coffee.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> S-Sorry. Listen, n-no more going off topic, okay?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 tilts its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> What is the topic, anyways? You haven't asked me anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> That's because you… nevermind. Here.</p>
<p><em>He looks down at his clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Please try to answer honestly. To begin with, what do you experience when someone, um, changes you? Does it feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p><em>It taps a finger to its chin.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Not really. I can't tell what's happening unless it's super obvious.</p>
<p><em>He exhales softly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><em>It peeks at Mensing, who is staring forlornly at her now-empty cup, and whispers.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> But some of what you guys do to me isn't cool, even if it doesn't hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I'm… sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I just figured you would've found a way to turn me human by now.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Well, I don't know if that's possible. I wish I could say otherwise, but we still have no clue what happened to you, and that's, um, partly what the tests are supposed to help us understand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Hmm, well, at least you're trying. That's good enough for me.</p>
<p><em>A moment passes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh by the way, I figured out how to do a proper handstand. Wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Sure, I—well, uh, hold on…</p>
<p><em>Mensing lowers her cup.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> This isn't going anywhere. Please stop.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 freezes with its hands reaching towards the ground. Mensing pushes herself off the wall and extends her hand to Xiao.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> May I take a look at the questions please, Alfie?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Um, everything's proceeding fine. I was just about to ask the second one.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> For my own curiosity, then?</p>
<p><em>He hesitates before passing the clipboard to her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Thank you. Fortunately, you have neat handwriting. You should see Hale's notes—entirely illegible, even for him.</p>
<p><em>Her eyes scan the paper and she mumbles to herself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> How testing feels, fine… preferred form, hm… its views on containment, unnecessary. And… its parents? Really? This information is entirely irrelevant to our research.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I thought maybe we weren't asking it the right questions?</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Is that… really the only reason? Look at me please. Will you swear that these questions were meant to further our research, and nothing else?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Um, I, uh…</p>
<p><em>He presses his clipboard against his chest, and her eyes soften.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I'll be honest, Alfie, I'm afraid you're being influenced by this anomaly. Frankly, it's gotten quite obvious. I think we should talk.</p>
<p><em>She returns the clipboard to him and moves quickly towards the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Outside, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I-I still have more questions to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Please, I'm worried for you. I see you blurring lines that a Foundation researcher must never cross. Also, I need to refill my coffee. Both are equally desperate at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Alright, um, okay.</p>
<p><em>He moves to follow her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Don't let her walk all over you, Mister Alfie! Stand up for yourself!</p>
<p><em>Xiao flinches.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Try to ignore it, Alfie.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Hey, ghosts have feelings too! Don't make me haunt you!</p>
<p><em>Xiao gives SCP-8403 an embarrassed wave and mouths 'sorry'. It smiles at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Don't worry about it. Just get me that ghost bottle, pretty please?</p>
<p><em>Xiao hesitates, biting his lip. A moment later, the entity's fingernails gain a slight purple hue, which it does not notice.</em></p>
<p><em>Mensing pauses by the door and turns around with another yawn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Come on. I'll buy you a coffee too.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Yes, sure.</p>
<p><em>Xiao hurriedly follows her out of the cell as SCP-8403 raises a hand to wave goodbye. It gasps and turns its fingers underneath the light, its smile growing wider.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Ooh, not bad.</p>
<p>&lt;END LOG&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Upon returning the next day, Dr. Hale reviewed the prior log and noted multiple minor infractions. Xiao was assigned to mandatory remedial training concerning Foundation standards for professionalism and objectivity, and his unapproved manipulation of SCP-8403's fingernail color was reverted.</p>
<p>Containment procedures were revised accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8403-5: Further Testing Results</strong></p>
<p>Over the next few months, frequent and extensive testing was performed to discover the extent and limitations of ontokinetic manipulations through SCP-8403. However, procedures which involved temperamental, temporal, or existential changes or total transformations of SCP-8403's biology remained banned by the Ethics Committee, despite repeated requests for expansion of the project's scope.</p>
<p>These tests, in addition to validating previous results, produced a variety of findings, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manipulation requires visual contact with the affected portion of the entity.</li>
<li>Some amount of focused intent is required, which lessens the risk of accidental manipulations.</li>
<li>Photographs, video recordings, or other attempts to capture SCP-8403’s likeness do not carry its anomalous properties, and viewing them is insufficient to allow for remote manipulation.</li>
<li>Abnormal alterations to SCP-8403’s physical form generally cause minimal harm to its physical well-being. It is theorized that its body adapts to these changes to maintain normal function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of findings was delivered to relevant departments to assist in potential combat and containment applications.</p>
<p>As testing progressed, it was discovered that the maximum effective distance for the entity's primary anomalous property was gradually decreasing over time. These represented reductions of SCP-8403's anomalous properties towards baseline levels. The reason for these changes was unknown, and no method to slow or halt them was discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8403-6: Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>On 05/██/2011, SCP-████ breached containment by utilizing its ontokinetic abilities, resulting in the deaths of ██ Foundation personnel and the loss of Site-███.</p>
<p>In response, Mensing and Dr. Hale edited and re-submitted a supplemental project proposal to expand the scope and intensity of SCP-8403’s testing. The proposal reiterated the existential threat of hostile ontokinetic entities as the main impetus for the research and cited current ethical constraints as reason for the recent lack of new findings. Additionally, SCP-8403's physical form had become almost entirely opaque and tangible, which added further urgency to the project's timeline.</p>
<p>On 05/11/2011, the proposal was approved, and testing was scheduled on the same day.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 is standing on tiptoes in its cell, attempting unsuccessfully to pull down a large painting that has been bolted to a wall. Its brown hair is frazzled, and its nails are chipped.</em></p>
<p><em>The researchers enter the room. Xiao stops in place and stares at SCP-8403; dark bags are visible under his eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Good evening, 8403.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 continues pulling at the painting’s frame.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Oh hey, you lot are back. I totally missed you, you know? It’s been three weeks since you last visited. I’m hurt; I thought you cared about me.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Only two, actually. We were busy with… well, you’ll see. Before we begin, how are your accommodations? Anything we can do to make you more comfortable?</p>
<p><em>Mensing begins pacing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> You could let me walk outside, for one. I’m all for settling down, but if I’m being honest, the scenic view from within this cell has been getting reeeal old.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Unfortunately, that will not be possible. No further requests, I assume?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Nah, I’ve actually got one more.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 releases the painting and turns around. Xiao looks away.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Stop messing with my body.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Dr. Hale, we need to begin right now.</p>
<p><em>Hale waves his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Well, if you please, lad.</p>
<p><em>Xiao turns to SCP-8403, who stares back at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Is this step really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> It will only take but a moment. Go on.</p>
<p><em>Xiao takes a deep breath and approaches the entity, then pauses for several seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Is it working?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I’m trying…</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> 8403’s area of effect must have shrunk quite significantly since our last experiment. Approach it so we can record the new effective distance.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Quickly, please.</p>
<p><em>She clasps her hands beneath her chin as Xiao inches closer to SCP-8403. The entity purses its lips but remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Still nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Move closer yet.</p>
<p><em>Xiao gnaws at his lip.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> …how much closer?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Make contact if you must.</p>
<p><em>Xiao approaches within arm's reach of SCP-8403. Searching its eyes, he slowly raises a hand, which trembles slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I’m sorry, c-can I…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> …go ahead.</p>
<p><em>Xiao gently grasps SCP-8403’s hand. It twitches, its expression pained, though no source of physical distress is visible.</em></p>
<p><em>Xiao shuffles his feet and whispers something inaudible. SCP-8403 looks up, its brows loosening, and the corners of its lips rise slightly. It squeezes his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Sometime today, preferably.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Alright, I’m doing it.</p>
<p><em>The chips in SCP-8403’s nails begin to mend, and the frazzles in its hair straighten out. It takes a deep breath and rolls its shoulders languidly.</em></p>
<p><em>Mensing exhales deeply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It still works.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> There. Much more presentable, eh?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Move away now, please.</p>
<p><em>Xiao does not respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Alfie?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><em>Xiao releases the entity’s hand and steps back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> So, our dear anomaly has become fully corporeal, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Almost entirely, uh, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Fascinating, but unfortunate. If this trajectory continues, we may lose a valuable testing subject. Even physical contact may not be enough in a week.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> A week? I suspect we have no more than a day left.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Ever the more reason to learn as much as we can before this opportunity flies away.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> May I start, Dr. Hale?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Certainly, certainly.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Are these tests really necessary? I'm turning human all on my own now. Don't need your so-called help anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Of course, there are broader scientific implications at stake. Do cooperate for even just this first test, won't you? Surely there is no need for a repeat of last time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I’ll… keep my hands to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> On the contrary, we will require <em>one</em> hand to—</p>
<p><em>Mensing takes hold of SCP-8403’s arm, and it flinches.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> …ahem. Cheer up, 8403. Your cooperation in these experiments has led to notable strides in our understanding of ontokinetic abilities. Hence, we do appreciate your role in this endeavor, and I encourage you to enjoy what little time your anomaly has remaining.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 rolls its eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> Totally loving it, yeah. I’ve always dreamed of being a lab rat. Nothing excites me more than getting manhandled by a weasel-faced—</p>
<p><em>Its head droops, and it nearly falls forward, though Mensing’s grip keeps it upright.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Wh-What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I just made it more cooperative<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-705422-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-705422-5')">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 wobbles on its feet and mumbles, its movements lethargic.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I’m… bleh. Sooo tired, man. Am I… seeeing things?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Sh-She’s going to pass out!</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It's <em>fine</em>, Alfie.</p>
<p><em>She glances at her watch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I'm moving onto the next procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Perhaps a little more energy, Luzia, so that it doesn’t keel over.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403's eyes flit up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Is that really necessary, doctor? I'm certain it's going to lash out, and I won't be held responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Just do it, please.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Fine. A little more energy, then, per your request.</p>
<p><em>She turns to SCP-8403, who lolls its head back and blinks rapidly. Its fingers twitch, and it looks down at Mensing's hand with widening eyes and a reddening face.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I… I'm…</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Hey, what's wrong?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 sucks in a deep breath, its hands balling tightly into fists.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8403:</strong> I'm… I'm <em>so</em> gonna kill you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 lunges at Mensing, who immediately pushes her palm into its chest. In response, it grasps ahold of her hair and yanks down sharply. Mensing cries out in pain, her nails digging into the entity's arm as she fights to lift her head up. She growls.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8403 transforms into a large brown rat. It falls to the ground with a muffled squeak, buried under the entity’s previously worn clothes. Mensing stumbles back, panting, and rubs a palm against her forehead.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It… it worked.</p>
<p><em>Xiao's breath catches, and he begins to tremble.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> What.</p>
<p><em>Mensing straightens up slowly, brushing her hair out of her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It's… it's a lab rat now. Fitting, right?</p>
<p><em>Xiao moves towards the fallen clothes, only for Mensing to jump in front of him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Wait. Stop.</p>
<p><em>Xiao reaches out to push her aside, but she grabs his wrists firmly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> You… hey, let go!</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Calm down, Alfie!</p>
<p><em>Hale looks between the two of them, bewildered.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Lu—</p>
<p><em>He clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Luzia, the Committee has explicitly banned total transformation. You should be aware of this fact.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It was trying to kill me, sir. What else was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> You're crazy! Let me turn her back!</p>
<p><em>He cranes his head to look around her, but she blocks him, tilting her face towards his.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> We will, Alfie, but not by cheating.</p>
<p><em>She huffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> You're a scientist, aren't you? This rat used to be a humanoid, so certainly there must be some way to restore it without the luxury of its anomaly. I already have a laundry list of ideas that we can—</p>
<p><em>Xiao stomps his heel onto her toes. Mensing yelps and punches him, and he falls onto his back, clutching a hand to his nose. She recoils.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Shit!</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Wh—Th… You’ve just struck a fellow researcher!</p>
<p><em>Hale presses his thumb to the back of his lanyard while Mensing fiercely shakes her head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> It was self-defense! Everything was self-defense!</p>
<p><em>She raises her injured foot and winces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> G-Goddammit I need to—</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Luzia, we have established procedures in place for dealing with—</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I'm sorry but what’s done is done, alright? S-Someone had to take the first step.</p>
<p><em>She hobbles over to the bundle of fallen clothes, where SCP-8403 has managed to poke its head out. Mensing kneels down and lifts the entity, which squeaks and squirms ineffectively within its former clothing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Think about what we can learn from a completely transformed humanoid under entirely controlled conditions.</p>
<p><em>Hale adjusts his spectacles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I… suppose this does hold potential. It seems unable to communicate, but is it still sapient? Can such a small animal even contain a human-level intelligence? Perhaps we can…</p>
<p><em>He swallows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> …no, still, the Committee will have our heads for this.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Dr. Hale, with all due respect, why do you let the Ethics board control you? What have they ever done for you?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> Truly, nobody ever enjoys being beholden to oversight committees, but one must learn to obey the rules and regulations they have sworn to.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> No, no, enough of that. The Committee has failed us. We need to stop wasting our fucking time bickering over trifles so that we can focus on what matters: people who have had their <em>lives</em> ripped away and stuffed into the shells of beasts. You haven't forgotten, have you?</p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> I… remember your file, Luzia. However, research is a gradual process, and there are procedures we must follow regardless of our personal motivations.</p>
<p><em>She stands up holding the wriggling bundle of clothes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> I'll bear the brunt of the fallout. I don't care if I get arrested or worse, but this research needs to be done right now.</p>
<p><em>Xiao stumbles towards her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao</strong>: Let me just… turn her back. You’ve done enough already.</p>
<p><strong>Hale</strong>: This has gone on too far. Do what the boy says.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing</strong>: Really? What kind of scientists are you? All I'm asking for is an hour of—</p>
<p><em>The cell door hisses open and a site security team bursts into the room. Mensing turns just as Xiao tackles her to the ground, which causes her to release SCP-8403; it immediately attempts to bite her, but a swipe of her hand sends it tumbling away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Alfie, you—</p>
<p><em>The guards intervene and pull the two apart. One lifts Xiao onto their back, another handcuffs a struggling Mensing, and the last holds SCP-8403 down with gloved hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Security Officer:</strong> Anything we should be aware of with this anomaly, doc?</p>
<p><em>Hale shakes his head slowly, his brow furrowed in thought.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hale:</strong> No… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Mensing:</strong> Listen to me! All I need is an hour—no, even just ten minutes! We need this research, goddammit!</p>
<p><em>She is forcefully escorted out of the cell. Xiao coughs, struggling to get down. His nose is bleeding.</em></p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> W-wait, no, we need to turn 8403 back!</p>
<p><em>The officer carrying him glances at Hale, who remains silent.</em></p>
<p><strong>Security Officer:</strong> After the debriefing, researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> You don’t understand, she’s supposed to be human!</p>
<p><em>They exit the cell, and Xiao's protests fade away. The last officer in the room releases SCP-8403, which attempts to escape but is obstructed by the door sliding shut.</em></p>
<p>&lt;END LOG&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>Following the incident, Researcher Luzia Mensing was reassigned to Provisional Site-███ with autonomous project privileges suspended for 12 months. No further corrective action was deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The Ethics Committee passed a decree with the following provisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-8403 is to be restored to its prior humanoid form.</li>
<li>Further testing with SCP-8403 is forbidden until a new project proposal is approved.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all post-incident interviews were completed and Xiao was administered basic medical care, he was allowed to return to SCP-8403’s cell to fulfill the first provision. However, it was discovered that no forms of manipulation were effective anymore due to it having become fully corporeal.</p>
