<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9440 is kept within a standard humanoid containment chamber (6m x 6m x 6m) at Site-17. Because SCP-9440 demonstrates no physical need for food, water, or sleep, furnishings are restricted to a single chair, unless otherwise authorized by Level 3 staff. Continuous monitoring is to be maintained to confirm the entity's body remains physically present within its chamber at all times. Due to the nature of what it is, true "containment" is not feasible. Because of this, personnel are instructed to log any sightings of SCP-9440 they witness outside containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9440 is a localized phenomenon taking the appearance of a vaguely masculine humanoid and claims to be the abstract concept of endings. Foundation regards this as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unverified self reporting</span> operationally credible. Beginning at 9 cm away from SCP-9440's skin, light rapidly loses energy across all wavelengths. On contact with the skin, all light energy is terminated, an effect likened to a matte event horizon. Despite this, when interacting with staff, a pair of eyes and a mouth will be faintly visible.</p>
<p>Although SCP-9440 possesses a tangible, measurable body, evidence indicates this form is merely a localized manifestation of awareness rather than an encapsulation of its whole self. While humans have their sense of awareness anchored in their bodies, it appears SCP-9440's consciousness is non-local and it only uses the form in containment for the sole purpose of interacting with Foundation staff.</p>
<p>In the absence of external stimuli, SCP-9440 remains seated and motionless at all times. However, reports of SCP-9440 briefly manifesting at the conclusion of various events have become so frequent a dedicated log has been created and is maintained to document all reported sightings. Security cameras confirm that despite remaining confined, SCP-9440 is able to simultaneously manifest in multiple locations for brief durations.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> At 06:39 local on 03/11/20██, SCP-9440 manifested in the Site-17 decomissioning chamber during the termination of senior researcher Mallory. The manifestation occurred at the moment of death and was observed by all in attendance. Video recordings confirm subject offered no resistance to security forces. Firsthand reports from the detaining officers additionally suggest the entity <em>deliberately</em> presented itself for detainment. Analysis of security monitors indicate SCP-9440 manifested without an alteration of humes within the local environment.</p>

<p><strong>Interview #1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. LePlante<br/>
<strong>Date</strong> 05/13/20██<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Initial interview following manifestation during the decommissioning of senior researcher Mallory.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>[[Interview Begins]]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> For the record, what designation do you normally go by?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> I am called The End. Or you can call me the numbers you’ve given me. They both point to the same conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> You describe yourself as “the end.” The end of what, specifically?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> The end of everything. Every structure falls, all concepts are eventually forgotten, patterns complete themselves…All that begins, ends. I am that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Then you are not a manifestation of say, Death?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Death is but a single note in the song. I am the silence that swallows it and everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Why did you manifest at the time and place of researcher Mallory's termination?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> <em>That</em> was not an ending due in its time. It was an egregious threshold being crossed that finally drew me here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Can you elaborate—what exactly is your purpose here?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> To instruct you on how dangerous your hubris truly is.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Are there other forces like you? Concepts that take form? The Beginning, perhaps?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> You won’t give a yes or no answer?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Your lessons will not be learned from those types of questions.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> And what should we expect of you, if you are not here to cause endings?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Expect only the consequences of the endings you have taken out of their proper place.</p>

<p><strong>Test 9440-E1:</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> Lightbulbs, various, new. Tested functional. (Three LEDs, 3 incandescent, and 3 fluorescent)<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Sequentially, each bulb was placed into a table lamp. SCP-9440 instructed to 'end' the functionality of the bulbs.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject touched the bulb causing luminescence to instantly cease. Post-test analysis discovered that the electrodes, filaments and ballasts within the various bulbs had expired simultaneously upon contact.<br/>
Test is repeated with additional bulbs. Outcome is identical in all cases.<br/>
Subject refused verbal comment.</p>
<p><em>Note: During the clean up post-experiment, research assistant Carroway dropped one of the bulbs and lacerated their hand during the attempted clean up. The injury resulted in several stitches placed by medical and being put on limited duty for the remainder of the month</em></p>

<p><strong>Test 9440-E2</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> Personal phone belonging to Dr. Johansen, charged to 47%.<br/>
<strong>Procedure:</strong> Device placed before subject. Subject instructed to end the battery life.<br/>
<strong>Result:</strong> Subject hesitated before touching the phone, immediately bringing it to 0%. Analysis confirmed battery requried complete replacement.<br/>
The battery was not drained of charge, its function was completely ended. This implies a somewhat rigid finality to whatever we put through testing with SCP-9440.<br/>
Caution is advised.</p>
<p><em>Note: Dr. Johansen missed several calls from their wife who had gone into labor. Since the test, Johansen's work performance has degraded, resulting in workplace counseling.

<p><strong>Incident Report: 9440-09A1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> 03/14/20██</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dr. Johansen had been using an emergency exit in the west wing to call his wife multiple times a day for several weeks. He had disarmed the alarm system of the door, and created a predictable pattern of vulnerability. On the day of the attack, a small Chaos Insurgent cell managed to breach through this opening, wounding Johansen. Their objective appeared to be the abduction of several humanoid anomalies. The Insurgency managed to successfully launch a neural net overrun of the security systems, flooding the system and polluting the defensive AI with false positives alarms.</p>
<p>The insurgents were able to secure four humanoid anomalies during the ensuing confusion. When they attempted to take SCP-9440 into custody, the computer attack abruptly ended, and all security protocols were restored.</p>
<p>Security responded in force, neutralizing the insurgents and recontaining all anomalies.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description of Events:</strong><br/>
<em>Note: Timeline below has been reconstructed via the security cameras around the facility that were able to capture portions of the events.</em></p>
<p><strong>1901:</strong> First internal error codes.<br/>
<strong>1903:</strong> Internal AI defensive systems compromised. Emergency status initiated.<br/>
<strong>1904:</strong> System is overun with error codes and emergency shutdowns. Dozens of parts of the facility are locked down, delaying response time.<br/>
<strong>1905:</strong> Seven insurgents are spotted in western hallway, near emergency exit.<br/>
<strong>1911:</strong> First humanoid anomaly is taken from containment with no restraints.<br/>
<strong>1920:</strong> Second humanoid anomaly is sedated and carried.<br/>
<strong>1922:</strong> Third humanoid anomaly is breached from containment and taken by force.<br/>
<strong>1925:</strong> Insurgents breach SCP-9440's containment and take them at gunpoint.<br/>
<strong>1926:</strong> As the insurgents enter the primary intersection, the virus abruptly terminated all functions.<br/>
<strong>1929:</strong> On site security forces detain insurgents. All humanoid anomalies recontained, thus ending the raid.<br/>
<strong>1932:</strong> Dr. Johansen is found and stabilized by first responders.<br/>
<strong>1935:</strong> All clear is sounded. Emergency status lifted. Normal functionality is restored.</p>
<p><em>Security Note: Data analysts confirm that the attack on their system ended only after SCP-9440 was targeted for abduction. Although direct intervention cannot be confirmed, evidence strongly suggests SCP-9440 was responsible for abrupt ending of the raid. It has refused all questions about the matter, or potential consequences of its actions.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Report 33H01</strong></p>
<p>Date of Report: 03/29/20██</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary of Events:</strong> The mouse used in Test 9440-A was immediately transported to feed a viper (Crotalus atrox) in an unrelated herpetology program. Transit time from Test-9440-A to feeding was approximately two minutes. While attempting to initiate feeding, researcher Whylind was bitten on the wrist and invenomated. It is suspected that the heat loss between the time of death and the feeding caused the mistaken bite, as the researcher’s arm was now the warmer target. Researcher Whylind had an unusually severe reaction to the venom, and immediately went into anaphylaxis.<br/>
Medical staff administered antivenom and transported them to the medical wing, where they remain in a vegetative state.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Incident Report: 9440-33C2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> 07/21/20██</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary of Events:</strong> At 14:40, a containment drum in Sector D ruptured, releasing 200 liters of HX-21, a highly corrosive compound used in neutralizing biological waste. The liquid rapidly vaporized in the open air, producing a poisonous cloud that triggered a full section lockdown.</p>
<p>Security cameras confirmed Research Assistant Malkovich was escorting SCP-9440 back to its containment chamber when the HX-21 vapors reached the main corridor. The alarm was triggered and the system locked down that portion of the facility, trapping Malcovich, 9440, and several other personnel.</p>
<p>The cloud spread through the hall, causing immediate and severe burns to all staff. Malcovich fell at the feet of 9440 who did not move. The gas around 9440 crystalized and fell out of the air as inert dust.<br/>
Security systems engage the ventilation purge, and the gas is quickly flushed out.</p>
<p>First responders find SCP-9440 unmoving standing over the head of Malcovich.<br/>
Though 35% of his body received severe chemical burns, he was stabilized and tranferred to on site ICU.<br/>
When questioned on why it refused to do anything to stop the events and loss of life, they replied "This is the consequence of previous disruptions. Their ends were rewritten to accomodate your inquiries."</p>
<p>Medical reports that the only reason Malcovich survived was because their lungs had not been exposed to the HX-21 gas. Having fallen within the short 9cm range that causes the electromagnetic breakdown of light around SCP-9440, the same property that 'ends' the light as it reaches the skin also affected the HX-21, rendering it harmless dust. This appears to have allowed them to breath until medical treatment was rendered.</p>
<p><em>Note: Inspection of containment units of HX-21 was scheduled to be completed by researcher Whylind, but had not yet been reassigned after their hospitalization. Detailed analysis of the residue dust confirms it was identical to control sample aged 21 years.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Report 9440-44A</strong><br/>
<strong>Date of Incident: 11/03/20██</strong><br/>
<strong>Location: Site-17</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Summary of Events:</strong> The morning of an annual administrative inspection, Dr. Soahso completed the vehicle check out form and had prepped the paperwork for a 1400 pickup from nearby airstrip. Due to previous injury <sup>(See test 9440-D1)</sup> Dr. Soasho's handwriting was misread by staff, resulting in a junior staffer being assigned to pick up the director two hours later than scheduled.</p>
<p>When the Director finally arrived to site-17, the inspection was nearly two hours behind schedule and the director expressed strong dissatisfaction. This led to what was typically a routine and quickly passed inspection instead being escalated into a formal inquiry into site records and administrative processes.</p>
<p>The site passed the inspection but common clerical errors resulted in four temporary suspensions of duty, seven clearance reductions, two transfers, and eighteen formal written reprimands.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is a clear downstream consequence of Dr. Soahso's hand injury from previous testing, occurring many months after the initial accident. While no loss of life happened in this particular incident, the consequences of removing so many personnel are certain to cause further disruption. Furthermore, the disruption to workflow due to the recent disciplinary actions is almost certain to cause additional manpower issues. Expeditious rassignment of all duties from the suspended personnel remains a priority.</em></p>

<p><strong>Interview 2</strong><br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. LePlante<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 12/31/20██<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted following conclusion of the initial test series and subsequent incidents.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>[[Interview Begins]]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> You were cooperative in the demonstrations. Did you know in advance the consequences that conducting the tests were going to cause?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Yes. And you've not yet seen the end of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Can you be more specific? What should we expect to happen?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> You've seen ripples. The waves have not yet arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Can you warn us before these 'waves' arrive and cause disruption?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Endings are not meant to be given in advance. You will live them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Do you have the power to end other anomalies we contain?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> If you are asking that, then you have not learned the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Is it within your power to delay the end of the world?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> [[Subject pauses for several seconds]] Endings <em>must not</em> be delayed, nor rushed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Your tests show you are capable of interverning when you wish-<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> I do not <em>wish.</em> I simply am. You have not yet learned what those tests were meant to teach you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> Then tell me this: what is the point of these warnings? Why do you care?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> Your continued interference risks the premature ending of every story in existence.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. LePlante:</strong> [Sighs] What are we supposed to do, then? Stop containing? Stop neutralizing? Should we sit idle and do nothing while the entire world ends?<br/>
<strong>SCP-9440:</strong> You tear out the last chapters of the story and drag the corpses of long-dead characters across the pages of your book, then wonder why it no longer makes sense.<br/>
<em>Let things end in their <strong>proper</strong> time and place. Stop interfering before things get worse.</em></p>
<p><strong>[[End of Interview]]</strong></p>
<p><em>Personal Note: Please remember to interact with SCP-9440 as you would with any being capable of predicting, or potentially ending your life. It is easy to slip into the habit of interacting with SCP-9440 like a person because it speaks like one. However, the repeated sightings around the facility are a reminder that the 'containment' is largely at-will, and, as a <strong>concept,</strong> is effectively impossible, hence the secondary classification.</em><br/>
