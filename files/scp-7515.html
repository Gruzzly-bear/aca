            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7515</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the nature of SCP-7515, it cannot be physically contained by current technology.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7515 describes patterns of solar radiation caused by the refraction of anomalous starlight through the chromosphere of Sol. These pattern vary in wavelength and intensity and can manipulate fluctuations in quantum probability that govern the sequence of cause and effect, both on earth and within the solar system. SCP-7515 events are visible in the sky as a bright pattern of light surrounding the sun, commonly referred to as a Parhelion<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Described by Foundation researchers as ‘The Parhelion Effect,’ SCP-7515 events have been observed to correspond to great moments of luck or fortune for individuals affected, (henceforth referred to as SCP-7515-1) though whether this alteration of chance manifests as positive or negative is seemingly random. Since recording of SCP-7515 events began in 18██, at least 3,484 events of high-intensity have been recorded, with the rate of occurrence showing a steady increase over time. Various documents and artifacts recovered from historical astronomers and stargazers of antiquity reveal a vague understanding of SCP-7515's nature in regards to its ‘luck’ effects on SCP-7515-1 entities, though a firm understanding was not established until the Foundation formally began its research into the anomalous events. Ongoing study of SCP-7515 is performed by the current research team, Lambda-22, working under the direction of Dr. ██████████ at Site-██.</p>
<p>SCP-7515 is thought to be the origin of several astrological disciplines that draw meaning and effect from patterns of solar bodies, alignment of planets, and rotations of the moon. Efforts have been undertaken by the Foundation to promote cultural disbelief in such practices as part of containment procedures of the true nature of SCP-7515. These efforts are ongoing as known elements of the GOC<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> have made attempts to bring the nature of SCP-7515 to light, forcing the Foundation to deploy Mobile Task Force “Sun Dogs” and engage in information suppression operations to thwart any moves towards public recognition of SCP-7515’s anomalous nature.</p>
<p>There have been no observed correlations between individual SCP-7515 events, preventing subclassification of radiation patterns, and no understood link between the starlight refracted by Sol and their effects. While SCP-7515 events have no known method of prediction, a greater quantity of events have been recorded in locations of high population density. The results from Lambda-22 monitoring teams are thus far inconclusive.</p>

<tr>
<td>Japanese Smallpox Incident</td>
<td><em>&lt;██/██/735&gt; (Exact time is unknown.)</em> SCP-7515 event is recorded by an unknown resident from Dazaifu, Fukuoka, Japan. ██ days later, hospital records indicated a smallpox epidemic rapidly spreading through the community. Historical records find that patient zero of the incident was a fisherman whose boat suddenly capsized at the approximate time of the recorded SCP-7515 event, leaving him stranded in the Korean peninsula for a period of several days during which he is presumed to have contracted the disease, before returning to Japan. The disease quickly spreads out to surrounding regions and results in the deaths of approximately 35% of the population.</td>

<td>Sinking of the <em>Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta</em> Incident</td>
<td><em>&lt;Approximate date: ██/██/17██&gt; (Exact time is unknown.)</em> SCP-7515 event is noted by Johan Tobias Lowitz in a recovered journal. Historical records correspond this event with the death of Swedish monarch Gustav III, who was killed along with the crew of the <em>Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta</em> when the aft guns on a passing Russian frigate fired upon the hull of the vessel, sinking it. Swedish records point to the sinking as the act of aggression that began the decade-long Russo-Swedish War, whereas Russian accounts from the frigate in question indicate that the cannon that dealt the critical blow to the <em>Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta</em> experienced an accidental misfire after a crewman slipped on a misplaced wash towel.</td>

<tr>
<td>St Mary's Hospital Medical School Incident</td>
<td><em>&lt;09/02/1928, █:██ am&gt; (Exact time log lost due to coffee stains on early Foundation documents.)</em> One of the first recorded high-intensity events occurs in London, prompting Foundation personnel to investigate areas in and around Paddington, ultimately concluding a lack of observable effect. Scientist Alexander Fleming, working in the nearby St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, would publish an article<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup> in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology on the 10th of May the following year. It would later be determined by Lamba-22 personnel that this article likely describes the outcome of the event.</td>

<td>Attempted containment breach of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2317">SCP-2317</a></td>
<td><em>&lt;03/13/1956, 2:56 am&gt;</em> Stirrings by SCP-2317 threaten to break the final chain holding it in containment, causing site personnel to fall into a panic. A SCP-7515 event is detected that causes movement within the local tectonic plate, resulting in a large fissure opening within Containment Area 6, drawing tight the chain binding SCP-2317 and causing it to return to a state of rest</td>

<tr>
<td>Apollo 13 Incident</td>
<td><em>&lt;04/1█/1970, █:██am&gt;</em> The Apollo 13 mission launches from Cape Canaveral days prior to the date of the incident. Upon entering the Moon’s orbital field, an SCP-7515 event is detected, resulting in Apollo 13’s lunar and service module suffering severe damage from stray meteorite debris. The crew is unable to maneuver beyond the field, resulting in the ship crashing into the Sea of Tranquility. There are █ confirmed survivors.</td>

<td><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076">SCP-076</a> Breach Incident</td>
<td><em>&lt;██/██/████, █:██ pm&gt;</em> SCP-7515 event recorded moments before the containment failure of SCP-076-02, resulting in [REDACTED] casualties. This incident is notable for being the impetus of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-963">SCP-963</a>'s state alteration into the form of Dr. Bright, who claims that this SCP-7515 event is proof that the universe hates him. This claim has not been proven, despite corroborating evidence.</td>

<tr>
<td>North Zanesville Incidents</td>
<td><em>&lt;11/22/1998, 7:12 pm&gt;</em> SCP-7515 event detected in the northern regions of North Zanesville, Ohio, United States. Local Foundation agents are deployed to investigate SCP-7515-1 entities, but are unable to locate any persons affected. <em>&lt;11/24/1998, 6:36 pm&gt;</em> SCP-7515 event detected in the northern regions of North Zanesville, Ohio. Foundation agents again sweep the region, but are unable to locate SCP-7515-1 entities. Instances of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3334">SCP-3334</a> are installed across the region for greater accuracy in detecting SCP-7515 events in the case of a repeated occurrence. <em>&lt;11/26/1998, 8:05 pm&gt;</em> SCP-7515 event detected in the northern regions of North Zanesville, Ohio. Previously installed SCP-3334 entities locate the epicenter of the events to be a portion of the property owned by local accountant Oliver ███████. Disguised Foundation agents question the homeowner on any improbable events occurring in recent times. They are told of several instances of misfortune that had occurred while he had been attempting to repair his back porch, forcing him to halt his work. These mishaps were made at times correlating to recorded SCP-7515 events. In an attempt to determine the specific cause, Foundation agents are assigned to watch the property for the next attempt made to fix said porch. <em>&lt;11/27/1998, 6:56 pm&gt;</em> SCP-7515 event detected in the northern regions of North Zanesville, Ohio. Foundation agents time the event to correspond to the exact moment Oliver ███████ attempts to begin repair work. During the event, a ceramic cup of coffee placed on a worktable is struck by a low-flying bird, spilling over the subject and causing him to cease repair efforts. Foundation personnel are dispatched to relocate Oliver ███████ with Class-B amnestic and purchase the property, sealing off the location to prevent further repair. As of 20██, research by Lambda-22 has begun on the site to determine the purpose of the SCP-7515 events.</td>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>The nature of SCP-7515-2 entities is currently unknown, as all attempts to gather information via interstellar probes have failed, nor have telescopic imagery of the entities yielded any usable data. Their designation is due to their mimicry of many of the properties attributed to stars, and are visually identical when not observed in detail. Whether or not this stellar camouflage is an intentional disguise on the part of SCP-7515-2 entities is unknown. Research is frustrated by the localized manipulation of quantum uncertainty that seems inherent to the False Stars, shielding them from observation via an insufficiently understood variation of the Observer Effect<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>. Despite this, some correlation has been recorded by Foundation personnel, notably an increase in SCP-7515 events from nearer SCP-7515-2 entities<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>. Certain SCP-7515-2 entities have been shown to emanate SCP-7515 events in relation to specific time periods, such as a period of 4 months, 2 days, and 3 hours in the year 20██ when SCP-7515-2-3429 was observed to be the sole cause of all Parhelion Effects across Earth, after which the various known False Star entities resumed seemingly random fluctuation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: yellow">Discovery:</span></strong> The exact date of intentional SCP-7515 monitoring began on August 3rd, 1927 when several installed instances of SCP-3334 began picking up strong readings in the presence of an observable parhelion at the East Arctic Observation Redoubt. The event was brought to the attention of Foundation personnel who began tracking SCP-7515 events globally, with efforts increasing after the events of July 3rd, 2004 involving SCP-179. As part of a routine effort to resume communication with SCP-179<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>, the being raises both arms forward to point towards the outer rim of Sol. It is observed by microsatellite to suddenly shift 3000 meters into the path of the SCP-7515 event, causing SCP-179 to glow brightly for 2.12 seconds before returning to its previous position. Why SCP-179 felt that the SCP-7515 event was worth defending Earth from became a matter of immediate importance to Foundation personnel, and research team Lambda-22 was commissioned to begin research efforts.</p>

Following the discoveries of the third of July, I, Dr. ██████████ have been named the director of research team Lambda-22 with a mandate from the O5 council to determine the true nature of the SCP-7515 phenomenon. Needless to say, this show of faith from the O5’s presents a truly rare opportunity for my talents to shine, I have no intention of wasting it. I have set my researchers to the task of correlating all recorded SCP-7515 instances for traces of a pattern or direction to their effects. The search has just begun, but already I can sense that success shall soon come to my work.<br/>
It must.<br/>

Purpose: To determine the purpose of SCP-7515 events</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&lt;Begin log&gt;</em><br/>
Work has continued for over a month, and I fear that the goal of Lambda-22 is no closer to the completion of its goal that it was at its inception. The team and I have burned the midnight oil through long weeks of work, and yet there is no clear direction to be found throughout the archive of recorded SCP-7515 phenomena.<br/>
The first great difficulty in our search has been the vague nature of SCP-7515 events to begin with. Though the variations in quantum probability caused by the Parhelion Effect is noticeable with requisite recording equipment, the differentiation between SCP-7515 phenomena and the generalized phenomenon of ‘luck’ is unclear in many circumstances.<br/>
The second complication is related to the first. In each recorded SCP-7515 event, the result of the occurrence has tended towards the preservation of the human race, despite some truly terrible catastrophes that can be attributed to SCP-7515. Not only have many of the most vile abominations known to the Foundation remained in containment as a result of SCP-7515 events, the outbreak of wars, plagues, and general prevention of death or the end of the human race is almost always an outcome.<br/>
I wonder if perhaps I should consider presenting paperwork to change the object class of SCP-7515 to Thaumiel for all the good it has done for the Foundation. It is not out of the realm of possibility that all the atrocities for which SCP-7515 is the cause may in fact be the lesser of an unknowable number of evils. But then, why has SCP-179 gone out of its way to block SCP-7515 events if this is the case?<br/>
As always, work goes on. Success is on the horizon.<br/>

Purpose: What does SCP-7515 want?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&lt;Begin log&gt;</em><br/>
I am lost.<br/>
Months of research. Hours of failed propositions and investigation. Is it all for naught? After many failed attempts to determine the nature of the SCP-7515 origin entities, I was at last able to requisition a hyper-relativistic probe from the Aethernautics Division to gather information from the origination stars ‘up close.’ For all the technological prowess at my fingertips, it seems to be useless. What scattered information the probe returned is nearly as clouded and worthless as our telescopic data. It is as if our instruments simply fail to see the entities, even when pointed directly at them. As if by some mockery of fate, all that they are have become hidden just beyond our observations.<br/>
The number of confirmed SCP-7515 origination points has multiplied vastly over the course of our research. It is not that all of them have been confirmed to have been the origin of an SCP-7515 event, rather that close investigation of these stars (if that is what they truly are) has revealed a worrying inability to determine much of anything about them. Only SCP-179 has shown the ability to defend against The Parhelion Effect, and I suspect it is merely reacting to the occurrences, not truly predicting them.<br/>
On the topic of SCP-7515’s purpose, this is something of a closed matter. SCP-7515 is perhaps the primary reason that the Foundation has managed to hold back the vile abominations that sleep alongside us each day, despite the great odds against us, and a driving force behind the development of the entire human race. If these events are the ‘lucky coincidences’ that grease the great wheel of progress that pushes the Foundation ever onwards, I am forced to question: what is the role of our work at all? Were it that the Foundation did not exist at all, would SCP-7515 hold back the evils all the same? Regardless, I no longer question the meaning behind these incidents. Now I wonder, to what end?<br/>

<p><em>&lt;Begin log&gt;</em><br/>
The truth is close. So perilously close. The O5 are all but pounding on my door, demanding answers that Lambda-22 was supposed to provide. I am not supposed to be privy to their inner meetings, but I cannot help but know of the arguments within their ranks over the containment of SCP-7515, if such a thing was even possible. The more I have come to know the Parhelion Effect, the more I realize that it’s containment would be true folly. Its reach is vast, its scope grand, and its purpose is essential. Without luck, without the Parhelion Effect, we would all surely fall to ruin. I have tried to make this position clear time and again, but always I am refused. This was to be my moment of ascension, but now I am merely the failure.<br/>
Lambda-22 is soon to end, one way or another. Answers still elude me. And yet-<br/>
Yet these fools persist in attempting to contain that which should not be. I have proof! Proof that SCP-7515 is essential for the Foundation’s great work to continue and still I am denied. My researchers have compared SCP-7515 events and their effects with those that managed to be disrupted by our ‘guardian angel,’ SCP-179, and it is clear that the automaton’s interference lessens their sway. Instances where SCP-7515 may have granted individuals the luck they needed for success instead become failures. Failures that will lay waste to all the progress of the human race! Those naysayers who point to events of uncertain disaster that SCP-7515 has failed to influence due to the automaton’s actions are merely the devil on the shoulder of my great work. I shall not allow them to drive our efforts to ruin!<br/>
And now, the greatest of all follies, the O5’s have authorized the Astronomical Phenomena Division to install an experimental solar shield in a vain effort to block out incoming SCP-7515 events. Already since this prototype began operations, containment breaches have increased by 32% across all sites, and myriad disasters have sprung up across the whole of the world! To my very face, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-128">Dr. Argent</a> has maintained that this work is all that holds back the would-be puppet masters of our race from achieving their endgame, but I know this for idiocy. They have forged not a shield, but an almighty sword of Damocles, hanging oh so far overhead.<br/>
I must work harder, faster. A lucky break is all I need-<br/>

<p>&lt;<em>Begin log&gt;</em><br/>
In my line of work, one hardly is glad to meet the subject of their research. And yet, today I could not be more delighted. The detection of a new SCP-7515 event caught the attention of my researchers and they have determined the epicenter of the event to be none other than this very facility. This information does not surprise me. For 10 minutes before the news of the event arrived at my door, I stumbled upon the meaning behind it all.<br/>
It is us. We are SCP-7515’s purpose. Scattered stack of paper and notes, recorded over endless days of labor came crashing down upon my station, knocked off balance by my own feet stumbling from out of my chair after another endless night, and lo and behold, for upon my desk the truth was revealed. The right information in the right order can illuminate all mysteries, and this one is no different. SCP-7515 is not simply the cause of many of the most vital successes in containment of anomalies and other disasters, it is the impetus of all humankind. We have been brought up on starlight, guided to glorious purpose by beings we can scarcely understand. The others must know. I will tell them.<br/>

I am found.<br/>
I see now. The writing on the wall of reality, penned in starlight. SCP-7515 is not a series of isolated incidents guiding some unfathomable luck. It is luck itself, the crones of fate that weave the tapestry of destiny. I was blind, but now, by the light of Parhelion, I see.<br/>
The False Stars are coming. I’m going now to meet them.<br/>

<em><span style="color: yellow">Document 7515-TCP-04</span></em><br/>
<strong>&lt;02/22/2004&gt;</strong><br/>
Proposed by O5-2<br/>
Location: ███████<br/>
Purpose: To determine the threat that SCP-7515 poses in response to the fate of Dr. ██████████.</p>
<p><em>For the sake of humanity and the Foundation, I believe it is in our best interests to contain SCP-7515 events by any means necessary. Due to the scattered origins of SCP-7515, we cannot contain the many identified False Stars, but instead we must work to prevent their effects from reaching Earth. The core tenants of the Foundation at its founding were to secure, to contain, and to protect. We can not truly say that we have succeeded in these noble goals if we are unable to safeguard this organization and all the peoples of Earth against a guiding hand whose purpose and motives are unknowable. For the well-being of humankind, the Foundation alone must set the course of the future so that the myriad horrors contained within our facilities do not do it for us. SCP-7515 should be no exception.</em></p>
<p><em>Previous proposals discussed preventing SCP-7515 events from entering the Sol system, but as we have discovered, that simply is not possible at this time due to the anomaly’s incredible scope. Our alliance with SCP-179 is not a full, protective solution as the Lambda-22 report has shown, and so it falls to us to contain this anomaly in its entirety. The successful implementation of experimental solar shields by Dr. Argent and the Astronomical Phenomena Division to block the currently identified SCP-7515 wavelengths shows that a way to contain the Parhelion Effect is now open to us. Only when we are totally free from the grasp of SCP-7515 can we lay claim to our own destinies.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> If I am to understand these findings, what you are proposing is that we should mask the planet with a bit of floating metal? Is this seriously the best thing we can come up with? How can we deploy enough of these shields to account for every possible SCP-7515 event vector? We cannot deploy some thousands, if not millions of ill-conceived devices that blot out sunlight over portions of the earth and expect the masquerade to stand!<br/>
<strong>O5-6:</strong> What else do you expect? Experimental data from the Astronomical Phenomena Division have shown that these shields are the first prototype to offer any meaningful protection against a 7515 event. It would not be difficult to create a cover story for when we need to deploy them. Gods know we’ve convinced the world of more absurd things.<br/>
<strong>O5-3:</strong> But those experiments were only covering part of the parhelion. How can we expect to fully cover one? It would cause an entire portion of the Earth to be enveloped in shadow for possibly hours at a time.<br/>
<strong>O5-9</strong>: In addition to that concern, I note here in this report that there was a spike in Keter and Euclid containment breaches during the time of the experiment. If we were to fully block 100% of all SCP-7515 events, the increase in dangerous breaches may become uncontainable, and perhaps even cause a broken masquerade situation just the same as O5-4 has raised concerns about. As it stands, this report makes it clear that containing SCP-7515 is something we would do at great risk to ourselves, and the Foundation as a whole.<br/>
<strong>O5-2:</strong> While some SCPs are better left uncontained, I cannot agree with your position O5-9. This research and the solar shield experiments merely reinforce Dr. ████████’s hypothesis, that SCP-7515 events may be one of, if not the sole reason that the world has come to be as it is. That the Foundation has remained in control. And, perhaps, the reason that there is little we as individuals can do that is beyond this anomaly's sway. How can any of you tolerate the thought of such a violation of our free will?<br/>
<strong>O5-9:</strong> Because the results have been overwhelmingly to our benefit! The data has shown that it is extremely likely that these events have stopped containment breaches that may have otherwise been impossible to contain. Certainly, there has been ‘bad’ luck as well as ‘good,’ but we must take the longer view. It is clear that SCP-7515 is aiding in our advancement, not taking full control. This ‘luck’ may influence the tasks to which we apply ourselves, but it is still we who choose the tasks.<br/>
<strong>O5-2:</strong> Have you considered that it is because of SCP-7515 events that we have come to consider ‘our benefit’ in the first place? This is a force that has influenced our civilization perhaps from its infancy, if not long before. Even SCP-179, a being that has shown perceptive abilities far in advance of our most technologically capable systems, regards the Parhelion Effect as a threat to us, and has been actively interfering with SCP-7515 events. I will not trust the future of the Foundation to solar abominations, nor will I condone those who would simply wait for them to arrive. I agree that action must be taken against SCP-7515, and that such action should target its myriad sources. Before we ourselves are judged worthy of some False Star’s curse.<br/>
<strong>O5-4:</strong> Which is the greater evil then, if you are so willing to take to the crusade path? SCP-7515, or all the misfortune that we might unleash should we contain the Parhelion? I worry that in the pursuit of our purpose, we may open a veritable Pandora’s Box, and experience a disaster that we can not recover from.<br/>
<strong>O5-6:</strong> It sounds to me that there will be unfortunate outcomes no matter the path we choose.<br/>
<em>[A slight pause.]</em><br/>
<strong>O5-12:</strong> If we contain SCP-7515, if we banish the luck that has brought us this far, what will we be then?<br/>
<strong>O5-1:</strong> I suppose we shall simply be ourselves. If that is not enough, if that has never been enough, then perhaps we do not deserve the world that SCP-7515 has wrought.</p>
