<p>This routine can be ignored on the dates of July 20th, October 12th, February 14th, and August 22nd. On the former two dates, procedures can be performed with marginal effectivity if a chocolate cake with several candles is present.</p>
<p>Personnel unable to recall vital and/or personal information as a result of SCP-6665 will be discreetly given replacement information; their memories are to be altered to accommodate this change.

<p>Any vomiting by affected personnel is to be attributed to common food poisoning. The vomit is to be thoroughly removed and incinerated.</p>
<p>NARM0.0.aic — the Foundation grammatical assistance intelligence construct — has been updated with additional protocol measures allowing for it to repair data loss from SCP-6665 errors whenever possible. Such reparation, however, is usually futile.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #c75d5d"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-6665 is Project BLACKBOX, which is currently responsible for all classified information redaction in Foundation databases.</p>
<p>SCP-6665 consists of a 15m tall, biomechanical, conical apparatus, affixed in a position of vertical levitation within Site-01. SCP-6665 predominantly resembles the shape of an orbitoclast<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, which gradually tapers down from a diameter of 2m to a small point at its end.</p>
<p>At the top of SCP-6665 — in place of a normal orbitoclast handle — is a 2m tall black chamber of unknown composition. Atop this chamber is a large glass tank, which feeds directly into the chamber's only opening. While internal imaging indicates this chamber is hollow, nothing can be seen inside. This nothing is designated SCP-6665-█.</p>
<p><a href="scp-5666.html">SCP-6665-α is former Foundation Co-Administrator Malorie Auguste</a>. SCP-6665-α is in a constant state of being lobotomized by SCP-6665, puncturing through its thought. SCP-6665-α has been integrated into SCP-6665; further details are strictly indeterminable.</p>
<p>Periodically, the tank atop SCP-6665 will begin to fill with a viscous substance from no apparent source; a liquid which is black yet colorful. After approximately one week of continuous use, the tank will be filled completely, its contents are then dispensed into the chamber of SCP-6665-█. The chamber will violently vibrate for the next hour, a behavior which gradually subsides.</p>
<p>Following this, SCP-6665-α will vomit nothing out of its mouth, which will then become something.</p>
<p>SCP-6665 causes the instantaneous replacement of classified information in Foundation databases with black boxes or other appropriate redaction techniques, with said redactions cognitively registering only when the observer is under the clearance level of the obscured data. SCP-6665 affects physical documentation by obscuring information with lines of black ink, which appears as if printed directly into the affected documents.</p>
<p>Information expunged by SCP-6665 is subject to loss of remembrance by Foundation personnel, an effect which correlates to security clearance in relation to information confidentiality. While some information can be temporarily remembered through non-Foundation sources, it will quickly be once again forgotten.</p>
<p>SCP-6665 is prone to frequent errors. SCP-6665 will expunge extraneous information, such as names, dates, numerical values, and locations, even when such information is not entirely classified. This affects all levels of security clearance, and retroactively alters all former revisions of affected documents, causing Foundation recovery of most of this data to be impossible. Due to this, small pieces of data are wholly unmemorable by Foundation personnel of any clearance. Personnel heavily affected by this information removal occasionally vomit nothing, which usually remains nothing.</p>
<p>It is unknown if SCP-6665 can be disconnected from Foundation databases or otherwise deactivated, as the O5 Council has forbade any such action.</p>

</div>
<p>On 2020/20/01, Project BLACKBOX was commissioned by O5-2 with assent from a majority of the O5 Council. This directly followed the deaths of both original Administrators Malorie and Maddison Auguste, the cumulative result of their respective long and arduous battles with dementia. Upon recovery of the former's body and the containment of the latter's persistence, precise plans for SCP-6665 were created, utilizing each Administrators' existing states as the main components of its operation.</p>
<p>These plans and their justification were sent to an O5 Council vote for approval.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p>It was all a matter of time.</p>
<p>Malorie and Maddison were great people, greater leaders. Their bond, it bonded the Foundation into the organization it is today. Peacekeepers, protectors. It's a shame, as it always is, they got old, lost their way, their minds. No amount of love — personal or otherwise — can stop the infernal creep of the mind's melting.</p>
<p>With tragedy comes opportunity, like a phoenix fueling a fire. A new age begins, one of flourishment for our mighty organization. One where we <em>truly</em> realize why 'protect' is only the last word in our motto. Securing knowledge, containing absolute reality; what need is protection when the horrors are forgotten? Erased from memory? Purged from thought?</p>
<p>This will only be the start of the beginning. Our Foundation, the test ground for true security, true containment. We can live burning in the light of all past knowledge, while the world remains sheltered in the dark warmth of the black boxes.</p>

<p>SCP-6665 was completed three months after its approval. O5-2 was initially self-designated as the acting Caretaker, and began its routine medical examinations.

<p><tt><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></tt> After an emptying of SCP-6665's glass container, the fluid is immediately retched back into the tank.

</div>
<hr/>
<p>On <span class="redact">REME</span>/<span class="redact">MB</span>/<span class="redact">ER</span>, The power to the east wing of Site-01 was suddenly deactivated. All backup generators failed to automatically engage, causing a total power outage for 1 minute and 45 seconds. This caused a temporary deactivation of SCP-6665 and its containment machinations, which caused multiple unprecedented events surrounding the apparatus.</p>
<p>A full log of this power outage as viewed from the containment chamber of SCP-6665 can be found below; certain information not viewable in this footage has been supplied by O5-2.</p>

<p>(<em>O5-2 performs the scheduled medical routine, cataloging a higher quantity of plaque entanglement implantation into the computer terminal's medical records window. He speaks into his audio recorder.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Beginning routine medical examination. Everything from here appears as ordinary. Eyes shut, no drool. No abnormalities in that regard, for once.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-2 scans SCP-6665 further.</em>)</p>

<p>(<em>Power is lost. SCP-6665 deactivates. Nothing can be seen.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Dammit.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-2 blindly walks towards the room's site call system, trying multiple times to input the extension for Power Control before dialing correctly.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> What is going on over there?</p>
<p>(<em>Something large falls lightly to the ground.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Hello? Can, can anyone hear this?</p>
<p>(<em>Guards attempt to enter the containment chamber from outside, but the door has been rendered inoperable by the power outage.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Dammit, dammit— the emergency power, where— ? I can't see anything, where the hell's the switch— ?</p>
<p>(<em>Nothing whispers.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Who's there?</p>
<p>(<em>O5-2 begins to feel his way across the wall, attempting to find the switch for the containment chamber's emergency power system. A second pair of heavy footsteps slowly trudges across the floor.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> No, no, you're not— Where's the— ?</p>
<p>(<em>Retching, followed by a wet thud. O5-2 becomes more frantic.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="redact">MEAGAIN</span>: What are you— where are we going?</p>
<p><span class="redact">ILOVEYOU</span>: Shhh, just, just one second!</p>
<p>(<em>Hushed giggling; a door opens then shuts. It does not sound like any door in the chamber.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="redact">ICANTDO</span>: Well… what? What'd you want?</p>
<p><span class="redact">THISWITH</span>: Sorry I… I just had to get away from everyone, thought we did. I— I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime, somewhere.</p>
<p>(<em>Cracking. As O5-2 feels across the wall, it no longer feels concrete; he feels wallpaper. The floor creaks like hardwood as he runs frantically, now disoriented.</em>)</p>
<p><span class="redact">OUTLOVE</span>: ….what'd you mean?</p>
<p><span class="redact">LETSBEUS</span>: Well… you're always so kind! Fascinating too, really. Believe me, I'd never thought I'd be so interested in planes… planes of all things! No offense. But uh, well, when it's you talking, I can feel like… like I can listen to it forever.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-2 climbs up a staircase; his hand knocks picture frames off the wall. Two sets of steps encroach behind him. He is pushed aside by two giggling figures. He grabs a hold of the railing.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> This is not now! This— this is the past, you're <em>both</em> the past. Let it burn away. Let <em>go</em>.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Resultant investigations about the outage revealed it to have been an express emergency order, the clearance codes for which are only known to select Level 5 Personnel and above. Further investigation is underway, although their conclusion has been inferred.</p>
<p>Despite her denial of involvement, O5-1 has been indefinitely denied access to SCP-6665 and all documentation pertaining to Project BLACKBOX. Any personnel allowing O5-1 access to SCP-6665 will face an immediate reprimand and reassignment.</p>
<p>Further disciplinary measures regarding the conduct of O5-1 — including possible censure — are under consideration.</p>

The following is an informal meeting between O5-1, O5-10, and O5-7 within a conference room of Site-01, recorded on a hidden paperclip audio recorder. Other recording devices placed in the room were disabled or destroyed. The meeting was assembled by O5-1 in regards to Project BLACKBOX, violating her current restrictions.

<p>(<em>A pair of footsteps walks into the conference room, followed by two others. The latter two sit down as the door is locked.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> You know, we—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I know.</p>
<p>(<em>Manic walking; small objects are heard breaking.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> …didn't let me finish. We can't get you what you're asking for— well, I can't, I dunno what else you wanna to hear.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I know, I— Eva, you saw the file I sent you, I, I—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> This… this is the third time we've had this conversation. Jen. I'm sorry. It's… it's all just too much of an ask.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> They— you know I don't have access, doesn't mean I can't <em>see</em> what's going on. One of my guards, I caught him coughing up something— straight into his hand. I couldn't even ask him what it was then; I couldn't remember his name. 10 years… he's been here for a decade, and now? Couldn't even remember his damn name.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> Doesn't help your case — you know — the stunt you pulled, One.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I told you! I— It wasn't me. I <em>know</em> what this looks like, believe me, but—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> But what? You want all of us, the rest of the twelve of us, all to believe what you've been sayin'? Eh?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Those codes — the emergency codes — those ones aren't available to us. Only to the top— to the <em>Administrators</em>, Mike, I swear—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> It's Ten.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> —They're doing something with what little they have left. There's still something fleeting in there. And he's hurting them. For his gain.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> <em>His</em> own? We all gain from this. Every damn person in this organization, and <em>especially</em> us, especially you. If we can secure the knowledge of those things we lock up, keep the world ignorant and happy, you know, our job will be much, much easier. Yeah it's only our people for now, but think about it, will yeah? A world where the monsters under the bed, all them bumps in the night, all are just—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Forgotten? God, I've gotten this same exact talk from Two. Do you even— do you just not care?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> I care One, I care about the greater good.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I've had it with that phrase — "the greater good" — greater than what? Do we measure goodness on a scale? Some— some arbitrary good meter we've locked in a cell somewhere? Do Malorie and Maddison weigh less than— than all <em>this</em>? Well? Do they?</p>
<p>(<em>Sniffling.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-10:</strong></tt> Gosh, why am I even here, eh? I shouldn't even be entertaining this. <em>We</em> shouldn't be, Seven. This is childish. This'll be the last time I keep this under wraps.</p>
<p>(<em>A chair is pushed out. The door is unlocked and opened. A second chair is pushed out; footsteps trail towards the door.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Eva! Wait, wait— please.</p>
<p>(<em>The footsteps stop.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> How… how did Two convince you, huh? You— (<em>Sniffling.</em>) You were always so nice. The two of them were good to you. So nice when so many people just… weren't. Weren't.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> Jennie… I'm sorry. I—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> He's— he's been nicer to you, hasn't he?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> What?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I've— yes, I've seen it, he doesn't say your name like he used to. Your pronouns.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> Stop….</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Without the quotation marks now, right?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> Stop it! I… I—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> You told me— you said I was the third person who you came out to. I think we both know who the first two were.</p>
<p>(<em>Pause. More sniffling than prior.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> I've moved on… accepted it. They're gone. They're— they're gone.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> It doesn't look like you've moved on, I mean— you look just like me— crying right now. Don't you? (<em>Broken chuckle.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> I just want to move on… Jennie, I wanna be happy again. Please… I just— I need to go. I need to be happy again.</p>

<p>He's an old friend of mine, both of us really! But… He can be a bit dry, bit cold, but sometimes—</p>
<p>(Sigh.)</p>
<p>Sometimes you need a bit of dry. Or else all you have is tears. Neither of us were— are happy, about how he acts around us. I was conflicted putting him on, on the council. Mal brought me back around— he's just one voice! Just a drop of dry. We— we don't— Ahh!</p>

<p>Just— it's perfect, beautiful.</p>
<p>It'll keep her from seeing all my freckles, at least a bit.</p>
<p>Hey, do you really think she— ? You do realize that like, one of the main things she loves about you, well, from what I've assumed, is your freckles? You probably shouldn't hide them.</p>
<p>Really? I— well…</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p>Oh— sorry! Mind's going millions of places. It's just… that's kinda like what we do, you know, keep beautiful, magical things, keep them concealed. People may love them, we keep them hidden.</p>
<p>I— I guess, but—</p>
<p>Were— sorry, weren't you trying to come up with a name to describe— well, just that? The normal we've created, defining out the "is"s and "isn't"s of ordinary, as if we control reality.</p>

Multiple personnel detrimentally affected by SCP-6665 errors report previously unforeseen side effects, taking the form of false memories. These memories dissipate once nothing is vomited.
<p>The most potent case of this effect was uncovered from Researcher Marvin Kells, who was formerly involved in the containment of SCP-5666. An excerpt from an on-site therapy session detailing his case has been included below.</p>

<p><tt><strong>KELLS:</strong></tt> I… that's the problem, I think, I don't know what's on <em>my</em> mind. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> Well, that's what we're here for. To make sense of everything.</p>

<p><strong>███████:</strong> What did she say now?</p>

<p><tt><strong>KELLS:</strong></tt> Sorry, it's just…</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>KELLS:</strong></tt> Have you ever looked at something really bright, a lightbulb, something like that? You know how the light kind of… sticks in your vision. Flashes in there for a bit after.</p>
<p><strong>███████:</strong> I believe I understand.</p>
<p><tt><strong>KELLS:</strong></tt> Ever since I looked at her last time, in the dream, she was so bright— she's still there. Stuck in my vision. I can see her out of the corner of my eye. She's—</p>

I— I wanted to give you acceptance, so long, so many months, and you still haven't reached that stage of grief. You're still denying. Your therapist talked about this— why don't you go see her again? Instead of bringing more people pain.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> My therapist is out on psychiatric leave. Her friend is comatose, a workfriend. But that— this didn't even make her the <em>most</em> distraught. She burst into tears over the phone trying to say his name— remember his name.</p>

<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> One, this— this is unprofessional.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> No, it's just true. It's true.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> Evaline, I hope this encounter teaches you something. Do I have your vote at the next conference?</p>
<p>(<em>Pause, before O5-7 reluctantly nods.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> No, I know you Eva, this—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> It's—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-2:</strong></tt> It's Seven. To you. Now come along, Evaline. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-2 exits.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> I'm sorry, you just—</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Do you— do you even realize what he's doing?</p>
<p>(<em>Pause.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> What am I saying— you probably do. You're just happy that's he— he's not being himself.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> Jennie— One… this is the happiest I've felt since they…</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> You haven't made peace yet, you can't— you're just like me. Like how he says I am. Can't bring yourself to admit it. Because it's not true yet. Their love was a powerful thing, and it still <em>is</em>. When a love like that decays— when it rots away, all the memories of all the things they did together… It doesn't go easily. It fights. It keeps itself from fleeting. Any way it can.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> You're not making any sense… I need to get going, I need to go.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> Eva, just— ! Please. More things will be taken to sustain them, sustain their love.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> How do <em>you</em> know?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I've— I've seen them, felt the fight. We were so close… I think I became part of them. My brain is shooting back and forth, It's hard to think… to breathe.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-1 rubs the sides of her head.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> You know what he's doing. He's— he only uses your name when it's useful for him— only calls you a <em>woman</em> when it's useful for him. That sheet of happiness that his "acceptance" give you, it's— you <em>know</em> it's not real.</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-7:</strong></tt> And what if… what if you're just using me?</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I would never do that, I— I would never drag you into something if I didn't think— didn't know it was right. Tell me, really, who do you believe more? Just for one second, see through his— his display, through all the empty acceptance, just think. I know it's hard for you— it's hard for me too, but it'll be harder for everyone else too, they'll all be dragged into this fight. They'll all be dragged into their <em>love</em>.</p>
<p>(<em>Pause. Shakily, O5-7 begins to leave.</em>)</p>
<p><tt><strong>O5-1:</strong></tt> I know. I know it's hard. I'm sure they'll love you no matter what you do. They always have.</p>
<p>(<em>O5-7 pauses briefly, then exits, O5-1 sighs, briefly looking out the open office door, before exiting as well.</em>)</p>

<p>Following these events, a hearing on O5-1's censure was held. O5-7 was not in attendance.</p>

"Enter! Come on in!"</p>
<p>Evaline opens the door.</p>
<p>"How are you! Gosh— I have so much to talk about—"</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"Well— sorry, I know it's work hours, but me and Mal just have a <em>lot</em> to take care of still, it's hard to juggle this place and the</p>
<p>Evaline puts on a vividly colorful dress.</p>
<p>"Is this—"</p>
<p>"Hmm? Oh— sorry, I should've let you finish, that looks great on you. Did before— does now! Yes, Jennie, are you still getting ready?"</p>
<p>Jennie walks out of the changing room.</p>
<p>"Eva!"</p>
<p>"I know, right? She— wait, am I being too much? I'm just… excited? Yes, excited! You both look beautiful. This is perfect, This is going to be perfect. Sorry — I'm bouncing off the walls — this is going to be the best</p>
<p>Flower petals dance. A voice whispers over the vibrant chimes of the church organ.</p>
<p>"Eva!"</p>
<p>Jennie spins in her pew, to the face of Evaline behind her.</p>
<p>"You did it, you…"</p>
<p>Tears stream, as two dresses stream down the aisle. They are worn in both senses, yet they stay pristine, cascading over settled petals speckling the ground.</p>
<p>Over the black spots of the crowd sit the facadeless facades of things that can only be described as angels, yet despite any previous ravenous malice, they sit in a strained calmness. They are sated.</p>
<p>As the church organ fades into words and laughter and tears and joy and all else the world could lend to each savorous second, the words of Malorie and Maddison each ring, they each ring a bell, they each ring true.</p>
<p>"Till death do us part."</p>
<p>"And for forevermore after."</p>
<p>A foreign voice to the scenes kicks out from the pews. Skipping the needle on the record, halting the needle sewing two lives together.</p>
<p>"No, no, what is going on, this— this isn't now— it isn't right. The world needs closure, peace, we all do— <em>I</em> do— we—"</p>
<p>Maddison looks, she takes his eyes into hers, locking them inside, as she has many times before. Her mouth moves in an unfamiliar familiarity.</p>
<p>"This… this was never what you wanted. I know. I know it's all so hard for you. When you confessed your love… so long ago, it was hard for me to tell you too, probably as hard for you to hear it."</p>
<p>He cannot look away.</p>
<p>"But this is how the world is, was, will be."</p>
<p>He cannot look away.</p>
<p>"You're the only one stuck in the past."</p>
<p>He cannot look away. Caught in retrospective bliss, the past becomes his only present, stuck shuttered in the closure of a flytrap symphony, orchestrating in the orbits of two fluttering eyes. Eyelid-jaws close, eyelash-teeth interweave, before they open again to the sight of Malorie.</p>
<p>"You may now kiss the bride."</p>
<p>As they kiss, their lips twirl like propellors in the embrace of eachother's folded wings. The pews whirr alive with floating applause. Nothing is now nothing, as they walk to the plane.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"I— I won't lie… I'm kinda afraid of heights."</p>
<p>"I won't lie too Mal, I'm a bit of the same. But we have each other, I'll be here, you'll be here. Anything up there— nothing won't stand a chance against us."</p>
<p>Their laughter takes them to the stars. As they fly off forevermore into the oscillating blues of the cloudlessly clear sky, the Sun shines like a burning memory.</p>
