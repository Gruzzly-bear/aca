<p>Entrance to Facility 149-3's West Library prior to SCP-8349's appearance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entrance to the West Library is locked behind Level 3 security clearance. Two Security Officers are to be stationed outside the entrance to SCP-8349, operating on rotating shifts to ensure that the gateway is surveilled at all times. Individuals entering SCP-8349 may only enter once a week with permission from Area administration, and Dr. Paige Turner is not to be given access under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8349 is an unidentified extradimensional Y-space within Network Area-149’s Facility 149-3.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> SCP-8349 is accessed via a Class-W transportation gateway in the doorway leading to the Narrativistics &amp; Pataphysics Branch West Library, thus rendering a sizable portion of the facility inaccessible.</p>
<p>Exploration missions into the space have been successful, but recording equipment is permanently damaged upon exiting SCP-8349. The following addenda include descriptions of SCP-8349's contents, and should be reviewed before entry.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log 8349.1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Turner<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup><br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Area-149 Director Brian Stone</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 6/13/20 5:50AM&gt;</strong><br/>
<strong>STONE:</strong> Alright Turner, tell me the story.<br/>
<strong>TURNER:</strong> Well, this morning, I was in my office, drinking coffee and trying to catch up to the day since I had woken up, like, 3 hours before I usually do. And I got a call on my office phone from one of the Junior Researchers who said they found a cart of books in the West Library with a note attached that said “Paige please sort these.” I immediately went “Oh, yeah, I was supposed to do that yesterday,” and headed down there. Something to do while my brain wakes up.<br/>
<strong>STONE:</strong> Do you remember who the caller was?<br/>
<strong>TURNER:</strong> Wasn't awake enough for that.<br/>
<strong>STONE:</strong> Continue.<br/>
<strong>TURNER:</strong> When I got down there, I opened the door and could not see a thing. It was legitimately pitch-black, and the lights are on a sensor and should turn on once you open the door, right? But they didn’t.<br/>
<strong>STONE:</strong> Containment team told me they’re still not on.<br/>
<strong>TURNER:</strong> Are they? Huh. So I head in, ‘cause I know the place like the back of my hand and know there’s the emergency light switch in the back. But as soon as my foot squished on wet grass, I ran and told the next person I saw.<br/>
<strong>STONE:</strong> See anyone in there? Or anything out of the ordinary?<br/>
<strong>TURNER:</strong> Soon as the light from the hallway ran out, I couldn’t see anything. If there was anyone or anything there, I wouldn’t be able to tell you.<br/>
<strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Director Stone promptly declared the West Library Hallway a restricted area, and Dr. Turner was given permission to begin documenting SCP-8349.</p>

The grass was covered in a layer of water, and the scent of recent rain hung in the air. In hindsight, I suppose it was strange that such a large garden didn’t have much variety in its color palette, but in the moment it felt quite comforting. It reminded me of a place I had gone to with my family when I was young, but I can’t for the life of me remember where that was.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><em>Interspersed with the hedge walls and wooden gates were bookshelves from the Library, but they became less frequent as I trekked onwards. I pulled a few books from the shelves, but opening them caused the letters on the page to fall out like hair clippings at the salon. One of the books had fallen off a high shelf and nearly hit me on the head, a large leatherbound tome which - judging by its thickness and weight - I can only presume to be a dictionary or something of that ilk. I would have loved to continue further, but one glance at my watch told me that it was time to head back. I had a surprisingly easy time finding my exit, although I have suspicions that I didn’t retrace my steps perfectly.</em></span></p>

<p>Group of dormant SCP-8349-A entities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8349-A is the designation given to sapient entities found within SCP-8349. SCP-8349-A instances resemble blank sheets of paper, varying in size and wear. Groups of instances may gather to tear out pages of books and replace them with themselves, allowing the group to rest for varying amounts of time. SCP-8349-A entities feed on the pages of written books, and have no desire to consume standard food or water.</p>
<p>SCP-8349-A instances have demonstrated a wide range of emotional displays towards Foundation personnel. Many are ostensibly eager to show operatives an object or place, usually a particular book or bookshelf. All known instances are non-hostile until provoked either verbally or through physical force, in which case they will attempt to use the thin edges of their bodies to inflict cuts on a perceived threat.</p>
<div class="estrella-paper weathered">
<p><span style="color: #000000"><em>They're quite adorable actually. And smart, too. A few of them led me to that same heavy book that almost hit me the other day, and I was finally able to open it. I think it's the first of these books that actually has the letters stay in place rather than shifting all around. I can't remember exactly what it said, but it was some sort of fantasy story about a chosen one destined to slay a dragon. I'm excited to read the rest next time.</em></span></p>

<p>Dear Director,</p>
Our examination has so far shown no signs of anomalous influence drawing Dr. Turner to SCP-8349. If you wish for more in-depth testing, please do let me know. Be aware that doing so may mean Dr. Turner will be unable to conduct SCP-8349 research within the coming weeks, as we would need to isolate her from the anomaly.</div>

Thank you very much for the offer, and congratulations on 8 years as M&amp;C Chair!

<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Crystal Veejay entered SCP-8349 at 2:15PM, after Director Brian Stone inquired about Dr. Turner's whereabouts. Audio was captured by sending a constant radio signal to equipment in the West Library Hallway, which returned the first intact recording from within SCP-8349.</p>

<p><strong>VEEJAY:</strong> <em>(yelling)</em> Paige! Christ, what are you doing?!</p>
<p><em>(Loud sounds of paper rustling at regular intervals on recording.)</em></p>
<p><strong>TURNER:</strong> <em>(yelling)</em> Veejay? Is that you down there?</p>
<p><strong>VEEJAY:</strong> Yes, it's me! Everyone's wondering where you are!</p>
<p><strong>TURNER:</strong> Crys, look at me! I didn't just kill a dragon; I tamed it!</p>
<p><strong>VEEJAY:</strong> That's rather impressive, but you should know this is getting ridiculous! Did Stone approve this?</p>
<p><strong>TURNER:</strong> Since when did you care so much about procedure? This is <em>(unintelligible)</em></p>
<p><strong>VEEJAY:</strong> You know what I care about? I care that you've been spending so much time in here instead of out there. Come to think of it, when was the last time I saw you around the building? When was the last time we chatted at the coffee machine? You're missing out on a big social event as we speak!</p>
<p><strong>TURNER:</strong> What harm could it do?</p>
