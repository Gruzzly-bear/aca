<p>The eastern entrance to SCP-7649.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7649</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7649 has been integrated to the containment infrastructure of Site-19. Site-19 Security Team Bravo-02 ("Locksmiths") are tasked with the security of SCP-7649 and of its personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7649 is Storage Unit-07, a storage facility located in the Surface Area of <a href="https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/collab:scp-site-19">Site-19</a>. SCP-7649's construction was never ordered by Site-19 administration at any point in time, and manifested on the Surface Area of Site-19 on 11/11/2006.</p>
<p>SCP-7649's interior is built with the required equipment and security measures necessary for a Foundation storage facility. After initial quarantine and search by Site-19 security, SCP-7649 was confirmed to be non-anomalous, and later found useful for containment. Since then, SCP-7649 has been used for the containment of low-class, low-risk anomalies in Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7649.01:</strong> SCP-7649 Events</p>
<p>Following continued use of SCP-7649 for its intended purpose, the following phenomena were reported:</p>

<p>Because of the recent events that have endangered the personnel, all research and containment activities in SCP-7649 have been post-poned until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7649.02:</strong> Operation "VAULT CLEANUP"</p>
<p>Operation "VAULT CLEANUP" was a joint operation between <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#psi-7" target="_blank">Mobile Task Force Psi-7 ("Home Improvement")</a> and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#sigma-3" target="_blank">Mobile Task Force Sigma-3 ("Bibliographers")</a> to investigate the anomalous phenomena inside SCP-7649. Because of their expertise in searching anomalous buildings and thaumaturgy respectively, the joint operation was planned so that the task forces could effectively aid each other in exploring the facility.</p>
<p>MTF Psi-7 and MTF Sigma-3 never came back, the operation was declared a massive failure. Because of the loss of both task forces and the rising phenomena inside SCP-7649, Storage Vault Unit-07 has been closed by order of Director Tilda David Moose.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc0"><span>FROM THE OFFICE OF THE SITE-19 DIRECTOR</span></h3>
</div>
<p>I regret to inform all personnel that Psi-7 and Sigma-3 have been lost in our most recent attempt to explore SCP-7649. The loss of each agent is immeasurable, and I pray for their families and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Our work at Site-19 is to understand the unknown. To contain what we don't know, and research what we don't understand. But sometimes, we can't. We try to contain the uncontainable, and understand the incomprehensible. We believed that we understood SCP-7649, but the more we work there, the more time we spent there, the less control we have and the less we understand. Meanwhile, it grows. It sends anomalies we never had, disappears personnel that worked there, and only leaves us with more questions.</p>
<p>We don't know where it comes from, why it came to Site-19, and what its purpose is. Frankly, we shouldn't know. Not this time. I hereby order the termination of all activities related to research and containment inside SCP-7649. All personnel, as well as contained anomalies, will be transferred to other locations within Site‑19.</p>
<p>We may try to keep it at bay, but once we leave, it will stay there — sending more questions that we cannot answer. The mystery of Storage Unit-07 is one we don't know, and we may never know.</p>
<p>Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>— Director Tilda David Moose</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the closure of SCP-7649, Security Team Bravo-2 ("Locksmiths") are tasked with patrolling the nearby area and ensure that no individuals enter SCP-7649. Only Security Team Bravo-2 are allowed entry once annually to SCP-7649. Since then, anomalous phenomenon has continued inside SCP-7649.</p>
