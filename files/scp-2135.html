<p>View of SCP-2135 entrance from street level</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2135</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-2135 is located in a highly trafficked area, isolated containment of SCP-2135 is not feasible at this time. Instead, Foundation agents will work with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to prevent unauthorized access to SCP-2135 by civilians. SCP-2135 is currently closed to the public and inaccessible by conventional means; as such, this is considered to be a reasonable request that does not require excessive coercion on the part of the Foundation. The interior of SCP-2135 is to be monitored via closed-circuit camera, but as it is plainly visible to civilians travelling within the New York City Subway system, Foundation personnel are discouraged from directly guarding SCP-2135's interior.</p>
<p>Any incursions into SCP-2135-B are to be conducted by D-Class Personnel under the supervision of Foundation researchers; direct incursion into SCP-2135-B by researchers requires the approval of the current Region 38A (New York City/Long Island) Director. D-Class Personnel entering SCP-2135-B must adhere to the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No items manufactured after February 1959 (including clothing, recording equipment, entertainment media, etc) may be taken into SCP-2135-B.</li>
<li>When interacting with instances of SCP-2135-C, personnel must avoid using words or phrases that were not commonly used prior to 1959 (e.g. "hippie," "wicked," etc).</li>
<li>No more than 24 hours may be spent inside of SCP-2135-B.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2135 is the former 91st Street Station, a station of the New York City Subway system located in Manhattan. Prior to its closure in February 1959, SCP-2135 was served by the 1 and 2 trains of the IRT Broadway - Seventh Avenue Line, bounded by the 96th Street Station to the north and the 86th Street Station to the south. SCP-2135 was closed after platform expansion on the 96th Street Station rendered it impractical to continue servicing it.</p>
<p>SCP-2135's anomalous properties manifest twice a week, at unpredictable intervals. During this time, a train car (which varies by make and model, but is always a car that was in use by the New York City Subway system during or prior to 1959), hereafter SCP-2135-A, will stop at the station for approximately fifteen seconds. SCP-2135-A is only perceivable to those standing on the subway platform at the time it arrives; non-anomalous trains in service will pass through it as if it were not there, and passengers on those trains are unable to perceive SCP-2135-A's presence as they pass through it.</p>
<p>Should any subject board the train during this time, they will remain in a state of transit for approximately fifteen minutes, and will be unable to exit the train. No other passengers are present onboard the train, nor is a conductor. After fifteen minutes have elapsed, the train will come to a halt, and subjects will arrive within SCP-2135-B.</p>
<p>SCP-2135-B is a replica of the island of Manhattan as it appeared on 1 Feb 1959. Persons, events, and buildings present in Manhattan during this time are all replicated in a nearly identical fashion within SCP-2135-B, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persons present inside of Manhattan during this time are replaced by instances of SCP-2135-C (see below).</li>
<li>All written material present inside of SCP-2135-B, including advertisements, books, newspapers, etc. consist solely of the words "SAFE WORLD" repeated over and over, in capital letters. The exceptions to this are the signs carried by SCP-2135-C.</li>
<li>Subway stations other than the 91st Street Station are inaccessible to all subjects. Instead, an instance of SCP-2135-C guards each subway station entrance, remaining still while holding a sign with the word "SECURITY" written on it. Subjects attempting to enter these stations will be forcefully impeded from doing so by the SCP-2135-C instance.</li>
<li>Any area beyond the island of Manhattan is rendered inaccessible by a white void surrounding the entire island. Subjects attempting to leave Manhattan will be blocked by an impermeable barrier. SCP-2135-C instances leaving Manhattan will appear to vanish into the void; likewise, SCP-2135-C instances entering Manhattan appear to spontaneously emerge from it.</li>
<li>Subjects universally report perceiving SCP-2135-B as monochromatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-2135-C are faceless humanoid entities that inhabit SCP-2135-B. SCP-2135-C instances lack eyes, noses, and mouths, but otherwise are replicas of people that were in Manhattan on 1 Feb 1959. All SCP-2135-C instances carry with them a blank white canvas board and a marker; if in a car or other vehicle, they will have one within close proximity of them. Despite their lack of facial features, SCP-2135-C instances appear capable of sight and scent, and can interact with subjects if prompted via the blank canvas boards, albeit only one or two words at a time (see interview log below).</p>
<p>Should a subject enter SCP-2135-B with any items that were manufactured after February 1959, or exhibit speech patterns or other mannerisms anachronistic to the period upon exiting the 91st Street Station, SCP-2135-C instances will stop in place and continuously "stare" at the subject until they leave. While SCP-2135-C instances do not exhibit any hostile intent, subjects will generally express a strong desire to leave if SCP-2135-C instances enter this state, citing discomfort and unease. Subjects may leave SCP-2135-B by returning down the 91st Street Station entrance; SCP-2135-A will appear within ten minutes and will return the subject to baseline reality.</p>
<p>After twenty four hours have passed within SCP-2135-B<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, the 91st Street Station will be closed, and subjects will be unable to leave SCP-2135-B. [REDACTED] although said reports remain unconfirmed, and the similarities may be superficial or coincidental.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 23 Aug 2007 (baseline time)</p>
<p><strong>Test Subject:</strong> D-3425 (29 years old; Caucasian female)</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Outfitted:</strong> Handheld audio recorder, c. 1956; period-appropriate clothing; notepad and two (2) pencils, both manufactured c. 1958.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> To avoid shocking or upsetting D-3425 (thus potentially making data collection problematic), subject was informed of the nature of SCP-2135-B beforehand. Subject is instructed to find nearest SCP-2135-C instance and engage it in conversation, taking care to avoid using contemporary jargon, and transcribe the responses produced via the canvas board. Subject was given a list of pre-approved questions, but was given permission to deviate from this list if necessary.</p>
