</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7746</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Dreams and their dreamers are to be ranked by productivity within SCP-7746. Low-productivity residents are eligible for removal.</p>
<p>Individuals are to sleep no more than 30 hours in SCP-7746 to avoid extraphysical neuron displacement. On-site personnel may sleep for up to 45 hours (opt-out). Nanoscale somnosensors and sedatives will be injected during sleep.</p>
<p>Containment supervisors are to act as church staff and clergy. Repeat users are to be catalogued and allowed inside. Foundation assets within the Brussels Police Service are to covertly expedite entry and sleep within SCP-7746. Asset secrecy is to be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7746 is a small wooden church in Brussels, AB, CA. It was owned by the McClure family from 1895-2020 until being bought by Foundation front company Ranger Developers Inc.</p>
<p>SCP-7746 generates valuable human training data. Latent inforrhea is transcribed into the structure upon submission. New formations overwrite older generations, making extensive records necessary. An estimated ███,███,███ phantom neurons are currently firing within vital structural fibers.</p>
<p>Reports of excessive sleep and visible dreaming began in 1994. SCP-7746 became a local attraction wherein the public would record friends' and family members' dreams. The church hosted numerous gatherings and events until Foundation investigation of the property began in 2000. Locals amnesticized.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 1: Cumulative Progress Report for SCP-7746 Initiative</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> O5 Edict 48887.4 mandated clandestine incorporation of Level-1 information into big data amid funding cuts. Subsequent contracts with Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc. increased interest in extra-human data sets. First contracts sold in 2023 under L-3(S) Trusted Clearance. Associate supervisors approved for SCP-7746.</p>

<p>Residence of Type 1 specimens fully limited per Trusted Clearance oversight. Type 2 specimens were to be prioritized. Drs. J. Amherst and T. H. Walden hypothesized a possible ultra-productive Type 3 specimen based on recorded Type 2 personhood trends.</p>
<p>Funding boost led to heaters being installed in SCP-7746.</p>

<td>Rapid personhood development correlated directly with significant data set improvement. Complex reasoning, empathy-attraction, and substance novelty developed substantially by 17.8 points over 1 year. Emergent personality traits deemed extremely desirable. Drs. Amherst and Walden commended.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Type 3 specimens prioritized. Type 2 specimens limited but sustained in low number to facilitate backup/reference data set generation. Undesirable Type 2 specimens (Evans, Warner, Nguyen, Padilla, Ulmeyda, etc.) amnesticized and relocated to preserve data pool.</p>
<p>Renovations and expansions to SCP-7746 have been proposed and are currently under review by Brussels officials and the Foundation Containment Procedures Board.</p>
<p><strong>Update 04/06/2024:</strong> Models have shown undesirable bias towards certain topics. These biases have been traced back to SCP-7746. As such, Campbell's Condensed Tomato Soup will no longer be served. SCP-7746 is estimated to generate record profits in 10 years.</p>
