<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6921 is held within a reinforced hangar located at Site-19. Observation of SCP-6921 is to be done remotely to prevent external interface during behavioral study.</p>
<p>To further study its behavior, small mammals are to be released within its cell on a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6921 refers to a 4m tall spherical automaton composed of common metal alloys and complex circuitry. SCP-6921 is suspended by 35 mechanical appendages resembling elongated human arms. These limbs are incredibly dexterous; housing an abundant amount of joints to help it traverse environments and track prey. They have been documented extending far beyond what their design would suggest. Directly on top of 6921’s sphere lies an inoperable hatch, as well as a retractable input chamber directly beneath. X-ray analysis of SCP-6921’s interior has revealed the deceased remains of Jesse B. Court.</p>
<p>Whenever SCP-6921 locates organic matter<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, it will begin navigating towards it. Upon arrival, it will use its appendages to forcefully tear the matter into small segments, where<br/>
the remains will be inserted into a retractable lower compartment. Periodically, SCP-6921 will expel matter out of this compartment due to the excess of matter gathered.</p>
<p>SCP-6921 will remain dormant when not in the presence of suitable organic material.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> 16 video recordings were successfully recovered from Jesse’s personal computer. The following are the archived video files transcribed in numerical order:</p>

<p><em>Recording begins with Jesse sitting at his dining room table</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> My therapist suggested this was a healthy way to cope with trauma- God, this is embarrassing. Hello, my name is Jesse Court. I’m 33 and a retired mechanical engineer.</p>
<p><em>Violent coughing followed by sniffling</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> I’ve always had a fascination with machinery, like cars and stuff. Which is great since I'm right next to a junkyard, best seat in the house. I fortunately inherited my aunts property after she passed, which entitles me to 1.3 acres of woodland, right in Camden. Even with all of this, I've found myself in a pretty shitty living situation. Been workin’ under the table for a dead-end newspaper company, which on top of disability checks is just barely getting me by. Few years back, I sustained major head trauma after falling through some floor boards. As embarrassing as that is.</p>
<p><em>Jesse forcefully clasps his hands together.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Ever since then, I’ve had subsisting migraines. Like nails being driven into my skull. The real kicker is how easily nauseated I become. Lose balance pretty easy.</p>
<p><em>Jesse slowly lifts himself out of his chair, before attempting to walk in a straight line. Jesse loses balances and falls, where a glass object audibly breaks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> You get used to it.</p>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> It’s time to take initiative. For far too long I’ve wasted my days, counting them down until I drop dead. Not anymore. Starting from now, eighty percent of my life insurance will be going towards a device I’ve had in the works. A machine that will eliminate the need for reliance, a machine that will make me walk normally again. This over here is the first iteration of my machine.</p>
<p><em>Jesse positions the camera towards the wall, where 3 forked, mechanical limbs are shown hung up along the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Although being my first, this prototype has amazing functionality; extremely dexterous. Observe.</p>
<p><em>The automated limbs begin suspending themselves towards Jesse in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Creepy, I know. But this is the first step towards something life changing.</p>

<p><em>The camera is positioned downward towards his desk, where various blueprints depicting unidentified devices are shown.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Almost there. Haven’t been this happy in a while, feel productive. I feel so close to finally accomplishing my dream. Even been having dreams about it, creating something just… life changing. It’s hazy to remember, but it’s enough to keep me motivated. I’m even sleep talking, my wife’s caught me going on and on about random incoherent computer jargon. My infatuation scares even me sometimes, ha-ha.</p>
<p><em>Jesse appears visually agitated as his son attempts to walk inside of his garage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Junior, if I have to tell you one more time to not enter the garage during my work hours, I’m gonna freak the fuck out.</p>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Is this thing on? I’m not sure what happened. Under no circumstances can my family know, they’ll think I’m crazy. They’d be right to think so. It’s, what, 2:43 in the morning? Just woke up and found myself surrounded by THIS.</p>
<p><em>Jesse repositions the camera, where 3 disassembled vehicles and other miscellaneous objects are scattered in his driveway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> I must be going fucking insane. I have no idea what I’m doing at this point. Are… are these the junkyard cars? How did I even manage to do this? Was I drugged? I mean, what the fuck is even this supposed to be?</p>
<p><em>Jesse holds up an unidentifiable device, with various screws and LEDs protruding out of it’s base, which he forcefully flings at a wall.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesse’s attitude changes, becomes visually distressed as he leans in closer toward the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> (Lowers voice) But even still, I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s been lingering in the back of my mind. You know, I examined some of the janky parts that were found on my machine. They serve legitimate purpose. One part acted as coolant, one helped with stabilization, and one made a deafening “beep” whenever an object was in its proxy. Not to mention it’s equipped with these newly installed limbs. It’s all far beyond my technology. Either some big-brain hack put these parts on my machine, or…</p>

I mean- a device this complex, well beyond the technology of anything I've seen before, would be taken confiscated I'd imagine. I’ve worked too hard to have my device surrendered to the government or stolen. For now, until I’m absolutely sure it will be safe, Son will remain on my property, where it’s safely shielded by fencing and trees. I think he understands as well.</p>

<p><em>Video recorded on a handheld device from Jesse's upstairs window, overlooking 4 police officers which stand directly outside his front door late at night.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Mr. Court? This is the Camden City Police Department. Open up.</p>
<p><em>Jesse curses under his breath before walking downstairs towards the entrance. He hesitantly opens the front door and is greeted by multiple officers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> I'm recording for my safety.</p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Mr. Court? You are under arrest for trespassing on private property as well as multiple counts of theft.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> This is ridiculous. Sir, are you aware that I’m physically disabled? How would I ever be able to preform such a feat?</p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> We initially thought you couldn't, but after further investigation it seems you're the only viable suspect. We have evidence that suggests you were at the scene. Put your hands behind your back.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Fuck… Alright, fine. But please officer, just give me five minutes. I have to take care of something urgent.</p>
<p><em>The officer wedges his boot in between the door and doorframe, preventing it from shutting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Put your hands behind your back.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> You don't know what you're doing! Get away from me!</p>
<p><em>Jesse begins wrestling the officer to the floor. 3 more enter and forcefully remove Jesse from his house, pinning him on the pavement while still gripping the recording device. Jesse audibly groans in pain as he’s injured.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say could be used against you in a court of law.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> SON! If you can hear me, go into the woods until this whole thing is over! I'll find you again I promise.</p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Search the property for another individual and take them in for questioning, presumably a child.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> No- officer… I'm talking about my dog. I don't want you sending him away to the pound or some shit.</p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Son's an awfully weird name for a dog.</p>
<p><em>Right before entering the vehicle, the cops and Jesse stop in unison.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> …Uh. What the hell is this supposed to be?</p>
<p><em>SCP-6921 is suspended inanimately on the houses roof, hoisted by its appendages at precarious angles. The officer detaining Jesse disregards him as he runs towards the car.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Gotta radio this in. Get in the car.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6921 lunges downward towards the officers, crushing one beneath its limbs. The impact causes Jesse and the men to lose their balance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Officer:</strong> Open fire!</p>
<p><em>Multiple gunshots are fired at SCP-6921. SCP-6921 remains undisturbed as it carefully dissects the officer’s corpse, inserting the removed tissue into itself. Upon completion, SCP-6921 lunges towards another officer, and begins amputating them. Screaming and welching are prominent throughout the process. Jesse attempts to sprint into the surrounding wilderness, but is suspended midair by SCP-6921 limbs. He begins being slowly hoisted inside of the hatch. Bullets ricochet across SCP-6921’s surface.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Put me down right now! You have to obey my orders!</p>
<p><em>Jesse is shoved forcefully inside of SCP-6921; the hatch shutting behind him. Trying to escape, Jesse begins kicking and scratching the interior of SCP-6921 to no avail. Muffled screams ring out for some time before abruptly ending. The sound of rapid traversal on woodland becomes audible for the rest of the recording. 5 minutes later, an orange light illuminates Jesse’s fearful expression. Another food-item is dispensed through the slit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> What… what the fuck are you trying to make me eat? Oh God…</p>
<p><em>Extensive vomiting followed by maniacal hysteria.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> You call this helping?! What the fuck have you done? You- you killed that man! Ripped his fucking head off his shoulders.</p>
<p><em>Jesse exhales slowly, 10 minutes pass. He begins speaking towards SCP-6921 the way he had prior to this event.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Just listen, okay? Let me out. I’ll be safe, I promise. Those men are gone now.</p>
<p><em>SCP-6921 abruptly stops for 15 minutes, unresponsive to Jesse’s pleas to allow him out. SCP-6921 begins moving once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> I know you think this is right- but this is no way to live. Just let me out, alright? Think this through, let’s just go back to the house. You can play out back and cook me up some of your delicious meals. Perhaps you could even meet the family. What do you say, son? …Son? Are you even listening to me? Answer me God damnit!</p>
<p><em>Audible sounds of gurgled screeching are audible outside of SCP-6921.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> What was that?</p>

<p><em>Video starts within complete darkness. Jesses voice is notably shaky</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> It’s been an hour… my calls are getting blocked somehow and the battery’s almost drained. However, I've successfully managed to upload a recording onto my computer after repetitively trying, at least that’s what it’s saying on my phone. Hopefully this gets through.</p>
<p><em>Coughing, followed by a loud thud.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> My name is Jesse Court, and I doubt I'm gonna be coming out anytime soon. To my wife and children, I'm sorry. I should’ve never neglected you all. My selfishness is what led me here. I should've been there for you guys. I love you all.</p>
<p><em>Muffled sounds of rapid movement are heard from inside. Jesse struggles to speak.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> The officers injuring me must’ve triggered something inside of Son. He’s been reverted to his basic primary function, ensuring my safety. I’m not sure if he’s ever gonna let me out.</p>
<p><em>Jesse quietly laughs before presumably striking the hatch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Despite having created the machine, I’m unsure of how to destroy it. Hell, Its battery could last at thousand years for all I know. Light it on fire, douse it in water, electricity, just- do whatever you can to kill it. I… I want out. Find a way. Please.</p>
