            <h1>SCP-2752</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2752</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#alpha-4" target="_blank">Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 ("Pony Express")</a> is tasked with the identification and interception of SCP-2752 instances before they are sent to the addresses of their respective recipients. A scanned copy of each recovered SCP-2752 instance is to be produced, and stored in Archival Sector 7 at Site-64. After scanning, original copies may be incinerated.</p>
<p>Persons affected by SCP-2752 are to be held at E-class holding cells at Site-64, and undergo weekly medical checkups. At the discretion of the attending Medical Officer, invasive surgical procedures may be enacted on such persons to prevent health complications attributed to SCP-2752.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2752 refers to a series of letters mailed to New Zealand addresses, offering advertising mail opt-out services to recipients. The sender is attributed to an organisation named 'Robinson Toʊ Liz', which is not listed as a registered company in New Zealand or any polity known to the Foundation. No return address is found in confiscated SCP-2752 instances. To date, all known instances of SCP-2752 are sent solely to male individuals aged between 20 to 60 and with legal addresses in New Zealand cities.</p>
<p>When SCP-2752 is read by its intended recipient (hereon referred to as 'subject'), the following anomalous occurrences will manifest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cessation of mail letters (advertising mail or otherwise) sent to the address of the subjects instances. Through the use of letters equipped with a GPS tracker, letters are shown to have vanished when placed inside a mailbox. Hand-delivered mail letters are exempted from this effect.</li>
<li>Claircognizance regarding the contents of mail letters that would be sent to the subjects. This occurs after said letters are placed in a mailbox.</li>
<li>Traces of black dye manifested in subject's urinary system, particularly the kidney, bladder and urethra.</li>
<li>Manifestation of paper pieces inside subject's internal organs, including stomach, large intestines, lungs, kidney etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scanned and handwritten copies of SCP-2752 do not possess this effect on their intended recipient.</p>
<p>SCP-2752 was identified on ██/██/1974 in Auckland, New Zealand when multiple paper strips were found in the lungs of PoI-2752-01 (Mr. █████ ████) after a surgery. While initially believed to be an isolated incident, similar cases were identified in other New Zealand cities and SCP-2752 was officially classified.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2752-1:</strong> Interview Log PoI-2752-04-13 [Date: ██/██/1975]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> PoI-2752-04 (Mr. ████ ███████)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Aster Black</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following interview is conducted at PoI-2752-04's request.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> ███████, I heard you have requested for me. So what's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2752-04:</strong> Doctor, 'wrong' is an understatement. I've received another letter… uh, up here.</p>
<p>[PoI-2752-A04 points to its forehead.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> ███████, we've debriefed on this already. This is a difficult time, but-</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2752-04:</strong> It was from Robinson Toʊ Liz.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> Okay, I'm listening. What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2752-04:</strong> The usual 'thank you for using us' crap. But they sure have a weird way of expressing they have fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> Please give me some examples of these expressions.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2752-04:</strong> That they didn't know that cellulose is indigestible, or that ink poisoning is a thing. And the biological peculiarities of the so-called humans of this plane, that was underlined and a direct quote. They also gave us compensation, a cheque with a very large sum of money in yen.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> Do you recall the value?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-2752-04:</strong> 960,000,000,000 yen, precisely that amount. But doctor… if this is anything like the rest of their so-called service, I'm not getting any real money, am I?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Black:</strong> We will have to wait and see first.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Interviews with other subjects indicate that they have received similar letters from 'Robinson Toʊ Liz'. The value offered by 'Robinson Toʊ Liz' is consistent among all subjects, at a value of ¥960,000,000,000.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2752-2:</strong> On ██/██/1975, postage stamps are found manifested underneath the tongues of all known subjects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Denomination is stated as ¥960,000,000,000. Said stamps have a banana tree motif, and are labelled "<a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dai-to-a" target="_blank" target="_blank">Dai-tō-a</a> – Malai Baru".</p>
<p>No anomalous quality has been identified among recovered stamps. All instances of said postage stamps are provisionally kept in Storage Sector 2 at Site-64, and slated for incineration.</p>
