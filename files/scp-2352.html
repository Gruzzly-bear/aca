            <h1>SCP-2352</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2352
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized (formerly Euclid)</p>
<p><strong>Original Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2352 videos are to be copied onto Site-15 and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-247-dossier">Site-247</a>'s online media servers, with backups stored in those of sites 8, 17, 19, 24, and 56. The original uploads are to be suppressed from public viewing in accordance to standard <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dab-orientation">Department of Anomalous Broadcasting</a> protocols. Webcrawler SB985R ("Simon to Simon") is to scan for any references to "Simon M█████████" or "SimonM34" on YouTube or other social media sites. If there is successful confirmation of a match, agents embedded within said sites are to be notified as soon as possible, with Class-I amnestics to be dispatched when needed.</p>
<p>SCP-2352-1's corpse is stored in Site-15's Medium-Security Biological Storage. Due to the events of SCP-2352-Broadcast-66, in the event that a SCP-2352-Broadcast event occurs, any Foundation personnel present are to immediately vacate SCP-2352-1's containment area until its cessation. No less than four (4) security cameras are to be in place and active in said containment area at all times.</p>
<p>Efforts to permanently contain SCP-2352-2 are ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of 07/18/15, SCP-2352 broadcasts have ceased, and the channel SimonM34 has been deleted. SCP-2352-1 was transferred to its original burial site 06/17/17; surveillance of SCP-2352-1's surviving relatives is to continue until 09/07/20. SB985R is to be modified to scan for keywords pertaining to SCP-2352-2's characteristics indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2352 is the collective designation for videos uploaded onto the YouTube channel SimonM34. There are currently 128 instances of SCP-2352 on record (see Document 2352-U, <em>Notable Instances of SCP-2352-Broadcast-#</em>). With few exceptions, all broadcasts involve SCP-2352-1's diatribes on a range of topics, from the minutiae of its life to its limited knowledge of global events. SCP-2352 broadcasts themselves exhibit no anomalous properties; the only hazard that they pose is that of information breaches should they not be suppressed timely.</p>
<p>SCP-2352-1 is the corpse of Simon M█████████. SCP-2352-1 is a Caucasian male with brown eyes and black hair, age 17 at time of death. Due to the circumstances of its death, subject has second and third-degree burns across 65% of its body, with the highest concentration around its hands and facial region. SCP-2352-1 shows no anomalous properties when not under the effect of SCP-2352-2.</p>
<p>SCP-2352-2 is a humanoid, extradimensional entity composed of what is presumed to be a biological crystalline construct. SCP-2352-2 lacks any facial features, and possesses an androgynous body-type; <span style="color: red">no vocalizations from the entity have been recorded</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. For reasons currently unknown, SCP-2352-2 is only visible when recorded via video or surveillance camera; all Foundation attempts to perceive it by other means have resulted in failure. Efforts to contain it have been similarly unsuccessful, though due to the entity's frequent close proximity to SCP-2352-1 redundancy has been put into question.</p>
<p>An SCP-2352-Broadcast event occurs when SCP-2352-2 makes contact with SCP-2352-1. An event is initiated by SCP-2352-2 placing its hand against the forehead of SCP-2352-1, causing spontaneous reanimation in the subject<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. SCP-2352-1 will then speak of a random topic in a manner consistent with broadcasts prior to its death. SCP-2352-1 will give no acknowledgement to other occupants of the room that subject is in, with the exception of SCP-2352-2. An SCP-2352-Broadcast event ceases with SCP-2352-1's body becoming inert, and subject returning to its original position.</p>
<p>After a varying period of time<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, a corresponding SCP-2352 instance will be uploaded onto the SimonM34 channel. These broadcasts are implied to have been recorded and uploaded by SCP-2352-2, although the methods of how it is able to do so are unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-2352 was first discovered when during a routine scan, Webcrawler J159DI ("That Weird Part of YouTube Again") flagged an upload of the analysis channel "█████ ████", which covered the contents of SimonM34 up to broadcast 65. The video had garnered 4500 views and 135 comments before Anomalous Broadcasting protocols were enacted; ████ ████████ was subsequently questioned, with Class-B Amnestics administered after it was concluded they were ignorant of SCP-2352's true nature.</p>
<p>Further research into SCP-2352 prior to containment brought up an obituary for SCP-2352-1, listing cause of subject's death as a result of an electrical fire at its home in █████, DE, of which the subject was the only casualty. SCP-2352-1's remains were recovered prior to its burial; Class-C amnestics were given to mortuary staff and subject's surviving family afterwards.</p>

At 0:26, SCP-2352-2 is partially visible in the hallway through subject's partially open doorway, turning its head towards subject as they speak. The entity remains in that position until 4:32, after which it moves to the left out of frame. Length of 4:54.</td>

SCP-2352-2 can be seen in the background several times behind SCP-2352-1, although the exact number is difficult to ascertain due to the shaky nature of the footage. At 7:20, subject appears to finally notice the entity's presence, turning around with the camera pointing at a small clearing. SCP-2352-2 is nowhere to be found, and SCP-2352-1 lets out a string of disbelieving expletives before presumably shutting off the camera. Length of 7:58.</td>

<p>On 07/18/15, SCP-2352-Broadcast-129 was uploaded onto SimonM34 as an unlisted video. Titled as "___", the broadcast depicts SCP-2352-2 sitting atop of SCP-2352-1's slab and its attention focused directly at the camera, whilst subject gently spasms. SCP-2352-2 begins to speak after eight seconds of silence, its vocalizations matching no currently known language.</p>
<p>Labored breathing and coughs are heard from SCP-2352-1, with SCP-2352-2 placing its hand against their arm and periodically running it against the skin. At the 6:23 mark, SCP-2352-2 turns its gaze towards SCP-2352-1, lifting its hand up and placing it against subject's forehead.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, SCP-2352-2 utters "Goodbye, Simon" in neutral-dialect English, with a blend of masculine and feminine vocals. SCP-2352-1 mouths the words "thank you" before its body becomes limp. SCP-2352-2 remains in place for a minute and thirty seconds before retracting its hand from SCP-2352-1, removing itself from the slab, and walking left out of frame; the broadcast ends five seconds afterwards.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reception of the broadcast, the channel SimonM34 was manually deleted. SCP-2352 and SCP-2352-1 were deemed neutralized, whilst locating the whereabouts of SCP-2352-2 and its kind was branded as a medium priority.</p>
