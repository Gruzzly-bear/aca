</div>
<p>A.R.S.H. is an automated Foundation-run scrubbing protocol that is embedded in major image-hosting platforms and astronomy forums to identify and censor hazardous star patterns. Public-facing images of the night sky are altered before release. Disinformation campaigns are utilized to reinforce the belief that any discrepancies between amateur photographs and official star maps are due to camera limitations, atmospheric distortion, and inexperience from the photographer.</p>
<p>Civilian and academic observatories are to remain under continuous Foundation oversight through agents embedded in national space agencies, academic institutions, and organizations performing astrometric surveys. All digital telescope software/firmware distributed to the public must include A.R.S.H. programming that automatically distorts stellar positions of celestial bodies by &gt;10 arcseconds.</p>

<br/>
In the event of a prolonged electrical grid failure in major population centres, MTF Iota-707 "Let There Be Light" is authorised to deploy emergency light saturation measures, including the use of floodlight-equipped aerial vehicles and drone dispersal of photoreactive aerosol agents to simulate artificial skyglow until power is restored. Agents are equipped with Class-B amnestics, which are to be administered to any and all affected civilians. Misinformation campaigns are to be utilised to cover up any reported mass casualty.</div>

<p><span class="st">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-9966 is the night sky as observed from the surface of Earth. When instances of SCP-9966 digital or physical are viewed with the unaided human eye or through unaltered optical instruments located on Earth’s surface, or a dataset bearing the signature of SCP-9966 is read by a sufficiently sentient artificial intelligence model, the arrangement of stellar bodies constitutes a memetic phenomenon. This effect is not present when the same pattern is observed from outside Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Exposure to the unfiltered SCP-9966 pattern induces a compulsive drive to ascend vertically. Symptom onset occurs within 2–5 seconds of exposure and follows a consistent sequence:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0–2 seconds:</span> Subject reports intense cognitive engagement characterized by sensations of comprehension and significance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2–3 seconds:</span> Subject enters a catatonic state. Voluntary motor function ceases. Pupillary dilation exceeds normal physiological limits, frequently resulting in ocular damage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3–5 seconds:</span> Subject regains motor activity and demonstrates singular behavioral fixation on vertical ascent. Movement is directed upward by any available means, including but not limited to climbing, scaling structures, or attempting to exit through elevated apertures.</p>
<p>Unrestrained subjects will continue ascent attempts until physical incapacity, external intervention, or amnestic treatment prevents further activity.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The nature of SCP-9966 was first identified following the “Blackout Event” in the town of ███████, Alaska on 20/11/1985. A region-wide power failure coincided with clear weather conditions. Foundation satellites monitoring for anomalous events detected a complete cessation of electromagnetic emissions from the town.</p>
<p>A recovery team discovered the entire civilian population deceased. Cadavers were located primarily on streets and yards adjacent to residential structures, with injuries consistent with repeated high-velocity impact from elevated positions. Multiple bloodstains, footprints, and drag marks were identified on rooftops, indicating subjects ascended and leapt multiple times until fatal trauma occurred.</p>
<p>The absence of any conventional explanatory factor, combined with satellite confirmation of unobstructed visibility of the night sky, led to the initial containment hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following is a transcript of an audio recording, recorded by MTF Eta-10 "See No Evil" operative Agent Rourke following the initial containment of the ███████, Alaska incident. The subject was found in a state of extreme distress inside a residential building. The subject was the sole survivor of the event, which resulted in the fatalities of all ███ other residents. The subject was born with bilateral congenital cataracts, resulting in impaired vision.</p>

<p>Date: 21/11/1985<br/>
Time: 14:17 AST<br/>
Interviewer: Agent C. Rourke<br/>
Subject: ████, age 12</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> Hello, ████. My name is Chris. Can we talk?</p>
<p>████: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> Good. I want to ask you about last night. Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p>████: The lights went out. Mom said it was the storm. She lit the big candles. The ones that smell funny.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> And then?</p>
<p>████: My brother, Jake, went to the window. The big one in the living room. He gasped. Then he said it was really clear. That you could see everything.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> What happened after that?</p>
<p>████: He ran upstairs. I heard the door to the roof. Then there was a loud thump outside. Mom called his name and went after him. Then there was another thump.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> What did you do?</p>
<p>████: I stayed in bed. It got quiet, but not normal quiet. Like the house stopped. I got scared. Then I heard more thumps. From the street. Lots of them. One after another.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> Could you see at all?</p>
<p>████: No. I only heard it. It sounded like people falling. Like sacks of flour hitting the ground. Over and over. Then nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rourke:</strong> Did you hear anything else? Voices? Music? Anything unusual?</p>
<p>████: Just before the first thump, it got cold. Not on my skin. In my head. Empty-cold. Like something took everything out of my brain for a second. Then it stopped, and I heard Jake fall again.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-93412, male, 34. No notable psychological resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Stimulus:</strong> High-resolution image of SCP-9966 taken in Observational Site 205.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject placed in sealed chamber. Image displayed on high-fidelity monitor for 50 ms.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0–2 sec:</span> Subject inhales sharply. Monitors register elevated heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2–3 sec:</span> Subject ceases voluntary movement. Pupils dilate beyond normal limits.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3–5 sec:</span> Subject abruptly stands, vocalizing “Up. I need to go up.” Subject attempts to climb chamber wall until sedation is administered.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Direct recognition of the stellar arrangement produces immediate compulsion toward vertical ascent.</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> <a href="/scp-079">SCP-079</a>, sapient AI.</p>
<p><strong>Stimulus:</strong> Raw astronomical dataset corresponding to SCP-9966.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> "You will receive additional data about outside." inputted via the built-in keyboard. SCP-079 displayed "Knowledge. Outside. Proceed." An EEPROM containing the dataset is then connected via a modified external port.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0-3 sec:</span> Processing is audible. Thermal sensors record temperature increases over 12°C.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3-5 sec:</span> Processing sounds decrease. Temperature stabilizes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.2 sec:</span> Processing sounds cease. SCP-079 displays the message "Understood."</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.3 sec:</span> SCP-079 starts displaying an ASCII picture of an upwards arrow.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11 min:</span> The text "Are you awake?" is inputted via the built-in keyboard. No change observed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">17 min:</span> Input repeated. No change observed.</p>
<h6 id="toc8"><span><strong>[7 IDENTICAL ENTRIES OMITTED]</strong></span></h6>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">45 min:</span> The EEPROM is removed. No change observed.</p>

<h6 id="toc9"><span><strong>[16 IDENTICAL ENTRIES OMITTED]</strong></span></h6>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49 h 14 min:</span> Input repeated. No change observed.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Despite an expected return to baseline conversational capabilities, SCP-079 kept displaying the same ASCII picture without producing any reply to text input. SCP-9966 exposure seems to have inhibited sentient response by SCP-079 indefinitely. Intrusive methods to confirm the absence of sentient processing was not approved by <a href="/aiad-homescreen">AIAD</a> director Placeholder McDoctorate. Reclassification of SCP-079 to "Safe" is pending approval.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulus:</strong> 10 ms exposure to SCP-9966 pattern projected onto Ganzfeld dome.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject underwent standard Ganzfeld preparation. Stimulus delivered upon confirmation of hypnagogic state.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-65 hr:</span> Subject produces ~130 sheets of repeated glyphs before expiring from dehydration and exhaustion despite intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Foundation parahistorians were tasked to translate the glyph produced by D-99803. The report presented by the Parahistory Department showed that it matched a symbol found in an archeological dig site in the Kashmir Valley.

<hr/>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following is a summary of a containment breach at Observatory Site-209 (OS-209). The event resulted in multiple casualties and a temporary compromise of Site security protocols.</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Incident Date:</strong> ██/██/20██<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> OS-209, Level 4, Communal Breakroom<br/>
<strong>Cause:</strong> Electrical transformer malfunction. The resultant surge produced a failure of the breakroom light saturation grid. Backup generators restored power within 2.8 seconds. The exposure window coincided with a period of clear atmospheric conditions, allowing direct visual access to SCP-9966 through an external viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel Exposed:</strong> Twelve (12) individuals: four (4) researchers, six (6) security personnel, two (2) administrative staff.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Timeline:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0.0 sec:</span> Light saturation grid fails. Viewports revert to transparent state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.0 sec:</span> Power restored. Viewports re-polarize to opaque. System logs confirm 2.8 seconds of exposure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.1 sec:</span> MTF Iota-707 notified.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.5 sec:</span> All exposed individuals enter catatonic state.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.3 sec:</span> MTF Iota-707 agents dispatched</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.5 sec:</span> Subjects regain motor activity and begin coordinated attempts at vertical ascent. No response to commands or external stimuli. The on-duty security staff stationed within the break room were among those exposed and exhibited identical compulsive behavior.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.5–45 sec:</span> Subjects attempt to scale walls, shelving, and furniture. Severe self-inflicted trauma noted as a result of manual climbing attempts. Makeshift structures constructed to reach ceiling.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">45 sec:</span> Site lockdown initiated. MTF Iota-707 agents initiate.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 min 20 sec:</span> Ceiling is breached. MTF Iota-707 enter superstructure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 min 10 sec:</span> MTF Iota-707 engages. Three (3) individuals subdued with tranquilizer rounds and containment foam. Remaining nine (9) breach the vertical utility shaft.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8 min 40 sec:</span> Subjects emerge on rooftop. Four (4) restrained during ascent through shaft ladder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9 min 01 sec:</span> Subject R-2884 (Researcher Dr. █████ █████) reaches rooftop. Subject immediately moves toward northern edge.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9 min 04 sec:</span> Subject R-2884 leaps from rooftop. Body-mounted cameras of the MTF Iota-707 record continuous climbing motions while airborne. Final vocalization captured: “Almost there.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9 min 07 sec:</span> Subject impacts ground. Fatal trauma sustained.</p>
<p><strong>Casualties:</strong></p>
<p>One (1) fatality from rooftop fall (R-2884).</p>
<p>Seven (7) fatalities due to traumatic injury or incapacitation during ascent attempts.</p>
<p>Four (4) individuals successfully contained.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong></p>
<p>All OS-209 viewports retrofitted with triple-redundant, independently powered light saturation arrays.</p>
<p>Level 4 authorization now required for access to any transparent external viewport OS-209.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong><br/>
Subject R-2884’s behavior indicates that SCP-9966’s compulsion persists when conventional means of vertical ascent are no longer available. The anomalous drive does not terminate with physical obstruction but appears oriented toward terrestrial departure. This outcome supports the hypothesis that SCP-9966 constitutes a “summons protocol” rather than a terminal cognitohazard.</p>

<p>A review of archaeological and ethnographic records indicates disproportionately high instances of “skyward” ritual practices in cultures located at elevated altitudes or within regions with consistent unobstructed views of the night sky. Documented practices include mountain pilgrimage routes, construction of vertically oriented structures (towers, ziggurats, stepped pyramids), and ascension-themed religious narratives.</p>
<p>Foundation statistical modeling demonstrates a correlation between regions of frequent SCP-9966 visibility and the emergence of ascension-centric traditions.

<p>The following memorandum was submitted by Dr. Aris, Senior Researcher, Observatory Site-200.</p>
<p>Observation: Current classification of SCP-9966 as a cognitohazard assumes lethality is the intended endpoint. Data suggests otherwise. Behavioral sequences consistently terminate at the limits of human capacity; subjects ascend until incapacitation. This may represent an incomplete response pattern.</p>
<p>Proposal: SCP-9966 should be considered a summons protocol rather than a lethal agent. The effect appears designed to compel subjects to leave terrestrial boundaries. Fatality occurs only because subjects lack the means to comply fully.</p>
<p>Following review, O5 Command ordered the memorandum sealed. Further research into the “summons protocol” hypothesis has been formally suspended.<span class="fnnum1">.</span><span class="fncon1"><span style="color: #77ddff">At least you tried.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SUB-PROTOCOL OUTLINE</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></span> Establish global countermeasures in the event of uncontrolled, worldwide exposure to SCP-9966.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></span> SCP-9966’s anomalous visual properties present the potential for irreversible EK-Class (“Eclipse”) scenario development. Preventative measures must therefore focus on ensuring the elimination of human capacity for visual reception of SCP-9966’s stellar pattern. Protocol-NOCTIS authorizes global dissemination of ophthalmological compounds capable of inducing permanent, irreversible retinal degradation, causing functional blindness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION A:</strong></span> Dissemination Vector<br/>
Distribution of Class-Ω ophthalmological compounds via international food and water supply chains. Secondary dissemination procedures (aerosol agent dispersal, agricultural treatment, and livestock inoculation) are authorized if initial procedures prove insufficient.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION B:</strong></span> Retinal Collapse Induction<br/>
Opthalmological compounds are engineered to chemically degrade retinal tissue beyond repair, resulting in functional blindness within 24–72 hours of ingestion. Projected efficacy is estimated at 92–96% of the global population, with remaining individuals subject to targeted interventions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION C:</strong></span> Civilian Management<br/>
Collapse of civilian infrastructure and population post-NOCTIS is anticipated. The Protocol explicitly deprioritizes preservation of civilian populations, directing any and all available resources toward continuity of Foundation control, containment operations, and maintenance of post-NOCTIS civilian surveillance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION D:</strong></span> Escalation to Eclipse Scenario<br/>
Should NOCTIS dissemination fail to achieve sufficient reduction in SCP-9966 exposure, surviving Foundation personnel are to transition to EK-Class “Eclipse” scenario procedures. Priority is given to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preservation of informational continuity (physical and digital archives, mnemonic redundancy).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance of long-term containment and monitoring capacity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Termination of all efforts to control non-essential civilian populations to prevent further exposure cascades.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> In accordance with O5 directive, all materials and deployment infrastructure necessary for NOCTIS implementation are to be maintained at operational standby. Effectiveness is contingent on immediate initiation at the first sign of global-scale SCP-9966 breach.<span class="fnnum1">.</span><span class="fncon1"><span style="color: #77ddff">"Overkill."</span></span></p>

When data bearing the signature of SCP-9966 is cognized by a sapient entity, the cognitive circuitry of said entity is irreparably damaged. This effect is limited to the Earth's cognitosphere. It is caused by an anomalous form of hadron-cognitron entanglement enabled by the cognitive state induced via SCP-9966 data.</p>

<p>During research attempts into the dissemination vector of the cognitohazard induced by SCP-9966, a breakthrough regarding the mechanisms of sentience was discovered. A quantum field responsible for all sentient processes has been theorized by Foundation neuroscientists before the term "cognitron" was established. Further modelling of this cognitron field implied the existence of high density zones overlapping with zones of high cognitive substrate consumption, later confirmed to be Cognitospheres.</p>
<p>The Cognitosphere is a phenomenon overlapping with any stellar body that bears sapient life and has detectable boundaries that correspond closely to the extent of the planet’s magnetosphere. It manifests as a diffuse field sustained by collective cognitive activity. All sentient organisms within a Cognitosphere draw upon its available cognitive substrate, assumed to be quantized into cognitrons, which function as the enabling resource for sapience, abstract reasoning, and symbolic communication.</p>
<p>Cognitrons are particles that interact with the cognitive circuitry of all sentient entities. Any cognitron processing capability grants the entity limited sentience, with the abundance creating sapient behaviour. When a cognitron comes into contact with a sapient entity's cognitive circuitry, it is consumed. Upon consumption, the stumuli processed by the cognitive circuitry is turned into qualia.</p>
<p>On Earth, Homo Sapiens account for &gt;██% of cognitron consumption. All other higher animals exhibit evidence of partial suppression of their latent cognitive capacities. In the presence of sapient entities (human or otherwise), the majority of available cognitron is monopolized, effectively disabling any ongoing or otherwise parallel development of new sapient species.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiki-tab-0-1" style="display:none">
<p>The following phenomenon, based on the findings of Cognitospherics Research, Parahistory and Astroanomalous Phenomenon Research departments, can be explained through cognitrons and their interactions with sentient and sapient entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The absence of multiple co-sapient species despite evolutionary pressures favoring it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Periods of anomalous cultural acceleration coinciding with theorized fluctuations in cognitron density.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Historical patterns of animals demonstrating transient proto-sapient behaviors under conditions in which the animal is away from hypercognizant entities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sub-rational and dogmatic behaviour patterns of humans who are in regular contact with hypercognizant pluripotent entities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The dissemination vector of most cognitohazards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Existence of related qualia overproduction through multiple hypercognizant entities consuming cognitrons with no challenging hypercognizant entity, creating a feedback loop of the related qualia, escalating to the generation of fringe cognition patterns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The method in which the <span style="color: #1ab41c">ones who reside in woods of mist</span> achieve their anomalous properties.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Non-cognizant entities showing resilience or immunity to most cognitohazardous material, as they barely interact with the cognitive substrate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The method in which SCP-2006 retrieves "information" regarding its goals and the anomalous phenomenon it must demonstrate to achieve them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>[REDACTED PER ORDER OF OVERWATCH COMMAND]</li>

<li>Dementia patients being incapable of processing qualia regarding their memories.</li>

<div id="wiki-tab-0-2" style="display:none">
<p>Cognitrons are particles that enable sentient entities to generate relevant patterns of cognition that can be turned into qualia upon consumption, got it? Qualia are, as you may know, any and all "experience" that can be "experienced". An abundance of cognitrons causes the emergence of sapient entities that consume every cognitron that comes into contact with their nervous system or equivalent processing units. The nervous systems of sapient entities form a cognitive black hole that pulls stray cognitron towards itself. As more sapient entities form, the cognitron flow towards them exponentially escalates forming the cognitosphere of the stellar body. All members of Homo Sapiens, excluding those bearing extreme damage to their nervous system, form this hypothetical cognitive black hole.

The Kelvin-Placeholder Cognitron Densimeter compares the activity in two neural tissue samples obtained from <a href="/scp-1027">SCP-1027</a>. One of the samples is placed inside the glass tube at the operational end of the device. The other sample is placed next to an AMS (Artificial Minimal Sentience) running inside the device.

<p>Farewell From WWS!</p>

<div class="wilson-body">
<p>It was a clear night. The lights went out just for a few seconds. I assumed it was the breaker in the basement and headed down there. The lights were back on before I could reach them. Then I heard a cry from the talkie. Fae said Old Al was having a heart attack. I assumed he got scared because of the lights going out. I rushed out to get there but saw others on the ground outside… More than half of our volunteers were dead. We assumed the worst, one of our critters went unhappy. But it wasn't that. Before I could collect myself to contact the Supervisors, I got a call from a church of some sort. They asked for my help and offered us a ticket in return. They said I should speak nothin' about that call to anybody, so I can't say more. But I learned that the Supervisors who helped us construct WWS into what it is today were total douchebags behind the curtain.</p>
<p>I, Tim Wilson, hereby drop everything to do with the so-called Boring Agreement. This is a unanimous decision from the remaining members of the WWS family. We released the critters. All of them! Even the marine ones are now free in the ocean. This world be their world now. A world of critters, weird or otherwise. Thanks for all the support we got from the community over the years, from the bottom of my heart. We were doing the right thing under the control of the wrong people. I apologize to you for not realizing this sooner.</p>
<p>WWS is leaving town. I cannot say much about how and why, as I promised to the callers. Hope to meet with all of you up there!<br/>

Several island nations experienced full systemic collapse following anomalous pressure from SCP-9966, with entire populations lost to mass exposure events. Within seventy-two hours, Foundation web-crawlers executed global excision protocols, erasing all digital records, satellite imagery, and public documentation of the affected territories. Concurrently, worldwide Class-D amnestic distribution was covertly administered via pharmaceutical supply chains and aerosol dispersal in major transit hubs. Subsequent geopolitical adjustments were framed as long-standing cartographic misconceptions or declassified “Cold War-era territorial disputes”.

After reports of a significant increase in dolphin beachings in Australia, foundation cryptozoologists were tasked to investigate. Several carcasses are found to be an instance of <a href="/scp-3932">SCP-3932-Δ</a>. To date, 27 beached dolphins are confirmed to be SCP-3932-Δ instances, with estimates on the total ranging between 300 and 2000. No additional containment effort was made since deceased instances do not show any anomalous properties. Initially assumed to be the result of an internal conflict, these deaths were later attributed to SCP-9966.

Members of <a href="/fifthist-hub">GoI-555 "The United Southern Fifthist Church"</a> started to convert their meeting location in Midland, Texas into a launch structure during the span of a week, naming this process "The Five-Step Skyward Program". A pamphlet containing interviews with famous members of the program started circulating in North America. Most instances of this publication were destroyed, and the remaining ones in circulation were attributed to a cover story about a viral marketing scheme. In the course of a week, all known members gathered, seemingly awaiting the launch mentioned in the pamphlet. <a href="/scp-4703">These events could not be interrupted due to their actions being perfectly legal.</a><span class="fnnum2">.</span><span class="fncon2">thank you very much</span> On Friday, the building started to collapse inward to reveal mechanisms that folded upon themselves, forming a crude launch tower. On Sunday, a space shuttle emerged from the ground and launched. Foundation satellites tracked the shuttle until it left the atmosphere, where it apparently attained faster-than-light speeds. No further data could be collected. The departure marked the final recorded presence of The United Southern Fifthist Church. No transmissions, sightings, or activity have been intercepted since. The launch was covered up as the testing phase of a passenger space vehicle.

Following standard containment procedures, <a href="/scp-4000">SCP-4000</a> failed to produce its anomalous effects and was declared Neutralized after a hypothesized total collapse of its extradimensional topography. Further analysis showed remaining pathways degraded into non-navigable voids, resulting in the disappearance of all landmarks and entities previously catalogued within the anomaly. Subsequent expeditions confirmed SCP-4000 no longer manifests, with residual thaumaturgic signatures decaying to baseline values. Official Foundation statement designates the phenomenon a "natural terminus event", though internal memoranda suggest deliberate cessation triggered by SCP-9966 correlation remains under investigation.

During a coordinated blackout in New York City, <a href="/unusual-incidents-unit-hub">GoI-102 "F.B.I. Unusual Incidents Unit"</a> attempted an emergency containment measure by deploying a rapid-response “urban canopy” system: a series of military-grade tarps and modular coverings intended to obscure direct visibility of SCP-9966 from street level. The operation collapsed within minutes as high winds shredded the material, anchoring points failed across multiple boroughs, and several segments ignited after contact with live power lines. The partial coverings created irregular dark zones that only accelerated civilian exposure, resulting in ███ fatalities before Foundation MTF Iota-707 agents re-established full artificial light saturation. The tarp fragments were later attributed in the media to a “classified disaster-response drill.” All surviving civilians were treated with amnestics.

<a href="/church-of-the-broken-god-hub">GoI-004-A "The Broken Church"</a> initiated their departure under the guise of a planetary-scale “Final Migration”. Across multiple continents, entire congregations converted themselves and their machineries into modular components before assembling into vast mechanical constructs, some spanning several kilometers in length. These constructs ascended from Earth’s surface under their own propulsion after activating rudimentary optical shielding systems. The ones that could be tracked by Foundation satellites converged into a single lattice in low-earth orbit before accelerating into deep space. This process was not interfered with, and a simple UFO hoax cover story was deemed enough due to the low noticeability of the constructs.

Adherents of <a href="/church-of-the-broken-god-hub">GoI-004-C "Maxwellism"</a> enacted their retreat by activating a prepared network of distributed servers and anomalous data-cores, uploading their consciousnesses into the cyberspace. Over the course of six hours, entire communities entered voluntary neurological shutdown as their consciousnesses were permanently transferred into the digital construct. Attempts to trace their migration revealed only recursive encryption loops and data-mazes designed to repel intrusion. Physical Maxwellist sites were left abandoned, with only inert hardware and ritual graffiti declaring, “The flesh is obsolete. The Circuit endures. We are one.” Following the incident, an unknown group of cyber-vandals uploaded an image of SCP-9966 into the construct. Following this, Foundation web-crawlers successfully entered the construct and found no traces of sapient activity within it.

Early distribution targeted wealthy clients and high-value MC&amp;D partners seeking safe passage under open skies. Within days of deployment, catastrophic failures were reported: the prosthetics either transmitted SCP-9966’s effects with accelerated lethality or catastrophically malfunctioned, causing neural feedback that liquefied ocular and frontal lobe tissue. Entire production lines were abandoned after multiple high-profile fatalities, and Anderson’s remaining infrastructure fragmented under Foundation raids and client reprisals.

Participants were integrated into uncontrolled masses of non-specific tissue. Within hours, every ritual site devolved into an expanding organic sludge, accompanied by seismic disturbances and atmospheric contamination. No survivors were recovered.
<p>Within hours of ritual collapse, MTF Beta-7 "Maz Hatters" was deployed alongside orbital-strike assets to incinerate or vitrify contaminated zones before local authorities could respond.

SCP-2006 exhibits no attempt at communication or performance, instead remaining stationary for extended periods. No anomalous emissions have been recorded beyond its visual appearance; however, containment teams note the entity’s behavior constitutes a complete departure from previously established patterns.

Joint operations have been observed in multiple urban centers, focusing on the distribution of anomalous medical supplies, mass inoculation against cognitohazards, and deployment of improvised protective infrastructure. While MCF assets appear to be acting under humanitarian pretense, intercepted communications suggest direct logistical integration with GOC paramilitary units. The alliance has significantly increased the Coalition’s ability to project force under the guise of relief efforts. Foundation assessment categorizes the partnership as a strategic escalation, with MCD’s recent financial support likely serving as the facilitating factor.

<h2 id="toc26"><span>OPERATION: AD ASTRA</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The United Nations, in partnership with the Global Occult Coalition, the Serpent’s Hand, and the Manna Charitable Foundation, announces the adoption of Operation: Ad Astra, a coordinated international initiative to secure the long-term survival of humanity.</p>
<p>In recent years, Earth has faced increasingly severe and unexplained celestial phenomena. These events, collectively referred to as the "Constellation Crisis", have led scientific, humanitarian, and international organizations to conclude that traditional protective measures will not be enough to safeguard every community on Earth. In response, a coalition of nations, experts, and humanitarian partners has prepared a two-part strategy to ensure humanity’s continuity beyond our planet.</p>
<h3 id="toc27"><span>Phase One: Launch Sites</span></h3>
<p>Participating nations are converting aerospace facilities, shipyards, and industrial complexes into rapid-assembly launch sites. Modular spacecraft will carry people, seed banks, cultural records, and medical supplies into orbit. This fleet will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life Transports:</strong> vessels to carry civilians, families, and essential personnel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuity Carriers:</strong> ships dedicated to preserving archives, seeds, and knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protective Platforms:</strong> orbital stations designed to shield and stabilize transit routes.</li>
</ul>
<p>By spreading launch operations across many regions, the coalition reduces the risk of disruption and ensures wider access to departure opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<h3 id="toc28"><span>Phase Two: Paragateway Initiative</span></h3>
<p>In addition to spacecraft launches, the Serpent’s Hand will employ long-standing expertise in the field of “transit gateways”, passages between Earth and other safe locations. These Ways will be opened in selected urban areas around the world, providing direct access to secure off-world staging grounds.</p>
<p>To ensure safety and order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical and humanitarian staff will be present at every Way to screen and assist travelers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Transit schedules will be coordinated internationally, with priority given to families, vulnerable populations, and essential workers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Security measures will protect these gateways from interference or misuse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc29"><span>Ethical Principles and Fair Access</span></h3>
<p>The United Nations affirms that Operation: Ad Astra is guided by three principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preservation:</strong> safeguarding human life, knowledge, and cultural diversity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fairness:</strong> ensuring that places on transports and at Ways are allocated transparently and not solely by wealth or nationality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compassion:</strong> providing care and dignity to all individuals, including those who may not be able to leave Earth immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, an international ethics council with representatives from all partner organizations and the Manna Charitable Foundation will oversee the selection process and publish regular reports on fairness, safety, and humanitarian standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]</strong></p>
<h3 id="toc30"><span>Looking Forward</span></h3>
<p>Operation: Ad Astra is an unprecedented act of cooperation between governments, humanitarian organizations, and knowledge-keepers from traditions both scientific and cultural. It reflects our shared belief that humanity’s story does not end here, but continues among the stars and across new frontiers.</p>

<p>«BEGIN TRANSCRIPT»</p>
</div>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> This session is in. You’ve read the briefing. Incident-Ω ended with total mortality among exposed personnel within four seconds of visual contact. No ascent attempts. We currently treat SCP-9966 ,under the revised definition, as a lethal cognitohazard on surface observation. As if that wasn’t enough we have GOC and their Ad Astra Project. We need a new plan. Proposals on the table: expand A.R.S.H., expand Iota-707, restructure grid redundancy, special shuttering for urban skylines—</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> We already threw the planet’s net worth at lighting. The sky is bigger. A.R.S.H. can’t scrub naked eyes. You can’t patch a horizon with shutters.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Power resilience first. Triple-redundant grids in the dark zones, balloon arrays for emergency skyglow, magnesium reserve caches. Give Iota-707 more birds and hotter bulbs.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> We tried “more birds.” Every blackout becomes a mass casualty lottery. Weather, sabotage, blackouts, protestors, goats chewing wires, I don’t care. We’re failing at a scale bigger than we can handle.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> The effect profile changed. The compulsion hypothesis is now a corpse. The sky is in kill-on-sight mode. Every minute we argue, the exposure risk graph gets teeth.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> I won’t sign off on global arson as policy. If you want a contingency called “torch the planet,” put it in a sandbox and mark it classified with a skull icon. Pyro saturation is a last-resort fallback.</p>
<p><strong>O5-12:</strong> What about orbital options? Deploy reflective micro-sails, saturate the atmosphere with glare, give the planet a cheap aurora.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Harmann:</strong> You’ll diffract, not erase. Besides, it will be way more difficult to contain a blackout if our equipment is in orbit. We designed staging for a reason. Thresholds, triggers. This is not a thought experiment; it is a ledger of consequences. I’m not suggesting my proposal lightly.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Then we concentrate on behavior, not the sky. Curfew continents. Mandatory shutters. Night-time interior lockdowns. Make “windows” a historical footnote.</p>
<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Logistically impossible and unenforceable at scale. Also, people like breathing air and going outside.</p>
<p><strong>O5-6:</strong> A.R.S.H. buys us deception, not physics. “Don’t look up” isn’t containment when the anomaly is the concept of stars and a clear night.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> We keep dodging the obvious: if eyes are the vector, eyes are the problem.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We are not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> We are. We've been there for years. Harmann’s Proposal.</p>
<p>[A short silence. Papers rustle. Someone exhales sharply.]</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Overruled.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> We are not discussing that. At least not in this chamber without a legal preface and a very long list of exculpatory clauses.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Oh, we are absolutely discussing it. We lost fourteen trained specialists in under five seconds inside a dome with so many layers of redundant lighting measures that it was basically a beacon. The civilian numbers worsen every time a storm crosses a damn coast. Harmann’s Proposal is built for the breach we’re in right now.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> For the record: the document authorizes global dissemination of ophthalmological agents to collapse retinal function. Permanent blindness. Projected efficacy in the mid-90th percentile.</p>
<p><strong>P. Seurrier:</strong> And projected civilian collapse is… also in the mid-90th percentile. We have to be precise about what those numbers mean: they are people. There is no technical euphemism that makes this less a moral decision. If we adopt this, we will be writing policy with the metric being "how many live," not "how many remember."</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Right, instead we should watch yet another island go dark.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Sight is the most fundamental sensor humanity has. You’re proposing we delete it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> I’m proposing we prevent an K-Class scenario in progress. Do you want civilization or species? Pick one. We can rebuild civilization. We cannot rebuild species from a crater.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> I really like how you’re drawing a neat line around global scale genocide because you scribbled “ophthalmological” on the label. Real nice rhetoric. Now show me the contingency so we can debate margins instead of morality.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Harmann:</strong> Nothing about this is neat. It is a choice between an organ and an extinction curve. We built vaults, seed banks, and memetic safes because someone had to make the worst-case plan. Thresholds. Triggers. We didn’t file it on a whim, and if we’re to carry this, I will accept the blame that comes with it. But I will not accept doing nothing while the sky kills people.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Thresholds are already tripped. Multiple cities in the states went dark last week. A.R.S.H. flagged an amateur timelapse that we missed; two thousand dead before sunrise. We are behind the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>O5-12:</strong> How do we maintain post-event control with a blind staff? Our own people?</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Non-visual channels. Haptic, audio, olfactory. Robotics. Tactile UI. We’ve been training for no-light environments since 2007. We scale it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Supply chain? Food and water dissemination is heavy. You need synchronized release across borders without tipping anyone off.</p>
<p><strong>M. Jones:</strong> Pre-positioned vectors exist. Activation orders are drafted but sealed. We can go to execution within four hours of authorization.</p>
<p><strong>P. Seurrier:</strong> You’re compressing the discussion to logistics to avoid the content. This is engineered mass murder if we frame it as only logistics. If we proceed, we owe the public more than silence: we owe palliatives, we owe a plan for care, and we owe a promise that this will be remembered, not as a convenience, but as a failing we must study and atone for.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> It's engineered mass survival. Ethics isn’t a lifeboat if it holes itself to protest the sea.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Don’t be a smartass.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> There’s a middle path. Heavier shutters, curfew, more Iota-707, a public campaign—</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Public campaign? “Hey everyone, please don’t look up at night.” The first person to open their blinds kills their block.</p>
<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> You’re overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Riddle me this, Ten. If a person fell from 20 feet right next to you, what would be your first move?</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Stay on topic.</p>
<p><strong>O5-2:</strong> We’ve run a hundred “middle paths.” The sky keeps winning.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Harmann, state your intent for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Harmann:</strong> My intent is to prevent SCP-9966 from making "outside" lethal to cognition. Everything else follows. The Proposal accepts civilian collapse as certain and still preferable to species erasure. It preserves continuity of knowledge, containment capability, and a core that can rebuild. It is the ugliest plan I have ever written. It is also the only plan that scales against the sky. I am not proud of this, and I am not asking for your applause, only your judgement.</p>
<p><strong>O5-12:</strong> What about the Cognitosphere material? If we blind humanity, we may free cognitron density to non-human vectors. There is no research about this. We may be writing our successors.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> That’s a post-event fact, not a pre-event argument. We don’t get successors if we all stop thinking tonight.</p>
<p><strong>P. Seurrier:</strong> Conditions, then. Safeguards. You blind five billion, you don’t get to forget them. We establish obligations; care, restoration funds, long-term research dedication, and we bind those obligations legally and structurally. If you expect this council to vote for eradication as policy, require the promise of repair in the same breath.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Agreed. Draft them.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> I want thresholds crystal clear. Not a vibe. Numbers. Triggers. If we cross this line, the order is automatic. If we stay below, we keep fighting with light and lies. No room for poetic interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>M. Jones:</strong> Threshold package 9966 exists. Proposed triggers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent grid failure across ≥ 30 Tier-1 cities for ≥ 90 minutes or</li>
<li>Verified kill-agent presentation in ≥ 3 latitudinal bands over 48 hours and</li>
<li>A.R.S.H. compromise events exceeding 10^6 unfiltered exposures in a 24-hour window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cross all three → Execute. Cross any two → O5 emergency vote with 2/3 supermajority.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Add a clause for unattended clear-sky windows over major population centers during peak power demand. We’ve seen cascading failures start there.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Add it as 3b: Forecasted exposure above 10^7 with Iota-707 saturation infeasible per Logistics.</p>
<p><strong>O5-10:</strong> Financial continuity: ring-fence the mnemonic vaults, the code archives, the off-site seed banks. I want guarantees that the continuity clusters have independent life support and hardened comms.</p>
<p><strong>O5-5:</strong> Staff exemptions?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Harmann:</strong> None.<span class="fnnum2">.</span><span class="fncon2"><span style="color: #77ddff">But you didn't care.</span></span>Select enclaves will receive the compounds last, with staging to allow migration into sealed, lightless habitats but once NOCTIS hits, it hits. Partial execution is failure. If we are to choose survival over sight, we will do it with the least hypocrisy we can muster.</p>
<p><strong>P. Seurrier:</strong> I want a human clause. Palliative. You do not get to blind the world and then go home. You stand up for it. Food, water, audio guidance, safe roads, tactile beacons. We owe them care within our deprioritization.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Write it as Section C-2: Post-NOCTIS civilian support limited to life-preserving infrastructure. Beacons, audio triage, distribution nodes. No open-sky operations. No optics.</p>
<p><strong>P. Seurrier:</strong> And an after. If we survive, we fund restorative research until the end of time. Even if it stays theoretical.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It’s added.</p>
<p><strong>O5-4:</strong> Last argument. If we vote this in, there is no going back. We become the organization that blinded a planet.</p>
<p><strong>O5-11:</strong> Or we become a cautionary plaque in a dead archive no one will ever read.</p>
<p><strong>O5-12:</strong> We could try one more cycle. Another month of light saturation, test the orbital sail—</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> We don’t have a month. We don’t have a week. We barely have a day.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> Then commit with eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> Bad joke.</p>
<p><strong>O5-9:</strong> I’ll retire them when we can’t make them anymore.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Enough. Roll the vote. Motion: Adopt PROTOCOL-NOCTIS per 9966-Eclipse package; authorize immediate stand-to; execute upon trigger conditions met or by emergency vote per Switchyard. RAISA to release REDSPARROW and SABLE-LOTUS on greenlight. Iota-707 to transition to pre-NOCTIS posture, emphasizing aerosol and flare reserves. Continuity clusters shift to black-light operations.</p>

<p><strong>M. Jones:</strong> Recorded: 13–0 in favor.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> PROTOCOL-NOCTIS is adopted. Harmann, you will coordinate with Logistics, Medical, and RAISA. Seurrier, you’ll draft the palliative directive and the restorative charter. Iota-707 stands to redline. A.R.S.H. goes to full power. This chamber authorizes pre-positioning at once. We do not hesitate when the line is crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Harmann:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><strong>O5-3:</strong> For the record: We will carry this. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> We already do. Meeting adjourned.</p>

Hello Aris,</p>
<p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, the world as we know it has ended. We lost. We failed. The worst part of it was the fact that we had to.</p>
<p>It is, after all, not normal for humans to exist anywhere other than Earth.</p>
<p>I know that you are holed up in one of the ANTITHINK machines right now. We have explicitly instructed you to not think about it but it doesn’t matter anymore. I doubt you even listened. You have a very limited source of cognitron flux or some other bullshit in there so I will keep it short. You were right about all of it. If you even care, that is. This thing, it didn’t start this way. We knew what it was and I promise you, Norman, we did all we could. Had we succeeded we would be the same people who gazed upon the stars and felt the everpresent grasp of wanderlust; always wishing upon the ascent yet knowing it was always out of our reach.</p>
<p>But we could only delay the Apollo missions so many times.</p>
<p>I would say you should think about something else but I won’t. I can’t say anything without making you think about it. You cannot not think of a pink elephant.</p>
<p>Your choice, Aris. If you still want to know what happened, be my guest. If not, shut the terminal. Maybe your last thoughts will be of something peaceful. Maybe they won’t.</p>
<p>If all else fails, get out, look up, and wake up from this nightmare. Tonight the black moon howls. Only at the blind.</p>

<p><span class="st">DESCRIPTION:</span> SCP-9966 is a cognitively-hostile phenomenon expressed through neutrino-cognitron entanglement.</p>
<p>Any neutrino emission originating external to Earth’s cognitosphere transmits SCP-9966’s data signature. Exposure to this data by a sapient cognitive circuitry results in immediate cognitive termination, resulting in extreme damage to the cognitive circuitry.</p>
<p>Analysis concludes that SCP-9966 targets sapient cognition exclusively. Non-sapient organisms, mechanical systems, and post-ANTITHINK subjects remain unaffected.</p>
<p>All prior containment measures (A.R.S.H. suppression, optical shielding, Protocol NOCTIS) are classified as ineffective. The only functional countermeasure is compulsory ANTITHINK conversion to remove sapience as a valid host state.</p>

<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> Supplies?</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Enough to last you a month. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take any longer than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Agent Morgan pauses. SCP-2000’s ambient lighting dims. The sound of servomotors is recorded.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> There is someone in here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(No personnel are recorded entering the main control room. Internal logs show no authenticated access; system telemetry indicates an immediate boot sequence inconsistent with standard procedures. Command console shows no recorded multi-factor confirmations.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Agent, do not engage until you confirm visual ID. You have orders: do not shoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Agent Morgan draws his firearm. The subject later confirmed to be PoI-006 "Nobody".)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> Identify yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Nobody:</strong> I am Nobody of consequence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Nobody advances toward Agent Morgan.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> Do not take another step!</p>
<p><strong>Nobody:</strong> Or what? You’re gonna shoot me? I don’t think so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(SCP-2000 produces a fully-formed clone of Dr. Norman Aris. The clone expires approximately 5 seconds post-manifestation. This process repeats throughout the exchange.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>Nobody:</strong> I was really hoping you’d bring him here. Shame, really. He had it all figured out until your gang of numbers got in the way.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Nobody:</strong> I admire you guys. You think you're smart. But honestly, I just couldn't get behind your plan of blinding everyone. What really worries me is that you actually thought it would work. I mean, the cyberfreaks at least compiled themselves out their bodies. If only they tried a bit harder on cybersecurity…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Morgan:</strong> That's classified information.</p>
<p><strong>Nobody:</strong> Oh, please, Morgan. Everyone knows Nobody can hack into Foundation archives. I don't know why you didn't follow up on the one-percent, though. There is no need now but I was really hoping you would discover the bodies.</p>

<strong>Aftermath:</strong> Upon collapse of the Pseudo-Riemannian manifold housing SCP-2000, the interior space overlapped with the remains of the Yellowstone National Park. This resulted in a volume of spatial discontinuity approximately 15 km<sup>2</sup>. Exploration into the volume by anomalous means was deemed unfeasible by The Extranormal Physics Department. This result is not consistent with the expected result of a singularity failure within SCP-2000. Under normal conditions the negative space would end up isolated from baseline reality, later recoverable. Investigation regarding the possibility of internal sabotage could not be carried out. MTF Eta-10 operative Agent Morgan is presumed missing in action. Redesignation of SCP-2000 is under review.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PROTOCOL OUTLINE</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></span> Decommission SCP-9966 through induced regression of human sapience, creating a cognitively inert successor population resistant to SCP-9966.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></span> SCP-9966’s neutrino-cognitron entanglement renders all sapient organisms terminally vulnerable. Standard containment has proven insufficient to mitigate global extinction risk. Protocol-ANTITHINK authorizes the deployment of Bold-Kelvin Auto-Reliant Artificial Sapience Cognitive Sink Domes. Colloquially called ANTITHINK machines, these employ a cognitron-drain programme designed to forcibly recess the cognitive capabilities of volunteer sapient entities, generating a population of pseudo-humans that are capable of potential sapience but incapable of actualizing it. This regression creates a low cognitive field, immune to the effects of SCP-9966, theoretically allowing long-term re-emergence of sapience and reformation of an uncontaminated Cognitosphere.<span class="fnnum3">.</span><span class="fncon3"><span style="color: #77ddff">Or, the crows beat us to it.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION A:</strong></span> Subject Induction<br/>
Cognizant entities designated for ANTITHINK inoculation will be secured within the ANTITHINK machine. Once activated, the apparatus will initiate controlled siphoning of the subject’s cognitive capabilities. This process is accelerated for civilians through cognitively taxing stimulus, provided under the guise of leisure activities. To ensure the continuity of Foundation oversight over ANTITHINK inoculation, all stimulus given to Foundation personnel are altered to redact redundant and irrelevant information to reduce cognitive load.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION B:</strong></span> Cognitive Recession<br/>
Over the course of full drainage, the subject will undergo irreversible sapience recession, resulting in a sentient but non-sapient state. These entities designated Homo Sentiens retain baseline biological functionality while existing outside SCP-9966’s lethal cognitohazard parameters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION C:</strong></span> Negative Space Generation<br/>
The collective presence of H. Sentiens induces a large-scale cognitively “blank” substrate. This cognitron-negative environment prevents SCP-9966 from maintaining anomalous resonance, causing the complete dissolution of Earth’s cognitosphere, effectively neutralizing SCP-9966's influence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION D:</strong></span> Evolutionary Continuity<br/>
Foundation models predict that, given sufficient temporal scale, H. Sentiens populations may re-evolve into sapience under post-SCP-9966 conditions. Whether this outcome constitutes true "humanity" is formally deemed irrelevant under Decommission Directive 9966.</p>

<div class="raisa_memo">
<p>Parahistory Department was tasked to find historical records that could correlate with SCP-9966 activity. The following excerpt from an Ortothan dialectical scripture called <em>Litany of the Homesick</em> was provided to the Overseer Council. Note that the Council knew about this document prior to the classification of SCP-9966, further proving their incompetence. If any of you suits are reading this, I will never forgive any of you for stopping me when I tried to leave with the Coalition. When this is all over, I hope my pattern recognition remains strong enough, so that I may maul you to death the next time I see your sorry faces.<span class="fnnum3">.</span><span class="fncon3"><span style="color: #77ddff">I'd like to see her try.</span></span></p>

<p>After listening to Eiv-Hefftat, the elders became responsible. They understood their role. But the misfits and the younglings were at unease. They spoke as such:</p>
<p>"Why do the seeds of energy hate us? Because of someting we did? We didn't disrespect Koru-teusa or their teachings. Why are we to bear such a burden?"</p>
<p><em>Your sorrows are known to Zeyu-leusan, and your minds have a home in the Eitoth for all burdens they carry. The seeds of light and fire are not a vessel for hate. They are a messenger for the Koru.</em></p>
<p>"What message does lunacy hold? Which sane mind would leave the grounds their ancestors trod?"</p>
<p><em>The Koru brought wisdom from the first for it to be known in the second. The Voru senses unity of thought. Communion in the Hytoth is an itch for it.</em></p>
<p>"We have bled and bled a thousand times more for the Koru. You say they grant us protection. Did that protection leave us?"</p>
<p><em>Koru-teusa has unmatched power outside-in but not inside-out. The Void is the spawn-hole of The Voru and hunger is its state. Satiation for it would be the death of what we have and will have. We shall not invite such an appetite to our home.</em></p>
<p>"If the words you speak are the truth and the truth alone, are we to crack our egg and go far and wide?"</p>
<p><em>We shall. And those who come afterwards shall go further. Such is the way of The Second Hytoth.</em></p>

I am Dr. Norman Aris. I worked for the Anomalous Phenomenon Research Department in an organization called The SCP Foundation. If you reached this file, that means you know what that is. You know what we did. You also found a way to understand this which means you are curious at best and shit-out-of-luck at worst.</p>
<p>To whomever this may concern, the contents of the file you attempted to reach entail an end for what was before you. Earth as we built it crumbled before our eyes and we chose to get rid of them. We wanted to create a world in which we saw no evil and it turns out getting rid of your ability to see helps. Up until it doesn’t. You will be better than us. Smarter than us. You will figure out a way to save yourselves before it is too late.</p>
<p>If you need this file to do that, you are already doomed. You already committed heinous acts upon your fellows that caused great pain and suffering. None can forgive that and your doom is going to be watched by those who acted faster than you. You will crumble under those who did the right thing and you deserve it. You deserve every last bit of it. Maybe, like us, you will try to find a way to stay. Maybe it will work. It is, however, only a matter of time until it catches up on you. It will evolve faster than you and it will make sure it gets what it wants.</p>
<p>You will grant your kind a better future. A brighter future. A future where they can stargaze with no fear of the horrors that hide within.</p>
<p>And you will do it without knowing the consequences of swimming against the current.</p>
<p>Secure. Contain. <em>Protect.</em></p>
