<p>SCP-8442 is to be contained within an isolated terminal connected to the Foundation Intranet. Per the containment team’s agreement with the anomaly, any attempt to breach this terminal will cause Ashlyn Hyde's treatment to be reconsidered. Mx. Hyde is monitored to ensure they do not speak publicly about SCP-8442. The subject has requested the following methods of entertainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission to play single player online games - <span style="color: green">approved based on individual request</span></li>
<li>Permission to play two player games with Foundation employees - <span style="color: green">approved based on individual request</span></li>

</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8442 is a sapient digital entity self identified as “Alexander”. SCP-8442 is capable of various feats of cyberpathy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, internet manipulation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>,and technopathy<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. It is capable of communicating through various forms of online communication, although it appears to prefer directly communicating via an unidentified masculine voice alongside dialogue boxes accompanying its onscreen avatar.

<h5 id="toc2"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Addendum 1: Discovery, Origin, and Relevant Information</strong></span></span></h5>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8442’s origin was traced back to a post made on the website <em>creepypastafiles.fandom.com</em> created by civilian Ashlyn Hyde in 2015. It does not appear that SCP-8442 was sapient at the time of its creation.</p>
<p>SCP-8442 was discovered after SCP-8442 itself sent a message to the Foundation via email to the Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department informing its existence and situation. For further information regarding its discovery, see Addendum 2. After its discovery, several social media posts made by Mx. Hyde regarding SCP-8442 were discovered. Footage from home security cameras within Mx. Hyde's home was uncovered and viewed to gain further insight on SCP-8442.</p>
<p>Below contains all relevant documentation relating to the interactions between Mx. Hyde and SCP-8442, as well as the context surrounding said interactions. All information has been placed in order of creation to create a linear timeline of events.</p>

<p>New pinned post, new blog</p>
<p>I'm Ash, 20 yrs old, they/she nb lesbian</p>
<p>If you remember my old blog I ask that you don't use that to give you any info on who I am now. I'm still into GreyXSide, DMD, and obvs cute mascot characters<br/>
pls don't pester me about why I left most of the fandoms I was active in, I'll interact with that content again if I want to</p>
<p>Do fuck off if you only see me as your personal source for true crime info btw!!!! like all the way off because I am not fucking okay with you true crime freaks mooching off of me for your perfect victim story. I'm open about what happened, but I'm a person first and foremost, and I do NOT want that to be forgotten. Might be a bit before I feel comfortable enough to talk any more about it, so this and the next post about it is all you get for now</p>
<p>I will probably disappear periodically because some time offline is gonna be needed to help me get better</p>
<p>Do talk to me about Yuna Tamura from GXS!! I am her self proclaimed biggest fan :3 also really like Aina and Isamu too!! If you send me an ask or dm me about those guys I'll probably reply! Even if it takes a bit<br/>
Please don’t talk to me about Yuna’s near death experience pls it makes me really upset<br/>
But any other Yuna stuff is cool!</p>

<p>Quick post on what happened:<br/>
So I’m open about what happened, as I am lucky to be a victim that gets to speak about my experience. Every other victim wasn’t as lucky as me, and I don’t want to take that for granted. My name is Ash, and I survived an attack from Steven L. Hargrove or “The Seaside Stabber” as he’s being called by some fucking freaks online. It has changed me a lot, and I’m asking for everyone to be patient with me. ALSO can I fucking talk about how fucking stupid of a name that is???? Seaside stabber are you being for real right now? Ah yes I get it the "stabber" cause he stabbed people in seaside, yes how fucking original. how about we call him Steven the life ruiner because that would be FAR more fucking accurate, kay? kay :)</p>
<p>As I said, I’m gonna be disappearing for a bit. Maybe I’ll be more open to discussion when I come back, maybe I’ll share my version of events. But for now, I am not interested in recounting what happened so please don’t ask<br/>
Thank you for your understanding</p>

<p>Hi! I'm thinking I should be more active again…</p>
<p>I'm thinking of opening an rp ask blog for Yuna<br/>
I'm not really interested in continuing the ones I had… but I really think getting in the mindset of a character I like would help me. Really just ignore reality a bit. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thank you all for your feedback! The blog is <span style="color: #1d9bf9">@askmissyuna</span>! I think it will be good for me. I remember I used to rp my old ocs and I always felt so cool, thats why I like doing ask blogs<br/>
too bad most of those guys are going in the cellar,, but like, Melly, Alexander, Kia and most of Dream Land are still cool<br/>
most of /er is going in the gutter tho<br/>
I miss Alex, he was really cool, I might convince myself to find his oc lore stashed somewhere… he's one of the only of my old ocs I can still see myself befriending</p>

<p>The following is the first instance of SCP-8442 in Mx. Hyde’s home. It is to be noted that SCP-8442 appeared on Mx. Hyde's phone and laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/20/2020</p>
<div style="display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px">

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde is laying on their bed with their phone in their hand. They suddenly begin to breath quickly, shoving their phone under a pillow. They flip onto their stomach, burying their face against their mattress, letting out a yell. They remain like this for approximately two minutes.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A muffled voice can be heard.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde turns onto their left side, pulling their phone from under the pillow.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The muffled voice is now clear.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Ash? Ash? Ash! Hiya!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> It's safe to look at your feed again! I've got a surprise for you, too!</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde sits up, turning their phone off. They set it on their bedside table.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> As if things couldn't get —- worse. My therapist already said I was being paranoid by putting cameras inside my own house, what's she going to think now?</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde groans, burying their face in their hands.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> <em>[muffled]</em> I'll have to tell my therapist.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Oh, right! You're probably super freaked out. That sorta slipped my mind. Can you please pick up your phone again?</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde gets off of their bed, walking over to a nearby table. They remove a tall book from the table, and begin to flip through the pages.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Actually, no. I'm being a bit pushy, aren't I? Um, take your time!</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde sits in the middle of their bed, seemingly reading one of the pages. After a few minutes pass, they shut the book, tossing it back on the table, groaning. Mx. Hyde leans over, pulling a laptop from a computer case next to their bed. They begin to type something frantically.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Wait wait wait! You're not hallucinating! Don't call anyone!</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde yells, tossing their laptop gently to the other side of their bed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> What the hell? Hallucinations can try to convince you they're real?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Ash, I promise I'm real! Here, does this convince you?</p>
<p><em>[The lights in the room begin to flicker. An unidentified song begins to play, seemingly being played on Mx. Hyde's laptop.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde glances around the room, then puts their hand over their mouth. They then remain still for a few moments.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> The tab is in my history. <em>[pause]</em> How?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> I'm not sure! But, I really couldn't bear to stay quiet for long. I really thought you might be happy to see me!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> I mean… I did say out of my old OCs, you're one of the only ones I can still stand. I'm just a bit anxious, y'know. I didn't expect to be approached.</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde sighs, running their hand through their hair.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Oooh, yeah… I'm sorry! I didn't really think about that, ehe…</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> Just… why not Yuna? Why didn't I like, get a hand written letter from her or something?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Uh, I don't know! I'm not Yuna, but I still want to help! I care about you, Ash!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> Five years ago me woulda freaked. I thought Alexander- you were like, the coolest character ever. <em>[pause]</em> Well, I thought Oliver was cool. I've deleted every drawing of him I ever made. Along with most of the other slash-er characters. <em>[laughs]</em> It was just some cheap slenderman mansion knock off that didn't even understand the actual appeal to the mansion, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> No comment! I was stand alone, remember?</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> Hardly. It's been a while since I've read your lore. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> <em>[chuckles]</em> Heh… yeah. I didn't really think through how long its been.</p>
<p><em>[The two are both silent for a few moments.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> You mentioned a surprise?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Oh! Right! Check your Tumblr feed now!</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde types something into their computer. They put their hand over their mouth.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> I did a search of all fan art of Yuna and found that you haven't seen this one before!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> It's… it's so pretty. I love the flowers over the wounds. This art is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> I know you've seen art of Yuna healing from her injury… but—</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> Thank you, Alex. That was uh, very nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> You're so welcome! I also blocked the account that made that art that upset you!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> It's not really worth blocking every person that creates upsetting content. <em>[pause]</em> I guess it's true that one was uh.. particularly bad.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> So don't block all content that upsets you?</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> I— I don't know. <em>[pause]</em> It would be easier but… <em>[trails off]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Hm.. Uh, okay? <em>[pause]</em> Should I leave you alone for now?</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> Yeah… I need some time to think.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Okie dokie, Ash. If you need me, I'll be here. I'm gonna try to help you get better!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> <em>[nods]</em> Alright. Uh Alex, why are you helping me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Because that's why I'm here! I was born one day to the internet, and I knew that's what I was meant to do, you know? I care about you!</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> Ah, I see. <em>[smile]</em> Uh, see you, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> I'll see you later!</p>
<p><em>[Mx. Hyde's smile fades. They closs their laptop, falling onto their back. They sigh loudly.]</em></p>

<p>A drawing of my old OC Alexander! He's like the one creepypasta OC I'm still comfortable with,, I'm surprised I wasn't a fan of GXS when I made him cause he reminds me of all the Venge Girls but Yuna specifically</p>
<p>Here's the basics about Alex:</p>
<p>he/they/it, 18 yr old masc guy, killed by a serial killer, so his consciousness revived online and he had technopathy and stuff and was able to manipulate the internet and technology and did this to take out other killers<br/>
I specifically did not have him interact with other creepypasta characters cause even at the time I thought it was cheap and god im glad I didnt go with that it wouldve been so tacky</p>

<p>Successfully went through the GXS tag without finding anything upsetting… yayyyyy<br/>
Not like that happens that often cause like people be goddamn insane<br/>
you'd be surprised the amount of Yuna "fans" that are perfectly fine talking about what happened to her so openly</p>
<p>I wish I could still interact with creepypasta but that’s a panic attack waiting to happen<br/>

<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> It's just— everything.</p>

<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> There's nothing you can do to make any others come to life, huh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> You didn't design me with that capability! I'm only able to do what I was designed to do, remember?</p>
<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> It was worth a shot. I mean, I still got really lucky with you being the OC that came to life.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> Yipee! <em>[pause]</em> I've been trying to make your social media feed more bearable. I know it's been hard for you. You still said not to censor everything, so I haven't!</p>

<p><strong>Mx. Hyde:</strong> You think so?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8442:</strong> I know so!</p>
<p><em>[The two are silent for a few moments.]</em></p>

<p>Why. How could ANYONE think this is fine? Why don’t you all see this like I do? Why do I have to see it this way? What’s funny about this? I don't fucking understand. If I have to suffer you all should too. I shouldn't be the only one sent into PANICK ATTACKS AND FLASHBACKS when I see shit that's supposed to be FICTIONAL. I swear to god people who make content making fun of character trauma are literal psychopaths, like you lack any degree of basic human empathy. I don’t give a shit if it’s not so real to you but have some goddamn empathy you sadistic sack of shit god I swear</p>

<p>Might go to the bookstore soon! I've heard that the new GXS side story released in English in stores recently, I haven't read it yet, I couldn’t find it online, haven't seen any spoilers either<br/>
idk if this is too personal but I haven't exactly left my house in a while (yes those instacart fees are killing me lol) but I've just been very afraid, but I've been feeling much better lately<br/>
to those who say pretending fictional characters are real is a bad coping mechanism, uh L yeah because its been doing wonders for me</p>

<p>I talked with my therapist about how I've kinda like, been just avoiding things. She thinks that I need to start slowly exposing myself to content in a safe environment so that when I come across it on accident it doesn't like. cause me to have flashbacks or panic attacks. Cause part of the problem is I went through periods of seeing nothing so that when I started to see it again it hit me like a truck.<br/>
It's been really rough, but I think its been kinda alright to start finally letting myself see that I'm safe, and I'm not gonna get hurt again which has been so hard because realistically I know right I know the likely hood of that happening to me again is very low. but the memories hurt me so much they cause me so much pain that it can be hard to remember that<br/>
but at least I'm finally listening to my therapist I'm trying to get better and that has to count for something</p>

<p>I wish getting better was as easy as wanting to. For a while, I didn't want to. I just wanted other people to suffer, too, so they knew how I felt. And sometimes I still do. Sometimes people just make it so fucking hard because they don't understand, they don't get that they shit they say or make is triggering to me and god I just wish they knew, yknow? damn.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for any hateful posts I may have made, my life has just been irreversibly affected by the traumatic even I went through yknow. Its jaded me, its made me meaner, its made me an asshole. and this isn't gonna remedy quickly, I'm probably gonna continue to be this way for a while. But I'm doing my best. I'm not gonna be the person I was, but at least I can allow myself to heal without ignoring reality. Because it's been very unhealthy the way I've just allowed fiction to feel more real to me than reality, and I'll still never look at GXS the same as someone who hasn't been through what I've been through. But idk y'know?</p>
<p>I've done a lot of self reflection</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The following is the message sent by SCP-8442 to the Foundation:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Hello there! My name is Alexander! I am a digital entity that was born from a character 20 year old Ashlyn Hyde, from Seaside, Oregon, created! In my time being alive, I have discovered that the internet is full of other strange beings that it appears you would classify as an anomaly! I believe that it might be safest for me to alert you of myself, as there appear to be several organizations surrounding the anomalous that could be potentially harmful and use an all knowing entity such as myself for bad, or could use Ash's knowledge of me against them. Your motives appeal to me the most, so I decided to turn myself into you! I find myself able to interact with content you have created, but I have no need to do so, so I will not do so any more. But through looking through a few of your files when I was first trying to decide if I wanted to turn myself in, I picked up on a couple of things. You also appear to be capable of erasing the memories.</p>
<p>For my cooperation, I ask one thing in return: you do not erase Ash's memory. Through my mistakes, I realized an important lesson, that Ash has learned too, and if their memory is erased, I will simply do everything again because I want them to be happy, and I refuse to let them suffer again. I also think by spending my time monitored, it will encourage me to not communicate with Ash again. I never intended to in the first place, but it does help to find something else to occupy my time with! And if I can help you guys by making you feel more sure that one more anomaly is away from the public, then that satisfies me! (Although, I am going to want some games to play either solo or with one of you, I'll talk to you about my requests for entertainment later!)</p>
<p>Before I decided to part ways with Ash, I told them not to tell anyone about me, and I truly do not think that they will! If they do, I can help you track down whoever they told so you can erase their memory! I can delete the messages if it is through message, too! Ash is a good person, and I believe they will keep their word, though, so we won't need to worry! As long as you do not erase Ash's memory, I will do whatever you need me to do!</p>
<p>Do we have a deal? You don't have to reply to this email, by the way! Just call for me, and I'll appear to talk!</p>
<p>- Alexander</p>

<p>SCP-8442 containment head Dr. Xavier Clark interviewed SCP-8442 upon its discovery. The following is a summary of the conversation and conclusion reached by Dr. Clark.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>SCP-8442 is a highly complex digital entity capable of bending the internet to its will. Fortunately, it does not appear to have any desire to use the abilities. It has clearly stated its terms and conditions in the initial message it sent to the Foundation. Currently, we have no solid way to ensure that SCP-8442 remains in containment, and there is much we do not know regarding its capabilities. Though SCP-8442 has surpassed all known Foundation antivirus and firewall software, it seems unaware of the threat it poses. It is also currently unknown if SCP-8442 can occupy more than one set of terminals at once, or how it interacts with computerized interfaces. It has been decided that the best course of action is to accept SCP-8442's terms. Because of SCP-8442’s unprecedented levels of cyberpathy and manipulation of Foundation security protocols, it has been decided by the Ethics Committee and myself that the risk of compliance with its demands are far too great. The properties SCP-8442 possesses could also be instrumental in developing new technology to protect Foundation interests as well. If we can study how it is bypassing our security, not only can we build around those faults, but we can also wield that information against other anomalies and hostile threats.</em></p>
<p><em>- Dr. Xavier Clark, Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department</em></p>
</div>
<p>The previous message was written shortly after SCP-8442's containment. Now that approximately four months have passed, a new statement has been made:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>In the months since SCP-8442 has been in containment, The Foundation has kept an eye on Mx. Hyde via the cameras in their home and mics hidden within their therapists office. Mx. Hyde has since deleted any posts related to SCP-8442 and has not mentioned it once either online, offline, or verbally. To date, they appear to have upheld their promise with SCP-8442. We will continue to monitor Mx. Hyde to ensure their continued cooperation.</em></p>
