<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-6443 are to be kept together in a canine containment unit. All assigned personnel must be amiable to canines and must have scored an 8.0 or higher on the Animal Empathy Test.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Assigned personnel must feed and give water to all instances of SCP-6443 twice a day, bathe them once a week, and spend a total of 120 minutes or more engaging in enriching and physically enriching "play" every day. Personnel assigned to these duties are to be given devices that will play an audio file containing a voice speaking the sentence “Remember to feed SCP-6443” every ten minutes, with the message varying depending on the personnel’s assigned duty. These devices are not to be removed from the personnel’s possession and may only be powered off by senior staff once the assigned task has been successfully completed. The devices will automatically turn back on at the beginning of the personnel’s shift and at other periods when they need to provide care again. All personnel must indicate the date and time they fulfilled their duty on the care record attached to this file.</p>
<p>Automated feeders were suggested, but rejected by the head researcher Dr. Merkel on the grounds that SCP-6443 instances would benefit from the human interaction provided by manual feeding from the researchers.</p>
<p>Should instances of SCP-6443 exhibit signs of dehydration or malnourishment, all available personnel are to provide food and water immediately. No personnel are to exit the facility until this task has been carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6443 instances are quadrupedal species bearing resemblance to the Canis lupus dingo, commonly referred to as dingos. All known instances of SCP-6443 have dark brown and black speckled fur covering their backside and tail, with white fur over their stomachs.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-6443 display antimemetic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> properties causing their caretakers to forget to take care of them. This includes forgetting to feed, give water to, bathe, or show affection for SCP-6443. Currently, 13 instances of SCP-6443 have been contained. Their antimemetic properties do not affect their visibility to the human eye or knowledge of their existence; these properties only affect actions taken to care for them.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Discovery Log</p>
<p>On 11/12/2016, the Foundation was alerted by field agents stationed in Adelaide, Australia of a previously undiscovered species of canine which was dying in mass upon being domesticated.</p>
<p>Pereginus Animals, a company known for the trade of exotic animals, had discovered SCP-6443 instances in the wilderness. The group killed the parents and captured all other instances of SCP-6443. Documents procured from a nearby office of Pereginus Animals detail that the company had focused on capturing every instance of SCP-6443 they could find to avoid other similar companies taking the opportunity. SCP-6443 was stated to be an extraordinarily rare find due to the rarity of new species of canine being discovered in recent time as well as the rarity of canine species native to Australia. Many breeding companies and collectors had already shown interest in buying instances of SCP-6443, and many of these requests had been fulfilled at the time of Foundation discovery. No indication that the company understood the antimemetic effects of SCP-6443 or the species' anomalous nature has been found.</p>
<p>Foundation agents tasked with containing instances of SCP-6443 tracked their location using documents procured from the Pereginus Animals company. SCP-6443 instances were found within multiple buildings owned by the company and within the homes of wealthy citizens. A collective 139 instances of SCP-6443 were found, 126 of which were deceased, to the distress of many families and individuals. Foundation personnel removed all instances of SCP-6443 and delivered them to Site-124 for containment.</p>
<p>All individuals with knowledge of SCP-6443 were amnesticized and all documentation of SCP-6443 was destroyed, with all financial transactions being reversed.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Incident Report 11/13/2016</p>
<p>As of 8:00 PM on 11/13/2016, all research staff assigned to SCP-6443 failed to fulfill their duties to care for SCP-6443. The following is an audio and video log of an interview conducted with Junior Researcher McMannus, one of many Junior Researchers assigned to SCP-6443.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interview Log 6443.01</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Junior Researcher McMannus</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Benside</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 08:13 PM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Please state your name and position.</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Jack McMannus, assigned to SCP-6443. What did you need?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Please allow me to ask the questions, McMannus.</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Sorry, sir, but I’m here past the end of my shift. I was supposed to leave at eight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Are you new here?</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Yep, SCP-6443 is my first assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> I see. You will soon learn to speak in a more professional manner when involved in an interview with senior staff. Staying a bit late after your shift will likely be one of the easiest annoyances you will need to deal with. Onto the topic at hand - you are currently assigned to providing SCP-6443 with food, correct?</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Um, sorry. Yes, that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> And despite this, SCP-6443 has not been fed once today. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Well, pretty much all day, I’ve been going to give SCP-6443 their food, but every time I go to do it, I always find myself doing something else, and here we are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> I see. Looking at the disciplinary logs, it seems you’ve received multiple warnings for failure to fulfill your duty, and despite this, you have still not completed the task.</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> You don’t seem concerned. Were you planning to leave today still having not fed SCP-6443?</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> Oh God, you’re right, I completely forgot I still have to do it! I’ll take care of that once we’re done with our interview.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Understood. Please understand that failing to complete your assigned duty will cause a disciplinary infraction to be added to your personnel file.</p>
<p><strong>McMannus:</strong> U-understood.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Junior Researcher McMannus left the office soon after the interview was conducted. SCP-6443 was not fed, and McMannus has been likewise disciplined and removed from their assignment to SCP-6443.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Incident Report 11/14/2016</p>
<p>As of 6:00 AM on 11/14/2016, of the thirteen living instances of SCP-6443, seven were found deceased due to malnutrition. The remaining six are malnourished and near death, as well as in an extreme state of distress. The following is an audio and video log of an interview conducted by Dr. Benside with Dr. Merkel, a senior researcher assigned to SCP-6443.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interview Log 6443.02</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Merkel</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Benside</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 09:00 AM&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Please state your name and position.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> Oliver Merkel, researcher with level 4 clearance. I am currently assigned to the research and caretaking of SCP-6443 due to my animal aptitude test score of 10.0 and my experience with canines.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> What exactly happened here, Dr. Merkel?</p>
<p>[Dr. Merkel appears visibly dejected]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> I’m not exactly sure. I have been granted a large number of staff to study and take care of SCP-6443, including multiple junior researchers. Each staff member was assigned to particular duties relating to SCP-6443, but not a single one has been done. Few of my staff had a notable record of disciplinary actions before they were assigned to SCP-6443, and none of them seem particularly lazy, and yet, I consistently found them doing something besides their assignment throughout the day yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Hence the disciplinary action report?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> Yes! Every single person working on SCP-6443 was eventually dismissed from duty for the day. At one point, I took it upon myself to take care of SCP-6443, but before I knew it, my shift was over, and I needed to get home to get ready to go see my son’s basketball game. I didn’t realize that the instances of SCP-6443 hadn’t been given any care all day until today. They haven’t been taken care of at all since we contained them!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> And have the remaining instances been taken care of today?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> Oh, shit!</p>
<p>[Dr. Merkel runs out of the room.]</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. Merkel Concerns</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is Junior Researcher Calvin, currently assigned to research on SCP-██████. For the past three hours, Dr. Merkel, assigned to SCP-6443, has been continuously running back and forth between the lounge and SCP-6443’s containment cell while panicking. I attempted to stop him to see what is wrong, but he refused to listen to me, saying he needed to take care of SCP-6443 immediately. I don’t understand what is going on, but this behavior is very concerning.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>

<p><strong>Addendum 5:</strong> Incident Report 11/16/2016</p>
<p>As of 7:00 AM on 11/16/2016, of the six remaining instances of SCP-6443, four were found deceased due to malnutrition. The position of the corpses seems to imply that they were engaging in close contact before death, possibly for comfort. The two living instances were seen lying in front of Dr. Merkel, facing him and whimpering. Both showed signs of extreme malnutrition. Dr. Merkel was asked to leave to conduct an interview regarding the incident. The remaining instances of SCP-6443 whined loudly as Dr. Merkel closed the door to their containment chamber.</p>
<p>The following is an audio and video log of an interview conducted by Dr. Benside with Dr. Merkel.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Dr. Merkel, as I understand you were assigned to SCP-6443. Please explain the events that led up to all but two instances of SCP-6443 being deceased.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> P-please, doctor, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Dr. Merkel, when is the last time you slept?</p>
<p>[Dr. Merkel does not respond. His legs shake.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Doctor, this is very unprofessional behavior. Please answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> S-sorry. Um, maybe, the thirteenth?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Benside:</strong> Dr. Merkel, you’re saying you have not slept for two straight days?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> I need to go f-feed SCP-6443.</p>
<p>[Dr. Merkel rises from his seat and immediately collapses.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Merkel:</strong> S-SCP-6443, I have to f-feed the dogs, I have to, I have to, f-feed, feed my dogs!</p>
<p>[Dr. Benside stands and walks to Dr. Merkel, squatting next to him. Dr. Merkel lays on his stomach and pulls himself towards the door while panting loudly. His body shakes.]</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6:</strong> Incident Report 11/16/2016-2</p>
<p>As of 9:00 AM on 11/16/2016, the two remaining instances of SCP-6443 were declared deceased due to malnutrition. All junior and senior staff assigned to SCP-6443 have been relocated with no disciplinary actions, except Dr. Merkel, who has voluntarily resigned from his position and been properly amnesticized. The object class of SCP-6443 has been updated to “Neutralized” to reflect the recent change.</p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6443</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-6443 are to be kept together in a furnished canine containment unit. This containment unit includes a fenced-in outdoor area that the canines have constant access to. Dr. Merkel is to oversee the caretaking of SCP-6443, and his living quarters are to be directly connected to SCP-6443’s containment chamber to facilitate constant care and monitoring of SCP-6443.</p>
<p>Dr. Merkel may choose to request other personnel to aid in caring for SCP-6443. If needed, these personnel must be amiable to canines and must have scored an 8.0 or higher on the Animal Empathy Test.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6443 is a species of canine with antimemetic properties causing their caretakers to forget to care for them. This includes forgetting to feed, give water to, bathe, or show affection for SCP-6443. Mnestics<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> have been used to successfully counteract this effect. The two remaining instances will be referred to as SCP-6443-1 and SCP-6443-2.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Incident Report 11/16/2016-3</p>
<p>Following the events outlined in Incident Report 11/16/2016, the remaining two instances of SCP-6443 were fed by Dr. Benside, a researcher assigned to the Antimemetics Division with training to resist antimemetic effects. They were then relocated to Site-41 for care by members of the Antimemetics Division.</p>
<p>After being administered mnestics, Dr. Merkel, now assigned to the Antimemetics Division, has been able to effectively care for instances of SCP-6443. Dr. Merkel’s primary and only duty will be to care for and report on the health of SCP-6443 until he reports that they are both restored to a sufficiently healthy state.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Log of Care for SCP-6443 (From Dr. Merkel)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/16/2016</strong> - Instances of SCP-6443 have been properly fed, bathed, and provided with a clean and well-furnished containment chamber. I took it upon myself to spend time with SCP-6443 to provide them comfort, however, I fell asleep soon after sitting down in their containment chamber.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/17/2016</strong> - I awoke in SCP-6443’s chamber to find both canines lying beside me. I chose to continue lying there so as to not disturb them. Within an hour, both instances awoke and walked around their containment chamber, sniffing the blankets, toys, and bowls. They are still getting used to the new living space.<br/>
I then provided both of the canines with their breakfast. They did not eat at first, but once I sat down next to them, they slowly consumed their food. I am giving them three small meals a day rather than one or two large meals to help them adjust to a healthier diet than, well, being starved. Both canines frequently drank from their water bowl. They are looking better already, but this process will be slow.</p>
<p>Neither seem to be afraid of me or otherwise adverse to my presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/20/2016</strong> - The instances of SCP-6443 no longer hesitate to eat their food, and they both appear to be properly nourished. In addition, they have begun to show signs of excitement and playfulness, occasionally wagging their tails and jogging around their containment chamber. Neither is running yet, but they are improving.</p>
<p>I have named the female, SCP-6443-1, Paige and the male, SCP-6443-2, Teddy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/24/2016</strong> - Paige and Teddy have shown great signs of improvement in health and energy. Both canines are now eating regularly, getting excited for meals, playing with their toys and each other, and frequently running around their containment chamber. With the use of training and treats, they have learned to go to the bathroom outside.</p>
<p>I have taken them both on a walk outside of their containment chamber, with their leashes secured around my waist to prevent them from running. Both showed hesitation to walk any further than a few dozen feet from the door, and both reacted with fear when seeing other personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11/28/2016</strong> - I have taken Paige and Teddy on a walk outside of Site-41. They enjoyed the open air, frequently pulling on the leashes as they walked around the forested area. In addition, they have become comfortable with the other staff assigned to their care, and only show minor fear of other personnel.</p>
<p>As of 11/28/2016, I believe I can comfortably declare both instances of SCP-6443 to be restored to a healthy condition. I will continue to monitor both regardless, but any immediate risk of death has been negated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> Video Log 11/29/2016</p>
<p>The following is a transcription from a video log recorded to confirm Dr. Merkel’s statement on SCP-6443’s health. Choice hours were included to help demonstrate the health of SCP-6443.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>0600:</strong> Dr. Merkel lays in his bed. The blankets are pulled up to his chest. SCP-6443-1, hereby referred to as “Paige,” lays on a dog bed nearby. SCP-6443-2, hereby referred to as “Teddy,” lays on Dr. Merkel’s bed with its back against Merkel’s side.</p>
<p><strong>0630:</strong> Paige wakes up, scratches its head, and walks over to Dr. Merkel’s bed, wagging its tail while staring at the doctor. Teddy lifts its head and also wags its tail, making a thumping sound as it hits the bed. Dr. Merkel slowly opens his eyes as Paige licks his face. He smiles and quickly reaches to his nightstand, grabbing a pill bottle and swallowing a hexagon-shaped pill with a glass of water sitting by his bed.</p>
<p><strong>0632:</strong> Dr. Merkel gets out of bed, quickly followed by Teddy, and he briefly pets both. The instances follow behind him as he walks to the canines’ food bowls, then fills them with a measuring cup, giving both a cup and a half of food, carefully measured. Neither canine eats anything until he adds a spoonful of peanut butter, mixed with vitamin powder. The doctor walks away as the canines eat, sitting at his desk and turning on his computer.</p>
<p><strong>0645:</strong> The canines briefly use the bathroom, using a swinging dog door provided on the door leading to the fenced-in area. They return shortly after, both standing next to Dr. Merkel as he sits at his desk. Both stare at Dr. Merkel expectantly, wagging their tails. He reaches a hand down and pets both, typing with the other hand. Teddy whines, then lifts its paw up to the computer tower and presses the power button. Dr. Merkel stares in disbelief as the computer powers off, then laughs, further exciting the canines.</p>
<p><strong>0650:</strong> Dr. Merkel stands outside in the fenced-in area, throwing a frisbee for Paige and Teddy. The canines both eagerly chase after it every time, attempting to grab it before the other. Dr. Merkel pretends to throw it multiple times, with the canines never falling for the trick. After pretending to throw the frisbee for the fifth time, Teddy jumps into the air and grabs the frisbee, running around the fenced-in area as Dr. Merkel chases him.</p>
<p><strong>0803:</strong> Dr. Merkel sits on his couch, playing a podcast out loud from his phone on the coffee table. Paige lays with its paws on Dr. Merkel’s lap, licking Dr. Merkel’s cheek as the doctor cranes his neck in the opposite direction. Paige eventually lays its head on his lap, after which Merkel begins to pet it. Immediately, Paige’s tail starts wagging, and she starts licking Dr. Merkel’s face once again. Dr. Merkel laughs, tilting his head away as Teddy jumps on the couch and begins to lick Dr. Merkel as well, overwhelming the doctor as he chuckles, petting both at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>0931:</strong> Dr. Merkel re-enters the containment chamber after briefly leaving to use the bathroom. Upon the sound of the door opening, both canines jump up and run to it, wagging their tails. He quickly closes the door behind him as both instances jump on him. Dr. Merkel laughs, kneeling down and petting the canines as they lick his face.</p>
<p><strong>1014:</strong> Dr. Merkel sits in his bed, his back upright against the headrest. Paige lays at the foot of the bed while Teddy lays with his back to Dr. Merkel. Dr. Merkel quietly pets Teddy as he reads.</p>
