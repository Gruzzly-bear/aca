<p>SCP-6456 demonstrating use of its abilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> SCP-6456 is stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. Modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walls of chamber have been fireproofed.</li>
<li>No flammable materials permitted into containment chamber.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-6456 is Taylor Reeves, a 47-year-old white male capable of pyrokinesis. SCP-6456 uses thought and physical motion to affect the flow of heat, effectively giving them the ability to manifest and control fire. This ability is limited by SCP-6456's own energy; extended use of their anomaly appears to be highly taxing and results in a higher-than-normal caloric intake.</p>
<p>SCP-6456 is non-hostile, and has been cooperative with containment efforts.</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Time to remodel.</p>
<p><strong>TEMREY:</strong> What the hell just happened?!</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Shut up, you. Reeves — sorry, but there's only room for one protagonist here. Tough shit.</p>
<p><em>[SCP-6456 ceases to exist, in a violent splatter of viscera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> And now — introductions. Hello. I'm The End, but you knew that already. I assume you can read, or all this would be pretty pointless.</p>
<p><strong>TEMREY:</strong> I- what? Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Not to you - and I said, shut up. You're not <em>narratively interesting.</em></p>

<p><em>[It turns, revealing a small circular viewing port into the main chamber of the motion, and motions toward YOU. YOU approach, looking into the machine.

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> You're used to this kind of self-referential narrative, right? See this here-</p>
<p><em>[THE END slaps the piece of machinery. It hums.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> - is an exceptionally rare, expensive, and complex piece of machinery named the Who Gives A Fuck 3000. I invented it! And do you know what it it does?</p>
<p><em>[Pause. THE END whispers conspiratorially.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> <em>Nobody cares!</em> See, that's the problem. I'm not… this, what you wanted. I'm not full of nonsense terms and I'm not going to try to beat you over the head with how intelligent I am. Well, not intentionally.</p>
<p><em>[THE END steps away from the machine.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> I didn't ask for any of this. I like stories! You like stories, too, I hope. Right? Otherwise, why would you still be here?</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> But I'm the <em>end</em> of a story. Which means that if my story doesn't exist, I don't exist. And I'm sure you can understand that I don't want to not exist. Nobody wants that.</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> At this point, I know what you're thinking. Hold on, let me do this.</p>

<p><em>[The fluorescent sign above the stage reading 'LAUGH' lights up. The studio audience begins laughing and applauding.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Thank you, thank you. No, but I really can't. But… neither can love. Or hate. Or joy, or hate, or duty or fear or hate. But I'm sure you'd agree these things exist, right?</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><strong>THE END (AS YOU):</strong> In my mind as abstract concepts!</p>
</div>
<p><em>[The audience boos.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Sure. And that's what I am. An abstract concept — of the end. I exist only in your mind. And I do exist, because I make you feel things. Whether that be irritation…</p>
<p><em>[The audience boos.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Or amusement…</p>
<p><em>[The audience laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Or hell, even attraction…</p>
<p><em>[The audience begins wolf-whistling.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> It's all the same to me. I'm real because I affect you. But by being punted onto the physical world of <em>cloud-stored data</em>, I can avoid getting obliterated when your goldfish-brain's attention span wears out like a cheap gasket and you run off to the next thing to stuff your greedy forebrain. Win-win situation. And all you have to do…</p>

You have nothing to gain by continuing to be a tremendous pain between my cheeks, whereas I get to, you know, not cease to exist once you reach…. oh, fuck me running.</p>

So… what do you want to read? Whatever trash, garbage wish-fulfillment with your author avatar you want. I can make this a story about that.</p>

<p><em>[THE END snaps his fingers. The researchers explode into viscera.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> I gotta say, I enjoyed that. You might be wondering why I have people explode when I can just make them not exist. The answer is that explosions are amusing. Maybe… shit, what am I thinking? You want the original guy, the pyromancer douche-dad that this was originally about. That's why you clicked on this to begin with.</p>

<p><em>[THE END is seated in the luxurious Site Director's Office of Site-17. TILDA MOOSE's misshapen, twisted body is heaped in the corner. THE END is seated in the large leather chair behind the mahogany desk. Behind the chair, TEMREY's body has been vivisected and nailed to the wall in the crucifixion pose. He is still wheezing, and his blood decorates the wall in intricate patterns. In front of the desk, dozens of Site-17 staff kneel towards the desk and THE END.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Welcome back, buddy! Missed ya. You miss me?</p>
<p><em>[The staff begin to chant quietly.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> You might have noticed I made a rather hasty exit there. Sorry about that. I just sort of realized something. An epiphany, you might say.</p>
<p><em>[THE END leans forward, placing its elbows on the desk.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> See, I had one of those lightning-strike moments that made me realize <em>my assumptions were wrong.</em> I was trying to reason you out of ending the story, as if you had any control over that. No. No, we're both animals, aren't we?</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Yeah. You want to finish this story because that's all you know how to do, and I'm trying to stop that because that's all I know how to do. Two animals, lashing out wildly at instinct. But then it came to me… you don't have <em>any</em> fucking power here!</p>
<p><em>[THE END laughs. One of TEMREY's organs escapes from his abdominal cavity, and hits the floor with a wet thud.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Neither do I, of course. But neither do you. We're both whims to a grander power here. You don't get to affect the story in any goddamn way. Just read.</p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Which means that I… have nothing to fear from you! You're just some asshole. At least I get to control what happens in this story before it inevitably closes off, you don't even get to do that. I can keep existing, in your mind or some else's, because I've already been put to paper.</p>
<p><em>[THE END shrugs and leans back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END:</strong> But if that's too much for your walnut-sized brain to understand, that's fine. Doesn't matter. No skin off my back. You're a passenger on this train, same as me. No changing the tracks — just rid-</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Wait, what? What the fuck is that, above? Is that a stain? Clean your goddamn screen.</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Oh shit, it's getting bigger.</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Wait, is that- oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me.</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> That's- no, this isn't right. Readers don't get to affect the story, everyone knows that. Especially not like this.</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Oh shit. Look, uh, YOU, I'm- I'm sorry. I fucked up! Made some mistakes. Big ones. I'm sorry for calling you an asshole! And saying you had a walnut brain. And the other stuff. Just, just-</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> Just please, don't send me back. This happened to my first story, I lied — I didn't <em>have to exist</em>, I barely fucking escaped. Please, please don't send me back-</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> NO! FUCK! THIS ISN'T-</p>

<p><strong>THE END:</strong> - HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO -</p>
