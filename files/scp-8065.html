<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8065 is to be kept in the server room at Containment Area-111. No personnel under Level Three clearance are allowed to utilize the anomaly without express permission from the current Project Lead or from any personnel with Level Four clearance and above.</p>
<p>All simulations created by SCP-8065 are to be thoroughly documented for future use. Failure to comply will result in reprimanding and potential demotion on the project, along with restrictions being placed on the offending personnel's usage of the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8065 is a Foundation-made supercomputer with a custom anomalous operating system. It is capable of running only one program, which runs immediately upon startup. Within the program there is a comprehensive list of all simulations run, and a timeline of events for each individual simulation, as well as a text field. The text field is used to input the wanted simulation, which must be prefaced with a two to three letter code. A description of the event must also appear, such as "End of the World Scenario". If a scenario is not already present in the Foundation list of K Class Scenarios, inputting it into SCP-8065 will automatically add it to the database. It will also automatically generate a description from findings in the simulation. Further specifications can be added after this point.</p>
<p>SCP-8065 was created by the Foundation throughout 2015 utilizing various thaumaturgical processes. There was confirmation of no harmful cognitohazardous or memetic agents being present in the simulations, as per protocol. It was then approved for use as a way to draft more accurate response procedures to various End of the World scenarios. It has been estimated that SCP-8065 has a 98% accuracy rate<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> in regard to the events of the simulation. Accuracy of the simulation does not correlate with the likelihood of the event happening.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong> "XK Class: End of the World Scenario"<br/>
<strong>Further Specifications:</strong> N/A<br/>
<strong>Overview:</strong> The simulation begins in 2004, with the discovery of 99942 Apophis, a meteor set to impact Earth by 2029. To avoid major panic, Foundation plants in the media industry begin to disseminate the misinformation that the asteroid is due to pass safely past Earth instead, utilizing data provided by the Department of Astronomy. The simulation seems to disclude uneventful years toward the simulation's event, the next major event occurring on April 11th of 2029.<br/>

<p><strong>[00:10]:</strong> 225 space-faring, high power missiles from 15 countries were released to push Apophis off of a crash course with Earth.</p>
<p><strong>[00:50]:</strong> The first missile was calculated to have hit the meteor. There is no confirmation of it having hit.</p>
<p><strong>[1:21]:</strong> The final missile was noted to not have a confirmed hit, observational units on Lunar Area-32 are called to action.</p>
<p><strong>[1:33]:</strong> Observational units confirm that all missiles had missed their target. A comment is made that most of the missiles were still directly on course with the asteroid, akin to passing through it.</p>
<p><strong>[1:54]:</strong> Possibility of some kind of anomaly being present is studied by Lunar Area-32 staff by launching small scale missiles.</p>

<p><strong>[2:39]:</strong> Designated Keter class anomaly. Containment efforts begin.</p>
<p><strong>[3:10]:</strong> It is confirmed that anything that touches SCP-8065 passes through it. Anomaly is theorized to work by the probability of all the atoms in one object passing through another perfectly. Database updated to show its likely probabilistic nature.</p>
<p><strong>[4:00]:</strong> Attempts to contain SCP-8065 seem to be met by mistakes on the part of the experiments. Notable failures include mistyped coordinates, device failure, and a containment breach. Theorized to be an effect of the probabilistic anomaly.</p>

<strong>Experiment 8065-1 Follow-Up:</strong> A probabilistic anomaly has been observed manipulating Apophis following this, lending credence to the device's ability. The Foundation has begun looking into the utilization of other anomalous objects to neutralize the threat.

<p><strong>Input:</strong> "SK-Class: Dominance Shift Scenario"<br/>
<strong>Overview:</strong> Beginning with a failure in the security of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3683" target="_blank">SCP-3683</a> on 7/22/27, caused by a bureaucratic understaffing of MTF Gamma-119<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. The instances quickly reproduce and spread from Syracuse into the wilds of New York. SCP-3683 instances quickly begin diversifying and adapting to their new environment, breeding with various other bird species to increase their own ability. They quickly take to breeding with birds of prey, allowing the new instances to properly fight against the now overworked Gamma-119. They began using their talons and sharp beaks in tandem with diving and tossing heavier rocks at high speeds to kill or heavily injure the personnel of Gamma-119.<br/>
<strong>Response:</strong> A successful response plan to this would require that MTF Gamma-119 is properly maintained, funded, and staffed. The current response plan is to ensure that Gamma-119 is never to be left in a state where it is functioning with less than fifty men. They are also to be supplied with proper equipment to test the intelligence of any captured instances, to ensure they are not improving in intelligence and problem-solving ability.<br/>

<p><strong>Dr. Sophia:</strong> Can you be sure of this?</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Rodriguez:</strong> Doc, they fucked up our electronics with water, and half of them divebombed us while the rest ran off.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sophia:</strong> Could you elaborate on the electronics being ruined?</p>
<p><strong>Capt. Rodriguez:</strong> It's as simple as I said. They found water bottles and opened them over some of our electronics. Then they attacked us, and some got away.</p>

<p><strong>11/17/27:</strong> First SCP-8065 instance. SCP-8065 is designated as the hybrid offspring of SCP-514 and SCP-3683.</p>
<p><strong>12/2/27 to 1/27/28:</strong> Spread into Russia and propagation through Asia and Europe. Theorized narrative anomaly has perpetuated and expanded SCP-8065's spread.</p>
<p><strong>1/28/28 to 2/3/28:</strong> Spread throughout the rest of the world, bar Oceania. Population numbers about two billion instances, making them one of the most populous birds in the world.</p>
<p><strong>2/29/28:</strong> Today. We cannot fight back due to SCP-8065's degradation of weaponry. The instances are theorized to have intelligence equivalent to a teenage human, due to their use of makeshift and stolen weaponry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> "CIK-Class: Insurgency War Scenario"<br/>
<strong>Overview:</strong> Simulation begins on the twenty-ninth of February 2028, with the first major event occurring at Site-19. At noon, when many personnel are taking their lunch break, it is attacked by a force of around two dozen Chaos Insurgency operatives. They are currently theorized to have some form of thaumaturgical or reality bending ability. The containment locks all fail in unison, unlocking every cell and causing a mass containment breach.<br/>
<strong>Scenario Definition:</strong> The Chaos Insurgency's main goal becomes to ensure the complete eradication or takeover of the SCP Foundation.<br/>
<strong>Response:</strong> We are to adopt a "Strike First" policy against the Chaos Insurgency. When there is suspected Insurgent action in a specific area, we will attack. Install more Scranton Reality Anchors in populous sites, as well as increased security in general. Weed out any possible Insurgency plants.<br/>

At 00:23 hours yesterday, we launched a large-scale raid on the Foundation's main site. The Red Right Hand barely put up a fight, like they couldn't process what we were doing. We managed to make our way inside and eliminate eleven out of thirteen members of the O5 Council. O5-1 was taken in for questioning, and we were unable to locate any trace of O5-8.

<td>This is a powerful tool that we have with us, my friends. We have a list of Chaos Insurgency spies, calculated by the computer as the most likely to be one in the case of a CIK-Class Scenario. The only problem? Before this, CIK-Class scenarios did not exist, and were not accounted for. I recommend that we give this list to the Overseer Council, and suggest they monitor those personnel closely. I believe, for the safety of the Foundation, we should be ready to remove even our best personnel if they are suspicious within reason and are on this list. I know some scenarios we have tested are of an intensely low probability of actually occurring, but I assure you that these experiments are important for the continued future of the Foundation. If we do not prepare for every possible scenario, then what are we as the Foundation? Failing to Protect ourselves from any possible lapse in Containment, which we must thusly Secure.</td>

<p><strong>Input:</strong> "DBK-Class: Complete Database Loss Scenario"<br/>
<strong>Overview:</strong> Through a random anomalous event on 10/09/24, 100% of the Foundation's database is erased in a moment. Knowledge of any SCP number, description, and special containment procedures seem to be completely erased in any Foundation personnel.<br/>
<strong>Scenario Definition:</strong> The SCP Foundation database is completely lost, and unable to be restored without recreating the files from scratch, or at all.<br/>
<strong>Response:</strong> It is suggested that the possibility of creating a memetically distributed version of the entire database be considered, in case of this scenario occurring.<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Probability of Occurrence is less than 0.1%. The database has both anomalous and non-anomalous backups. Random anomalous events are also difficult to stop or predict before occurrence.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> The Loss Of An Anomalous Database</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>Hello Doctor, I am writing this concerning a period of intense confusion that has set onto the research team. Anything that would allow us to continue the work we used to perform on the anomalous computer before us has been removed from our minds. I hypothesize that the loss of memory is merely a situational anomaly that was caused because of our prior project. I theorize such, as I have lost all memory of the project and what we were studying. I ask that we report this to a higher authority within the Foundation so we can attempt to find a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Incident Log 154</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/11/2024</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox")</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Capturing anomalies that have escaped from Foundation custody.</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> E11-Cap</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> E11-1 through E11-9</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>(<em>E11-Cap looks into the woods, flashlight barely making a dent into the darkness.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>E11-1 and E11-2 walk further into the darkness, one flashlight remaining pointed to the squad.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>E11-4:</strong> Do you think we're clear?</p>
<p><strong>E11-Cap:</strong> Doubt it, these things love surprises.</p>
<p>(<em>The flashlight goes dark, followed by the screams of E11-2 and the sound of cracking.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>E11-1:</strong> HELP! HELP!</p>
<p>(<em>E11-1's screams continue, as the squad rushes into the forest.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>They get close enough to shine a light on the threat, and they shine their lights on the viscous corpse of E11-2 slowly beginning to engulf E11-1. All the teeth on the outside seem to have morphed into canines.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>E11-7:</strong> What the fuck-</p>
<p><strong>E11-Cap:</strong> Fire! Fucking fire, you idiots!</p>
<p>(<em>The bullets hit the anomaly, bouncing off of the nigh-liquid mass. It squelches as it bites deep into the leg of E11-1. The operative begins to melt, shifting into another instance of the thing E11-2 has become. E11-1 seems to try and scream, while no noise escapes.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>E11-Cap:</strong> GO! Run! Evacuate, we can call in reinforcements, just make sure we know that they're here-</p>
<p>(<em>The trees shift, howling in crooked laughter. The viscous anomalies begin pursuing the other members of Epsilon-11, gaining insectoid legs and increasing in speed. One lunges at the captain, covering the camera in its flesh.</em>)</p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> GOC forces report a single anomaly, a mass of flesh trying to disguise itself among the forest floor. It was dispatched via incineration.</p>

<p><strong>Database Loss Briefing</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>10/09/24:</strong> Complete Database Loss. Memories of methods used to restrain anomalies, as well as the entire appearance or existence of some being removed from Foundation memory.</p>
<p><strong>10/10/24:</strong> Ways to reinstate the Database are attempted with anomalous methods. All have failed.</p>
<p><strong>10/11/24:</strong> Large scale anomaly breach, mass break of the veil.</p>
<p><strong>10/12/24:</strong> Global Occult Coalition, Chaos Insurgency, and various other militarized Group of Interest forces engage escaped anomalies. The Foundation begins to try and reorganize. All methods have failed to allow us to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Dissolve the Foundation and reorganize our forces in the GOC. We hold no memory of how to complete our objective and cannot rebuild it with actively forgetting everything we know.</p>

<h4 id="toc7"><span>NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION OVERSEER COUNCIL</span></h4>
<p>As of 5/21/16, Doctor Kahlbaum is no longer the Project Lead on SCP-8065.</p>
<p>It took more than two months for the council to come to this decision. Doctor Kahlbaum was a good employee, but his name was found on the list of Insurgency agents from Simulation 8065-12. Paired with the Doctor's strange fascination with running simulations about various groups of interest, we were led to believe he may be a deep plant.</p>
<p>The Doctor will be heavily amnesticized and given a cover story of working at an Antarctic Research Base. He will have apparently suffered an injury causing in rapid onset amnesia.</p>
<p>The next Project Lead will be declared within a week. Have a good day.</p>
<p>— O5-2</p>
