<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known instances of SCP-8236 are to be kept in Site-654's aquarium, to be maintained and observed by on-site paleontologists. All data recording and storage at Site-654 must be regulated to physical media only; all digital information, storage, etc. is strictly prohibited within 200 meters of the Site. External communication must be regulated to landlines.</p>
<p>Location and capture of any remaining SCP-8236 instances is under the purview of MTF Gamma-6 (“Deep Feeders”), with cooperation from the British Occult Service, and is considered a top priority by the Overseer Council. Failure to capture all SCP-8236 instances, or locate their point of origin, will result in a Broken Masquerade scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8236 refers to an unknown number of <em>Ichthyosaurus communis</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> discovered in the northern coastal regions of Europe, generally between the North Atlantic and Baltic Seas. The species is capable of extracting digital information via echolocation.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On 8th Jan 2026, multiple digital security accounts of MI6 were compromised, though no data was lost or transferred. Investigations yielded no results; a similar cyberattack on the United Kingdom's Government Communications Headquarters was attempted the following day, with no change in data and no known source of origin.</p>
<p>The cyberattacks drew the attention of the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/british-occult-service">British Occult Service</a> when their own systems were broken into on 11th January. Unlike previous attempts, vital information was stolen and leaked to various anomalous and mundane sources; subsequent attacks on MI5 and the Defense Intelligence were similarly disseminated. The BOS conducted an investigation into the attacks, but the source could not be traced to any known Group of Interest or hostile force, nor did any such organization claim responsibility.</p>
<p>Between 11th - 19th January, all major industrial, economic, educational, and social platforms in the United Kingdom were digitally infiltrated, with approximately 56% of attacks leading to information retrieval and distribution. No pattern for the attacks was established during this period. Cyberattacks on neighboring countries were initially limited, with Ireland, France, Belgium, and The Netherlands being the only other recipients.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Three Foundation sites were infiltrated during this period, though no information was lost, and at the time, were not perceived as anomalous.</p>
<p>The Foundation became involved after sensitive information from eighteen additional Sites was publicly leaked. By that time, successful attempts had been made on various government centers and anomalous groups in Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark, as well as numerous public and private companies unrelated to government affairs. After negotiations with the British Occult Service, who contacted the Foundation shortly after the leak, the two organizations conducted a joint investigation in the United Kingdom and surrounding area. MTF Eta-11 (“Savage Beasts”) and Rho-9 (“Technical Support”) were able to determine that the attacks were acoustic in nature, though a point of origin had yet to be determined.</p>
<p>By 1st February, twelve European governments had their digital databases infiltrated. Seventy percent of all attacks on the British government resulted in information loss and dispersal; distribution of data concerning anomalous groups had climbed to 63%; BOS and Foundation information was being released in one out of every six attempts. Although the attacks bore a resemblance to <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8840">a similar instance on 8th April 2021</a>, targeted at Site-203, no additional correlation was determined.</p>
<p>On 3rd March, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3889">SCP-3889</a> reported catching an ichthyosaur during a 3889-TEHOM event. The animal was confirmed to be alive by local Foundation agents, though SCP-3889 expressed confusion regarding its catch. When questioned, SCP-3889 did not seem disturbed by the anachronistic nature of the animal, nor its appearance outside of its established habitation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, but rather "the way it spoke to [him]". When NTF Sigma-58 Agent Danielle Torres made a call to a nearby Site, she noticed data stored in her cellphone was being accessed by an outside source. SCP-3889 suggested that the animal was "talking its way into your [phone]", and a plausible link between the animals and the cyberattacks was established.</p>
<p>On 5th March, an ichthyosaur was caught by MTF Gamma-6 between the coasts of Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway. Their GPS service had been compromised six hours prior. Following a battery of tests, the ichthyosaur and its effects were classified as SCP-8236.</p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>The Overseer Council unanimously approved a mass expedition to locate additional SCP-8236 instances, if applicable, and to determine the origin of the animals. With assistance from the BOS, a total of fourteen SCP-8236 instances were located within five months, and transferred to approved facilities. Vivisections indicated discrepancies between SCP-8236 and ichthyosaur biology<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, most notably the presence of a cranial melon (adipose tissue), a feature normally found in odontocetes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, who use it for echolocation. It was also observed that the instances were capable of producing live young with similar anomalous capabilities. Despite the considerable efforts of the two groups, digital databases continued to be infiltrated, with an increased focus on anomalous organizations.</p>

<p>By 1 August 2026, anomalous organizations were almost exclusively targeted by the SCP-8236 instances, with 25% of all digital data being stolen or distributed. After studying the various points of entry performed by SCP-8236, Dr. Bragi Asbjornsen of Site-654 noted that a number of major Groups of Interest had not been targeted, and proposed an investigation into each to determine a point of origin for the anomalies. A raid on a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prometheus-labs-hub">Prometheus Labs</a> front in Lajes do Pico, Portugal yielded information on biological cloning, genetic manipulation, artificial organ growth, and various paleontological studies, though the personnel were unable to reveal their source of funding or sponsorship during interrogation. All active fronts for Prometheus Labs were investigated for involvement, but no conclusive evidence was discovered. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Currently, investigations are ongoing.</span></p>
<p>As of 1 December 2026, fifty-three instances of SCP-8236 have been captured and contained, with a loss of approximately 900 terabytes of information worldwide<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. Following the most recent capture, no further attempts at digital infiltration were reported, and SCP-8236's containment class was downgraded to Euclid.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum [Revision]:</strong> On 7th February 2027, the British Occult Service contacted the Foundation regarding the capture of an animal identical to SCP-8236. They claimed the animal had been responsible for the retrieval of highly classified information concerning the location and function of various anomalous articles and persons. Unlike previous cyberattacks, a destination for the information retrieval was discovered, and the BOS offered to assist the Foundation in locating this source and apprehending any recipient, to which the Foundation agreed (extended logs concerning this retrieval are available for Level-3 personnel).</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the destination, only a single structure was located in the vicinity. An MTF was sent in to investigate; they returned bearing a metal case with a letter inside. After ascertaining the absence of any biohazardous material, the letter was opened; its contents read:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>"<em>By the time you have found this letter, 250,000 have been set loose across the world. The first batch was merely a test run. Call [REDACTED] if you need proof. As for where we got this number, you can thank our new friends.</em>"</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>The number led directly to Site-654 Director Mulisch, who had been put in charge of the SCP-8236 instances. Mulisch confirmed that five Foundation Sites recently had their digital archives compromised, with sensitive data disseminated indiscriminately. Agents of the BOS received similar reports after contacting their superiors.</p>
<p>The following was printed on the back of the letter:</p>
