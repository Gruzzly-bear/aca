<p>Siw, Lia and Juno Andersen by the stream, 1910.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8099</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Children living in Sweden aged 2–12 suspected of ontokinesis or thaumaturgy are to be immediately detained and investigated.</p>
<p>The 19th century homestead formerly belonging to the Andersen family is under Foundation purview. Civilians who had met with the Andersen siblings were administered with amnestics and all accounts of the family have been erased from historical records.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of information on the entity known as SCP-8099, further containment procedures are not deemed viable.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8099 is the collective designation for the seven siblings known as the Andersen siblings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Siw Andersen, 3 years old</li>
<li>Lars Andersen, 4 years old</li>
<li>Twins Keno and Meli Andersen, 6 years old</li>
<li>Lia Andersen, 7 years old</li>
<li>Sven Andersen, 8 years old</li>
<li>Juno Andersen, 9 years old</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1910, local authorities in the area of Sala, Sweden received several complaints and reports on the Andersen family, a foster family consisting of the older Ada Andersen and seven orphaned children. These reports largely concerned suspected "witchcraft" and "heresy" among the siblings. Reports mentioned several items that had reportedly been "conjured" by the children, though civilians were first suspected to have been exaggerating strange or odd behavioral traits. However, based on the amount reports accumulated, Foundation researchers opted to survey the Andersen family leading to containment. Dr. Sven Linde was research lead.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Sven Linde sits on a peg chair in the kitchen of Ada Andersen's 19th century homestead. Their grandmother hurriedly sweeps a whirlwind of children inside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Okay, now my darlings, pl- please try to be quiet and say hello to the young doctor from the, uh- the "Foundation", as it were.</p>
<p><em>The siblings jab at each other, sniggering and chattering. When they notice Dr. Linde's presence, a few of them stiffen up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Now now, form a line! A beautiful line, just like you did so nicely when the priest was here.</p>
<p><em>The children seem to be attempting to order themselves according to their length.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> Juno! Over there! By Sven! You're the tallest! Stupid-</p>
<p><em>Lia, a blonde long-haired child, pulls Juno to the end of the line.</em></p>
<p><strong>Juno Andersen:</strong> Let me go! I can do it myself… MY NAME, is is, Juno! I'm the uh… The <em>tallest</em> of the seven knights!</p>
<p><em>Lia makes a face at Juno. This face seems to resemble an old woman about to scold him. In a moment this face disappears.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> I'm Lia. These are my siblings.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Well I-</p>
<p><strong>Keno &amp; Meli Andersen:</strong> We- we, we- are Keno and Meli!</p>
<p><strong>Meli Andersen:</strong> I have my own island!</p>
<p><strong>Keno Andersen:</strong> I, uh- I!! I have got these…</p>
<p><em>Keno pulls out a bag of marbles out of their pocket and starts pouring them all out on the floor, having the seven siblings disassemble in order to go after the lost marbles.</em></p>
<p><em>The second smallest of the bunch is in the process of kicking the marbles away in every direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Oh dear me! Lars! You don't need to kick them away!</p>
<p><strong>Lars Andersen:</strong> RAAAWR! AAARGH.</p>
<p><em>A moon-eyed toddler is picked up by Ada as to avoid the commotion on the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> This is dear Siw, she hangs along a lot.</p>
<p><em>While most of the children are scrambling on the ground after the marbles, one boy still stands in his place. He looks at Dr. Linde almost with reverence, and raises his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> Nice to meet you doctor. My name is Sven. What's yours?</p>
<p><em>Linde clears his throats and shakes the boy's hand</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> My name is also Sven, Sven Linde. What a, uhm… terrific set of siblings you have here.</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> They are mostly not in the way. I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Well, we'll see shall we? Now, could I ask your grandmother some questions in private please?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Oh, my dear, did I call them my grandchildren? That's not exactly true…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Are you not related?</p>
<p><em>The long-haired child is looking up from underneath the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen</strong> We were left here by our parents! They were <em>poor</em> and <em>unable</em> to keep us!</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Oh my, oh yes I guess that is true. But sometimes, I like to imagine them as my own anyway, because they practically are, little rascals!</p>
<p><em>The siblings have found most of the marbles, and has lost interest in the guest. They swiftly run outside, leaving an eerie silence in the kitchen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Have there been any reactions to your foster children's behavior in the area recently? Anything unusual?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Well, yes there have been some rumours of course. But most people I believe mean well. I don't really believe in having the little ones on a leash. Children should explore for themselves and discover things, the world! I guess that's one of the reasons people react to their open ways.</p>
<p><em>Ada Andersen clears her throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> What do folk usually say about your children?</p>
<p><em>Ada smiles and closes her eyes for a brief moment to think.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Oh well dear, they didn't say much about Sven or Juno, the oldest. When I suddenly had four of them, I started hearing all kinds of comments. That they lied about things, were up to no good, that they had stolen different items and that they were unfaithful…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> And… Is there any truth to this?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Hmm. Yes, yes I can confirm. I think there have been moments were Juno or Sven or Lia has lied about things that have or have not happened, and I believe together, they have formed quite the band of rascals at points. But never have they sought to harm anyone! It is just their way… I mean, some things are bound to happen when you have seven of them!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I am not here to judge your children on any accounts of thieving. But I am interested in all the reports I have heard about your children getting their hands on seemingly uncommon items. There have been reports of various innocuous items, such as rope, clothing and toys. However, you also mentioned another item you wanted to show me?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Yes…</p>
<p><em>Ada audibly sighs as she rises and lifts the seat of the kitchen sofa where a sharp tool is contained. As she puts it on the table, the shining blade reveals that it is a dagger. The grip is wired with leather, and it has a crossguard and pommel out of steel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> It looks… Brand-new?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> You could cut yourself on it, I made sure to get it away from them as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> And, where could it have come from?</p>
<p><strong>Ada Andersen:</strong> Well, they could hardly carry it in their hands, let alone steal it! And there's no smith who makes weapons around here. Besides, it looks ancient! It could have belonged to a theatre, but there's no one around. I suspect some company must have dropped it on their way through Sala and they found it in a ditch.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I suppose it's possible. And it's time I get some time with your children. If you will give me a hand.</p>

<p>My assistant and I have followed the object of study for a week at this point. We have had some difficulty following the siblings during the days as they often set about in different groups on the grounds of the property. The property, a 19th century homestead includes farmland and woodland, a main building with surrounding economical buildings such as a stable and a barn; pastures behind the main building crossed with a running stream. We try to shadow one group of children at a time and observe their behavior when they are not supervised by their parents, which is often. Seemingly completely undisciplined, the object of study was difficult to keep in conversation or obtain any valuable information from. Although, we did see examples of suspected conjurings.</p>

<p><em>Siw, Lars and Lia are running along the stream. They throw pebbles and rocks into the stream.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> Come on, harder!</p>
<p><em>Lars proceeds to lash stones at the stream in a clumsy manner. Siw waddles behind her siblings, picking up dirt and pebbles from the ground before falling on her head, somersaulting in the process. Screeching ensues. Lia rushes toward her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> No, no no. Siw, get up. You are okay! You are okay.</p>
<p><em>Lia hugs her sister, almost carrying her onward, she picks up her arms and makes her walk as some sort of doll. Siw blurbs out a laughter as she is half-lifted onward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> We need to follow them! Stop them!</p>
<p><em>Lars has started throwing sticks, bigger rocks and logs into the stream.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen:</strong> Yes good, wall! Big wall!</p>
<p><strong>Siw Andersen:</strong> Big wall!</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> Are they stopping the serpents?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde is caught surprised by this one, coming up from behind him. Sven has blonde hair, blue still eyes, different from the others.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Stopping the serpents? They're throwing rocks into the stream.</p>
<p><em>Sven looks upon Dr. Linde with unconcerned eyes, acting patiently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> No, doctor, I think you are mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde smirks at the precocious young man who stands honorably with both of his hands behind his back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> They are needed to stop the great rush of serpents. The serpents' fleet are usually moved to the east because of the tide but since they are allied with the Enemy, they need to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde starts laughing with no response from the boy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> Tsk, tsk. How <em>unworldly</em> of you.</p>
<p><em>He uses the word "unworldly" as if it was appropriated from some other source. At the same time, Lars stands on top of a rock in the middle of the stream, seemingly celebrating having repelled the bigger bass and trout of the stream with larger logs and stones.</em></p>

<p><strong>Juno Andersen:</strong> B-, b- but the Gameflies aren't here yet… How do you know they will come?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> They will come! They will help us! They have always done so!</p>
<p><em>The bushes that Juno ran into has no remarkable contents different from a normal forest grove. The children continue to emphasize that the soft and cold cream was the nectar of so called "Wontrees".</em></p>

<p>Some time during the last days of this summer in 1910, Dr. Linde grew suspicious of an individual allegedly living in the area. The person of interest called himself Stennja and seemed to be an outcast within the society of Sala. His appearance is recorded within one of the observational logs.</p>

<p><em>A group of the children play in the garden, when they are distracted by a tall man walking past the garden. He takes his hat off and greets the siblings. They run up to the white picket fence and starts an eager conversation with him. He is dressed in a suit colored in a very deep color of black. Dr. Linde hurries up to talk to the man.</em></p>
<p><strong>The siblings in unison:</strong> We won Stennja! We did it!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Well, uhm <em>Linde clears his throat</em> good day to you gentleman.</p>
<p><em>The man's attention is switched from the children to Dr. Linde.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Oh, I'm sure you did. Did you avert the serpents as well? G'dday t'you Mister.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> So the children have told you about their, uh-, adventures?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Sure 'nough. They're heroes indeed.</p>
<p><em>Stennja speaks in a northern dialect, typically shortening his words.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I hope they don't bother the gentleman, when he passes?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Not'at'all! I'm glad to hear 'em. It's why I'm 'ere.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> You… Come here to visit them? Voluntarily?</p>
<p><em>Stennja chuckles and picks up Siw who gestures for him to pick her up from behind the fence. He holds her in his right arm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> You've grown. Y'know these kids are not like most. They're allowed a good life. Out here on these grounds they learn to like all of it. Worthless things becomes treasure. There are kingdoms we can never take from them. Hey, Sven!</p>
<p><em>Sven gets up closer to the fence and looks dutiful.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> Yes, Stennja?</p>
<p><em>Stennja whispers something into the boy's ear.</em></p>
<p><em>Sven looks hesitant at first, but soon lights up and runs into the house. He comes back with the dagger, carefully folded in cloth. He hands it to Stennja who has passed Siw back into the garden.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Is… Is it yours? How did you come by it? It's at least-</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> An old relic… Yes it's as old as it looks. Been passed down for generations. I lost it somewhere here, good thing Sven could take care of it for me for a while.</p>
<p><em>Stennja gives Sven a wink and puts his hat back on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Well, I've gotten what I needed. I'll see you a-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Okay, well listen sir. I am afraid that item needs to stay here.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde pulls out a few papers of documentation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> You see, we are from the authorities and we would highly appreciate if everything could stay on the properties so far. We might uh- need it for a while…</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> What, is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> We are just looking into these children, whether they belong here, <em>linde clears his throat</em> in this foster family. I can not tell you much but I can assure you will get your heirloom back.</p>
<p><em>Stennja hesitantly hands the dagger to Linde.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> I sure hope I can trust the authorities with it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Or we can simply rely on Sven again, can't we Sven? For you to take care of it a little while longer?</p>
<p><em>Sven looks on with a puzzled gaze.</em></p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Hmph, indeed.</p>
<p><em>Stennja nods his hat before making his way down the road again.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum-8099-4: Excerpt from Dr. Linde's Log Book</strong><br/>
June 18th 1910 Dr. Linde assumed to have sufficient evidence to detain the orphans to Site-80 along with their foster parent, Mrs. Andersen. After this detainment, Dr. Linde made the following profile of the seven children.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN EXCERPT]</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Juno Andersen, 9 years of age.</strong><br/>
Mousy hair. Sensitive and dumb. Has an affinity for conjuring a cold kind of cream.</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen, 8 years of age.</strong><br/>
Blonde. Overly adult. Has conjured gunfire. Wants to be the hero.</p>
<p><strong>Lia Andersen, 7 years of age.</strong><br/>
Longer blonde hair. Playful but does her duties. Is very good at doing faces; so good at one point I was sure she had turned her face into a golem. The very next moment she had removed this face.</p>
<p><strong>Meli Andersen, 6 years of age.</strong><br/>
Short, blonde hair. Indistinguishable to their twin Keno. Outgoing. Is allegedly in the possession of a private island they visit regularly – investigate.</p>
<p><strong>Keno Andersen, 6 years of age</strong><br/>
Short, blonde hair. Indistinguishable to their twin Meli. Shy. Has shown to be able to conjure many colorful marbles at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Lars Andersen, 4 years of age</strong><br/>
Blonde. Quite aggressive. Has participated in anomalous events however has not performed conjuring directly.</p>
<p><strong>Siw Andersen, 3 years of age</strong><br/>
Small, stubby and with short brown hair. Yabbers quite a lot nonsensically. Will require further testing.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-8099-5: Interrogation with Sven Andersen</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Containment chamber # 33, Site-80. 13:10. June 20th 1910. Interrogation commences with Sven Andersen of SCP-8099.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Hiya, uh. Hi again Sven.</p>
<p><em>Sven is sitting quietly on a bench.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I'm Dr. Linde. Sven Linde, as I am sure you remember. Now, this- this isn't a time to be angry. We just want to ask you some questions, okay?</p>
<p><em>Sven holds his legs against his chest in a curled up position. He is looking away from Dr. Linde.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Sven, Sven? Again, I am not here to be angry at you, or blame you for anything. I represent, an organization, a group… We uh- need to talk about your abilities. Your own land… The Ethereal Ocean, and the Wontrees. We would like to know it all. I am sure you know of what I am speaking better than anyone of your siblings.</p>
<p><em>Sven doesn't move and Dr. Linde fidgets in his seat. After a moment of silence, Dr. Linde bends forward toward Sven.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Listen. We are not, the Enemy. We are not, a part of them. If you want to rid your "world" of the Enemy, we are your strongest bet. Because you are not getting anywhere, without us. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><em>The boy moves, and closes his eyes. Finally, he nods and begins to sob.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> Will you help us with the Enemy? If I answer your questions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Doing the opposite will certainly not deal with the Enemy. Your best bet is just to tell us all you know about it. We-, we will see what we can do.</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> What we see is not visible to you, that I have known for a very long time. You are <em>unworldly</em>, like most. I <em>hardly believe</em>, you will be able to do anything against the Enemy. The Enemy is not a human being, not even a being. The Enemy has always, throughout our lives, moved closer. It is the shadow that puts nature under its forcing hand. We have been told by a great knight, that we must block the many minions of the Enemy to protect the land.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> You don't seem to be able to travel to this world you are speaking about. I can see you perfectly clear. On the other hand, several items have appeared here. Can you explain these?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> These items have always been here. This is our world.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I thought you said the world was your own?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Andersen:</strong> There is only one world. But you don't seem to see its <em>forthcoming demise</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Maybe there's a chance of avoiding this… If we let you and your siblings out of your chambers for a little while?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde looks over his glasses with a smile. Sven Andersen strokes his feet on the bench.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum-8099-6: Test Logs</strong><br/>
June 20th, 1910 Sven Linde requested further testing in order to see the extent of the children's ontokinetic abilities.</p>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 1<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Lars Andersen<br/>
<strong>Place:</strong> Containment Chamber 34<br/>
<strong>Complementary Items:</strong> A cardboard box.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The young boy was made aware of a carton box that had been supplied during lunch time. Without knowing he was being supervised, the boy immediately took interest in the box, lifting it up, throwing it against the wall and hiding inside of it. When the boy was concealed under the box, a violent screaming and thrashing could be heard. The box was split in two when the boy rose up again and started stomping the parts of the box flat. When the boy was seen slicing the cardboard apart with means of a rusty key, guards intervened. The boy loudly protested: "GET OFF PRISON GUARDS! I GOT THE KEY. I KILLED YOUR SERVANT! DEAD DEAD DEAD!" A new containment chamber of higher security classification is considered as the conjured key perfectly fit the lock of the door to chamber 34.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 2<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Keno &amp; Meli Andersen<br/>
<strong>Place:</strong> On Site-80 grounds, supervised by a team of researchers and security personnel.<br/>
<strong>Complementary Items:</strong> A wooden canoe with paddles is left together with the twins.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The ground of the site allows for activities on bigger patches of grassland. The twins were let outside into the yard where the canoe was centered. They first approached the canoe with curiosity. Keno grabbed the paddle and wildly swung it against the ground while Meli rocked the boat. Soon however, they started pleading to the surrounding personnel for help. Apparently, their play had been interrupted by the perimeter fence. Finally, Dr. Linde conversed with them on the issue and was informed that a certain island had been "overrun by Bigfeet" and that the perimeter fence blocked the twins from reaching said island.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 3<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Lia &amp; Juno Andersen<br/>
<strong>Place:</strong> The siblings were supervised in a small wooded area.<br/>
<strong>Complementary Items:</strong> No supplementary items.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The siblings were encouraged to obtain that cone with cold cream in order to replicate the effects found during the observational period. However, the two were sceptical as there were "more important things to do". At last, Juno scouted the wood with more and more tension in his body. He started shouting incomprehensible words to nearby trees and started to claw at the ground screaming: "They're all gone! All gone! They have fled! Come help us someone!"</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 4<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Sven Andersen<br/>
<strong>Place:</strong> Outside the perimeters of Site-80.<br/>
<strong>Complementary Items:</strong> Upon the object's request, a knightly dagger. It is also of note that the object required the help of Dr. Linde in order for this test to be realized.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The boy was supervised when he led Dr. Linde to a nearby creek. "This is what we need to do. We need to cross this river…" The young boy paused and looked for Dr. Linde's understanding. While the doctor looked admittedly puzzled on this ordeal, he had rather wanted the boy to show what he knew rather than return to the state he was in before; As such, Linde clumsily followed the boy across the creek on a few rocks. Suddenly, the two began a fearsome "fight", with an invisible being. While Dr. Linde had lost his composure and looked shocked at the same time, the young boy straddled around on the ground and in the grass. "No!" the boy shouted and started to weep. The sword he recently had held in his hand had broken in half.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Test #:</strong> 5<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Siw Andersen<br/>
<strong>Place:</strong> Containment Chamber 55<br/>
<strong>Complementary Items:</strong> An assortment of toys suitable for toddlers such as a ball and various building blocks.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The toddler had crept up by the window of her chamber when her carer came in with the toys. She met these new supplies with a joyous cackle, waddled towards them and picked the ball up. However, as she held it she slowly started looking around the room. She soon started crying. The ball was dropped and the toddler sat down on the floor. Dr. Linde intervened, and sat down with the toddler for a moment, briefly stating, "You're not very magic are you, little one" before he was suddenly startled. He looked around the room, and called for the testing to stop and that the carer take over.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum-8099-7: Excerpt from Dr. Linde's Log Book</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN EXCERPT]</p>
<hr/>
<p>Working with the children so far have led us to draw four conclusions.</p>
<p>Firstly, the children are not capable of conjuring items of their own will. In general, they do not seem particularly strong.</p>
<p>Secondly, our world is interpreted as just as real as theirs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is another world. However, if this world is conjured by the children, or existent all of itself is not clear. Being in contact with the object has allowed me to get brief glimpses of this world. It is a vast land with an impending threat threatening its nature and its people. Objects in this world have its own equivalent in the other world, a creek can become a river, a puddle can become a lake and a containment chamber can become a dungeon.</p>
<p>Fourthly, this impending threat has revealed characteristics such as empathy and playfulness. The children do not differ much in this regard to other human children.</p>
<p>With these conclusions in mind, I will recommend a lower level of classification and security protocol to be implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum-8099-8: Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>June 30th, 1910 SCP-8099 along with Ada Andersen escaped containment. Witnesses described an unstoppable force, which ripped apart doors and chambers for the children to run out into Site-80 grounds and onward. Security staff along with research lead Dr. Linde made their way out but were apprehended by a new perimeter fence and a man in a suit who stood waiting.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[OPEN LOG]</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The suited man had met Dr. Linde before and introduced himself as "Stennja" once again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> It's… You?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> I've come to collect my kids. I thought I'd let them have some fun with you but… This is a place of nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> You've… Collected them? Where have you taken them?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Somewhere you can't reach. Don't worry. They are safer, and most importantly, more stimulated than with you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> What is your relation to these kids? You said they were yours? You know of their… Abilities, so to speak?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> I've known them all their life. I have followed them ever since I left them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> You, you were the one who left them there?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> We, left them. Ada Andersen is a righteous being, with a heart of gold. We don't trust ourselves with raising our own spawn. And so, we leave them. We left all of them, as they'd be happy. As you've seen.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Linde pauses for a minute. Stennja puts his hat on to turn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> Could we, could we meet with them again? Could we talk more?</p>
<p><strong>Stennja:</strong> Not if you so tried. They are in our land now. It's time I head back too. It was nice meeting you doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Linde:</strong> I understand, but what if there could be some arrangement made, maybe-</p>
