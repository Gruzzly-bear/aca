<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area containing SCP-4305 is enclosed by chain-link fence and bears signage appropriate to standard cover story "Waste-4."</p>
<p>The containment area is monitored remotely via perimeter alarm. In the event of trespass, Secure Area-38 is to dispatch a reconnaissance drone equipped with sedative darts in order to identify, track, and incapacitate any individuals who may pose a risk of activating the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4305 is the collective designation for an area of desert approximately 80 kilometers northwest of the city of McGill, Nevada in the Great Basin Desert. This area is the source of a spatial anomaly as well as an associated humanoid manifestation designated as SCP-4305-1.</p>
<p>While the specific dimensions of SCP-4305 are presently unknown, the anomalous area encircles a derelict in-ground pool, adjacent concrete pool deck, and a 2x2 meter cinder-block structure that has been painted white. This structure features a wooden door showing significant signs of weathering, no windows, and a yellow plastic sign marked with block letters that read 'CAUTION: No Lifeguard On Duty'.</p>
<p>The anomaly becomes active when an individual approaches the pool deck. Upon activation, the door on the cinder-block structure will open and an instance of SCP-4305-1 will emerge. Instances of SCP-4305-1 take the form of a humanoid male approximately 50 years of age standing greater than 1.8 meters in height and with a lean build. While the features of the face vary from instance to instance, all manifestations recorded to this point have shared the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dressed in a gray wool three-piece suit.</li>
<li>Wearing a black derby hat.</li>
<li>Speaking in a Liverpool accent.</li>
<li>Carrying a black umbrella, undeployed.</li>
<li>General immunity to all attempts at impediment including the circumvention of man-made barriers.</li>
<li>A walking speed of approximately 2.1 meters per second.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>After the instance of SCP-4305-1 manifests, it will approach the triggering individual in an attempt to secure their attention. If allowed to reach the subject, SCP-4305-1 will offer a verbal warning of trespass and attempt to make physical contact. Should it be successful, the affected subject will experience substantial pain rated by individual sufferers as comparable to that of being struck by a taser.</p>
<p>Additional violations of the trespass order issued by SCP-4305-1 have proven invariably fatal.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery Log:</strong><br/>
While on a routine training mission, Foundation field operative David Harbour became separated during a controlled skydiving exercise and landed several kilometers east of his intended target. While waiting for extraction, the agent attempted to scout the area only to note the presence of an in-ground pool in the middle of the desert.</p>
<p>The agent reported approaching the pool, having no suspicion of its anomalous nature, and was then met by a manifestation of SCP-4305-1. After indicating the presence of SCP-4305-1, the agent failed to provide any further updates and his field beacon was no longer detectable.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of the extraction team, Agent Harbour was located in proximity to the last known location of his beacon. He was unconscious and his field equipment had all been short-circuited in a manner consistent with substantial electrical shock. The agent was returned to nearby Secure Area-38 for medical evaluation. The nearby area was flagged for containment and investigation.</p>
<p>During the debriefing, the field agent was unable to recall any substantial detail about his experience after he began his investigation of the pool, nor could he explain the burn marks now present on his abdomen. It is unknown if this was due to an anomalous effect or merely the result of trauma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The following is a transcription of a field test conducted at the site of SCP-4305. A monitoring team including Agent Harbour was dispatched with standard athletic field gear and a body camera with an extended battery. The video begins as the agent disembarks from the monitoring van; extraneous footage has been cut.</em></p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Alright Agent, equipment check complete. Please approach the pool.</p>
<p><em>Agent Harbour approaches the area of SCP-4305 on foot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> Okay, Ops, I'm about 10 meters from the pool deck. I'm seeing…concrete, dust, a little bit of trash. 'No Lifeguard' sign. Looks like what used to be a pool chair. Not much going on here. This pretty much matches what I can remember about last time. I'm going to go in closer.</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Affirmative, Harbour. Please try to get some footage from the pool.</p>
<p><em>Agent Harbour approaches the lip of the pool and angles the camera downward to look within. The pool is in a state of disrepair however there is an amount of muddied or otherwise dirty water still remaining at the bottom. Based on visual cues such as the pool's slope the suggested depth is less than 0.5 meters. As the camera pans left to right, the corpse of a human male becomes visible facedown in the water. The body appears to be coated with an unknown substance visually similar in appearance to mineral oil.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> Ops, are you seeing this? Looks like somebody drowned in there? I'm going to look for a way down, maybe…maybe something to poke it with? I guess I can just walk down the steps on the far side.</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Corpse acknowledged, Agent. Physical contact is not authorized at this time; observation only. We don't know what happened last time. No sense gambling.</p>
<p><em>As the camera further scans the pool the abrupt creaking of wood startles the agent and the camera snaps to the right, focusing on a small cinderblock structure at the edge of the pool deck. The wooden door on the front has opened and an arm can be seen emerging from the interior. A tall man in a gray suit emerges, an instance of SCP-4305-1. The observing Agent holds his ground for the time being.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> You there!</p>
<p><em>As the head of SCP-4305-1 emerges, the camera snaps around and the sound of shoes on concrete can be heard as Agent Harbour breaks into a run.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> Oh fuck! Not this guy again!</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Agent, do you know this man? Is this who you saw before?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> Shit, I think so. I'm outta here, Ops!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> I say, you there! Wait!</p>
<p><em>Approximately four minutes of audio and video has been fast-forwarded wherein Agent Harbour continues to run through the desert back toward his drop point. The video resumes as Agent Harbour collapses from exertion and falls onto his hands and knees just outside the Foundation monitoring van. The camera turns back in the direction of SCP-4305. In the distance, a humanoid figure can be seen several hundred meters out.</em></p>
<p><em>Another minute elapses as Agent Harbour is helped into the monitoring van and the testing team radios back for permission to leave. Permission is obtained and the van leaves the area of SCP-4305. Agent Harbour's camera is pointed out of the back window of the van where a humanoid figure is observed in the distance, presumably the instance of SCP-4305-1.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Update to Addendum.4305.1</strong><br/>
<strong>Dateline:</strong> 2009-07-06, 18:12 [Approximately 5 hours after previous addendum]<br/>
<em>After returning to Secure Area-38, internal cameras indicate Agent Harbour was debriefing site research staff after his attempted field test when external security alarms sounded and the site entered Stage-1 lockdown. Agent Harbour, representatives of Operations, and researchers assigned to this test self-isolated inside their interview room for the duration of the lockdown as per protocol.</em></p>
<p><em>Security footage correlated from the entrance to Secure Area-38 as well as other internal monitoring indicates that an anomalous humanoid approached the facility entrance and utilized an umbrella to leverage the external bay door and pry it open. Site security personnel were instructed to engage the target with lethal force. Responding with standard weaponry available to the site, numerous shots were fired at the instance of SCP-4305-1 from increasing numbers of Foundation personnel until ammunition was exhausted. There was no apparent damage to the instance of SCP-4305-1.</em></p>
<p><em>The invading instance of SCP-4305-1 continued unimpeded through internal corridors, utilizing a previously undocumented sense of preternatural awareness regarding the location of Agent Harbour.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon arrival to the interview room, the instance of SCP-4305-1 utilized his umbrella to pry the hinges of the door free and enter. Approaching Agent Harbour directly. The following exchange was recorded:</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> What is it that you want? Why did you follow me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> Sir, as I stated before, that was private property you entered. I thought the signs would convey a certain <em>understanding</em>. You can't go in there and I shan't want to serve you notice again.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Harbour:</strong> Whose property is it? Why is it private? What are you protecting? What's in the—</p>
<p><em>The agent's line of questioning is cut off as the instance of SCP-4305-1 decouples the handle of his umbrella to reveal a large cylindrical rod visually similar to a cattle prod. He makes contact with Agent Harbour's abdomen. The agent immediately begins to seize and shortly after falling onto the floor he vanishes completely. The instance of SCP-4305-1 then turns and leaves. Foundation assets tracked SCP-4305-1 back to its point of origin at SCP-4305 where it entered the cinderblock building adjacent to the pool.</em></p>

<em>The activation of motion sensors triggered the cameras surrounding SCP-4305 to begin recording footage. Multiple angles pointed at the inground swimming pool recorded the submerging of the corpse which had been floating face-down on the surface of the water. Shortly thereafter a series of bubbles escaped from the liquid before another corpse of a differing physical makeup surfaced, also face-down in the pool.</em></p>
<p><em>Observation indicates this corpse bears a tattoo that is a positive stylistic and anatomical match to a tattoo worn by Agent Harbour. A reconnaissance drone was deployed in an attempt to identify the remains as well as sample the viscous fluid. This operation was executed successfully and a positive DNA match was made between the corpse and genetic material on file for Agent Harbour.</em></p>
<p><em>Analysis of the viscous fluid indicates the presence of deuterium oxide, mercury chloride, and human saliva. While none of the components of this material have tested as individually anomalous, the resulting mixture demonstrates a substantially greater density than any of the components would normally possess.</em></p>

<em>A treaded drone was deployed equipped with claw and hook utility arms; however the drone was unable to secure a hold on the corpse. Additional attempts at reducing the distance between the drone and the corpse to better secure leverage were unsuccessful. During the procedure, monitoring equipment recorded a sharp jerk on one of the mechanical arms as it attempted to grip the leg of the corpse. The drone was then pulled further down the slope of the pool by an unseen force and dragged into the viscous fluid. The device failed to respond to additional commands before eventually going offline.</em></p>
<p><em>Subject D-21443 was then fitted with a remote-operated compliance collar and given a three-meter-long hooked pole with instructions to attempt to first recover the reconnaissance drone from the pool, and, as a secondary objective, attempt to recover the corpse of Agent Harbour by pulling it out of the liquid.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Okay boys, I'm just about to the pool. Where should I get into this thing?</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> You can use either the stairs at the shallow end of the ladder on the near side.</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Smelling real ripe over here now that I'm downwind of this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Understood, D-21443. Please proceed to the inground pool.</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Heh. 'Caution, no lifeguard'. Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> What was that, D-21443?</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Nothin'. Just no lifeguard.</p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Please restrict cross-talk.</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> &lt;<em>Grumbles indistinctly</em>&gt;</p>
<p><em>D-21443 steps onto the pool deck and approaches the shallow end. He descends the steps and begins to cross the pool floor. After a meter, a loud banging noise is recorded and other cameras pointed at SCP-4305 record the door to the cinderblock structure flying open as an instance of SCP-4305-1 steps out.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> I say, old boy. Get away from there! This is private property!</p>
<p><em>D-21443 drops the hooked pole he is carrying and begins to run up the stairs, off of the pool deck, and away from SCP-4305-1 in a direction opposite the monitoring team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> D, you need to head back towards us. Stop. Immediately. Or we will have to encourage compliance.</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Hell no man, did you see that fucking guy! It must be 100 degrees and he's wearing a <em>wool suit</em> out here? <em>Nearby cameras record D-21443 running towards the perimeter of the containment zone with SCP-4305-1 continuing to pursue at a steady walk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Operations:</strong> D-class, do you understand that if you attempt to flee we will activate your collar?</p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Fuck you! Come and pick me up!</p>
<p><em>D-21443 reaches the perimeter fence and begins to climb. As he nears the top, the remote compliance collar is activated and the D-class seizes and becomes rigid as he falls from the fence. Approximately one minute later, SCP-4305-1 enters the frame just as D-21443 begins to regain bodily control.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Seriously, dude, I'm just doing my job!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> Sir, you and your friends must work on your comprehension skills. Just like the sign says: No trespassing. This is private property. <em>SCP-4305-1 disengages the handle of his umbrella and withdraws a long baton with a forked head similar to a cattle prod.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Ah jeez, come on dude, I'm just the pool guy!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> I'm not sure what is unclear about 'no trespassing'. <em>SCP-4305-1 advances.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Wait, what? There wasn't any trespassing on the sign! It said 'lifeguard'! No lifeguard on duty!</p>
<p><em>SCP-4305-1 halts and furrows his brow.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-21443:</strong> Caution, no lifeguard on duty. I swear it, on my life.</p>
<p><em>After a nearly 30 seconds pause, SCP-4305-1 extends the cattle prod and contacts D-21443 in the abdomen. The D-class begins to seize violently before he vanishes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4305-1:</strong> I'll have to look into that.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4305-1 returns to the cinderblock structure and closes the door behind itself.</em></p>
