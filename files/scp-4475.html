<p>All Project GALAXIAS personnel — including occult dairy practitioners — are to consume 1.5 liters of milk per day to maintain natural resistance against dairy-based anomalies. As such, the project is to screen a strict lactose tolerance for all prospective research personnel.</p>

<p><span class="h-span">Description: SCP-4475</span> is a Class-III<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> deific bovine entity with a body length of 40 km, presently located in extrasolar space.</p>
<p>SCP-4475 possesses 25 pairs of ungulate forelimbs — ranging from 15 to 40 km in length — and a single large udder of variable diameter<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> with 49 lengthy teats. Mapping initiatives have detected a large internal bladder and five powerful sphincters, located at the rear of its body. Within the bladder, a complex metabolic process produces biochemical propellant. This propellant is expelled through one of its five sphincters. Based on this anatomical configuration, Foundation-employed aerospace engineers estimate that velocities upwards of 8,000 m/s (28,000 km/h) can be achieved in the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>Collected Thaumic Gateway<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and telemetry data have determined that SCP-4475 is presently located at a distance of 1,344 light-years (± 20 ly) from Earth. SCP-4475 is in orbit around the Trapezium Cluster: A system of five stars orbiting an unregistered supermassive gravitational anomaly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the high level of para-technology required to directly observe SCP-4475, the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition each became aware of its existence independently. Starting in 2009, at least 5,900 different persons on Earth have undergone physical teleportation into the interior of SCP-4475's mammary glands.</p>
<p>Though random in nature, both firsthand eyewitness accounts and audiovisual recordings from dairy ranchers corroborate the existence of a complex ritual (designated <span class="h-span">SCP-4475-1</span>) capable of triggering the phenomena. The following process — as compiled by abducted dairy ranchers for scientific study — is a baseline for teleportation via SCP-4475-1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select and secure a cow.</li>
<li>Vocalize praise for its existence.</li>
<li>Approach the selected cow at a 55° angle in the direction of its posterior.</li>
<li>Lubricate its two rear quarters, preferably with udder cream.</li>
<li>Pull on each teat five times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the ritual, immediate disappearance and re-emergence inside SCP-4475's udder has occurred in all cases.</p>

<p><span class="h-span">RECOVERY NOTE:</span> The following is the earliest known recorded instance of spontaneous teleportation into SCP-4475. Timothy Wickman (<span class="h-span">POI-4475-01</span>) recorded the following on his camcorder and was later discovered incoherent in the middle of a Wisconsin, USA intersection. Witnesses described him appearing in the middle of the road and regurgitating a large pink-red biological mass.</p>
<p>The only information the tactical response team gleaned from Wickman was his strong desire to "return to the womb."</p>

<p><span class="h-span">TIMOTHY:</span> Hey– Uh, is uh, anyone there? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Timothy flips the camera back around and taps on the display screen, shaking it. The focused and unfocused view shows off-white floor panels with hexagonal edges.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="h-span">TIMOTHY:</span> Hey this is Tim, can anyone help me out in here? My damn GPS isn't working.</p>

<p><strong>[</strong><em>The camera rests on a flat surface. There is a low rhythmic humming and distant trickle. Scraping sounds approach the camera.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Slurping.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="h-span">TIMOTHY:</span> Fuck. <strong>[</strong><em>He retches.</em><strong>]</strong> Why am I so thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Soft mulching accompanies Timothy's footsteps. The view moves through a large entrance and into a tall white edifice with intricate designs and carven surfaces.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Timothy approaches a threshold, wider than the last.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="h-span">TIMOTHY:</span> <em>Another</em> entrance? What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Timothy enters into a small white courtyard with similar intricate carvings. Various bovine head and udder statues line the interior walls. Timothy stops in front of a mural adorning the far courtyard wall. Text inscriptions — identified as Indus script in large font and Sanskrit in small font — are paired with different pictures.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>The murals depict 25 entities in a five-by-five formation. Each entity is a nude humanoid with iridescent full-body tattoos and malformed serpentine necks. The view blurs, then resolves, now focusing on a featureless, placid green face, with five intersecting lines on the forehead.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="h-span">TIMOTHY:</span> Huh…?</p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Timothy moves to the next wall to the right and stops again.

<p><strong>[</strong><em>Distant sloshing. Timothy appears not to notice.</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[</strong><em>Timothy keeps moving, this time taking little care to review the next inscriptions.

<p><span class="h-span">I. May 12, 2033</span></p>
<p>Osteoporosis rates have increased by 10%. The remaining citizens of India have reported astronomical objects being less visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Recent SCP-4475-1 test results have trended toward increasing abnormalities; as such, persons returning from SCP-4475 more frequently reported experiencing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traumatic spiritual experiences.</li>
<li>Affliction with memory retention abnormalities, ranging anywhere between permanent amnestic fugue states and hypermnesia.</li>
<li>Recall of memories foreign to themselves.</li>
<li>Recall of memories foreign to humanity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, randomized teleportation into SCP-4475 has increased dramatically, with upwards of 50,000 civilian disappearances attributed to SCP-4475 in the last year alone — most of whom returned displaying abnormalities consistent with the above. Due to potential negative repercussions resulting from the execution of SCP-4475-1, Project GALAXIAS has tentatively ceased all experimentation.</p>

<p>At 0137 UTC, the Brennan Thaumometric Satellite detected an unknown electromagnetic pulse (or EMP) with high levels of tachyonic particles and associated Akiva radiation. After triangulating the pulse, astronomers determined that it had originated from the Trapezium Cluster. No known cause has been identified.</p>

<p>Despite ceasing all experimentation two years' prior, significant numbers of persons on Earth continue to teleport into SCP-4475. The triggers are increasingly commonplace milking procedures, which lead to escalating dairy-based anomalies. Recovered persons show significant transfiguration to their skeletal structure.</p>
<p>Efforts to construct autonomous surveillance of SCP-4475's interior and exterior are underway. Discussion on its neutralization is pending.</p>

</div>
<hr/>
<p>Just as threats from the "<a href="/land-of-honey">Land of Milk and Honey</a>" hung over the UIU's head in the 1920s, preternatural dairy threats continue to plague us today.</p>
<p>After <a href="/scp-3739">Operation: LACTOSE INTOLERANCE</a> and the ensuing battle we waged — and lost — the O5 promoted me as the Director of Project GALAXIAS. From here, I have led us to archive, study, dissect, and perhaps, finally grasp apotheosis. I have seen beyond the stage on which we play our little lives. We are naught but actors — puppets on strings, dancing to the tune of a trillion capsules of milk, suckled by decaying, necrotic gods of sadism, bound to chairs of osteoporotic bone. But no longer.</p>
<p>For the good of humanity, we stand against the Land of Milk and Honey — in whatever permutation it exists.</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="h-span"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALPHA</span> Specialist Bhupinder Gauri</span> — a thaumatological practitioner and former MTF-Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") attachment.</li>
<li><span class="h-span"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BETA</span> Specialist Cindy Singh</span> — a trained orthopedic surgeon and medic for MTF-Xi-55 ("Spleen McQueen").</li>

</ol>
<p>Each selected personnel possesses Level-4 knowledge of SCP-4475-1's effects — including its danger to human neurology and well-being. Due to Spc. Bhupinder Gauri's field and occult knowledge, as well as his high memetic retention and cognitohazardous resistance, he will lead this mission.</p>

</div>
<p>4. <span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">EQUIPMENT</span> CRIMSON COWBELL personnel charged with SCP-4475 exploration have been granted the following equipment and materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three pressurized VISTA-Type Extravehicular Mobility Unit support suits, each outfitted with a SCRAMBLE headset<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> and 30 hours of oxygen.</li>
<li>A single Thaumic Gateway device powered via portable generator — to allow instantaneous communication to and from the Operations Theater. Due to its large mass and physical dimensions, the use of a Marlowe Anti-Gravitational Repulsion Sled is essential in allowing simple transportation of the device.</li>
<li>The microcomputer processor, hull, and power plant for five autonomous telemetry drones will be deployed alongside the CRIMSON COWBELL team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between September 22 and October 10, Project GALAXIAS staffed 28 excursions into SCP-4475 with the sole purpose of plotting a route into the lower bound of one of its 400-meter-long teats. Each associated rancher readily pledged under a Foundation-authorized geas<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> to fulfill their duty. This allowed them to better map a navigable route through the teat before the onset of memetihazardous effects or inexplicable teleportation back.</p>
<p>5. <span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">MISSION DESCRIPTION</span> Undergo a direct and extensive study of the interior and exterior of SCP-4475 and its surroundings for future physical containment.

<h4 id="toc4"><span><span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">EXECUTION</span></span></h4>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>At 0507 hours (UTC+5:30), the team completed SCP-4475-1 and disappeared.</p>
<p>At 0520 hours, COMMAND confirmed visualization of SCP-4475's interior through all three feeds.</p>
<p>At 0533 hours, the team met at a rendezvous point. GAMMA parked the Repulsion Sled in an open chamber and programmed the Thaumic Gateway to open periodically and transmit the team's collected data. The team activated and released the telemetry drones, which dispersed. One drone flew down a path leading to the chosen teat, and the team followed.</p>
<p>The team traveled down a long subterranean biological tunnel, next to a temple structure like that seen in <span class="h-span">Recovery Log 4475.1</span>.</p>
<p>At 0704 hours, ALPHA reported distant bovine vocalization and ordered the team to a halt. After perceiving no threat, they reconvened — with ALPHA at the lead — and traveled unabated for 3 hours.</p>
<p>At 1021 hours, ALPHA reached the teat's upper span, discovering the lifeless body of a ranch-hand; their ID tags identified them as one Darien Meyer. COMMAND claimed that Meyer exited SCP-4475 one month ago and is presently employed by the Foundation with Class-E personnel classification.</p>
<p>At 1025 hours, BETA discovered an enamel statue of a feminine humanoid entity with bovine characteristics. BETA noticed warped holes resembling those found in osteoporosis patients. She scraped off a sample of pink residue, revealing porous bone marrow beneath.</p>
<p>While taking the sample, the tunnel's muscle-lined walls contracted. BETA hastened her sample collection. At once, the flesh ruptured, from which acidic stomach fluid, pus, blood, and milk flooded the chamber. In a panic, the team jumped into a nearby crevasse, falling an estimated 20 meters onto a soft-padded biological chamber floor.</p>
<p>After a brief respite, ALPHA noticed GAMMA's VISTA-Type suit slumped over and still. Upon closer inspection, the helmets' glass view-visor appeared shattered, and GAMMA's body was not found within. ALPHA marked her as Missing In Action, but BETA's biometric radar indicated that GAMMA now existed in two separate locations: 5 meters behind and 6 meters beneath them, simultaneously.</p>
<p>COMMAND confirmed the signals matched a 99.6% biometric reading of GAMMA and reported the irregularity to the Director of Project GALAXIAS. Awaiting a response, COMMAND ordered the team to remain in place.</p>
<p>Around 1031 hours, the headset of each "GAMMA" instance activated and broadcast the following in base-2 numerals: "DISAVOWED DEATH FORBIDDEN."</p>
<p>ALPHA noticed a star-shaped crevice glowing neon pink, illuminating the crevasse beneath. Against COMMAND's order and in an attempt to aid the "correct" GAMMA, ALPHA escaped into the hole. In an audio communication with BETA, he described feeling symptoms of dizziness and dehydration and ordered her to follow. She denied, remaining with GAMMA's vacant suit, where she stayed for the rest of the operation.</p>
<p>At 1034 hours, ALPHA's visual relay depicted a struggle as he fell through a translucent milk flow.</p>
<p>Around 1035 hours, the Director of Project GALAXIAS responded, ordering COMMAND to hasten the operation. An argument erupted in the COMMAND control room over whether they should halt the operation prematurely.</p>
<p>Soon after, large amounts of milk flooded into the control room from an unknown source. ALPHA's vitals were detected at the back of the Operations Theater, contradicting his presence within SCP-4475. COMMAND dispatched an armed security team to investigate.</p>
<p>Other personnel — who were attempting to escape — discovered that all egress doors had been pasted shut with a curdled milk substance. COMMAND alerted the local emergency Mobile Task Force at once.</p>
<p>At 1038 hours, ALPHA ejected through the teat cistern into the vacuum of space at 14 meters per second. Despite his velocity, ALPHA jolted to a stop, 1.6 km away. His footage depicted the two distant stars θ<sup>1</sup> Orionis A and B in his periphery, as well as an unaccounted for stellar abnormality ahead. The abnormality — presumed to be a supermassive gravitational anomaly at the cluster's center — emitted jets of EM radiation in each cardinal direction.</p>

</div>
<p>ALPHA made note of a large number of deceased human and proto-human organisms in SCP-4475's vicinity. Autonomous optical monitoring via nearby telemetry drone detected ~450,000 total entities.</p>
<p>At 1045 hours, ALPHA's in-suit sensor suite detected a space-time abnormality and subsequent burst of directed electromagnetic field (or EMF) radiation. The EMF energy, focused in a wide multi-colored beam filling his view, traveled at ~3 Astronomical Units<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup> per second in his direction — ~1,500 times the speed of light.</p>
<p>20 seconds later, the EMF beam enveloped SCP-4475, and ALPHA and BETA's telecommunications — as well as all five drones — went offline.</p>
<p>At 1046 hours, the emergency MTF arrived at the building and struggled to force open the front egress door. Personnel suffocated as the flow of milk in the control room reached a height of ~3 meters.</p>
<p>Eventually, the MTF breached the lobby, through which several thousand liters of milk escaped. Altogether, 12 personnel were found deceased, trapped within the control room.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">AFTER ACTION REPORT</span> While assessing CRIMSON COWBELL and the events therein, COMMAND discovered that at 1045 hours, every electronic device in both the Operations Theater and SCP&amp;D farm had received an identical foreign transmission. As translated from base-2 numerals, the message reads "SAFE AND SOUND."</p>
<p>As well, analysts reviewed ALPHA's final transmission and reached a consensus on the sequence of events. It is now believed that due to an unknown spatiotemporal event, the directed EMF beam caused the aforementioned electromagnetic anomaly detected on November 19, 2034 — some 327 days prior.</p>
<p>After evacuating the Operations Theater, security personnel detained the apparent duplicate of ALPHA and inspected it for abnormalities. No superficial anomalies were detected. The subject leaked milk and smiled.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span class="h-span">V. October 13, 2035</span></p>
<p>In the wake of CRIMSON COWBELL, no further SCP-4475-1 teleportation appears functional. All teleportation has ceased. With no known means of accessing SCP-4475 and a current lack of reliable long-distance superluminal travel, all further SCP-4475 study has been placed under indefinite hiatus. SCP-4475 is pending reclassification to NEUTRALIZED.</p>
<p>The captured ALPHA duplicate (designated <span class="h-span">SCP-4475-A</span>) relayed the following message to Project GALAXIAS personnel in written Ortothan Extraterrestrial Language (or OEL):</p>
