<p>Photo taken of SCP-7738-A instance. Note that it is only visible to those affected by SCP-7738.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the elusive nature of SCP-7738, and the lack of any leads, containment efforts are not currently possible. Currently, personnel not specifically trained in memetic resistance are forbidden from pursuing the containment of SCP-7738. Personnel with access to this file are to be assessed by foundation psychiatrists immediately before and one week after reading this document. If found to be afflicted with the early stages of SCP-7738, the patient is to be kept under constant supervision and care by Foundation psychiatrists until symptoms subside. It is unknown how many people in the public are currently affected by SCP-7738. Personnel are currently assessing the possibility of a major outbreak, and theorizing containment methods.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7738 is a memetic, infohazardous illness spread through the propagation of knowledge about its existence. SCP-7738 has a 4 day "Incubation Period" before starting to show symptoms, or in case that the affected person has strong enough memetic resistance it will die out. Full timeline of symptoms below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Days 1-4: Incubation</span><br/>
SCP-7738 remains hidden while beginning to infect Auditory and visual cortex.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 5: Initial Symptoms</span><br/>
Person affected (Hereby referred to as "patient") starts developing a consistent feeling of being watched. When not processing other auditory stimulation, they may hear footsteps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Days 6-8: Stage 1</span><br/>
During this time, the patient will start seeing movement in their peripheral vision and minor auditory hallucinations. Additionally, fabricated memories of SCP-7738-A will appear in the patient's mind, leading them to believe they are being hunted. The patient can safely be treated in this stage without adverse side-effects.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Days 9-14: Stage 2</span><br/>
SCP-7738-A manifests at a distance and place in which only the patient can observe it. SCP-7738-A demanifests if patients attempt to approach or interact with it. SCP-7738-A will appear behind any mirror or window the patient views, regardless of physical limitations. Patients show immense amounts of distress upon any sightings of SCP-7738-A, though it is unknown if this is an actual symptom or just a natural reaction. Patients in this stage can be treated without neurological damage, however lingering trauma will remain. The Occipital lobe is heavily affected at this point.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">14 Days - 1 Month: Stage 3</span><br/>
At this point, most patients start showing severe signs of mental distress, as well as extreme paranoia. SCP-7738-A sightings become more frequent, progressing from watching the patient sleep to actively 'chasing' the patient. Symptoms at this stage depend on the psyche of the patient, ranging from depression and dissociation to self harm. Currently, only one patient has survived after reaching this stage, Ethics Liaison <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-am-weird">Atlas Keyestone</a>. At this point, SCP-7738 has complete control over the Occipital and Temporal Lobes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 Months and after: Stage 4</span><br/>
Most of the Brain is either completely controlled by SCP-7738, or is at least vulnerable to further infection. Even if cured at this stage, patients will suffer immense neurological damage, including damaged vision, hearing loss, loss of fine and gross motor skills, and long/short term memory issues. Patients at this stage are extremely manic, and frequently suffer mood swings, dissociative episodes, and suicidal tendencies. SCP-7738-A sightings are constant, and cause further psychological distress. All patients that reached this stage have died, except for Ethics Liaison Atlas Keyestone.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-7738-A:</strong><br/>
SCP-7738-A are hallucinitory memetic entities manifested by the SCP-7738 infection. SCP-7738-A take the form of physically perceived space warped into the shaped of a person, estimated around 5'11". SCP-7738-A cannot physically harm or interact with affected individuals, but their presence is known to cause immense psychological distress.</p>

<p><strong>Doctors Note:</strong> I'm very happy with Atlas' Recovery under our care, though I cannot stress enough that this was a very traumatic experience for him, one that will surely affect the remainder of his life. I've attached most compiled journal entries, logs, and other media to have a physical example of the SCP-7738 infection's progression.</p>

<div class="page">
<p>I've been feeling a bit weird since I visited my <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7937">Grandfather</a>. A bit paranoid. His stories creeped me out of course, but I've been hearing footsteps- me and Kyle theorized it's the meeting room upstairs, but I'm not sure. I've been clinging extra close to him at night. When we even manage to sleep that is ;) If this keeps happening, I'll probably get a quick psyche eval or something.<br/></p>

<p>I saw it today. The monster from pop's story. I was walking back from the smoke shop and there it was. In an alley, tucked between Evelyn's and the bank. It had no eyes, but I could tell it was watching me. My heart dropped and I knew I had to get out of there. I kept passing it on the road back to the site. How did it follow me? What is it? I want to tell Kyle, but he's always so tired on tuesday nights. I'm scared.<br/></p>

Transcript of video recording found on Atlas Keyestone's phone. Dated 4/19/2023</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>[BEGIN VIDEO]</p>
<p><em>Camera opens facing Liaison Keyestone. It is clear he hasn't slept or changed in several days. His hair is dirty, and several dozen lay all across his arms in various states of healing. Dried blood coats the area around his nostrils, and his nose is crooked.</em></p>

<p><strong>Incident Report:</strong> Shortly after Senior Researcher Hill received the final text from Keyestone, he contacted site security, who proceeded to his on-site dorm. Inside they found Keyestone unresponsive and bleeding heavily from two wounds on his wrists. Besides him, a box cutter was also found. Several dozen other partially healed cuts were also located elsewhere on his body. Keyestone was rushed to the site's medical wing where he was stabilized and given 3 days to recover before being placed into psychiatric care.</p>
<p><strong>Document 11:</strong><br/>
After a 3 months in foundation psychiatric care, Liaison Keyestone was allowed to resume his work under the condition that he submitted to an interview, which he agreed to. Transcript below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Ethics Liaison Atlas Keyestone</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. W. Mearns</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, 14:23 7/25/2023&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> Hello, Mister Keyestone. How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> Good. Better, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> Great, and how is the Physical Therapy going?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> Good. I'm still having a little trouble walking and keeping food down though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> I'm sorry, Atlas. I just have some questions about what happened in march, alright?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> Yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> Take all the time you need to answer these questions, Atlas. Don't feel pressured.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> In your last text with Senior Researcher Hill, you said you were going to ask SCP-7738-A a question. I understand you have the ability to compel information through questions. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> I uh- I asked it what it was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> Did it say anything?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> No. For the first time in my life, no. I kept asking it questions. Where it came from, what it wanted. But it just stood there. Staring. Fucking staring at me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> I see. And what drove you to use the box cutter on yourself?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> What it did tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> It spoke?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> What did it tell you, Atlas?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> I asked it what it was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> And it responded?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> I wish it had.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> It just made that FUCKING grinding sound. All my life I've been able to get any answer I wanted. To just ask, and know. Sure, I've hated it at times but this thing, that lived inside me, it just decided not to. It had that power over me. I was completely at its mercy. And that's the scariest part. I just- I'm sorry. You don't need to hear all this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> …</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Mearns:</strong> Consider yourself reinstated, Liaison. You're still required to attend biweekly therapy sessions, please don't miss them.</p>
<p><strong>A. Keyestone:</strong> I won't.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Atlas Keyestone has since denied any further interviews and inquiries about his encounter with SCP-7738-A.</p>
