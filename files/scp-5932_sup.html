<p>SCP-5932 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. When removed from its unit, each instance is to be monitored at all times by no less than two handlers proficient in advanced combat training.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours, redundant SCP-5932 instances are to be euthanized. Due to the identical nature of separate instances, the specific instance chosen for termination is to be determined by random selection.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5932, formerly Charlotte Violet Owens, was a European female 27 years of age, previously employed by the Foundation as a non-anomalous operative in MTF ζ-12 ("Turtle Down")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-5932 did not differ from a baseline human beyond advanced combat capabilities expected of tactical Foundation personnel.</p>
<p>Following an apparently random timeframe<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, SCP-5932 and each subsequent instance spontaneously duplicated through an unidentified anomalous process. Subsequent instances were biologically and psychologically identical, and all instances possessed a collective memory. Each instance was capable of independent behavior and function, although research indicated that an increase in instances impaired SCP-5932's memory and sensory abilities due to human cognitive limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5932-1:</strong> Development</p>
<p>SCP-5932 was initially employed by the Foundation in 2008 as a security guard and stationed at Site-49 for four years until Containment Breach 049-21<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Following complete recovery from near-fatal injuries sustained during the incident, SCP-5932 was promoted to MTF ζ-12 ("Turtle Down") on the basis of exemplary conduct during active duty.</p>
<p>In 2013, SCP-5932 volunteered to participate in Project ASTEROIDEA, a Foundation effort to develop humanoid personnel with superior regenerative capabilities. Due to the nature of the project, only voluntary personnel deemed sufficiently loyal to the Foundation were approved for experimentation. The following files from the Project ASTEROIDEA archive have been included due to their relevance regarding the development of SCP-5932 and the initial analysis of their anomalous properties.</p>

<p>(<em>Owens is enclosed within a standard humanoid medical unit connected to SCP-████. Abelson is reviewing the components while Ito is monitoring Owens' vitals.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Initializing.</p>
<p>(<em>Abelson nods slowly.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> And you're sure — <em>absolutely sure</em>— that the fusion will be stable this time? The splice needs to be as clean as we can get it, and I'll be damned if the Committee lets us waste field agents —</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Yes, Mr. Abelson —</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> <em>Doctor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Apologies. Subject is compatible, with about a 2.4% margin of error. After accounting for SCP-████'s observed fluctuations, approximately 5.1%.</p>
<p>(<em>Abelson pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> And how high was the previous subject's margin? With adjustments, of course.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito reviews previous records.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> 3.9%, doctor. Though, all things considered —</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> — human subjects have higher genetic complexity than laboratory mice, yes, I realize.</p>
<p>(<em>Abelson pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> And the current subject has the highest compatibility with SCP-████ of all approved candidates?</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> She's the only volunteer so far, doctor.</p>
<p>(<em>Abelson pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> Interesting. I'd have thought more would've been interested at the prospect of immortality.</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> All things considered, doctor, I'd assume the prospect of human experimentation is rather off-putting in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> Well, that's your job now. Get used to it.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>System indicates completion of program.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> Ah, it's done.</p>
<p>(<em>Steam produced during the defrosting process emerges from the capsule and the central compartment opens.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Ito steps closer to observe as Owens opens her eyes.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> How are you feeling, Agent Owens?</p>
<p>(<em>Owens blinks several times in rapid succession.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Owens:</strong> I — I got a splitting headache.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito turns to look towards Abelson who appears to not notice and traces a finger along a scar on his left temple.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Owens:</strong> Everything's also kind of…blurry?</p>
<p>(<em>Owens blinks and her irises duplicate.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Agent Owens?</p>
<p><strong>Owens:</strong> What's happening —</p>
<p>(<em>Owens is unable to finish her statement before a new set of teeth develops from between her central incisors, forcing her jaw to widen to the point of dislocation. Excess tissue, bone, and flesh protrudes from both sides of her body.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Owens attempts to produce pained vocalizations, which are quickly silenced due to distortion of her neck as her clothing is punctured by a formative ribcage. A set of secondary organs developing against her exposed abdominal cavity is enveloped by developing tissue that begins coalescing into a vaguely humanoid figure.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>The two figures violently split apart, and all excess growths are excreted along with the remains of Owens' clothing. All lesions and cuts begin to heal, leaving two identical and otherwise undamaged SCP-5932 instances. Both instances appear to be in a state of shock and are in fetal positions.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Abelson:</strong> Well, let's see if we've succeeded. Sedative and scalpel, please. And keep her hand still.</p>

<p>Regrettably, SCP-5932-1 did not regenerate its amputated finger. However, while Project ASTEROIDEA appears to be unsuccessful, the potential applications for trained field agents with a shared consciousness are nearly limitless. It would be fascinating to see SCP-5932 returned to active duty following the 14-day quarantine, and it is my earnest hope that the fruit of my labors can be put to good while I continue progress.</p>

<p>Despite your adamant insistence, SCP-5932 has continued to duplicate and is currently at 64 instances.

It's only been <em>one week</em>, and we're already approaching the uppermost limits of our site.</p>

However, O5 Command has voted unanimously to allow an exception in the case of SCP-5932 so as to prevent our site from falling into disarray.

<p><em>Those who are dead are not dead</em><br/>
<em>They're just living in my head</em><br/>
— <em>42</em> by Coldplay</p>
</div>
<p>Josie,</p>
<p>Every time one of me falls, it's like a little bit of me dies with it. And I know it's crazy, because I'm still alive, but I just have to wonder, at what point do I stop being me?</p>
<p>It's like Gabriel's Horn — that recursive geometry thing you used to be so obsessed with. Every time one of me dies, I'm half of what I used to be, but I'm never all the way gone. But what's it even mean to live if I'm a fraction of a fraction of myself?</p>
<p>And then there's you. God, I miss you so much.</p>
<p>Josephine Lillian Whitley. Still don't know why I put up with your theories and thought experiments and whatever. Too smart to be a grunt. Hell, too smart for me —</p>
<p>Me. Charlotte Violet Owens. I guess underneath it all, I'm just another dumb girl scared of dying or falling in love. Too careful for my own good, too ambitious for anyone around me. Did you ever even know how I felt about you? Did you ever feel the same way?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I hope you did. I hope you knew that I was only ever so scared of dying because I was scared of leaving you. I hope you knew that every time I called you an idiot, I was really calling myself an idiot, because I only needed to tell you I love you but I marched around in circles trying to run from myself because I was afraid.</span></p>
<p>I hope you forget me. I hope you don't give a fuck about Charlie Owens, or where I am, or how I'm doing.</p>
<p>I hope I forget, too.</p>
<p>Then I won't have anything left to lose.</p>

<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Would tea help?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 scoffs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Tea is just a way for rich people to sell dead leaves.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito smiles.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Josie — a, um, friend of mine from Turtle Down.</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Mhm.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito places the cup on a desk.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Personally, I think of tea as a way to honor that which has already gone.</p>

<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> It's not that I don't know one of us is going to survive. It's just that — I can't help but wonder whether I'm the one that dies this time.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> And the sheer — sheer utter <em>hopelessness.</em> Like — like a butterfly in a hurricane. I can't help but be <em>terrified.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> I could die, or I could live to die again, but there's only so much of me to kill.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> I'm sorry. I mean, I can't ever understand — but I hope that, maybe, it gets better —</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 scoffs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> How could dying get "better"?</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> I —</p>
<p>(<em>Ito pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> I was thinking that — thinking maybe one day, death itself becomes so familiar that you're like good friends.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> What, like me and you? Not unless I have some serious Stockholm syndrome.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 lays back down and turns away from Ito.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Why did you volunteer for ASTEROIDEA?</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 pauses.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Yes. It was in your medical file.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 nods.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Kind of ironic how I volunteered for ASTEROIDEA to run from death, and now I face it every day…</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Like I said before, only people are worth dying for. I didn't know what ASTEROIDEA was going to do to me, but I did this for Josie. And now —</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 swallows.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> I don't think I'll see her ever again.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>

<p>Josie, do you remember when we used to lay down in our bunks and fall asleep listening to X&amp;Y, or A Rush of Blood to the Head, or whatever you left on that night? That's how you got me into Coldplay in the first place — and that's how I got into <em>you.</em></p>
<p>I used to wish that I was lying next to you, and we'd be staring at the stars over a beach, and it would just be you and me, forever.</p>
<p>Now, I'm just glad I remember.</p>
<p>Ito thinks that I'm overwriting old memories because humans only have so much mental storage. Hell, I can't remember my middle name now. Don't know how long it's going to be until I forget my whole name. And then how much longer until I forget you?</p>
<p>And once I do, what's the point?</p>
<p>I mean, who am I anymore? It's like the Charlie that used to exist isn't the same as the one that exists now — not sure if it's because something was taken from her, or if it's because she's just not complete anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher:</strong> Senior Researcher Ezriel Abelson</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Personnel:</strong> Unnecessary*</p>
<p><strong>Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:</strong><br/>
☐ Excessive Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario<br/>
☐ Excessive Danger<br/>
☑ Expense<br/>

<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Do you know why Owens was afraid of death?</p>
<p>(<em>Ito pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> I don't think Owens was afraid of dying. She was ready to die. She volunteered for ASTEROIDEA. It's just that —</p>
<p>(<em>Ito pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> I think most of us aren't scared of dying, you know. I think we're just scared of losing what we love — scared of losing who we are.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> But even if you aren't who you used to be — even if the old you is dead — that doesn't mean you don't belong, or that you deserve to die. And I —</p>
<p>(<em>Ito pauses.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> If it were up to me, I'd say you deserve a chance to live. Not as who you were, but as who you would have been. A life where you don't have to live as though death were your shadow, but you don't have to fear it, either.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 sighs.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> I guess it's too late for that, though.</p>
<p>(<em>Ito nods slowly and approaches SCP-5932-1 with the syringe.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Ito:</strong> Think of it like going to sleep.</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1 smiles sadly and looks up at Ito.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5932-1:</strong> Will I wake up?</p>
<p>(<em>Ito swallows and slowly presses the syringe into SCP-5932-1's forearm.</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>SCP-5932-1's eyes roll back and their body falls limp.</em>)</p>
