<p><em>&lt;SCP-8855 walks up to a tree within its enclosure, bracing itself against it. Professor Alsvart fumbles with a pen and notepad, setting them down hurriedly on a plastic fold-up table as Director Moose approaches through the grass.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Moose— Tilda. Tilda— Moose.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>Haa-haa.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose extends their hand to Alsvart, who gives her a confused look. Rather than taking it, she quickly pulls them into an embrace. Moose is surprised, but reciprocates with a soft smile.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I'm sorry for eating into your schedule like this, with a meeting that isn't just business. I'm sure a great many people have an urgent need of you at any given moment, but— I haven't seen you in so long.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I know— no, it's fine. I've had an unfortunate couple of days. I'm glad to be outside, with friends. I need something easy… to take my mind off things.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart releases Moose from her grip and steps back.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> This place isn't good for you, you know that? You can't keep working yourself to the bone like this.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Someone's gotta do it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> And <em>someone's</em> gotta take care of you, Tilda. Please, sit.</p>
<p><em>&lt;They both sit down across from each other on a pair of plastic fold-up chairs. SCP-8855 ceases bracing itself against the tree and begins to wander.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I see it on your face; questions. Far be it for me to delay your curiosities, <em>ask away.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I got the notice from security about this thing. No indication of anomalous attributes or of external subterfuge; it's been cleared for release outside the perimeter. I take it you're the reason it's still here?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Ye-up! I blocked its release. I just had to test one last thing. Plus… do you really think a <em>three-hundred-plus</em> kilogram beast like that could've slipped by <em>our</em> perimeter unnoticed? <em>Really?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Stranger things happen.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. SCP-8855 appears to be inspecting the grass around its enclosure.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Enlighten me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Someone as well-read as you, how much do you know about "Fylgja"?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose stares blankly at Alsvart.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> F-Y-L-G-J-A.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Ah. Hm… I've seen the name under the category of 'guardian spirit'. Never did read up on them myself, though.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> A guardian spirit indeed! A <em>follower</em> — that's what "fylgja" means — tied to fate and fortune. They manifest mostly in dreams, in feminine form, sometimes as animals representative of it's owner's spirit. Though "follower" <em>is</em> a bit of a misnomer, as they actually walk ahead of them, act ahead of them. So they're guides, of sorts.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose stares curiously at Alsvart.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Their animal forms usually appear in the dreams of others to forewarn the fate of its owner. But, when that form can be seen <em>by</em> the owner? It is a clear omen of death — <strong>impending</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. Moose continues to stare, patiently waiting for Alsvart to make her point.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Gosh, when'd <em>you</em> start making such liberal use of the silent treatment? Fine! What if I told you this— <em>&lt;pointing to SCP-8855&gt;</em> —is <em>yours</em>?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose takes a moment to look at Alsvart, then at SCP-8855 for a while, then back at Alsvart.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Why, just because…?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <strong>No</strong>, dummy. Not because it's a <em>moose</em>. It's— <em>&lt;she scoffs.&gt;</em> Have you had any weird dreams as of late?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I haven't <em>been</em> dreaming as of late. Haven't had the time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> See? This is why we never spend time together anymore! This place isn't good for you. Always busy, busy, busy. Well, I <em>have</em> been dreaming— <em>&lt;again, pointing to SCP-8855.&gt;</em> —of her. Two nights in a row, now.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> So I can say that someone did their job properly… Alsvart, do you have anything to go off here besides circumstance and conjecture? <em>Are you certain you haven't just had moose on the mind?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Well I… <em>I suppose in certain ways you could say I have.</em> But… very well. I'll recount what's been my primary focus for the past couple days. I <em>just</em> got back — yesterday — from my vacation in Greece, throughout which I was re-reading 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' for the… fifth time. So, n—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You never left the hotel room, did you?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> …the Aegean Sea looked just fine through the window. <em>&lt;Pause.&gt;</em> Anyway, so, no, I haven't had <em>moose</em> on the mind. Last I heard they aren't native to the Mediterranean anyway.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-8855 stops moving and locks its gaze upon Alsvart, laying its ears back and raising its hair.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I'll grant you that a coincidence like this, in our line of work, <em>could</em> be an assumed manifestation of anomalous influence. But you need more than that.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart pauses and exerts herself greatly to maintain eye-contact with Moose, putting on a fake smile before speaking.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> How's your sex life?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose closes their eyes and belabors their breathing, beginning to speak shortly before opening them again.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>What?</em> It… really is lovely catching up with you — Reine — but we <em>are</em> working.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Clearly. It must be difficult for you, when everyone's too afraid to speak up to the big boss. I understand, of course, the power imbalance. You're in charge, where would you go looking? <em>Other site directors?</em> Not a very big pool… not a very good looking one.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> And what, exactly, could've possibly indicated to you that I had even the slightest gleaming interest — at all— in discussing such a topic with <em>you</em>?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> No, no. I know that, Tilda. I know.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shattered-love" target="_blank">Not since Alison</a>, right?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose stares at Alsvart with a gaze that threatens harm.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> She must be a <em>pretty</em> difficult one to top, huh?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You're pissing me off n—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> You said I needed more. <em>&lt;She turns toward SCP-8855.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;After a moment's delay Moose does the same. SCP-8855 is now standing on the immediate opposite side of the enclosure fence, staring at Alsvart, agitated. It takes a violent bite at the fence. Alsvart hides a frown from Moose's view.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> It's not just you. In my dreams, when it came to me, I always thought of you. My mind had difficulty differentiating its behavior, its image, from yours Like it was an interobject, somewhere in between. In my dreams I saw it walking away, towards… someone. I don't know who.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose continues to look toward SCP-8855.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> They walk ahead of you, act ahead of you. As it is now, is how you soon will be. In dreams they come to guide you, or others—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose interrupts, standing up and turning towards Alsvart.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> This is <strong>not</strong> how we test! You set an appointment, you state your suspicions, you outline procedure! You do <strong><em>not</em></strong> drag a co-worker into a meeting and blindside them with inappropriate questions in a selfish gambit to corroborate your theories!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I'm sorry, Tilda. I didn't want to hurt you, but I had to prove it to you!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. Moose remains standing, staring.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> And I haven't seen you in so long.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose turns, and leaves without a word. Alsvart sits still for a while before picking up the pen and notepad on the table. She looks at SCP-8855, which has already sauntered off through its enclosure. She begins to write.&gt;</em></p>

I'm looking out of a window in my home. The view is familiar to a point that I almost don't recognize it. It's the one from my office at Site-19. The field is dew-laden; it's morning, I can see a dark figure dancing on the treeline, half-obscured by a gentle fog at our feet. The cold wind makes me shiver, and the treeline upon which it stands is one straight, unending threshold stretching from horizon to horizon. Looking back, there is no home, no Site-19. The threshold surrounds me, a circular clearing of a dense forest. I'm surrounded and alone. I know I'm alone.<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
The figure accompanies me, it smiles at me lovingly, its darkness warms me in the chilly fog. Over its silence I find it hard to hear myself speak. I don't know what I'm trying to say, or why I feel such a desperation to say it. I'm not even sure who I'm speaking to. It reaches out and I want more than anything to pull it into my embrace…
<p>But I know I'm alone. An ever-present heartbeat pauses as I'm struck by a pervading sense of self-awareness. I know I'm dreaming. I know I'm about to wake up. I turn away from the figure, and I say nothing.</p>

<p><em>&lt;Moose is standing by their office window, gazing out on the field and SCP-8855's enclosure. Alsvart is sitting by Moose's desk, she appears saddened, lost in thought.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Listen closely, Reine. I'm prepared to leave yesterday's indecorum at the door — that is — on the condition that you start behaving like an adult. It's cards on the table now, you will be straight with me. <em>Is that understood?</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose turns to face Alsvart, who nods sagely.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Good.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose sits down in their chair. Alsvart rubs her right eye.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Did you hear what happened to Site-118?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(despondent)</em> Yes, tragic.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> It is, more and more common nowadays. Yet all things considered <em>&lt;Pause.&gt;</em> I think they got lucky. I'm saying this on the record since only you and I will have access to it — I think it's a little unfair.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Even you can only give me thirty minutes a day, even with your life at risk. We all signed away our right to fair treatment at the door.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Every day I'm surprised when you still walk into work, talking like that. No, not in that sense. I'll never resign to some omen, but let's say, hypothetically, that my time's nearly up. I really don't appreciate the heads up, frankly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I did say sorr—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Not from <strong>you</strong>, dummy. From <em>it</em>. Why show up… however long in advance, to tell me that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it? If death stepped through <em>that</em> door and said to me "Time's up." all I'd want is a word in before I go. Maybe an elbow too, just to see how far I could get.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(sarcastically)</em> Really?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> 'Death' in this case referring to the actual immutable force of fate here to collect its due — that due being me. Were an anthropomorphic or some otherwise manifest 'death' to come through… <em>&lt;Moose taps their coat pocket.&gt;</em> Every director carries a little something for the occasion. It's a bit of a fifty-fifty, but if we do go down, it won't be alone. My point being, no matter her form, in her unflinching face, death is just death. That's fine with me. But now? This thing, it's forcing me to wallow in it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> And you don't think there's anything that can be done?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Like I just said, <em>I will not</em> resign my fate to an omen.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> We could always decommission it. For all we know this thing is only manifesting a subset of a fylgja's conceptual qualities. My family has no history with anything similar to it, which, if it's real, they probably should've. At least to some extent. It might be… a behavioral lynch-pin to which an entity — I — am anomalously attracted. No lynch-pin, no pull. Besides, we've seen no evidence of fate having any part in this, it could be a wholly behavioral/temporal anomaly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Or, equally likely…</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I go down with the pin. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> But that's why you're here, Reine. You're the expert. This is it, time to lay your cards on the table for me. What do they say?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>I hope that's not the only reason you keep me around.</em> Fine, fine.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart is silent for a while.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> In your dream, you refused this figure, who had come for you. Why?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> It obfuscated itself. Only presented itself to me as some vague form. How could I trust it? Never showed me its face, not even its real figure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Figure— it's a bit much to ask on your first dream, no?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose looks away briefly from the camera.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <strong>My point being</strong>: it didn't strike my dreaming mind as very… 'guiding'. It was hiding from me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I did actually <em>read</em> your transcript, you know. You're skipping a couple things.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> It was a dream, Reine. No one's really themselves when suffering a severe case of disjunctive cognition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I'd have to contest that, it's in our dreams when we're freed of our inhibitions! Dreams are where our suppressions come to dance and taunt our childish denials of their existence. There's a truth in that dream, Tilda. And you couldn't hear yourself say it.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Well, I… I don't even know what I was trying to say. It was just… some desire to— to say anything at all. But I guess there was nothing to say.</p>
<p><em>&lt;A notification on Moose's phone interrupts them. They grab it from their pocket and glance at the screen before quickly returning it. Alsvart looks on with a smug and curious smile.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Care to share with the class, young woman?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>&lt;Sighing deeply.&gt;</em> Just another SCP-8855 activity update. Let's move on.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Trying your best to ignore it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I refuse to legitimize it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Did you know that when an animal fylgja dies, it's said that a part of her owner — who is soon to follow — has already moved across that threshold. They exist in this… liminal sphere on their way into another world. In this condition, their typical behaviors and attitude changes. So, someone of few words might become one of many, for example.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You're suggesting we decommission SCP-8855 in order to make me into a better speaker?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart laughs.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(gleefully)</em> No, sweetheart. Of course not. I'm laying the cards on the table for you. Have <strong>any</strong> of its behaviors diverged from your own?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose sighs deeply.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> No. Though I stopped reading them a couple hours ago.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Just like with the dream, Tilda, I don't think denial is the ideal approach.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I'm well aware of what this is, I deny nothing. I simply don't <em>particularly</em> enjoy regular updates on how precisely I'm going to be acting in the immediate future. Conjures one too many memories of McDoctorate's cafeteria lectures on determinism at Site-17. Among other things.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Why don't we take a live look instead then?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Before Moose can react, Alsvart jumps out of her seat, quickly reaching the office window in order observe SCP-8855. Moose plants their elbows on the desk, and their face in the palm of their hands. In its enclosure, SCP-8855 appears frustrated, biting branches off the tree within its enclosure and throwing them away. It suddenly stops, standing still for a bit before walking away, slowly.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I see. <em>&lt;Turning to Moose.&gt;</em> Well don't get frustrated with me yet, I haven't done anything!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose's head remains in the palm of their hands. They are completely still, save for the occasional wave-like twitch of their upper-body. They're sobbing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Tilda? <em>&lt;She pauses, taking a step closer.&gt;</em> Tilda, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart continues to step closer to Moose.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I'm truly sorry.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Sorry for <strong>what?</strong> You haven't done <em>anything</em>. You're having the time of your life just fucking around!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> It's not—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>What have you done so far besides torment me?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I swear I was— I was trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart cups Moose's head in one hand as she seizes a gentle hold of their chin with the other.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> It's just, when I'm here, with you… after so long. I can't contain myself.</p>
<p><em>&lt;With her thumb, Alsvart wipes a lone tear from the Director's cheek. Moose arrests Alsvart's arm, grabbing and pulling it down away from her face, looking up into her eyes. They pause.&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You shouldn't flirt with your boss, it's unbecoming.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(Under breath)</em> So now you have things to say…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose lets go of Alsvart's arm with a gentle flare, establishing an illusion of distance with the application of a soft pressure on her body, before gesturing firmly to the empty seat.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Sit.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Yes ma'am.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart makes her way, slowly, around the table and sits down opposite to Moose, who rubs their eyes of remnant tears before resting their arms on the table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Tell me exactly what I told you at the start of this meeting.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> "Cards on the table."</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>Start behaving like an adult.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> What's more adult than being straight with someone? I may not be the Black Queen herself, but I can certainly—</p>
<p><em>&lt;With a flat affect and moist eyes Moose stares unflinchingly through Alsvart, who seems to take the hint. She drops her grin, and readjusts herself before she continues speaking.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I apologize for my behavior, Director. I'll get right back to it for you. But this figure in your dreams, there is no doubt in my mind it <em>is</em> your fylgja, like SCP-8855. Though SCP-8855 is only a mirror of yourself — a guide — this figure? They are your <em>guardian</em>.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I know you feel stuck, Tilda. But you're not alone. You just need to grab the hand that's reaching for you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart reaches across the table and grabs a hold of Moose's hand.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Trust me.</p>

I'm so tired… my eyes begging for me to give in. I turn my head, and I see the figure laying beside me. It stares wakefully up at the sky. Welling up inside me, butterflies, a desire to get its attention. I almost speak, refraining only in a tacit knowledge that it's already upon me. I… want to see what she sees. I turn again to the sky — it's all white. An unending film in all directions… and no less.<br/>

My hushed heartbeat spikes and I'm on my feet; I've forgotten why I'm here. I recall nothing except: her singular touch, clutch, and erasure of drifting tears. The forest encircles me utterly, again. But I know… now, I'm not alone. <em>She</em>'s here. She's here for me. I see her standing upon the treeline, and I know I can follow her. I can trust her. I know what I… don't know who she is… no, I know. I know she'll keep me safe. I need to reach out. I don't know what I don't know. I'm missing something. That voice, God, that voice. What am I missing? It does something to me. Who am I missing? I don't know who she isn't, she… isn't, no. I know it's not. Not her. I'm missing the forest for the trees.

<p><em>&lt;Sitting by the Director's desk, Alsvart is reading from a paper file: the transcript of Moose's dream. In their seat, Moose appears embarrassed, lethargic, covering their eyes in shame as they looks to the floor.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> That is, uh… wow. I'm not sure where to begin.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose looks up and uncovers their eyes, but continues to avoid eye-contact with Alsvart.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Yeah… <em>&lt;clearing throat.&gt;</em> Well archetypically you tend to have something inappropriate to say about my personal life, or perhaps some semi-ironic negging to sprinkle in there before our work can begin.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em><strong>Ironic?</strong></em> <em>&lt;with frustrated theatrics, Alsvart raises and drops the document on Moose's desk.&gt;</em> And I object to this accusation of 'negging'. Just because you cried doesn't make it <em>negging</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Reine, I was j—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Someone's just been a little sensitive lately, haven't they?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. Moose musters the courage to look Alsvart in the eye.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> With every day that passes — your professionalism — it never fails to floor me. How'd you wake up this morning?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I've yet to ascertain if I have. Surely, I must be stuck in some nightmare.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <strong><em>Alright</em></strong>, I get it. It's time we calm this down a little, Reine. What's <em>wrong</em> with you?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>Something</em> is, indeed, wrong, Director. But it's not with me. My friend isn't listening to me and is putting their life in danger as a result. Why wouldn't you just follow the figure? <em>Like I told you to do?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I do apologize, <em>Professor Alsvart</em>, I'm not a lucid dreamer. My subconscious is in control down there, not this waking mind you're talking to right now. It seems, clearly, that my subconscious, for one reason or another, is simply unconvinced.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart prepares to say something, stopping herself just before she opens her mouth to speak.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Speak.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Just… explain it to me. What <em>were you</em> thinking?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Understand, I'm not judging. I just need to know what these thought processes of yours are and <strong>why</strong> this is happening. Now that this waking mind I'm speaking to is here, how does it rationalize the mess on that piece of paper?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose prepares to speak, and similarly stops just before opening their mouth. They takes a while, formulating their thoughts, seemingly processing some degree of shame.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I— I uh… Sorry. I know— I think that I thought… I thought it was—</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart smiles and places her hand over Moose's, who pauses, and takes a deep breath.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I think I thought it was… you. The figure. I thought it was you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. Barely visible, Moose's face reddens ever so slightly&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em><strong>Me?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> <em>(cheerfully)</em> Yes, <em>you</em>, Reine.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> You really— You think that the… that it was me?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I don't know… you don't think it's plausible?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> You're absolutely sure? You didn't think of <em>anyone else?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Who else would I be thinking about?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence. With a concerned expression, Alsvart speaks.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I really… I don't know.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose's smile suddenly drops as they withdraws their hand from the desk, Alsvart's moving ever so slightly in its direction before stopping.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I'm sorry. I… shouldn't have said that.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> No! No, don't apologize, Tilda…</p>
<p><em>&lt;Silence.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(sternly)</em> <strong>Tilda.</strong> That wasn't—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I understand completely. That was… unprofessional. I'm your boss. This wasn't okay of me. I apologize if I made you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in any way.</p>
<p><em>&lt;With a pitiful frown, Alsvart tilts her head as she speaks.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Tilda, <em>please</em>. Stop it. Do you think of yourself <strong>at all</strong> anymore? If anything, I've been much worse. Frankly, I'm shocked you haven't thrown me out of your office; the way I've been behaving.</p>
<p><em>&lt;With a stern expression, Moose's body stiffens as they look down at the table.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I am the Director of Site-19. The largest and most powerful facility in the largest and most powerful organization on Earth. Holding me to the highest of standards should be nothing less than insufficient. How I've acted… to one of my employees— <em>&lt;Moose cringes visibly at their own words.&gt;</em> <tt><em>fuck</em></tt>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> I said stop it! I'm more than just one of your employees, Tilda.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> You're free to leave, Professor Alsvart. It's not right of me to keep you here, you don't need to stay.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>Excuse me?</em> I don't give a shit, <em>(mocking)</em> <em>'Director Moose'!</em> Have you forgotten completely what's going on right now?! <strong><em>Your life is in danger</em></strong>, shit-for-brains! I'm here to help you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose says nothing.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> Fine. I understand, you don't need to say anything. Just listen. If you truly need your waking mind to go through with this. Tonight, when you go to bed, recite the following over and over as you drift away: <em>"Mind awake, body asleep."</em> Got it?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Moose nods. Alsvart sits silently for a while before standing up. She looks at Moose, despondently. She begins moving around the desk, but is stopped as Moose indicates for her to go no further.&gt;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Prof. Alsvart:</strong></span> There's no more tiptoeing around this, Tilda. You need to choose.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Alsvart leaves through the door, leaving it wide open behind her. For hours, Moose sits, staring blankly at this threshold.&gt;</em></p>

<p>—ind awake. Body asleep. I mutter to myself as I step lethargically through the grassy field outside Site-19. I stop to grab a mirror from my pocket. Looking at myself, I see nothing. I have no mirror. I've never owned a mirror. I'm dreaming. Awake. Why am I walking by the forest's edge? It isn't surrounding me anymore. I must be searching for her. In the face of my dwindling agency, I feel a profound shame. Where is she? Again the forest stretches from one end of the horizon to the other. I can only imagine its confinement to have been a product of my subconscious fears, then. A fear that it was a thing impending; my prophesied doom. Is that why I hesitated? Faced now with a simple threshold, I know I have a choice.</p>
<p>I leave, with her.</p>
<p>Or I stay, and die.</p>
<p>The forest is not the death I had feared, it is the field. The forest is her refuge for me. I turn to her, knowing she'll be there.</p>
<p>She stands, again, on the treeline. I see her clearer now, with a waking mind. The visage remains just as incomprehensible as the one gleamed by my subconscious — like seeing several of the same person beneath a layer of no one at all.</p>
<p>I can think of no one but Alsvart—</p>
<p>—and Alison. Why am I thinking of Alison? Stop it. Enough. Stop it. Shut up. Stop thinking.</p>

<p>Perhaps my mind's not quite as awake as I'd thought. I tend to have more self-control. More… control.</p>
<p>But I have no control, only a binary choice. Leave, or die. Can I really just leave? It hasn't been said, but I know it, tacitly. That if I take her hand I will be leaving it all behind. The Foundation, my co-workers, friends…</p>
<p>Just because I want to live?</p>
<p>No, of course not. Even in my subconscious I knew to repress it, to childishly deny its existence. I want to go — I want to live. I want to do it with <em>her</em>. With… Alsvart. Would she come with me? Is that selfish? No, I don't care. Why should I? I deserve to be happy… I deserve to <em>let myself.</em> The world doesn't need me at its helm. I've done enough. Hurt enough…</p>
<p>I've hurt so many people… for control. Control. Is that why I work here? To control things? I couldn't control the library, I couldn't control… Alison.</p>
<p>And that scared me. I needed… control. I needed the Foundation. But I can't even control myself, anymo— stop it. I need to stop trying. I need to give up control.</p>
<p>Is that what all this was about? Is that why SCP-8855 came here? To take my— Oh, right. She's waiting for me, isn't she? She's standing right in front of me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> I don't know who you are, even now. Why do I want to leave with you?</p>
<p>She extends to me, her hand. I can only imagine it turning a page as I sit with her in silence, reading a book.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>???:</strong></span> Of course you know who I am, Tilda. Why do you think I've come to dance here, in your dreams?</p>
<p>I give her a confused look, and rather than taking her hand, I pull her into my embrace.</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="background-image: url(http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/theme:eventyr-theme/HCAbackground.png)">
<p>I'm awoken by a blaring alarm. It's coming from my phone. A priority alert.</p>
<p>"SCP-8855 has demanifested."</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Will I?</p>
<p>Has a piece of me crossed that threshold?</p>
<p>I walk to the window. Just as it says, SCP-8855 is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>But there is… someone. Standing on the treeline beyond its paddock. Not a figure, but a person.</p>
<p>Reine.</p>
<p>Is that really her? Is she looking at me? What is she doing?</p>
<p>She turns away from me, and she steps into the forest. Just like that, what final shred of control that might've remained leaves my body. I can't stand still, not here. I need to get to her. I can't lose her. I need to hurry— <strong>I need to run.</strong> Through the open door and through the populated corridors flooded with my co-workers, I don't have time to look at any of them. I consider only, for a moment, what they might've once thought, were their director to do such a thing.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Outside, I cross the fields in no time — the grass giving way to shrubbery — but I don't stop at the forest's edge. I don't stop. I trip. I get up. I don't stop. I yell her name. I hear nothing but echos and trampled bushes beneath my feet.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Already I'm deep within the forest, the light from the forest's edge long gone. I've reached the foot of a mountain. I slow down as I happen upon a wooden trail. The ground, it feels like I'm at sea. Seeing footsteps, I follow them. Up. They go up.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<img alt="steps.jpg" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8855/steps.jpg" style="align: center;" width="100%"/>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Is this who I am now? A person who chases after someone. Is that who I am, in that sphere?</p>
<p>Step by step. I can see the top now.</p>
<p>I'm exhausted, I know I am. I must be. Should be… but I can only feel those butterflies. Consuming all else within me.</p>
<p>It's here.</p>
<p>I've made it. There she is, on a plateau, I see her. Kneeling before an overlook, rays of sunlight from the dawning sun before us darkening her silhouette.</p>
<p>I run to her.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Dir. Moose:</strong></span> Hey… why are you—</p>
<p>—crying? Did I do this? Is this because of me? What I did? You stupid fucking moron. Why did you do this to her? You have to <strong>fix this.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>(in a blubbering sob)</em> <strong>I'm sorry!</strong> Gh-od. Pl— please, forgive me. I'm so sorry. Tilda. <em>&lt;she pauses, gasping for air.&gt;</em> I cou— I could— <em>I couldn't do it anymore.</em></p>
<p>Is she talking about SCP-8855?</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> You did everything you could, love. It's okay. I'm here, it's alright.</p>
<p>I kneel down behind her and wrap my arms tightly around her waist. Immediately she grabs onto them, as if her life depended on it. I drag her closer to me. I feel her warmth and her whimper. She's so warm… so soft. I place my head on her shoulder. Instantly she cuddles closer to me. Rubbing her cheek slowly against mine.</p>
<p>We just need some time.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Her whimper softens.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>Her breathing slows.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> You're okay.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> <em>Why?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>I made you leave.</em> I tried for so long. I tried to do it, I tried to be like you. I tried to be like… <em>&lt;She begins to sob again.&gt;</em> <strong><em>I can't.</em></strong> I can't do it!</p>
<p>Like me? What is she talking about?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> But… I still needed you.</p>
<p>Those words. Said in that voice. The butterflies within me grow more restless than ever.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> I came here <em>for you.</em> I never left.</p>
<p>I don't ever want to.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> And what do you mean you 'tried to be like' me? What couldn't you do?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> Tilda— <em>&lt;She fails to contain her whimpering.&gt;</em> I need you to tell me who I am.</p>
<p><em>Who you are?</em> That's simple. You're—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> —my Reine.</p>
<p>I place a gentle kiss on her cheek, and she bursts into tears.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>What did I do?</p>
<p>Quickly I let her go and take a step back. She falls forward, gripping her stomach. Her cries morphing into a violent sob as her forehead comes in contact with the dirt. I don't know what to do. <em>What did I do?</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> <em>Tilda.</em></p>
<p>Her scream freezes me in place. I've only ever heard it… once before. I don't understand.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> <em>You're Reine.</em></p>
<p>Really? You're gonna lie to yourself?</p>
<p>But she is!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> <strong>Tell me!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, she is. Like an interobject, your mind's had difficulty differentiating her behavior, her image, from—</p>
<p>Please, don't make me say it.</p>
<p>You've denied her existence, but there she is. Sobbing at your feet. It's her.</p>
<p>She's—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> I'm—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> Alison.</p>
<p>Before my eyes this woman that I've known for years, without changing even slightly, becomes someone else.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> I tried for so long. <em>I tried working at the Foundation.</em> I tried to be there, to create someone who could be part of the thing that took everyone I loved away from me. I wanted them to be with Dad… with <strong>you</strong>. So that even if <em>I</em> could never be with you, someone else could. I tried to be that someone else.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>She raises her head.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> But I could never be anyone but myself. I couldn't bear it. Existing in a place like that. And you… talking to me like I wasn't me. I had to leave… but I needed you. <em>&lt;She turns to me.&gt;</em> I needed you to come with me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> <em><strong>SAY SOMETHING!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>How could you…</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> What have you done?</p>
<p>She stands.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> Look at me, Tilda. I'm the same Alison that—</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> Not another word.</p>
<p>I can't listen to this. I can't talk to her. I can't stay here.</p>
<p>Reine wasn't real. No, of course she was. She <em>was</em> real. She was Alison. And you loved her. You fucking moron. You knew the whole time, didn't you? What, was it easier just not admitting it to yourself? <em>ARE YOU LITERALLY BLIND?!</em> She was exactly the same, but she hadn't made any of <em>her</em> mistakes. So what? You thought it'd be <em>different</em> this time?</p>
<p>Was any of it real? SCP-8855? It knew how I would act— or did she just know me? Was there any omen at all? Any threat to my life? The dreams — the figure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Reine</span>.</p>
<p>I want to cry. I know I do. I need to.</p>
<p>No. Stop it.</p>
<p>Control yourself.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> But I can be better. I promise. I— I can still be someone else! If fate won't let you and I be together, I swear I'll do it. I promise, we can…</p>
<p>Pretend?</p>
<p>Is that what I've been doing?</p>
<p>No. She lied to me. I didn't know.</p>
<p>Sure you didn't.</p>
<p>I <em><strong>didn't!</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm gonna be sick.</p>
<p>It's too much. I turn away, back to the wooden steps. And I walk.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> You can't fix something by just walking away!</p>
<p>Alison cries. Under her breath, I can hear her speak. But I hear nothing of what she says. I can't be there for her.</p>
<p>The stairs ahead become a bright, dawning star in the space of a single blink. I stand upon the same overlook as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Reine</span> had when I found her, knelt down in the dirt. I turn to see Alison standing now before the stairway I had just approached.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> You <strong>don't understand</strong>, Tilda. How <em>alone</em> I'll be, without you. I don't know him anymore, that man who goes by my father's name. There's nothing left of the man who raised me. Or maybe I never really knew him. But you're still you. I have no one— <em>no one</em> but you.</p>
<p>Don't do this.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> <em>Please.</em></p>
<p>Please don't do this.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> <em>Please don't leave me.</em></p>
<p>Please stop…</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> My love—</p>
<p><em>Don't call me that.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> <em>&lt;She begins moving toward me&gt;.&gt;</em> I know it can work. Fate? I figured it out. It's like your Foundation. Desperate to control. But you're proof, Tilda. Proof that it's not all-consuming. It can be made to open its hand, to forget. We can be proof of fate's fickle grip, together. I told you—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> —I can still be someone else.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> Shut up! Don't you dare speak to me in her voice…</p>
<p>You sadistic piece of…</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alsvart:</strong></span> But our voices are the same—</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> —they always were. Even if you think you didn't know, Tilda. Some part of you did.</p>
<p>She's right in front of you. She has you cornered. In all but her direction you're met with a steep drop and a long fall. Did she design it this way? There's no turning around and walking away, the only way out is through… her. You need to speak, Tilda. Speak. Say something. Anything. Maybe…</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> Maybe some part of me did know… and maybe you really do need me. But it's not my responsibility to fix you. You've promised and promised and left them all shattered on the ground beneath your feet. How could you possibly think — even for a moment <em>imagine</em> — that after everything you've done… we could just be together? Because you found some new trick? Something that will finally let you dupe fate? What you've done isn't just another lie, or broken promise, Alison. You <strong>duped <em>me</em></strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> But I <em>can—</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> <strong>Understand.</strong> This is not fate speaking, this was not preordained. I am telling you this, now. In my own words.</p>
<p>It was a wilful thing, having never said this out loud. Is it not best, perhaps, for you to leave it unsaid just once more? Just for the chance that…</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> You and I—</p>
<p>No. I can't make that same mistake… just to stoke some dying light. I can never let her… I can never let myself have a way in again.</p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> —we can never be together.</p>
<p>And I see there somehow, in the Black Queen herself, a light goes out.</p>
<p>As it does in me.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>So now you have nothing to say…</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #26592b"><strong>Moose:</strong></span> I'm leaving.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> No.</p>
<p><em>No?</em></p>
<p>I look to her side, and I take my step. Yet she blocks my path without a step of her own.</p>
<p>In every direction I step, I look, she — and she, alone — stands before me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000"><strong>Alison:</strong></span> <em>(in her sternest of tones)</em> You leave with me. Or not at all.</p>
<p>She knows it won't work. Why is she doing this? You saw it. She knows we can't.</p>
<p>And yet, unflinchingly, she stares at me.</p>
<p>We're doing this.</p>
<p>Already in my hand, grabbed out of my coat pocket — a device — activated.</p>
<p>She moves, without moving.</p>
<p>Pulling me into her e—</p>
