<p><strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> SCP-6060. My name is Dr. Ozwald, and this is Researcher Prescott. Today we will be discussing your origins.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I told you when you took me that I don't know anything. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I'm alive.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Could you tell us how you went so long without being caught?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Yes, I would assume that someone would have noticed that you never shifted.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> That's not your business.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> You're at our mercy, SCP– <em>[SCP-6060 pounds its fists against the glass divider, interrupting him.]</em><br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> And that's not my name! It's Candela. I told you that.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I'm afraid per protocols we have to use your… designation.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 6060-B:</strong> SCP-6060 existence in the aftermath of the 6060-GH event</p>
<p>SCP-6060's existence is notable primarily because it's generally accepted that baseline humans do not exist following the GH-Class "Dead Greenhouse" event known as "the calamity." The anomaly is evident in that SCP-6060 was born after 6060-GH occurred, making its birth an anomaly itself. The implications of SCP-6060's existence are currently unknown, but high-profile.</p>
<p>The Foundation conducted a series of interviews to gauge the general populace's thoughts on the possibility of SCP-6060's existence before making their research known to the public. For the entirety of the interview conducted, see <a href="javascript:;">SCP-6060-AUI</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dominic Arania<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Susan Prescott<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Mr. Arania is a large organism of the order Arachnid that claims to be from an <a href="/scp-6600">alternate timeline</a> where spiders are the dominant species.<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Thank you for your time, Mr. Arania. I'm just going to ask you a few questions if that's alright.<br/>
<strong>Dominic Arania:</strong> Whatever. Just make it quick.<br/>
<strong>Prescott:</strong> What do you know about The Calamity"?<br/>
<strong>Arania:</strong> No more than anyone else. Wiped out all humans, nonhumans took over the earth. That was well before my time, it's not like I remember it.<br/>
<strong>Prescott:</strong> Understood. Do you believe the calamity wiped out all humanity?<br/>
<strong>Arania:</strong> You're asking if I believe in Civs? <em>[He laughs.]</em> No, I don't believe in civs. They're a myth meant to scare little spiders into being good.<br/>
<strong>Prescott:</strong> How do you think you would react if you met someone you knew for certain was baseline human?<br/>
<strong>Arania:</strong> Squish them. <em>[He laughs again.]</em> I don't know. Why the hypotheticals?<br/>
<strong>Prescott:</strong> Just part of our research. Perhaps a better way to phrase would be how would you feel if you met a… civ? What do you think the implications of that would be?<br/>
<strong>Arania:</strong> <em>[He is silent for several moments.]</em> I think I would be scared.<br/>
<strong>Prescott:</strong> Scared? Why?<br/>
<strong>Arania:</strong> Because it means they could come back.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Mr. Samual Barros<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Cleveland Ozwald<br/>
<strong>Others Present:</strong> Researcher Susan Prescott<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Mr. Barros is a humanoid with attributes reminiscent of a Great White Shark <em>(Carcharodon carcharias)</em>, including what appears to be a live miniature shark in placement of hair. Mr. Barros claims to be a "creature", a being who survived The Calamity by having anomalous attributes beforehand.<br/>
<strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Mr. Barros. I would like to ask you a couple of questions.<br/>
<strong>Barros:</strong> You can just call me Sam, man. And no problem.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> What do you know about "The Calamity"?<br/>
<strong>Barros:</strong> That I was alive before it. I was human. I could talk to sharks, and they didn't hurt me. Made surfing much less dangerous. Many of my memories are fuzzy. <em>[chuckles]</em> Seems those were enough to keep me alive, though. Maybe I was always part shark.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> <em>[nods]</em> As you seem to know, all humans were killed by The Calamity. But what if I told you not <em>all</em> humans were dead?<br/>
<strong>Barros:</strong> <em>[sits up]</em> You mean civs? <em>[chuckles]</em> Civs are just a myth, man. <em>[pause]</em> Unless you mean you've seen one?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> This is a hypothetical situation. In this situation, what would you do if you got to meet one?<br/>
<strong>Barros:</strong> <em>[his smile fades]</em> That… that has a lot of answers. <em>[pause]</em> I mean, I'd be happy that humans aren't dead. But, I'd be jealous, admittedly. Why do they get to be human, while I'm the one with the 50-pound shark on my head that miraculously hasn't snapped my neck?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Would you want people jealous of you, angry at you for something you can't control?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Suzie, we made it clear you wouldn't be asking questions this interview.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Sorry, I just thought it was a relevant–<br/>
<strong>Barros:</strong> No.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> <em>[remeains silent for a moment]</em> Thank you for your candor. That will be all for today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 6060-C:</strong> Testing the humanity of SCP-6060</p>
<p>In the time following the discovery and containment of SCP-6060, many tests were performed to verify that it possessed no anomalous qualities. These tests included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing of tissue sample</li>
<li>Testing of blood sample</li>
<li>Measuring vital signs</li>
<li>Exposure to items and life deemed anomalous to humans</li>
</ul>
<p>These tests occurred weekly, along with the collection of tissue for Promethean Reconstruction per Researcher Prescott's needs.</p>
<p>These logs have been expunged for irrelevancy. To request extended logs, see Dr. Ozwald.</p>

<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Why not?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> The sample collection is over. Go ahead and apply pressure for me here.<br/>
<em>[There are more sounds as Researcher Prescott begins to leave.]</em><br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …thanks.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> For what?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I don't know… not being as terrible to me as the others.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> That sounds like a low bar to meet.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Well, thanks for meeting it, doc.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I'm not a doctor.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Then what do I call you?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Um… Hm… The Foundation– the others call me Suzie.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Well, thank you for doing the bare minimum, Suzie.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Hello again…<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …Just get it over with, "SPD 6060" or whatever.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I figured you wouldn't like that.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Then why not call me by my name?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I really don't think the Foundation will like that.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> So whose wrath do you fear more then?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> It's not about who I'll make angry.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Then what is it about?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> I need to take some blood samples, along with another tissue sample. It… shouldn't take too long.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Baaaah.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> <em>[A few moments of silence pass.]</em> Huh?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Baah, you know, like a sheep. I watched some movies with them.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Yes… why are you bringing that up?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Sheep follow the herd. You do what you are told without question.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Huh? I mean… What else am I supposed to do?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I can tell that you've got an individual spirit in you.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> How– Wait, are you trying to lecture me?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Not necessarily. I know by the way you talk with me, you actually listen to my feelings. No one else here does that.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I guess that's true… I just, treat you how I'd want to be treated in this situation.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> That's what I mean. No one else does that.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I… guess I didn't notice that. Would you like me to do the same arm for your tissue sample?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Doesn't really matter to me. <em>[Pause]</em> Why are you running so many tests on me?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> To see if there's any variation from baseline humanity.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> But why so many?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> It's just what we do.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> The Foundation?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> We find anomalies. Secure, contain, and protect them.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Funny. I don't feel very secure or protected.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I believe that. Alright, we're done. Your arm will be a little sore for a bit, but you can remove the bandage in a few minutes. Let me know if you experience any unforeseen side effects or if pain persists longer than an hour.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …Thanks, Suzie.<br/>

<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Vitals and another tissue sample.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> That's… that's a lot of equipment.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Yeah. Honestly kind of overkill in my opinion. But I guess we'll start with the EKG, it's the most tedious to set up. Alright, I'm going to need to stick these on your body. I can never remember which goes to which though…<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Um, I don't… No, I won't–<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> What? <em>[Pause]</em> No, hey, hey, it's not gonna hurt. Look I know it all looks scary but it's just like… putting stickers on your body. Just some pressure, and there's not even any residue when we're finished. Okay?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Okay…<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Okay. Just gonna attach this one here… then this one here, this one– yep, you got it, and this one… I'm gonna let you do that one, right at your hip. Yep, perfect. Alright give me one second…<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …Suzie, I–!<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Breathe with me, in… and out… and in… and out… just think calming thoughts.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Like what?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Whatever you want. When I get anxious I imagine myself by a rushing river, the water clear but flowing, animals splashing in the water, birds chirping…<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> That… helps weirdly.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Good, good. And we're almost done with the EKG. We can move onto the tissue sample next, if that'll make you feel more comfortable.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Okay. …Why a river?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I'm… I don't know. <em>[Pause]</em> Okay, fine. So, one day, a long time ago, I got to leave the site, and I just started walking and I came across this river. I don't think I'd ever seen a river before. And I swear in that moment it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …So they don't let you leave either?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Um… no… I mean– yes! I mean– It's… it's complicated.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I just assumed you were one of them.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I am.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> But you're not <em>like</em> the rest of them… but you're trying to seem like you are. Why?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> …It's complicated. That's it for today. Let me know if there are any problems.<br/>

<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> <em>[silence]</em> Dr. Ozwald did this with me… A-and Dr. Kline… I don't wanna do it again.<br/>

<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> Thanks…<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> You're welcome.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> [pause] You know, in interviews with the others, I've noticed how they treat you. And things you describe, you seem isolated from them. They treat you like your lesser. Like… me.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I… <em>[silence]</em><br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> You know it's true.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> I am.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> What? No you're no–<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Yes I am. Candela… <em>[sigh]</em>. It's about time I told you what a promethean is.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Promethean?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Have you seen any zombie movies made Pre-Calamity?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I have… wait… you mean…<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> Yes. I was brought back to life. By the Foundation. Prometheans are a bit different than zombies, though. We were brought back using science. And… we constantly fight decay. These… these tissue and blood samples. While the Foundation has been using them to ensure you're a full-blooded human, they've also been used to keep me alive.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> <em>[silence]</em> You're so unique. You're like me, almost one of a kind. How come we're treated as something to be scared of? Why are they using such an amazing miracle of science to do the shit they don't want to? Were you expected to be a slave? If so, that backfired, and you need to let them know.<br/>
<em>[Twenty seconds of silence pass]</em><br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> I-I'm sorry, I shouldn't–<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> You're right. But it's not that simple either. It turns out the procedure used to revive those like me wipes our memories. I don't remember anything about who I was before I was a Promethean. This place, horrible as it is, is the only place I've ever known, these people were the ones to teach me everything I know. I can't just… leave.<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Yes, you can.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Where would I even go? What would I even do outside of the only place I've ever known?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> …Start small. Go to the river. <em>[Pause]</em> Then, if you want, legend tells of a haven.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> A haven? For whom?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Anybody who needs somewhere to go. A haven most difficult to find if those who seek it have ill intent. A haven where a human girl can have a normal childhood without anyone thinking anything of it, and a place where should she leave, she'd find herself in danger. A place she shouldn't have set foot outside.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Suppose this haven exists, and suppose I wanted to go there. How would I get there?<br/>
<strong>SCP-6060:</strong> Follow your heart. You'll know when you're halfway there.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> It’s come to my attention that SCP-6060 has escaped. I hate to point fingers, but the sign—<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> It was me. No need to drag it out.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> I knew we shouldn't have trusted a <em>promethean</em> with 6060.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Hey, Suzie’s part of the Foundation just like us.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Am I?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> What is that supposed to mean? Of—<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> The more time I spent with Candela, I came to realize something.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> Candela? You’re using its name now?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Then just call me SCP-6060-1. Because we’re not that different. Candela… she’s like me, an outcast within a world built against that idea.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> You’re not an outcast.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> You don’t treat me normally. It’s like— I’m technically still human! I… I’d ask why I have more rights than Candela, but I don’t. I’m not even allowed to leave. I’m just another anomaly you have control over.<br/>
<strong>Researcher. Youl:</strong> But you’re one of our friends! D-don’t say that stuff! <em>[pause]</em> What’s gotten into you?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> It’s not what’s gotten into me. It’s what I’ve been holding in. I never commented on this unfairness because I owed you my life. I figured the Foundation knew what was best for me. But Candela… I learned so much talking to her. All I had to do was talk to her like she was worthy of my attention, because she was. Not some object to be locked up.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Youl:</strong> Suzie—<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> What are we even doing? We’ve found like two or three things that are anomalous now, and just perform stupid tests that teach us nothing. Just face it, there’s no need for the Foundation anymore.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> That’s ridiculous! We have learned things! And we can con—<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Suzie’s right.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Youl:</strong> What?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Why do you even care about the Foundation, Bella? You weren’t alive.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> Why can’t I care about the restoration of civility just because I wasn’t alive then?<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> Do you feel guilty for being alive?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> What? What kind of question is that—<br/>
<strong>Researcher Youl:</strong> You did start acting more hostile when we found 6060.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> So did you, Jean.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Youl:</strong> I’m not letting you drag this out. Fine, I’m jealous of 6060. Aren’t we all? She got to keep her humanity while we’re all stuck like this for some dumbass reason.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> I haven’t even talked to the rest of the team. But, it looks like we’re just operating on longing of what we want. That’s no way to respect this organization.<br/>
<strong>Dr. Kline:</strong> Cleavlend…<br/>
<strong>Researcher Prescott:</strong> We never needed to secure Candela. All it did was break apart the stability we were pretending to have. It’s sad that it took this long to realize.<br/>
<strong>Researcher Youl:</strong> What… what do we do now?<br/>
<strong>Dr. Ozwald:</strong> Stop pretending.<br/>
