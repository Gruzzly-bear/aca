<p><strong>SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:</strong> The thaumaturgical test chamber #5 of the Site-139 has been designated as the containment unit of SCP-8346-B-1. In order to protect the psychological integrity of SCP-8346-A-1, the use of communication devices and oferring of literature has been approved by the Site-139 direction and the Ethics Committee, under the authorization and supervision of Dr. Carlton Wesley. For any future Foundation personnel turning into Class-F personnel in the form of a SCP-8346-A instance, the place of its particular SCP-8346-B instance will be designated as a temporary containtment location and SCP-8346-A will receive literature and communication as well.</p>
<p>nformation regarding SCP-8346 is freely available to any thaumatology specialist within the Foundation, and has been shared with the International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology (ICSUT). The future use of SCP-8346 as a procedure for investigative purposes and in field operations has been approved by the O5 Council. Accordingly, Dr. Cartlon Wesley has been set as the first director of the Applied Thanatological Thaumaturgy Department, which will be responsible for advising on and authorizing the use of SCP-8346 both at Foundation facilities and by Mobile Task Forces.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-8346 is a thaumaturgical-thanatological procedure<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> theorized and designed by Dr. Marcel Lukska. SCP-8346 is achievable through the precise and calculated combination of pre-established procedures within thaumatology. It allows the relatively brief preservation of the body and the post-death consciousness through the manifestation of a pocket dimension, within which a duplicate of the physical body will be found.</p>
<p>The thaumatological theory that composes SCP-8346 and is required for a proper understanding of it are as listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lukska Effect:</strong> It refers to a phenomenon that occurs when the brain of a thaumaturge is irradiated with ARad<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> and the taumaturge perishes while the ARad remains in place. These conditions allow the preservation of the consciousness of the deceased thaumaturge in an unstable form. The Lukska Effect occurs as long as the ARad in the brain has low pitch<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and high hue<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, and is maintained as a source of a working still to be performed. The initiator of this working is the demise of the thaumaturge, which endows the ARad a tendency to low pitch, therefore leading to a network of neural synapses that is independent of the physical brain. This consciousness is <em>forced</em> upon reality, existing non-physically, and endures in proportion to the weave of the ARad.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Beauregard Effect:</strong> The Beauregard Effect is an abnormality that can occur in a thaumic working or in a backlash when the ARad is largely compressed; this can be either unintentional or deliberate. The abnormality consists of a pronounced curvature of space-time, for a few seconds; this curve is perceptible but relatively insignificant, yet it opens up a brief window of opportunity in which creating a pocket dimension by a thaumic working is energetically doable.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Speckmann Rebound:</strong> It is a simple procedure in thaumaturgy consisting of two consecutive works. It employs any source of ARad to produce a single working and takes advantage of the backlash to do the major working, recapturing the ARad from said backlash. Generally used to reverse the ARad pitch given by the thaumic source, if necessary.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Performing SCP-8346 requires at least one subject who is a target of SCP-8346, and the support of one or more thaumaturges who specializes in spatial manipulation. An Everhart resonator<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> can be useful for the procedure. Since an individual subjected to the Lukska Effect can, to a greater or lesser extent, manipulate the residual Vital Energetic Elan of his preserved consciousness, he can do any work of low intensity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The target subject of SCP-8346 is indicated as SCP-8346-A from now on. Once under the Lukska effect he must force the manifestation of the Beauregard effect with sufficient amplitude for the space distortion to envelop the post-mortem electrical synapse network; this will be done with any thaumaturgic work of SCP-8346-A that meets the previously clarified ARad conditions.</p>
<p>This succession of steps will open up a brief opportunity with which the supporting thaumaturges will be able to create a pocket dimension, which will then synthesize with the SCP-8346-A consciousness within. This final action may be performed using a Speckmann Rebound of the thaumic working to manifest the Beauregard effect, which will make any subsequent backlash a minimal risk but will cause the final result to have low hue and a slight unstability. The pocket dimension finally created (SCP-8346-B) will be non-Euclidean and will contain chaotically dispersed physical representations of the memories of SCP-8346-A, along with a physical body of themself in which the preserved consciousness will inhabit. Physical entry into SCP-8346-B is possible and without risk, however, the size of the dimensional opening is variable<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>; telecommunications are maintained inside SCP-8346-B. The actual body of SCP-8346-A outside SCP-8346-B will not be affected, and will decompose normally once the entire procedure is completed.</p>
<p>Currently, SCP-8346 has only been successfully performed once in an experimental project developed by Dr. Lukska on Monday, June 26th, 2021, at 13:00. Resulting in the instance of SCP-8346 currently in containment (SCP-8346-A-1 and SCP-8346-B-1,). The calculations made by Dr. Lukska and other personnel from the Thaumatology Department agree on the fact that any SCP-8346-B instance will not be accessible for longer than 9 years, since the pocket dimension link to base-line reality destabilizes.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong> Actions taken at Site-139 due to the, practical, death of Dr. Marcel Lukska.</p>
<p>As indicated in Dr. Lukska's will, his wealth has been invested in the ICTUS research fund for the flattened heart syndrome.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup>, syndrome from which he himself was suffering and which partly drove his research projects focused on thanatological thaumaturgy from 2019 onwards, since he was expected to pass away in October 2021.</p>
<p>By agreement between Dr. Wesley and Dr. Lukska, Dr. Lukska's daughter, Sophia Lukska, will be up for recruitment upon completion of her currently underway studies at the ICTUS, and has been assured a position on the SCP-8346-B-1 research team. She is expected to join the Applied Thanatological Thaumaturgy Department personnel in 2025.</p>
<p>From July 6th to June 9th, 2021, two affairs concerning SCP-8346 and Dr. Lukska were held open for discussion between the Personnel Committee, Ethics Committee, Logistics and Security Department and the O5 Command. Agreeing on the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Lukska will be classified as a Class-F personnel, and thus will maintain his duties as a vital member of the new Applied Thanatological Thaumaturgy Department.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The SCP-8346 procedure will be instructed to as many thaumaturgy-specialized Mobile Task Forces and research teams as possible. As considered by the O5 Council, Class-F personnel in a SCP-8346-B state are considered a temporal but nonetheless extremely valuable human asset to the Foundation. The Applied Thanatological Thaumaturgy Department has ben founded for this purpose, with the Site-139 being its current headquarter.</li>
