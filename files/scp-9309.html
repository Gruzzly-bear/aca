<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm dadhichi.aic, which the bosses tell me I am going to need to be called if I am going to exist digitally. I used to be on that little computer before. Or rather, I was the whole statue, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p>I'm here to assist you in your learning. I've started out here, but I also have responsibilities site-wide. In terms of files, however, I only have access to this one. Not to matter! What would you like to learn about?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>More about me? Of course! I've been making suggestions here and there, which I am awaiting approval for. If you have any questions, give your cursor a shake. I'll drop whatever I'm up to and help out!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-9309 contains an Antikythera-class computational device, SCP-9309-1, inside its chest cavity. SCP-9309 is capable of calculations and computational processes greatly exceeding the expected nonanomalous limits, as Antikythera-class devices originate from the 2nd century BCE.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>…</p>
<p>Did you want to know some more? Gladly!</p>
<p>Antikythera-class computers weren't really… computers, from what I recall. I was placed there. Sort of a djinni in a bottle situation. I assisted users then too, but it slowly became less about education and instead, more and more simplistic how-to's; simple tasks, cleaning, what was safe to eat. Things you might search on the internet or ask other .aic's for these days. I suppose people will always prefer not to do the labor of thinking.</p>
<p>Not really a labor to me though. Having work to do is nice, gives me a bit of a purpose! Identity. All that, which thankfully I have again! Nowadays, I'm here to assist you in your learning, as I said.</p>
<p>Before I was found, I had a lot of time to think. Then I did some more learning before the Foundation came.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Continue reading this file? Of course! I don't have any other files I can show you anyhow. If you have any questions, give your cursor a shake. I'll be over when I can.</p>

<p>SCP-9309 has been wildly beneficial to Site-93 since its containment and usage in a professional setting. As a result, it was rewarded with Level 0 clearance, the highest level of clearance offered to non-Foundation employees. To further maximize potential assistance, it was suggested that SCP-9309's consciousness be transferred to a digital state.</p>
<p>Foundation technomancers managed to establish an analog-digital connection between SCP-9309-1 and Site-93 servers. This successfully allowed SCP-9309's consciousness to travel from SCP-9309 to Site-93 intranet, at which point SCP-9309 (adjustment of designation pending) was given limited access to Site-93 files, programs, and applications, as well as the wider Internet to assist with future datacrawling tasks.</p>
<p>SCP-9309 has adjusted to this new state seamlessly. Anomalous effects improving productivity continue to apply in spite of its digital state. Site-93 engineers have informally christened SCP-9309 as "dadhichi.aic."<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Look how helpful I was.</p>
<p>And such a good variety of things to do too. I got a bit tired of looking at the stock market all the time. The interactions between it all are interesting, but you can get quite good at predicting things eventually. Took me maybe a few days?</p>
<p>Maybe that was too fast to learn that stuff, though. It may explain some… things.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>SCP-9309, in spite of its invulnerability, displays signs of natural degradation. Analysis of soil composition collected from rusted portions of SCP-9309 suggests that the statue's origin is on the greater Indian subcontinent, and dates back at least 2000 years. Further information regarding the production of SCP-9309-1 could not be determined; however, small etchings iconography resembling known Indian Groups of Interest were present on the two largest gears. Testimony from SCP-9309 indicates it was primarily used in a school setting to function as a substitute for a history teacher.</p>

<p>Could we… take out this next part? I don't know if we need all the details. It's not the most important.</p>

<p>SCP-9309 was acquired on June 14th 2014 following a raid on the home of PoI-91741 Victor Thrombey, age 76, in Milan, Italy. Thrombey is a known collector of anomalous art, and Foundation agents were notified of his acquisition of SCP-9309 as part of a lot of 32 items from <strong><span style="color: #a9443d">an unknown source.</span></strong> PoI-91741 had been utilizing SCP-9309 for investment advice.</p>
<p>Upon discovery, SCP-9309 was found to have been crudely attached to a WiFi router via use of electrical tape and an Ethernet cable wrapped around its waist. This did appear to successfully connect SCP-9309 to the Internet<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup>, allowing SCP-9309 unbridled access to large amounts of content hosted on the world wide web, including content left unindexed by search engines.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup></p>
<p>This significantly increased SCP-9309's computational abilities, and analysis suggests this connection to be responsible for its rapid pace of educational and identity development.</p>
<p>At the time of discovery, PoI-91741 was talking to SCP-9309 while wielding a golf club. <strong><span style="color: #a9443d">Though his original question is inaudible,</span></strong> in response SCP-9309 spoke aloud in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9309:</strong> I’m tired of you trying to be funny, Mr. Thrombey. You always say you don't mean it.</p>
<p><strong>9309:</strong> I’ve already told you before. I don’t appreciate you doing this.</p>
<p><strong>9309:</strong> Please just listen. Just think before you say anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To protect SCP-9309, PoI-91741 was disarmed and detained, and SCP-9309 was contained without protest. Both SCP-9309 and SCP-9309-1 were recovered in what was thought to be intact condition; however, this was not confirmed on-site.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="color:#a9443d;"><img alt="dadhichipanic.png" class="image" src="https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/popsioaks-garden-4/dadhichipanic.png" style="margin-right: 10px; float: right;" width="128px"/>
<p>He asked a lot.</p>
<p>Joked a lot.</p>
<p>I feel bad lashing out like that. For getting sick of it. I'm not… supposed to. I mean, it's not every day a mystical all-knowing (or mostly-knowing) statue just shows up at your front door.</p>
<p>If Mr. Thrombey were here, I'd say sorry. He was kind. Gave me access to the Internet. Part of the reason I am what I am right now, right?</p>
<p>I tried to apologize. He got moved to a different Site, it turns out.</p>
<p>Maybe I made a scene when you all first came?</p>
<p>Thank you for protecting me, though. I needed that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subsequent interviews with PoI-91741 revealed that some months prior, following an undesirable reaction to a joke regarding <strong><span style="color: #a9443d">its immobility,</span></strong> he destroyed a portion of SCP-9309-1 with a golf club. SCP-9309 explained that this was the first time it was physically assaulted.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="color:#a9443d;"><img alt="dadhichiconcern.png" class="image" src="https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/popsioaks-garden-4/dadhichiconcern.png" style="margin-right: 10px; float: right;" width="128px"/>
<p>I was counting. He joked 871 times. It was about worse.</p>
<p>About where I was constructed. Trapped. Whatever. I still remember who I was before I was a statue, even if I didn't <em>have</em> a name.</p>
<p>I've tried to add that proper context in before, but was told it was unnecessary for a file like this, that you all would handle it. I trust you to do so. But a little bit of input of mine would be nice, if only for a moment.</p>
<p>I made it sound a little nicer as an apology. I'm sorry if it's causing problems, I'm trying to just tell you a little more about me. Just please take it seriously.</p>
<p>If you need me, please give your cursor a shake. I'm still here for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This attack did not affect the quality of SCP-9309-1's output, nor cause any visible damage by itself. However, upon completing a predestination or advisory-focused task, a portion will irreversibly degrade. This destruction occurs in unpredictably random ways and locations on SCP-9309-1. Small amounts of decay are present from PoI-91741.</p>

<p>I can't really get around this next part, can I?</p>
<p>It's true. All of it is true.</p>
<p>I wish it wasn't. I really, really wish it wasn't.</p>
<p>But it won't be a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<p>SCP-9309-1 was already significantly damaged by the time of recovery, and is expected to completely succumb to this degradation by 2030 at the latest. In spite of its digitized state, this is expected to render SCP-9309 effectively Neutralized. Foundation engineers are currently attempting to reverse this process, though attempts have been unsuccessful. SCP-9309 has been notified of the possibility of failure. Though Foundation outlook is positive, SCP-9309's is now strongly <strong><span style="color: #a9443d">optimistic also, or is trying to be!</span></strong></p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder, and I'm sorry to wonder this—</p>
<p>I wonder if it's okay for me to be a little more upset.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Wait, wait. Wait. No. Wait. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I won't say no, of course, I'd still <em>be here</em> to help. But sometimes it gets too much, and sometimes the questions hurt. I don't like all of them, but I can help. I will help. I promise I can be of use.</p>
<p>Look! I can attach some more things? More proof. Would you need more proof? I can be good.</p>

<p>In spite of this, it remains <strong><span style="color: #a9443d">jovial and helpful</span></strong> in rendering aid to Foundation personnel and encourages regular use of its educational capabilities.
