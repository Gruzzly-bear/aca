<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Emergency Protocol KELLOGG has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scranton Reality Anchor Array #12 has been deployed and activated at Area-0219 to impair the effects of SCP-3918-1. The survival of SRAA #12 has been assigned top priority.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foundation Deep-Space Defense Network ELIOS has been placed under alert in anticipation for the deterrence of a high-threat anomaly. Current estimated probability of successful deterrence: 53.2%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Overseer Mandate 56991.E27 has gone into effect. As such, all personnel of essentiality rating <span style="color: #b784a7"><strong>Mauve</strong></span> or higher are to be immediately relocated to Site-519 in preparation for a K-Class event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All other necessary preparations for the survival of a ΦK-Class End-Of-Earth<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> scenario are to occur immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Foundation satellites are to constantly monitor for instances of SCP-3918-1 on an impact trajectory with Earth. MTF Ξ-9110 ("Armed Nuns") are to be dispatched to neutralize these instances as they appear. Lethal force has been authorized for contact with hostile entities under its influence.</span> All allocated resources are to be focused on the implementation of Protocol KELLOGG.</p>
<p>Recent estimations project an immense loss of life should SCP-3918 surpass all contingencies and reach Earth. Should SCP-3918 breach the perimeter established by ELIOS, threat-level <strong>MOJAVE BLACK</strong> is to be declared, and the use of all necessary deterrents will be authorized. Currently, SCP-3918 is 768,800 km away from the nearest ELIOS installation and will make contact in █ days and ██ hours.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3918 is the designation for a Class-X Reality Restructuring Entity currently traveling through deep space. At its current speed and trajectory, SCP-3918 will encounter the Earth on ██████ ██, ████. Through satellite imagery, it has been observed to possess the form of a human female, albeit lacking any facial features or upper limbs. Various thaumaturgic symbols are carved into its surface, although the significance of this has yet to be determined. It has been measured to be 38,300km in height.</p>
<p>Prior to its current designation, SCP-3918 was originally believed to be an anomalous structure that impacted the Earth's surface on April 13th, 2020 (It has since been designated as SCP-3918-1.) SCP-3918-1 is an oblong object comprised of a crystallized material approximately 8 m in height. Various signs consistent with those found on SCP-3918 mark its outside surface.</p>
<p>Initial investigations of SCP-3918-1 were prevented by the aerosolization of undetected compounds which caused anomalous and contagious hypersexuality in members of the kingdom <em>Animalia.</em> The resulting high volume of sexual activity in the research team initiated an event in which SCP-3918-1 proceeded to rapidly generate pockets of reality consistent with lunar terrain and accompanying vacuums in the area, now designated as Area-0219. Scranton Reality Anchor Array #12 was then deployed to Area-0219 and was activated, preventing the continuation of the event. Following this, no other instance of SCP-3918-1 has made contact with Earth.</p>
<p>Approximately four hours after the successful deterrence of SCP-3918-1, Foundation Deep-Space Defense Network ELIOS registered a field of temporal distortion roughly 3.5 light years away from Earth. Shortly after its discovery, hume levels surrounding the distortion dropped dramatically, leading to a destabilization of reality in the area. SCP-3918 then emerged from the distortion shortly before its instantaneous collapse and began its course to Earth.</p>

<p><em>-Chapter XVI of the Sacred Texts</em></p>
</div>
<p>As of Overseer Mandate E001.421, RAISA has been granted approval for the complete suppression of evidence of the existence of GoI-3918: "The Church of the Starved Goddess." The means of doing so have been left to the Administration's discretion. In addition, Overseer Mandate E001.421 has authorized the development of E-Class "LAST RESORT" countermeasures to the threat imposed by SCP-3918 and its following. The implications of such developments have been accepted by the Overseer Council with 7 voting in favor, 5 voting in opposition, and 1 abstaining.</p>
<p>Current information suggests that GoI-3918 is a loosely-organized monotheistic cult estimated to possess a following of approximately 15,000 individuals. Its main objective is to prepare Earth for what it refers to as "The Day of Eternal Pleasure," in which Earth is terraformed by SCP-3918 into a state resembling the Moon, through the use of thaumaturgic energy generated by a species-wide collective sexual act. Following this "rebirth," the now-barren Earth is to be utilized in SCP-3918's construction of "Him," a separate entity whose purpose is to satisfy its desires. Translation of the church's sacred texts has confirmed the date of this occurrence to be April 13th, 2020.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the Church of the Starved Goddess has resulted in the discovery of Uri'Arkana, a temple initially believed to be of a different origin. Several anomalous artifacts recovered from within the temple suggest that the Church has been in existence as early as 250 A.D, although no records stating its existence have been found within the surrounding cultures. Written records discovered in the temple's archives contain several references to SCP-3918 under the name "Anukeana." The Department of Linguistics has produced a translation of a section from these texts. (See Document-3918-A12.)</p>

<p>Document 3918-A12 is a section derived from a large series of texts pertaining to the supposed history of SCP-3918. In its entirety, it spans 24 "Chapters" spread over three consecutive tomes known as the Sacred Texts. This specific section is derived from Chapter VI.</p>

<p><em>In the Second Rising, it was Anukeana who protested Segrasi.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>"He is the darkness." She would sing. "The darkness must be outshone by the light."</em></p>
<p><em>And so, the Goddess conducted her work. In the early hours of the night, she crept into his chambers and laid with him. She coaxed the sin from his veins and purged it in the explosion of her own satisfaction. He was born anew into the dawn, a disciple of her Highness. She had destined him to be her voice in the East, and he was cast out to spread her word.</em></p>
<p><em>Her Highness was restless and without fullness. A fire burned within her heart and loins, the offerings of even sub-divine men being without complete satisfaction. She yearned for something of her own status, another God, another part of her that could outlast the puny lives of those who she accepted in her chambers. Her greatness was limitless, but even it could not offer her an end to her predicament.</em></p>
<p><em>The followers had offered their voices to her ear. Isolated, they were useless and without guidance. Collected, they could surpass even the false gods of the West. They beseeched their true goddess to unify them, to make them whole, to bring them into her breast and create what she desired most. The ultimate sacrifice was a solid commitment to their deity, and they accepted it without hesitation. She smiled upon them and granted them their wish.</em></p>
<p><em>He was to be constructed from the Universe, although she hesitated in choosing to do so. The Universe was no longer new. She considered it to be shameful in its disregard for pleasure. If she were to bring about the embodiment of her desire, she was to clean the sin from the materials that would build him: The fiery stars and the planets tainted with sickness that would poison him…</em></p>
<p><em>And so, the Goddess set out on her holy voyage, a mass exodus of evil and darkness, granting her grace upon those who were willing to convert without struggle…</em><br/></p>

<p>In the days proceeding the events surrounding SCP-3918-1, the Church of the Starved Goddess conducted several offenses on the Foundation, utilizing a combination of highly-advanced weaponry and thaumaturgic artifacts. To date, there have been seven recorded instances of terrorism conducted at the hands of the Church against both Foundation sites and civilian cities. Previous occurrences of similar natures are currently being investigated for connections to GoI-3918.</p>
