            <h1>SCP-1550</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All adult SCP-1550 specimens are to be contained in a sealed 5m by 5m by 5m terrarium simulating desert conditions under electronic surveillance and implanted with tracking devices. In event of an escape, the affected sector will be locked down until all specimens have been recaptured. SCP-1550 eggs are to be kept in their airtight packaging apart from in testing. The total population of SCP-1550 adults is not to exceed twenty at a time, with further specimens being terminated and their corpses incinerated. All testing must be approved by Level 3 staff or higher. All uncontained instances of SCP-1550 discovered must immediately be killed on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Item SCP-1550 is an apparently artificial species of unknown classification whose larvae have the ability to undergo metamorphoses into a form which is adapted for their environment. However, despite adaptations, all specimens possess a tattoo-like set of markings on their underbelly reading [DATA EXPUNGED] - a Dr. Wondertainment Trademark" and none will grow to over ██ centimeters in length. Due to SCP-1550's powers of adaptation, it is unknown if the species has an original form, and if so what it is. SCP-1550 eggs are 1-centimeter-long flesh-toned ovoids, which will only hatch if exposed to air. When packaged, they are stored under airtight plastic seals apparently for transport. Dissection of unhatched eggs reveals them to simply contain a biological mucoid substance containing fragmentary DNA of unknown origin. As adult SCP-1550 specimens appear to be sterile it is unknown how the eggs are created.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a tank of seawater and allowed to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-1 has gills along its upper back behind the eyes, and flattened and broadened tails to serve as paddles for swimming, and produces specialized mucus to protect its eyes from salt damage. It has a swim bladder revealed upon dissection in its lower █████ and [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Skin coloration was also a mottled blue, presumably to blend in with seawater.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a tank of water taken from a river behind Site ████ in which SCP-1550 was stored and allowed to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-2 possess enlarged lungs and thinned body for increased streamlining.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>No gills? Apparently, it doesn't use the same adaptations for similar circumstances. That's somewhat odd.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a temperate forest ecosystem and allowed to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550 specimen SCP-1550-3 has a thin layer of brown fur covering the top of its body and a ridged, snakelike underbelly as well as enlarged tail-tentacles.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>The ridges along SCP-1550-3's underbelly had a small oval patch of smooth skin on which the tattoo-like markings were located.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a desert ecosystem and allowed to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550-4 was cold-blooded and has a tanned coloration to camouflage it against sand, as well as a tendency to burrow.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>The size was also interesting. ██ centimeters in length, about one centimeter larger than the other specimens.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a terrarium made to simulate a standard city apartment and allowed to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550-5 has leathery skin, eyes on short lumps protruding from its head in a manner somewhat like the eyes of a chameleon, and was noted for behaving in a more affectionate and active manner to researchers than other specimens of SCP-1550.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Study revealed that behind the jaw inside are located strands of whale-like baleen, allowing the specimen to filter dust and crumbs from the floor.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vat of molten iron.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550-6 egg burst into flame and was destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Well, what did you expect to happen?</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vacuum chamber which was then depressurized.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550-7 egg exploded coating the inside of the vacuum chamber in [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>It now seems obvious that SCP-1550 eggs cannot survive conditions besides those in which at least some sort of complex animal can live. So we might as well stop trying to make them do so.</em> Dr. ████████</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████<br/>
<strong>Test Subject:</strong> SCP-1550</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> One (1) SCP-1550 egg was placed in a vacuum chamber filled with seawater which was then pressurized to 1,086 bars (15,750 psi)<br/>
<strong>Results:</strong> SCP-1550-8 possessed a bioluminescent lure similar to that of an anglerfish extending from its forehead, gills similar to SCP-1550-1, and dark grey-blue coloration. Legs were flattened and webbed into fishlike fins and eyes were near twice the size of those of other SCP-1550 specimens. Teeth were sharpened and possessed ridges to cut meat, similar to those found in many species of shark.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>This leaves the question of just what kind of child Dr. Wondertainment is trying to sell these things to that would live in conditions where a creature like that could be kept as a pet.</em> Dr. ████████</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>SCP-1550 was brought into containment after a series of ten (10) cardboard packages printed with stylized images of SCP-1550 specimens and the words "Dr. Wondertainment's Custom-Pets™!" each containing six (6) SCP-1550 eggs in separate airtight compartments and a short instruction leaflet was found in the exotic pets section of the ████████████ pet store. Upon interrogation of store workers, it was proven that none possessed knowledge of SCP-1550.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction leaflet for SCP-1550:</strong><br/>
