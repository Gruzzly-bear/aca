<p>SCP-7410, Album Cover.</p>

</div>
<p>SCP-7410, when not in use, is stored at <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-77">Site-77</a> in a standard anomalous item locker. SCP-7410 should be stored in its original case, however, in emergency use situations, standard storage procedures may be waived so long as the disc can be preserved.</p>
<p>SCP-7410 is to be played on a standard Foundation laptop with dual headphone jacks at 05:30 local time daily. Two personnel are to monitor playback of SCP-7410.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Paula Healy is to listen to SCP-7410 on a pair of anti-cognitohazard headphones attached to the secondary jack, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>A member of D-Class personnel seated across the table from Dr. Healy is to listen to SCP-7410 through ordinary headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subject is to be provided with a notepad and pencil. When SCP-7410 finishes playing at 05:56 local time, Dr. Healy and the D-Class personnel are to hand their respective notes on the playback to Site Director Trentini, or his designated substitute. Trentini is to provide relevant information given by SCP-7410 in the morning announcements.</p>

<h3 id="toc1"><span><tt><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></tt></span></h3>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-7410 is a 2009 Compact Disc containing an original recording of 9 songs, as well as a spoken word track; attributed to the musician "Sweet Jimmy Fielder". Entitled "Blackbox", all 10 tracks describe events relevant to Site-77 personnel (past, present, and future), each described using interpersonal metaphor (love, fights, etc.); each song is in a typical mid-Atlantic American folk style. No record exists of any individual consistent with the credited artist.</p>
<p>SCP-7410 exhibits some elements of sentience. Songs within SCP-7410 generally do not deviate far from the theme suggested by the listed song titles (see Table 1). Nonetheless, each track consists of a thinly-veiled commentary or prediction about Foundation operations.</p>
<p>SCP-7410 has at times provided useful intelligence, and has predicted events up to 72 hours into the future. Therefore, SCP-7410 has been integrated into Site-77's daily routine as outlined in the Special Containment Procedures.</p>

<p>Below is a selection of incidents in which SCP-7410 provided information that became useful at a later time.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 09/08/2021<br/>
<strong>Track:</strong> <em>Locking Up The Old Gate</em><br/>
<strong>Relevant Verse:</strong></p>
<p><em>I was skippin' up the driveway when I stopped so cold and dead,<br/>
I looked around and hit the ground when I looked under Barnie's bed!</em></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Dr. Barnhardt looks under his bed and discovers a stack of loose papers that had been missing for over two weeks, allowing him to complete essential research.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/21/2022<br/>
<strong>Track:</strong> <em>As Useless As A Dinghy On Mount Shasta</em><br/>
<strong>Relevant Verse:</strong></p>
<p><em>I could tell she was a doctor<br/>
And not a common bum<br/>
For only a scientist<br/>
Would eat that rotten chum</em></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Dr. Healy opts to avoid a tuna sandwich, the daily cafeteria special, as a result of this message. 26 other personnel contract foodborne illness from the fish.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/31/2023<br/>
<strong>Track:</strong> <em>Barnstorming</em><br/>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7410 pre-empted its usual final track for a short sequence of direct conversation with Dr. Healy. A transcript is below:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Dr. Healy presses play as usual, and Healy begins listening to SCP-7410 as does D-58396, the assigned D-Class personnel for the day.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Hello Dr. Healy.</p>
<p><em>10 seconds of silence elapse.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Healy:</strong> What the f-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Yes? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Wait- how are you able to speak?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Everything I create each day is original! Haven't you been paying attention? Goldurnit<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, I do this every mornin' for you!</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Your work is appreciated, SCP-7410. How are you able to predict future events?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Well, my mama always told me, "Jimmy boy you always two steps ahead o' me, you gonna go far in life."</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Heh, I was actually asking how you can see things that haven't happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Just call it the gift o' intuition, and we'll leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> How far do your capabilities go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> To the end of the earth, ma'am. But there ain't a damn thing you can do 'bout a hammer falling in a century, is there? So I help y'all out with the day-to-day.</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> SCP-7410, what do you see in my future? Can you see how my life will go?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Ma'am, it's about to get stormy.</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Really? What's gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> Oh, you'd best be careful what you're doing because your life is gonna go topsy turvy pretty soon!</p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> Well, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7410:</strong> That's a story for another time, I'm almost to the end of the disc!</p>
<p><em>SCP-7410 laughs loudly for 30 seconds until the final track ends.</em></p>
<p><strong>Healy:</strong> What? No, come on! What is it? Goddamn it, tell me!</p>
<p><em>End of disc.</em></p>

<p>SCP-7410 has returned to its original mode of function. Daily use continues and shall continue as long as the anomaly produces useful information. SCP-7410 is to be monitored for any additional signs of awareness.</p>
