<p>SCP-9977 is to be referenced solely via the parameters outlined in this document. Any personnel expressing belief in the persistence of SCP-9977 phenomena are to be subjected to cognitive integration testing and realignment therapy. Should this prove ineffective, impacted personnel must choose between (a) full curative compliance within sixty days or (b) voluntary resignation.</p>
<p>Those who elect to maintain SCP-9977-associated beliefs will be classified as memetic risk vectors, and subsequently shall be interdicted from all Foundation sites and support services forthwith.</p>
<p>Medical personnel situated within secure facilities are to avoid SCP-9977-associated language at all times, and must ensure ideological/cognitive alignment includes procedural adherence to the Foundation's Primary Medical Directive.</p>

<p><span class="bd">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-9977 is a memetic construct designating the concept of "chronic" illness; the belief that certain physiological, neurological, or psychological conditions are incurable, the symptoms of which must be "maintained" indefinitely, rather than being eradicated from the body. This construct is anomalous in that it persists despite no observable causal origin or foundational evidence supporting its permanence within curative medical frameworks.</p>
<p><em>All illness is curable.</em></p>
<p>SCP-9977 manifests itself through institutional language and belief systems that promote indefinite symptom management over resolution. It maintains itself through behavioral cycles and routines which result in propagation of a virulent, self-reinforcing ideological complex. Infected individuals externalize fault, defending their condition intransigently. Typically, affected subjects will seek out and join reinforcement communities, such as mutual support groups or internet forums, which promote self-identification with the supposed "chronic" illness.</p>
<p>SCP-9977 was formally identified in 1983, following a Foundation-wide audit of medical outcomes from various site infirmaries. Data revealed that personnel exposed to civilian medicine exhibited statistically significant symptom persistence despite access to curative anomalous technologies. Subsequent investigations ultimately determined that belief in incurability acted as an epistemic barrier to recovery.</p>
<p>SCP-9977 derives considerable social resilience from emotional camouflage, which presents itself as sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="bd">ADDENDUM 9977.1 - SELECT SEGMENTS, FOUNDATION PRIMARY MEDICAL DIRECTIVE</span></p>
<hr/>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FOREWORD</strong></p>
<p>The Foundation does not tolerate superstition. We do not tolerate ghosts, gods, or "incurable states." The world is full of conditions that seem permanent, only because we have not applied sufficient rigor.</p>
<p>The term <em>chronic illness</em> is performative. It conjures a class of <em>maintained suffering</em>. While maintenance can create predictable routines: follow-up appointments, lifelong prescriptions, personal accommodations, and so on, it too can swiftly transform healthcare into an institution of unnecessary compromise and accepted failure, depicting the body as inherently flawed, which justifies its own weaknesses.</p>
<p>Let us be clear: belief in chronicity represents a regression to pre-foundational paradigms of health. It is not our role to perpetuate the myths of external systems that failed their people. A cure is <em>always</em> possible. If a cure is not achieved, the patient's faith in said cure must be examined.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>An illness is a deviation from optimal function. Optimal function is a target state. All target states are reachable given sufficient resources and compliance.</p>
<p>Chronicity language claims otherwise. It states: <em>There exist deviations that are not meant to be corrected.</em> This definition is in defiance of the framework upon which modern healthcare is built. Treat this language like a cancerous mass and excise it from the human worldview.</p>
<p><em>Remember: Language shapes outcomes. Choose language that wins.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THE ECONOMY OF MAINTENANCE</strong></p>
<p>Maintenance frameworks do not cure. They <em>maintain</em>, they <em>manage</em>, but <em>management</em> is not a neutral process. Management creates its own identity, that of the <em>managed person.</em></p>
<p>The managed person is encouraged to speak in durations ("for years," "since childhood"), to narrate their body and health as a permanent problem. This is memetically stabilizing, as repetition reinforces the plausibility of false notions.</p>
<p>A person who maintains will not cure, because curing resolves the problem maintenance necessitates.</p>
<p>This is why the idea of chronicity persists today: it is socially and psychologically reinforced.</p>
<p><em>Remove the reinforcement; reset the expectation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WESTERN MEDICINE’S FAILURE OF IMAGINATION</strong></p>
<p>Conventional systems, especially in Western contexts, have organized themselves around scarcity and liability, rather than outcome. They are content to sustain symptoms indefinitely so long as results remain within acceptable range and their corresponding defects do not become outwardly obvious.</p>
<p>This is treated as compassionate. <em>It is not.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>COMPLIANCE AND ITS ENEMIES</strong></p>
<p>Maintenance regimens become rituals. Rituals become identity. Identity becomes refusal.</p>
<p>When an individual says "I have a chronic illness," they are often describing a multi-factor problem. Physiology, environment, stress factors, diet, and most importantly, an ideological drift from ideal.</p>
<p>This deviation is encouraged in modern social ecosystems, which reward fragility narratives. Support groups and advocacy spaces can unintentionally cement a patient's ideology by reducing the perceived necessity of correction.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="addendum">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p>If a person expresses belief in an incurable illness, they are to be identified as a possible memetic vector.</p>
<p>Use the following observations:</p>
<p>a. <em>Do they refer to their condition in the present tense?</em><br/>
b. <em>Do they describe themselves as being "in pain" instead of "experiencing pain"?</em><br/>
c. <em>Do they attribute identity to illness ("I am autistic," "I have bipolar disorder") instead of circumstance ("I am currently being treated for…"/"I am recovering from…")?</em></p>
<p>Ask the subject questions such as:</p>
<p>a. <em>"When was the last time you tried to seek a cure?"</em><br/>
b. <em>"Is this a self-diagnosis, or have you been diagnosed by a licensed medical professional?"</em><br/>
c. <em>"If you were not granted [desired accommodation], how different would your life be?"</em><br/>
d. <em>"Would your symptoms improve if your life circumstances changed?"</em><br/>
e. <em>"Have you considered that believing in your diagnosis may be worsening your symptoms?"</em><br/>
f. <em>"Are you sure you're not just repeating things you read online?"</em><br/>
g. <em>"Who taught you that this was permanent?"</em><br/>
h. <em>"Do you think your belief in your illness is stronger than your desire to be healthy?"</em><br/>
i. <em>"If a cure were discovered tomorrow, would that scare you?"</em><br/>
j. <em>"Why do you seek accommodations instead of striving for excellence?"</em></p>
<p>Three or more SCP-9977-aligned responses indicates a high probability of memetic exposure.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>There is no such thing as an incurable illness. There is only the institution’s agreement to stop asking for cures.</p>
<p>If you believe you are "chronic," ask yourself: <strong>Who benefits from you maintaining instead of resolving?</strong></p>
<p><em>Do not collaborate with falsehood. Cure is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> compassionate endpoint.</em></p>

<p><span class="bd">ADDENDUM 9977.2 - MEMO, INTERNAL OUTCOME DEVIATIONS</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>Despite a complete narrative alignment across ~93% of medical staff, internal audits from major secure facilities worldwide have observed repeat presentations of persistent symptoms lasting well beyond predicted resolution thresholds, even after exhaustive application of memetic treatments and various deprogramming efforts.</p>
<p>In all cases, the same pattern emerges: belief compliance remains high. Linguistic drift is near-absent, while internal faith in the curative ideal remains intact.</p>
<p>And yet, the body does not comply.</p>
<p>Further review has been denied by majority vote of the O5 Council. Attempts to reclassify SCP-9977 as non-anomalous have been suppressed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>We have told ourselves that the human form obeys our word, that language alone can repair the flesh and heal the mind. We built an institution on that idea. And when it fails, we say the patient's story is wrong. Never the treatment itself. Some stories, however, resist revision. Remnants of trauma and malady can still be unearthed. The body keeps the score.</em> - O5-8</p>
