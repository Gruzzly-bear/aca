<p>SCP-8767</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8767 is to be kept in a standard anomalous item locker on Site-███,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> inside of a reinforced carrying case with a lock. SCP-8767 should only be taken out in controlled testing environments, with all personnel involved undergoing a vetting process for cognitive strength regarding the handling and resisting of infohazardous anomalies. Any personnel interacting with SCP-8767 and files relating to it must have a certified Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) of 7.3 or higher.</p>
<p>All Foundation devices that access files relating to SCP-8767 are to be monitored via the Automated Infohazard Risk Avoidance (AIRA) Protocol. In the event of AIRA's deactivation for scheduled maintenance or other unspecified cases, all files relating to SCP-8767 should be fully locked until it is operational. Research conducted on SCP-8767 is to be recorded in exclusively audio-based formats, with any visual or written artifacts<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> made only with explicit authorization from a supervisor. Any personnel exhibiting an obsessive desire to gain access to SCP-8767 or files pertaining to it are to be detained for cognitive assessment and amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8767 is a straight-handle round point shovel, measuring 150 cm in length and showing significant signs of wear. Its effectiveness as a digging implement is unnaturally high, with test subjects reporting that digging with it feels similar to moving sand or loose dirt, no matter the material. This behavior of SCP-8767 is only limited to breaking up and moving terrain.</p>
<p>Subjects affected by SCP-8767 will believe that there is something beneath them that they need to unearth. Further questioning of what subjects believe they are digging for will vary, with responses ranging from treasure, objects/people of personal or historical significance, to even abstract concepts like truth or freedom. It is hypothesized that SCP-8767's compulsive properties function off of pre-existing fixations harbored by subjects.</p>
<p>After an undefined period ranging from 16 to 48 hours, subjects will experience vivid hallucinations and exhibit delusions of finding what they are digging for. Once a subject believes that they have found their target, the surrounding area will generate notable seismic activity,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> completely filling the hole, with the only indication of prior activity being SCP-8767 sticking out of the ground. Additionally, visual and written artifacts of SCP-8767 produce an infohazardous effect, compelling subjects to locate it and anomalously altering themselves to assist in finding its whereabouts.<br/>

<p>SCP-8767 was discovered in North Liberty, Iowa on March 15th, 2015, following numerous reports of missing persons.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> In all instances of the missing persons being seen shortly before their disappearance, eyewitnesses reported that they were digging a sizable hole with several other members of the community. Within this timeframe, various North Liberty media outlets reported on seismic activity within the area. Shortly after this, a woman by the name of Rory Elston contacted a Foundation agent embedded in local law enforcement regarding the disappearances. The following is a transcript of her statement.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 4/7/15</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent Sarah Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Ms. Rory Elston</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>[BEGIN LOG]</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> Can you please state your name and age for the record?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> Rory Elston, 36. Although, it used to be Rory Connors.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> You contacted us to make a statement regarding the disappearances on Ash Trail Way, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> You may begin whenever you're ready.</p>
<p><em>(Elston fidgets in her seat. She takes a deep breath before beginning.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> They were digging a hole before they disappeared, right? That's what you found out?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> According to eyewitness testimonies, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> Well… I'll tell you. That hole wasn't anything new. James had been digging it for a while. I can't remember exactly when he started, sometime in the summer of last year, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> Do you know why?</p>
<p><em>(Elston sighs deeply.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> … He… thought that there was something under our house. We, uh, inherited it from his father, my father-in-law, after he died a few years ago. He left the house to us, and I guess James was convinced that his father had left us something else.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> Like an heirloom?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> He called it a lot of things, but yeah. Something old, and worth a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> And this was a regular occurrence?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> At first, no. He just dug a couple pot holes in our backyard and called it a day. I thought it was a joke. But… overtime, he started… taking it more seriously. A few small holes became one big hole. Then he started missing things. Calling in sick, ignoring birthdays, that sorta thing. It really hurt, having to tell all my friends that my husband wouldn't be coming to gatherings for a while. It hurt even more when it was normal enough that I didn't need to. Everyone must've thought we were having issues at home, and I guess we were. He started getting contractors involved. Think it was around then that people started noticing what he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> The others. Were they… Did you feel like they were compelled? To help him?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> I don't know. He was very social, I've always been more of a homebody. Maybe he just sold them on it, I couldn't tell you, but it started being an everyday thing. He quit his job. All that mattered to him was that damn hole. Started taking the kids to my mother's place whenever I could, couldn't stand all the noise.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> Did you ever have thoughts of joining him? Helping him?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> … Sometimes. Just to see if maybe I could feel like we were together again. But I never did. I don't really like getting my hands dirty. The most I would do is keep some drinks in a cooler for all of them, make sure he was eating. Sometimes, I don't even think he slept. I would go to bed without him, wake up the next morning, and he would still be out there. Just digging. Lugging that stupid shovel around.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> That shovel?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> Yeah. Some old rusty one. It was in the shed when we moved. Maybe his father made it? I don't know. I just know that at some point, I never saw him without it.</p>
<p><em>(Elston looks down.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> Eventually, I just couldn't deal with any of it anymore. Filed for divorce. He- he didn't even fight for custody. It was like everything stopped mattering to him, except whatever he thought was down there. There wasn't anything left of the man I married.</p>
<p><em>(A pause.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> Is there anything else you'd like to discuss? About the disappearances? Any information you believe may help?</p>
<p><em>(Elston wipes her hands on her dress, and lets out a shaky exhale.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rory Elston:</strong> … No. I'm sorry for wasting your time. I guess I just wanted someone to know… Even if you find him. My husband's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Callahan:</strong> … Thank you for making a statement, Ms. Elston. I'm sorry for your loss.</p>

<p>Subjects were outfitted with a headlamp, a microphone, a radio, and an electronic depth gauge. Each was allowed to dig with SCP-8767 uninterrupted for progressively longer intervals. After the allotted time, a loud siren was sounded remotely and subjects were ordered to stop. Subjects were relayed instructions via their radio, with researchers stationed safely in an outpost a kilometer away. After tests, subjects were instructed to give a brief testimony on SCP-8767's effects.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D.10523<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 2 minutes</p>
<p>Siren easily broke subject's concentration. Digging ceased. Subject was unaffected by SCP-8767, and did not display any abnormal behavior after testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D.11851<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p>Siren had to be sounded twice for the subject to lose focus. Digging ceased at 1.3 meters. Subject displayed a lack of temporal awareness, noting that it felt like it had barely been a minute. Subject did not display any additional abnormal behavior after testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D.10945<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>Siren had to be sounded multiple times in rapid succession for the subject to lose focus. Subject was disoriented upon breaking concentration, and communicated a desire to continue, which was promptly denied. Digging ceased at 2.5 meters. Subject began displaying a fascination with SCP-8767, requesting additional time with it for several days after testing. Post-amnestic treatment, the subject's abnormal behavior disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> D.10764<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 20 minutes</p>
<p>Siren was no longer capable of breaking the subject’s concentration. Researchers lost all contact with subject shortly after.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p>D.10764 destroyed his radio to prevent researchers from contacting him. However, he did not remove his microphone, nor the electronic depth gauge, both of which continued to function for the full 36 hours he continued digging. The following transcripts are several notable excerpts from D.10764’s audio recording, with the attached time and depth for reference.</p>

<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> <em>(singing)</em> When the rude wintry win', idly waves round our dwelling… And the roar of the linn, on the night breeze is swelling… So merrily we'll sing, as the storm rattles o'er us… 'Till the dear sheeling ring, wi' the light lilting chorus…<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>(D.10764 takes a breath, then laughs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> Do you still remember that song? You used to make me sing it to you all the time. Not my finest performance, I'll admit. Mom sang it better. You should've heard her when she sung, her voice… I've never been able to describe it.</p>
<p><em>(He is quiet for a moment.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> … It wasn't your fault, Caz. You didn't ask to be born. Just wish she would've seen it that way.</p>

<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> … Come on. You can't give up now. He's counting on you. It's just pain. You've been through plenty of that already.</p>

<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> No one believed me when I told them you were still alive. Not a one. I never stopped looking, but hell, somedays I came close to believing them.</p>
<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> It's a good thing I didn't, eh? Brought me here. I found you, in the end. Still looking after you, even after all this time.</p>
<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> <em>(muttering)</em> … I promised. I promised I wouldn't leave you like he left us, and if nothing else, I keep my damn promises.</p>

<p><em>(He laughs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> You told us that this organization was created to uphold order, and normalcy, but <em>god</em> what would you even do if you had it? You <em>love</em> this. I've seen you bastards work, treating every fucked up thing in this place like a puzzle you're giddy to solve. This little prison of horrors you've built, this- this isn't just research, is it? It's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">passion</span> <tt>obsession.</tt> This is your life's work, how could you live without it?</p>
<p><em>(D.10764 is silent for a few moments.)</em></p>

<p><strong>D.10764:</strong> But I'm feeling rather generous today. So fine. I'll keep your little toys on me. You'll get your oh-so precious data, Christ knows you people need something to do. But once I find Caz, I'm getting the hell out of here. My sentence is up. You promised my freedom.</p>

It was like you completely disappeared. Every lead ended in a dead end. No one believed me, they thought I was crazy. Had me locked up for nearly caving that fucker's skull in. He had it coming.

<p><tt>You always do. That is the burden of this organization. To know. To <em>see.</em> Questions prompt answers prompt questions again, ad absurdum. It's never enough. The world ends. We dig the hole deeper. The world ends again. We dig the hole deeper. The earth doesn't have enough space for the bodies we bury. We dig the hole deeper. We can do everything, we can do nothing. We are centuries old, we are only a child. We are kind, we are cruel. There is no solution, only the search for something at the bottom of it all.</tt></p>
