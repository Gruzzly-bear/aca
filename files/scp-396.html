<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A geolocator has been affixed to SCP-396 to track its movements. If SCP-396 is to displace an individual, they are to be identified, administered amnestics, and returned to their original location. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">When possible, SCP-396 is to be contained within Area-93.</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-396 is a steel and red plastic chair. At statistically random intervals, usually between four and twelve days, SCP-396 will displace itself and switch places with another random separate seat. Any living matter seated on SCP-396 or the chair it is replacing will also change places. The approximate limits of this teleportation are unclear.</p>
<p>SCP-396 was discovered on 15/03/2002 when it manifested in Wing C’s testing zone of Area-93. Due to the unexplained apparition and the presumed simplicity of the anomalous manifestation, the chair was added to the <a href="/log-of-anomalous-items">Log Of Anomalous Items</a> and contained within storage. Three days later, SCP-396 displaced itself and a chesterfield sofa, along with a civilian from Busan, South Korea. The affected individual was administered amnestics, returned home, and SCP-396 was assigned a proper designation.</p>

<h1 id="toc0"><span>O5 COMMAND NOTICE</span></h1>
<h4 id="toc1"><span>Procedure HOTSEAT</span></h4>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>SCP-396 has breached its containment a total of 58 times since its initial discovery only one year ago. This is a terrible amount. And it's even more concerning when the only containment procedure we have is leaving this thing in a room, hoping its next teleportation will not be important to deal with.</p>
<p>Containing the anomaly in a single facility has thus been deemed impractical. Both due to its unpredictable nature and rather perplexing apparition, procedure HOTSEAT has been implemented. It has been decided that each time SCP-396's anomalous manifestation occurs, its location will be promptly pinned, and the closest Foundation complex to the anomaly will be instructed to contain it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The facility in charge will then be ordered to, with the help of all departments, divisions and other units present, theorize and test the possible origins of SCP-396's anomalous activity and/or propose new proper Containment Procedures to subdue its threat to the Veil as much as possible.</p>
<p>Failing to report a theory before the next transportation will lead to a cut in the budget of said facility. We want this thing fixed, do not try to avoid your duty just by containing it without much thought. Do your best.</p>
<p>SCP-396's latest transportation occurred within Poland's territory, and so, Site-120 has been indirectly chosen to contain the anomaly until its next anomalous activity. This is non-negotiable.</p>

Due to the chair's height, the instant transportation destroyed the entire containment room, including a portion of the closest and upper rooms.

<p><strong>Description of event:</strong> Just before its transportation, an interview was initiated to test SCP-396's communication ability, which proved inconclusive. However, at the end of the session, researchers mistakenly took a non-anomalous chair from the room and brought it to the containment cell, leaving the real SCP-396 in the interrogation room. During another interview later that day, Dr. Fenton unknowingly sat on the Item and was suddenly switched with an empty co-director seat on a movie set in Italy. Fenton pretended to be part of the studio’s staff until Foundation agents arrived. The researchers responsible have been disciplined, and SCP-396 was sent to Site Minerva.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> SCP-396’s teleportation ability and the way it chooses the chair it switches with is concomitant with the concept of seating. The action of bending the knees, lowering the body onto a surface designed for sitting, and adjusting posture for comfort and stability is an action impossible for the anatomy and the mind of most life forms on earth. This idea is inherently an old concept created within the noosphere,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> and a very esoteric one at that.</p>
<p>We believe this anomaly is a direct result of a concept being transcended into our reality, possibly making this chair, as we call it, an essophysical entity. And we want to check if we can do something about it.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Approved.</span><br/>
SCP-396 was connected via a Noospheric Regulator to search for its presence within the noosphere, memetic scans were initiated, and a deity-class entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> was summoned to demand if it knew anything about another “seating god”. No correlation between SCP-396 and the concept of seating was found. SCP-396 left its cell fifteen days later.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> I believe SCP-396 is the direct result of a time-traveling failure, possibly initiated by the Foundation. The day of its apparition, the fifteenth of March 2002, was the date set by a time-traveling device in a far future Area-93. That chair was sent out on our time, perhaps to test the actual device.</p>
<p>What resulted is the chair's timeline instability. Because the chair's atom structure shouldn't be in this timeline, it's trying to find its original past-version and replace it in order to find stability, displacing objects similar to itself while doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Approved.</span><br/>
A portable Temporal Sink<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> was affixed to SCP-396's seat to entirely block any kind of liaison to another timeline. After twenty days, the longest recorded time SCP-396 had not transported itself, the staff of Temporal Site-02 congratulated Dr. Azzopardi on the successful containment of SCP-396. During her celebration speech in the cafeteria, in which she insulted her future self for “being wrong for once”, SCP-396 transported itself again. The object's disappearance was only noticed after.</p>
<p>To avoid a potential paradox and public humiliation, Dr. Azzopardi sent the proposal's result to her past self.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Look, I am thankful to the anomaly for these new archeological findings, but we are not exactly a containment facility. Archeological research, our main thing, isn't going to help solve this anomaly, so this theory is more of a gut feeling than anything else. I know this probably isn't what that page is for, but it's the best I can come up with while avoiding a budget cut.</p>
<p>SCP-396 is a challenge for all Foundation facilities and for the staff charged with containing it. The anomaly feeds off our hard work. The more believable the theory is, the more it takes time to teleport. Look at the Azzopardi's theory, <em>everyone</em> thought she finally made it, and it's exactly because that theory is so believable that it took so long to transport itself. That chair judges our ability to contain and research around itself, leaving for another Site after a certain time, depending on how well we did our job.</p>
<p>Noospheric manifestation, reality-bending manipulation, some kind of GoI attack against us— I really have no idea what would explain it in para-scientific terms, but this is what I got. Now, the only problem is that there is no real way to test this theory of mine. The only way I could think of would be to leave it alone in its cell— without anything else. No joke.</p>
<p>If I'm correct, and this is a big if, SCP-396 would wait even longer than last time to transport itself, because that theory is believable and the closest thing to the truth. If I'm wrong, well, you'll know I tried.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Approved.</span><br/>
SCP-396 is left alone in its containment cell, without any interaction permitted. Three weeks after initial containment, the anomaly has yet to transport itself.</p>
