<p>Casino Lisboa (Macau, SAR) taken moments before a KIŠ.UNU Event knocked out all power to the site.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-666 is to monitor activity for all large scale casinos <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">within Clark County and Washoe County, NV</span> worldwide using Melammu.aic surveillance of security feed monitoring and regional news reporting for possible KIŠ.UNU Events and/or verified sightings of SCP-8131. In the event of confirmed activity, MTF Gamma-5 (“Red Herrings”) will be dispatched in order to gather actionable intelligence and administer Class-B amnestics to witnesses as needed.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="font-size:85%">
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> It's a demon, Vainglory-Class, or at least something that's presents in similar ways. We ruled out Type Green a few years back when Calendar tried putting out all those SRAs around Fremont Street.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> I agree, it's not a reality bender, but I think there is more to it than a simple demonic issue. For starters, it always targets something additional to the boilerplate security systems…</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> — So, you gonna tell me what it is, or are we doing the dramatic pause-for-effect bullshit —</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> I was just looking through my documentation to show you the incident reports. Here, look. Besides recording devices and anti-theft technology, it takes out the Akiva detection devices, without fail.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> … how in the fuck did we miss that?</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> See, here. 8131's not destroying them, it's changing the read out to intentionally show normal levels and then erasing the metadata. If you run diagnostics later, it shows up as an error but simple monitoring just shows the background rate. It also intentionally added TRE values which the devices didn't actually register to further confuse the incident.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> Huh. Divine fraud. Almost respect it.</tt></p>
</div>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Containment of SCP-8131 is to be considered a top priority for Site-666, the Department of Tactical Theology, and MTF Eta-77 ("Spheres Within Spheres"). Contact Site Director House for further information (with appropriate clearance).</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8131 is a probable <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vainglory-class demonic</span> deific entity known to target large scale gambling operations at physical locations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> with anomalous criminal activities classified as KIŠ.UNU Events. While the details, scope, and methods of each KIŠ.UNU Event vary, each are categorized by fulfillment of three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete and immediate failure of all anti-theft devices resulting in a window of opportunity for a particularly audacious robbery of the facility's main vault or other major repository. All cash on hand will be successfully removed from the premises and not recovered.</li>
<li>At least 25+ physically present witnesses to the event itself, all responding with grudging admiration and/or envy at SCP-8131's abilities and acumen, regardless of how the individual typically would respond to events of a criminal nature. Witnesses may include casino and hotel staff, patrons, and law-enforcement personnel present at the time of the event. It has not been conclusively determined if this is an anomalous effect produced by SCP-8131 or a natural reaction to the particularly audacious criminal acts the entity undertakes. However, Foundation researchers lean towards memetic influence as no witness has ever failed to express this opinion during post hoc interviews.</li>
<li>The marking of 𒄷𒈿<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> found somewhere within the crime scene itself, although the location, composition materials, and construction of said markings vary from event to event. Note that the markings to date have always been inert with regards to Akiva radiation, Tartarean Resonance Energy, or Hume level fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p>See Addendum for notable KIŠ.UNU Events.</p>
<p>While SCP-8131 has never been interviewed or identified, their appearance has remained consistent across all confirmed KIŠ.UNU Events: humanoid, of apparent Afrocentric or Arab descent standing roughly 175 cm (5'10") tall and of average build, while wearing casual, unremarkable clothing, usually including a baseball cap and sunglasses. Although some KIŠ.UNU Events often seem to include other humanoids working in concert with SCP-8131 (termed SCP-8131-1 instances), these beings immediately de-manifest upon the conclusion of said event and appear to be non-sentient beings created by SCP-8131 for the express purpose of carrying out the planned robbery.</p>
<hr/>
<div class="blockquote" style="font-size:85%">
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> Besides the issues with Akiva readings, it's the mark that I keep going back to. It's deliberate, almost mocking in its daring. Not to mention we have enough evidence of that particular symbol's use in ritualistic inscriptions to recognize it as an effective sigil, even if it isn't throwing readings on its own. It's possible that it <em>is</em> setting off some sort of reaction, but we don't know how to measure it properly.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> It wouldn't be the first time something brand fuckin' new turned up in Undervegas.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> It points to inadvertent worship, because in all these cases we end up with witnesses who admire the audacity of the crime. It doesn't matter that the stakes are mundane and no one gets too hurt; in fact I would argue that's half the appeal. It's theatrical, which is what the entity is banking on.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> Are we nearing the point, Coop?</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> Director House, I am almost certain we are dealing with the results of apotheosis and divine ascension, possibly accidental but likely aided by an established pantheon structure.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> Jesus Christ.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> No, far too recent, and unlikely to take an interest in something like this. My personal theory is one of the Mesopotamian pantheon, even if the Akkadian mark is a little on the nose. This is intentional ritual, dressed up to resemble a summer heist film. The sort of thing that provokes a grudging admiration from the witnesses at the audacity, the desire to come out ahead against the establishment. My theory is that at its essentials, someone is channeling worship through pantomiming a one-man Ocean's Eleven, over and over again.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>DIR. HOUSE:</strong> Someone wants to be admired. Envied, even.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>COOPER:</strong> Exactly.</tt></p>

<td style="text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black">1 Jan 2016 - Reno, NV</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">First Confirmed Event. Dubbed the New Year's Spree by local media prior to Foundation response, at least seven casinos within city limits were robbed within five minutes of each other by the same man matching SCP-8131's description. Although no specific anomalous behavior was reported by eye witnesses, it would be otherwise impossible for one person to travel between locations in mere seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black">25 Feb 2017 - Las Vegas, NV</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">Two Events occurred simultaneously at the Bellagio and Circus Circus Casinos. SCP-8131 appears on closed circuit feeds at both locations, although the various SCP-8131-1 instances varied. Although the Foundation was able to apprehend nine SCP-8131-1 instances, none provided any information upon interrogation and de-manifested exactly 26 minutes after the conclusion of both events. During both events, SCP-8131 appeared to look directly at various surveillance cameras, often winking or otherwise playing up for the viewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">30 Apr 2018 - Sé, Macau</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">First confirmed non-US event. Notable as well for the level of security overcome, as the target (Grand Lisboa Casino) had extensive paratechnology in place to limit anomalous gambling and criminal activity. SCP-8131 was able to complete the event in spite of multiple reality anchors, artificial intelligence programs, and cognitohazards in use at Grand Lisboa. Note that in addition to the contents of the major deposit safes of the casino, at the conclusion of the event all copper hardware and wiring was found to be removed from the building's electrical systems without otherwise damaging the structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid black">9 April 2020 - Las Vegas, NV</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">Only recorded event during the Covid19 Pandemic shutdowns. Although the site (MGM Grand Casino &amp; Hotel) was closed with a skeleton staff presence, SCP-8131 entered with his usual fanfare and complex redirection efforts using SCP-8131-1 instances. Roughly three minutes into the event, SCP-8131 stopped and looked directly at a camera with visible frustration before de-manifesting with all SCP-8131-1 instances. It should be noted that this is the sole KIŠ.UNU Event which resulted in no theft from the targeted casino. KIŠ.UNU Events resumed as normal after the reopening of most gaming establishments worldwide in the late summer of 2020.</td>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPLORATION LOG 8131.1</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Director House and Junior Researcher Cooper, accompanied with three members of MTF Eta-77 ("Spheres Within Spheres")<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> entered Undervegas in order to attempt contact with POI-68131, the Pit Boss identified previously as the leader of the Iwannit Estate (associated with the sin of Envy). Initial intelligence provided a likely location within the Estate for insertion.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The team continues through the Estate streets without challenge, although several ornately dressed demonic entities appear to notice and regard with some suspicion. Eta-77 members, Director House, and Dr. Cooper follow Iwannit protocol until an Estate liaison approaches Dr. Cooper directly.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> Note that the Liaison appears to perfectly mirror the appearance of Christian Bale in the 2000 film 'American Psycho', with the exception of their skin being a deep shade of purple.</em></p>
<p><strong>DRUX:</strong> (under their breath) I swear, my neck is going to be sore tomorrow for the dumbest reasons…</p>
<p><strong>LIAISON:</strong> Yeah, yeah. You're lucky the Boss has time for visitors today, or we'd just let you keep walking around like that for a couple hours. C'mon. Present your tithe.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Cooper hands the liaison a small leather bag holding three small stones, two golden coins, and a severed scorpion tail, the established tithe requested.</em></p>
<p><strong>COOPER:</strong> We appreciate the timely response.</p>
<p><em>The Liaison rolls his eyes, then opens a void portal behind him with a flick of his wrist, motioning for Cooper to approach. ETA-77 members post around the portal, remaining behind. The portal leads to a pocket dimension, resembling a modern high-rise corporate corner office which looks out over an unknown hellscape of thousands of beings in apparent agony. A howling wind is heard outside, although not loud enough to compromise recording. Lighting in the room is dim with the only full light focused upon the entity sitting at the desk near the window, presumed to be POI-68131.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Ah, there you are. Took you long enough to figure it out.</p>
<p><em>POI-68131 appears as an ethnically ambiguous human male of roughly thirty years of age, well over 8' (243cm) in height with pale yellow skin, luminescent green eyes, an elaborately shaved black goatee and slicked back dark hair. Their clothing is a simple yet finely tailored suit with a deep red tie that pulses slowly<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. It should be noted that POI-68131 does not resemble SCP-8131 as recorded during various KIŠ.UNU Events. They motion for Dr. Cooper to take a seat in a chair which manifests opposite of them at the desk, which she accepts. No equal offer is made to Director House, who remains standing beside the desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>HOUSE:</strong> That some two-bit demon lord in a fancy suit wastes his time hitting casinos to get a little attention now and then? Yeah, it was really high priority for us.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Ah. So you <em>haven't</em> yet. That's far more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>COOPER:</strong> We've found the evidence of Akiva, the tampering with the TRE readouts — and we are here to inquire as to why. As the Director said, this isn't exactly high priority for us. No one gets hurt, at least so far, and we don't particularly care about the private wealth of casino owners. But this is a lot of work for nothing, so yes. We're trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>— and it seemed likely that Pazuzu, Demon-God of Mesopotamia might be able to shed some light on that subject.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> C'mon, kiddo. You think I'm gonna give the game away for free just because you figured out my name? That doesn't make me to do shit, no matter how many movies convince you otherwise. The Power of Christ doesn't do anything to compel me; I never even met the guy.</p>
<p><strong>HOUSE:</strong> Yeah, I get it. You're a shadow operator, pulling the strings, running your own show, blah blah blah. Cut the bullshit, Envy. You're running a whole estate based around Envy, on Jealousy, and most of Undervegas doesn't seem to even know your name. There's a side gig here, or you couldn't keep all this up.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Even if you're right, which you already know you are, what makes you think it's gonna be in my best interests to tell you a goddamned thing?</p>
<p><strong>COOPER:</strong> Worship sustains gods, and this isn't getting you anything near the worship a deific entity in charge of all this would require. Something else clearly is creating what you need, but this agent of yours is putting down that vocative sign for a reason. It's calling back to you, even if we can't see the mechanism. You're gaining from this, and that much is clear.</p>
<p><strong>HOUSE:</strong> And sure. We don't have any power to <em>make</em> you tell us anything. But like every two-bit, cookie cutter megalomaniac craving validation and praise for his incredibly elaborate plot, you're gonna monologue it anyway because maybe you've got a good tailor, but deep down you want nothing more than to have the big dramatic reveal, so just fuckin' spill it already.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Ah, what can I say? We all have our vices, and ain't that the point? Fine. Don't worry, we're not doing any of that blood sacrifice shit that gets your kind all worked up. I swear, those Canaanites make a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-089" target="_blank">baby eating statue</a> <em>one</em> time and suddenly everyone's convinced all demons are into that. No, this is different. Respectable, even. What do the kids these days like to say? "Modern problems require modern solutions?"</p>
<p><strong>HOUSE:</strong> Great. Now we're getting Facebook-tier memes from this clown…</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Ah, but that's it, <em>Director</em>. They're still getting passed around like crazy, all over that internet you apes are so proud of. Sure, you don't think of it as worship because most people think that shit has to be locked down, ritualistic when all we're really doing it for is the attention. Time marches on and people forget the Demon God who can probably save their house from falling to plague, so you mix it up. You get people working for you that they <em>will</em> remember. Same shit every guy like me is out there doing, but you gotta get creative for it to last, especially when stuff like this. You gotta strike when the iron is hot, you know? When people are looking.</p>
<p><strong>COOPER:</strong> But they're <em>not</em> looking. We've been covering up the heists for years, no one remembers his face. Even if he's acting as your chthonic Anunnaki<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> it's not like people are noticing him for long enough for you to get much of anything out of it.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> Aw, you're so close! It's almost cute. Bless your heart, but you're looking at the wrong thing here. Yeah, he's my Anunnaki, I'm the Igigi<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, yadda yadda. I'm leeching like hell off all the attention he's getting, but the whole broad daylight heists? That's just something to keep the kid happy! Just busy work, y'know? I don't know what the hell is going on in Erṣetu<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> lately, maybe he got to watch those shitty Ocean's Eleven remakes or something. Who knows? He was down there for a pretty fucking long stent.</p>
<p><strong>HOUSE:</strong> … meaning you pulled him out after you realized you could use him, because now people were paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> And at last, circle gets the goddamned square. Man, you apes and that internet. You have no idea the kind of power you're handing guys like me, do you? Some asshole on Twitter finds one mildly interesting thing in a dusty museum and suddenly, out of nowhere, everyone is on a first name basis with some jackass salesman from Ur, roughly three thousand years dead.</p>
<p><strong>COOPER:</strong> … oh, son of a <em>bitch</em>.</p>
<p><em>The bright light shifts dramatically from POI-68131's desk to highlight the corner of the office where SCP-8131 is seen leaning against the wall with a large grin on his face. Theatrically, he shrugs his shoulders with his palms outward, head tilted slightly, evoking Han Solo in the film</em> Return of the Jedi, <em>1983.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-68131:</strong> The power of a meme, kiddo. You can bet your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir">high quality copper ingots from Ur</a> on it.</p>
<p><em>At this point, Both <strong>HOUSE</strong> and <strong>COOPER</strong> were ejected from the Estate via an unknown method of de-materialization and returned to Site-666. POI-68131 and SCP-8131 have rejected all attempts at reestablishing communication.</em></p>
