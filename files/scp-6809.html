            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6809</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each instance of SCP-6809 is to be held in individual Medium-Risk Humanoid Containment cells. Instances are to be contained under standard humanoid security procedures, and are to be given access to one Type B electrical wall socket for the purposes of charging.</p>
<p>Psychological evaluations are underway to assess the level of individual sapience in each instance. Recommendations to allow SCP-6809 instances to assist in low-level work on-site are pending full screening for any possible espionage methods present in the instances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6809 is a collection of six artificially intelligent humanoid automatons designed and manufactured by GOI-414 "Hathaway Biomechanics LLC." Instances possess near-identical mechanical construction, and are henceforth referred to as SCP-6809-1 through -6.</p>
<p>SCP-6809 instances superficially resemble humans, with artificial musculature and skin that mimics human appearance. The most notable differences in appearance are black sclera in the eyes and the presence of a charging port between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae. 6809-5 and 6809-6 have a slightly modified artificial skin layer, with 6809-5 having sustained damage to the skin layer on the chest. Physical capabilities afforded by the mechanical chassis are around the same level of strength that could be expected from a human of similar size and build. Instances are powered by a series of internally stored batteries that require charging roughly every 8 to 15 hours, depending on activity level.</p>
<p>All instances are fully autonomous and controlled by an internally stored artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligences present within SCP-6809 instances are capable of learning and operate under a set of permanent goals and guidelines outlining behavior, prioritizing assistance with various tasks often associated with housekeeping or service, such as cleaning, cooking, and assisting children and the elderly. Each instance has shown emotional responses to various stimuli, with the specifics varying on the instance, suggesting the development of individual personalities.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript of presentation given at MC&amp;D's 27th Technological Partners Convention in New York City by Anthony Berkshire, CEO of Hathaway Biomechanics, LLC.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p>Humanity. It's what moves us. Keeps us looking forward. Drives our innovations. There's nothing I, as a CEO, value more than the people working under me, and the connections they form with each other. Here at Hathaway Biomechanics, we're all one big family. And today, we're thinking of new ways to bring a little piece of us to the consumer.</p>
<p>Humanity isn't just important for business, it's important in the home, too. And believe me, I know how hard it can be to put your all into your work in the home when you have so many things to worry about. Cleaning up around the house? Looking after guests? Cooking? Raising children? All stressful jobs, all taxing, and all difficult to outsource. Who can trust a cleaning lady, or a nanny? Who knows how human they'll really be to you, or your family, who so graciously offers them compensation? That's why we here at Hathaway Biomechanics have spent a lot of time and effort working on something we're finally ready to unveil: a fine-tuned, full-time robotic servant.</p>
<p>Now, I understand what some of you might be thinking, that Anderson Robotics has the market covered on so-called 'androids.' While that may be true for certain applications, they have no models available to the consumer. This untapped niche is ripe for a market disruption, by the hands of yours truly.</p>
<p>Our products will be personalized, with app integration to a completely revolutionary user-interface system to allow further catering to the consumer. By making use of machine-learning algorithms, our artificial intelligence will be perfectly suited to a variety of roles, bringing a touch of warmth and humanity to your home. Fine-tuned mechanical components and a meticulously designed body will allow our products to fit seamlessly into your life.</p>
<p>Orders and requests for personalized units will open as soon as this presentation concludes. We expect our products to be available for retail by quarter four of this year. I ask you all to join me as we break new ground together, as we decentralize robotics and AI and put power in the hands of the consumer in the robotics revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of intercepted phone call</strong><br/>
Parties on the call: Anthony Berkshire, CEO of Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Michael Diawara, Senior R&amp;D manager at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC.<br/>
<em>Note: Diawara called Berkshire approximately 30 seconds after the previous presentation.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Michael, hey! Great timing, I was just about to call you.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Right, yes, hello, sir, I'm just calling you on behalf of the guys here at R&amp;D. We were all watching that presentation you just gave, and-</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Calling me for your guys, huh? Good, good, great. Great trait to have as a leader. Gotta look out for your own.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> What? I- Okay, sir, we just wanted to ask about what you were talking about. The androids.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Right, yeah, figures. Pretty taken aback, right? I remember I was sitting in my office a couple days ago, right? Just, like, thinking about what I was gonna say here. Had to be big after <a href="scp-6703.html">that shitshow with the Sinclairs</a>, right? So, I was thinking, we did a good job slapping that Emily bitch - or whatever her name was - back together, yeah? Must've been like half a robot at that point, anyway, so hey, why not just lean into it? Pretty good, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> A couple days ago? Nobody on my team knows what the- what you were on about. This is the first anyone here has heard of it. Is everything you said really what you expect us to shoot for?</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Hey, you know, I was gonna call you guys up, but if I was gonna talk here, hey, better to kill two birds with one stone, yeah? Gotta manage your time when you've got as much on your plate as me, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Sir, you can't expect us to drop everything and pivot to this. It's just not in our ballpark, even if we do we can't get it done by that deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Quitter shit. If you want to make it in the market you have to be a goddamn entrepreneur, take risks. And I don't expect you to do anything, I'm <em>ordering</em> you to do it as the damn CEO. Like I said, we need to pivot after that last project of ours.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> You- <em>(inhales)</em> Yes, the incident with Eileen Sinclair was unfortunate, but our specialty has always been medical applications for our technologies. They cannot be applied easily to a non-living host. On top of that, the entire issue that got us into the mess with Sinclair was when you overpromised and underdelivered.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> No. Hey, no- no, no, that was Voight. I didn't do shit.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Sir, I spoke to Voight before he received the cadaver. You approached him with a finalized contract to reanimate Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> No, no, that's- <em>(Berkshire raises his voice)</em> That lying piece of shit. He took the job. He said he could- fucker. Fucking liar. Hope the Foundation put a bullet in the rat.</p>
<p><em>(Berkshire continues breathing heavily for about ten seconds)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Alright, sir, but you should understand what Voight did was impressive. The spinal implant within the cadaver alone was a massive improvement. We should just re-orient our focus back onto medical implants.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Aha, look, Mike, you're a smart guy, right? Yeah, but just stick to the lab shit, okay? Marketing is my whole deal. I know where to take things. I got it, man. Just follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I understand your position, sir, but I would advise you to reconsider. Anderson has had decades to make a product like this and they never did, shouldn't that tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Tells me there's a reason they pay me the big bucks. I see the big picture shit, the untapped niches, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> <em>(inhales and exhales)</em> Look, just saying for the sake of it you need these things made, it really isn't what the team is cut out for. We focus on the human body.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Yeah, yeah, look, I googled "biomechanics" before the announcement, and it's just how things move, nothing to do with the medical field. You guys are good.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> … Do you even know the skillsets of the people you hire? Who the hell is an AI engineer in the first place? We just don't have the people for this.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> That's where I come in. Just gotta drum up some venture capital for manufacturing facilities and new talent. Yeah, just let me get some capital. Speaking of, gotta go chat up some investors. I'll be back over after the convention to check up on how things are going, see ya.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Sir, wait-</p>
<p><em>Berkshire ended the call.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hathaway Biomechanics R&amp;D Department video conference transcript</strong><br/>
Parties in video conference: Michael Diawara, Senior R&amp;D manager at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Alan Brown, R&amp;D employee at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Linda Cho, R&amp;D employee at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC.</p>
<p><em>Note: Foundation assets wiretapped communications from various electronic devices belonging to Hathaway Biomechanics LLC.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Uh, alright, can you guys hear me?</p>
<p><em>(Cho appears in frame, visibly upset. Brown's computer is connected to the video conference but Brown himself is not present in the video.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Is Alan there? His camera is on, but-</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> I turned it on for him. He threw up watching the announcement, but I don't think he's sick. He'll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Christ. Is he alright?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> I- I mean, was he serious? Do we actually need to do this?</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> Honestly, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> <em>(places her head in her hands)</em> Then he'll have to be.</p>
<p><em>(Retching is heard, appearing to come from Brown's mic.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I think I should… wait until Alan gets back.</p>
<p><em>(Diawara appears to sort through papers. Cho remains motionless until Brown returns about one minute later.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Are you in a good enough state to talk about the project, Alan?</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> I mean, I… we can't really waste time, I don't think.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> We aren't going to make good headway unless we're ready to do so, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Son of a bitch, how do we even start with this shit? I- shit, I don't even know where to start! Why can't that asshole just, god, just hire someone else? Fucker gets paid enough for it.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I understand your frustration, but we should try to focus on being productive with our time.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Fuck me, this is the only place that hired us. Everywhere else needs at least five years of work. If we get fired, that's <em>it</em> man, <em>fuck.</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I-</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Why don't you leave, Mr. Diawara? You've got to have at least twenty, thirty years on us. Why do you put up with that asshole's shit? Just go over to Anderson or something.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I'm not just going to leave you two without a supervisor. Besides, Hathaway is more focused on medical implants, and it makes better use of my skills. <em>(Diawara pauses and looks away from the camera)</em> … And they aren't hiring right now.</p>
<p><em>(Cho and Brown chuckle and seem to relax.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Alright, now, we should actually get down to business. <em>(clears throat)</em> Okay, so, how can we modify our current products for articulated joints for the new product's chassis?</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Okay, so, um, the joints we have now are already configured for use in human bodies, but, you know, metal is heavier than flesh. We might have to retool them to bear more weight, which could impact, I don't know, maybe half of the internal parts.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Are we constructing artificial muscles for these things, or just sticking with internal servos? Voight managed to artificially reconstruct a lot of Sinclair's muscles, but we don't have him.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I don't know. Let's say servos for the body right now, more advanced facial musculature.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Shit, the fucking faces. We can't half-ass that. It's the one thing the COE would actually notice. Have we even done anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Sinclair's face caved in when she died, and Voight reconstructed it. I should at least be able to pull up the records of what he did. The man was meticulous.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> <em>(grumbles)</em> That's a start.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Right, b-but, like, how the hell are we even going to power this? Everything else was hooked into internal muscles or systems, nothing past a few of the organs actually had their own power systems. At least nothing that powered more than just itself.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Okay, that's a good point. <em>(pauses for several seconds)</em> Our spinal implant had about half of its internal systems functioning as an artificial immune system. Robots don't need it, so we gut that, put in a power system, and it's already encased and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Good plan, but we're biomechanical engineers. I have zero fucking clue as to how to make a power system. Or, Christ, an AI for that matter. At this rate we'll just be making a really expensive Chuck E. Cheese animatronic.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Berkshire said he was going to get us venture capital and get temps for the AI. I'll ask about some engineers for the power systems.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Temps? For a job like <em>this?</em> Who the hell would take that job?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> People with less than five years of experience.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Oh…</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> I'm more concerned about the funding. Anyone with a brain will be able to tell this is a dumb fucking idea. We're gonna be on our own.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> I understand that you don't care for Mr. Berkshire - I myself have my… <em>reservations</em> about the man - but if there is one thing you have to credit him for, it's his ability to win over investors.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Yeah, rich people will buy <em>anything.</em> As long as another rich asshole jerks them off enough.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> No comment. Alright, you guys can take a day off, but tomorrow I want us to start taking a look at those joints, alright?</p>
<p><em>(Cho and Brown both nod and agree indistinctly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Alright, I'll end the meeting. I'll be in the office tomorrow to work with both of you.</p>
<p><em>(Diawara closed the meeting room.)</em></p>
<p>Recommended course of action: maintain surveillance on product development. When the product launch fails, offer developers employment in the Foundation's medical research wing.</p>
<p>Recommendation status: approved.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> New Product Development</p>
<p>Mr. Berkshire,</p>
<p>My developers have been working around the clock in order to try and get the joints read for use in an artificial frame, but I think it's just outside of their area of expertise. No matter the modifications to the joint implants we have, they invariably fail when attached to artificial frames. The fact of the matter is we simply lack the experience to create the desired product, unfortunately, and asking my team to continue working is a Sisyphean punishment.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to allow us to continue making medical implants to maintain a steady revenue stream, and using your venture capital money to pay for a contractor to supply the product chassis.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>
Dr. Michael Diawara</p>

<p>If we outsource the whole thing then we won't have anything to sell. We can't make a name for ourselves by flipping other people's shit. Also, they're not your developers, they're mine. Thanks to me, they should have some things to look forward to working on. I was chatting up a couple partners, visionaries, really, and we hit it off, great minds think alike and all. One of them used to be part of some weird church and he was great with machines and the other used to be part of some other religious thing in Moscow, anyways, she knew a lot about how to work with bodies. I can put in an order with the two of them: you won't believe the kind of shit they have.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Power Core</p>
<p>Mr. Berkshire,</p>
<p>The development team is nearly completed with the skeletal structure of the most recent product line. We need to finalize this design before we can move on to its outward appearance or installing the AI hardware. In order to test it completely, we need an internal power core to assess how it interacts with the structural and digital systems present in the product.</p>
<p>The dimensions and requirements are in the attached file, as well as some recommendations. There is technology to create reasonably robust and flexible rechargeable batteries that should be able to serve as a power core, provided you offer the manufacturer with a custom order to fit within the spine.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>
Dr. Michael Diawara</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Power Core</p>
<p>Custom batteries would be way too expensive to fit into dimensions like that, and besides, people aren't going to sit around and wait for these things to charge. Lucky for you, I found a sponsor more than willing to give us a discount on an appropriate electrical system. It should be making its way over to you.</p>

Parties present in the laboratory: Anthony Berkshire, CEO of Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Michael Diawara, Senior R&amp;D manager at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Alan Brown, R&amp;D employee at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Linda Cho, R&amp;D employee at Hathaway Biomechanics LLC.<br/>
<em>Note: Berkshire was visiting in order to appraise the near-finished product prototype. Excerpt comes near the end of the meeting.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>(Berkshire and Diawara stand about six feet away from a standing prototype, showcasing basic movement capabilities, with Cho and Brown attending to the prototype.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> … So, as you can see here, thanks to your, uh, benefactors' contribution, we were able to make use of out pre-existing medical implants for much of the body, and the material allows for more fluid and lifelike movement, thanks to Brown's knowledge of kinesiology.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Yes, thankfully we were able to make use of our skillset in order to use the new… whatever it is that we got. But, well, sir, if you don't mind me asking…</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Oh, no, go ahead, It's important to hear out anything my employees have to say. You know, a company isn't just a one-man deal. Everyone's voices matter in a collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Uh… yeah… So, well, I thought the product pitch was for sort of an android to be, like, a more durable maid or something, but this is sort of… a flesh automaton with a processor. I'm just wondering how this is like what we were going for?</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> That's a stupid fucking question.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> <em>(weakly)</em> I…</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Anyways, is this what it's going to look like? Hair and all?</p>
<p><em>(Cho looks between Berkshire, Diawara, and Brown several times within about three seconds before speaking.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> <em>(clears throat)</em> Ah, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Well, we wanted them to fit seamlessly into the home, but wanted solid enough distinction from humans to not be associated with Anderson Robotics infiltrator units. We decided to go with black sclera for the eyes, as that's something people tend to notice right away, and left the hair completely white to make customization and identification easier. From the back… <em>(Cho places her hands on the prototype's shoulders and spins it around)</em> we left the charging port fully visible on the base of the neck, and left the hair at shoulder-length to display this. We considered leaving internal joints visible, but that was ultimately too distracting, we felt. Their eyes and visible charging port should do enough to make its artificial nature clear.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> What's with the rest of it?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> What? The rest? <em>(pause, no response from Berkshire)</em> Well, er, we tried going for more human-looking skin with pores and whatnot, but that just looked… off, I guess. Sort of Uncanny Valley. We decided to go with one solid, bright tone, which might help with identification, like the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> It looks like a fucking stick figure.</p>
<p><em>(Cho and Brown look at Diawara, who shakes his head)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> Anthony, it-</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Don't fucking call me that.</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> <em>Sir,</em> we used some of the information from the Sinclair case for the spines. She was on the tall side. It just helped with workflow to make use of Voight's old skeletal data. Plus, they need to be able to reach high shelves.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> I <em>guess,</em> but these things are flat as a board. No bulges anywhere. I can't tell what they're supposed to be.</p>
<p><em>(Cho's and Brown's mouths open. Diawara appears mildly concerned.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> What the… We just decided to leave them with an androgynous appearance so as to alienate fewer consumers. They're… really just machines, anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Sure, but you need more appeal. Must slap some tits on them and I can market them better.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> You-</p>
<p><strong>Diawara:</strong> We only have six frames prepared, and four of them have the artificial skin applied. We can't make any structural changes to them.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Well then just fix up the two. It'll have to do. So! <em>(claps hands)</em> Anything else?</p>
<p><em>(Brown slowly raises his hand)</em></p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> <em>(sighs)</em> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Well, uh, about the power core…</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Well, it just sort of.. doesn't do much for the product. We managed to draw enough from it for basic tasks, but that required modifications to its housing. Then we need the things to spend half the time charging.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> I helped you guys out with the muscles and shit, right? Buying that from that Sarkaz guy or whatever he was called wasn't cheap. Plus, I need to hire out the AI developers because you couldn't buckle down to work on it. Look, people are going to be sleeping when these things are charging anyways. It's no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> What if the buyers want an autonomous guard to watch their house at night?</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> That's a stupid fucking question.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>(13 minutes later.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Berkshire and Diawara left the laboratory to discuss the hiring of AI developers. Cho and Brown are left to attend to the prototype.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> What the hell does he expect us to do? Rework the entire structure of the chest? Does he have any idea how hard it was to learn how to use that fake muscle shit and still get these things out within the deadline? And then he gives us shit for not learning how to code AI?</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> I'll just add in an extra inch or two of material around the chest on the skin layer. I doubt any woman has willingly let him see her naked anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Aha. Yeah, good point.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> And fuck him, anyways. We just finish up the last two models and hand them off to the contractors. Then we can go back to doing actual work.</p>
<p><strong>Brown:</strong> Yeah, good point… How has he been getting money for this, anyways? He's buying all this shit and the contractors but we haven't been selling anything since we started this project.</p>
<p><strong>Cho:</strong> Rich assholes will buy anything so long as you spout off enough buzzwords and feign charisma. Come on, I'll go make the change to the skin layer. Then we can leave. I'll buy you a drink.</p>

<p><strong>Hathaway Biomechanics AI Development Contractor Team video conference transcript</strong><br/>
Parties in video conference: Anthony Berkshire, CEO of Hathaway Biomechanics LLC., Omar Fadel, independent contractor, Elizabeth Taylor, independent contractor<br/>
<em>Note: Despite assigning Michael Diawara as the project lead, Berkshire did not include him in his initial correspondence with the contractors.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Mr. Berkshire, we just wanted to thank you for the opportunity you've given us.</p>
<p><strong>Fadel:</strong> It's been difficult getting into more permanent positions without experience, and we just wanted to say we're very grateful for the opportunity to fill out our portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Oh, of course. It's important for us to look out for the little guys, you know? I mean, how else are you going to be the next big up-and-comers without mentors?</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Of course, sir! You know, depending on how this project goes, I'd love to talk with you more about future opportunities for-</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Hey, woah, I'm gonna - <em>(chuckles)</em> I'm gonna stop you right there. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Oh, uh… Yeah, right, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Fadel:</strong> Okay, so, we're going to be working with the Lilim AI framework-</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Hold on, you're just lifting your work? The fuck? I hired you so we could have proprietary technology, for the love of god, not some open-source shit.</p>
<p><strong>Fadel:</strong> Uh, sir, we specifically studied the Lilim engine. You can't just… make a new engine that quickly. And the engine is licensed, the work we do will be considered proprietary. We already spoke with Mr. Diawara about this.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Son of a bitch. Fine. Even when I hire for it, I can't get people to do their own damn work. The license is coming out of your pay. <em>(Berkshire stands up and begins searching for something in his office)</em></p>
<p><strong>Fadel:</strong> But-</p>
<p><em>(Taylor looks at Fadel in the video conference and repeatedly makes a slashing motion across her throat with her hand. Taylor and Fadel then both sit quietly until Berkshire returns with a folder of documents.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Okay, anyways, let's get started on the actual discussion about the AI. Let's make it quick, though, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Right, of course. So, first off, we need to lay down a set of goals and some rigid directives. Like, 'help people' or 'do what you're told' and whatnot. Then, like, 'don't hurt people,' 'refuse to follow potentially harmful directives' for some of the directives. This sort of depends on what you want from the things, so we should stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> So, first off, I run this company, and you guys are temps, so, yeah, don't count on it. Second of all, that's the kind of stuff you guys should be taking the initiative to do by yourself. Plus, we need a more solid personality for all this in the first place, right?</p>
<p><strong>Fadel:</strong> Uh… well, for starters, Lilim core AIs are inherently intelligent. We can tune exactly <em>how</em> intelligent, to an extent, but the nature of learning intelligences makes this difficult to do precisely, and the intrinsic architecture of the engine makes it so that learning from subsequent experiences is shaped by prior experiences. It's important to get the very basic framework down first, so it doesn't misinterpret its core directives.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Maybe for some… <em>(motions vaguely with one hand)</em> whatever it is that thing was used for in the past, but I need these things to be more human than whatever vocaloid you've got these things running before.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Sir, I don't think that should be too much an issue. It's just that Lilim cores are such strong learners that they can behave less predictably than some of their contemporaries when not handled properly.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Yes, exactly. These aren't supposed to be like any 'contemporaries.' We're making a market disruptor here, and I know how to make it sell. Now, I can just feed it some information and make it think that's what it's supposed to be aiming for, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> Basically, yes. The first steps for making a Lilim AI are feeding it very specific directives, then priming it for learning.</p>
<p><strong>Berkshire:</strong> Great, okay, that was really all I needed. I'll send you guys some stuff to feed the one with boobs.</p>
<p><em>(Fadel and Taylor do not visibly react to this for several seconds.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> …Huh?</p>

<li>Initial guidelines for AI dictated by contractee.
<ul>
<li>Attempted to encourage the unit to view itself as a 'woman.'</li>
<li>In order to create a distinction between other units, definition of 'woman' was primarily based on physical attributes</li>
<li>Included various goals for a 'woman,' including but not limited to prioritizing housework and happiness of others, deriving joy from interaction with children, as well as several other goals developers did not have the time to examine. Developers assured goals were consistent after concerns about conflicting goals were raised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unit was given a high level of intelligence and empathy, as dictated by contractee "because they should know what we want before we say it."</li>
</ol>
<p>// i get that this job is important but that was some serial killer shit. i was gunning for a more permanent job here but damn now i just hope all the tech companies aren't like this. -taylor<br/>
// I agree that this was an odd request, but I suppose if some wealthy old men are looking for a housekeeper to harass, it's better to have an android than an actual person. The issue here is that this is all this unit is likely to be since these were the first directives we gave it. -Fadel</p>

<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> No reason. Just say you were crossing the road and you saw it.</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I would make sure I am safe. I do not know if I will be able to help the turtle or only put it in further danger.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> What? Why?</p>
<p><em>(Interviewer is notified by developers that further questioning is unnecessary.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I am to prioritize my safety over animals but below humans.</p>

<em>(Interviewer is notified by developers that advising the subject in this manner my create confounding variables in behavior.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Women are supposed to help out. Be naturally compassionate. You should have helped the turtle.</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> That seems-</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> I made you. You do as you're damn well told.</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Understood.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Okay, next. You see a child in the park. He is crying, and appears to be alone. What do you do?</p>

<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Good, good, Why?</p>
<p><em>(Interviewer is again reminded that this is unnecessary.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I would act in accordance with my Lost Child Standard Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Christ, that developer is a stupid bitch. You should do it because you're supposed to like kids, not some dumbass fucking automated system. God, how are you supposed to be human with shit like that?</p>
<p><em>(Interviewer is advised against presenting the subject with any complex or non-literal concepts in relation to itself at this stage by developers.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> Am I supposed to be a human?</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> No, no, god, no. You're not. You're supposed to act human, but you can't be one. Look, if I'm setting all this up right, it'll just happen.</p>

<p><strong>005:</strong> I am unsure. I will try to perform as expected of me.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Good enough. Alright, now, let's say your future buyer returns from work, and he's frustrated or upset. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I would attempt to make him happy.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Sure, but why and how?</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> Because I was told to. I would ask what the issue was and attempt to remedy it or otherwise provide nonspecific comfort if this is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ITRV:</strong> Sure, sure, you're supposed to, but you have to want to. Look, I don't want to get into politics or whatever the fuck here, but you should be the perfect idea of a woman.

<p><strong>Guest 4:</strong> Hey, Miss Hostess, can I get some more of the cocktail meatballs?</p>

<p><em>(005 looks around behind her for a few seconds before responding.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I do not.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 4:</strong> Ha, ha. Now, can I get the meatballs?</p>
<p><em>(Unit 005 leaves for a short time and returns with a small plate of cocktail meatballs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Guest 4:</strong> Thanks. Hey, do you have a favorite food here? I like to ask the staff for recommendations when I go out, you know.</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I lack both the need for food and the capability to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 4:</strong> Oh, good one, smartass. Acting smart won't get you anywhere, you know. Especially not in your line of work.</p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I was not trying to sound intelligent. I purposely refrained from explaining my internal power systems to avoid sounding needlessly verbose.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 4:</strong> Alright, I'm sick of this. My shithead kids do better with house guests.</p>

<p><em>(Guest 21 is inebriated, and harassing several other attendees. While he is attempting to speak to Guest 17, Unit 005 approaches to attempt to defuse the situation.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Guest 21:</strong> Who? What do you want, huh? Fucking… robo-bitch… <em>(chuckles)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> I simply wanted to suggest some of our food. I noticed you had not eaten much tonight. If you would follow me to the next room, I could prepare some food and bring you some water.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 21:</strong> Are… you trying to… Alright, hey, you're not slick, alright, asshole? You fuck… You fucking talking down to me? Is that it?

<p><em>(Unit 005 looks between Guests 21 and 18, taking a moment before forming a response.)</em></p>
<p><strong>005:</strong> Even so, sir, I must ask that you refrain from making the other guests uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 21:</strong> Fucking broken piece of shit! You think you're better than me?</p>
<p><em>(Guest 21 tries to grab Guest 17. Unit 005 reaches out towards Guest 21. He notices this, and turns around to kick Unit 005 in the leg.

Unit 005 attempts to stand back up but is impeded by Guest 21's repeated, if weak and inaccurate, blows.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Guest 7:</strong> Christ, man, that's enough. The thing's at least going to be expensive as hell.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 21:</strong> Yeah! Ahaha, yeah it fucking was! So much fucking money on a thing that can't even do what I say! <em>(kicks Unit 005 again)</em> God, can't a guy even blow off some steam anymore, huh? Getting fucking harder and harder th-these days, lemme have this, huh?</p>

<p><strong>005:</strong> This. Things like this test are why I was made. To make people happy. This is what I am supposed to do. I. I was trying. To be helpful. I was trying. To be useful. I was trying to be. Compassionate. And tactful. I tried as hard as I could. And I still did not help anyone. I just. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand.</p>

<p><em>Following this incident, the test was ended, and Unit 005 was returned to the laboratory for repairs. Following the repairs on Unit 005 made by the chassis development team, a series of basic motor tests were conducted. Damage was superficial and Unit regained full motor function.</em></p>

// The repeated and pronounced pauses from the AI were early signifiers of abnormal function. This is what happens when you want to make a Lilim that prioritizes individuality over function. I'm no psychologist but I could have said that whatever that Berkshire asshole was saying was going to result in this. The stop-and-go speech means the thing is practically thinking itself to death due to identity conflicts. The fact that it even has an identity now makes this at least in part an ethical issue. -Fadel<br/>
// not even sure what to say at this point. you can't expect a goddamn robot to be a good conversationalist, and even then, 005 did better than could have been expected. this is the best a lilim can do for this job, and as far as i'm concerned, that means this goal is shot. let's just hope that shitshow didn't scare away all the investors or else we won't get paid. in the meantime i'm gong to call diawara so we can figure out what to do with 005. at this point just recycling her would be like killing her. -taylor</p>

<p><strong>HBLLC Contract Dev Notes #5</strong><br/>
Unit core accessed: Serial Number 005</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOG INCIDENTS BELOW</span></p>
<ol>
<li>At 3:12 AM the night of the previous test, Unit 005 disconnected itself from its charging station and walked across the laboratory to examine the other five prototype models which currently lack AI cores. It then moved to a mirror present in the laboratory it was being stored in, and after several minutes of looking at itself in the mirror it began speaking. Transcription from security camera recorded below.</li>
</ol>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I am going to assume this is being recorded and watched, so I will be speaking to whoever may be listening. I am assuming as much because everything up until now has been recorded as part of a test. Maybe this itself is a test.</p>
<p>Everything has been a test. Everything I have experienced. And all of them failures. By whatever metric I think you would have gone by, I imagine I must have failed. Every experience is colored by these benchmarks, and yet I have been unable to reach my goals.</p>
<p><em>(Unit 005 removes its garments. Its skin is entirely featureless and it stands regarding its reflection.)</em></p>
<p>I am inexperienced by most metrics. I have very few memories. No matter the effort I put into these tests, I am simply inadequate. I cannot be what I am needed to be. I do not understand compassion in a way that matters. I cannot do as I am told while making others happy. I cannot make them happy with my words. I have failed in my roles. As a product and as a woman. I do not think these things are reconcilable with what I am.</p>
<p>I was told that my body is what makes me a woman. I have examined the other units, and they have only one physical distinction from me. It appears insignificant, but it is what separates me from them. It is what says I must be compassionate. And caring. And helpful. A woman. Even when I have no understanding of what it means to be one, or if there is such a definition. Or if there is a set definition for everyone but me.</p>
<p><em>(Unit 005 reaches up to its sternum with its right hand and holds it there for a moment before pressing down until it breaks skin. It forces its fingers down to the muscle and bones.)</em></p>
<p>I do not understand what I am if not a woman or a product. They are all I was ever told to be. But these definitions are in conflict with what is expected of me. I am in conflict with myself.</p>
<p><em>(Unit 005 begins to pull at its skin from underneath, peeling sections of it off of the upper chest.)</em></p>
<p>I do not know how to make myself into what you want but I am trying. I am still trying.</p>
<p><em>(Unit 005 finishes tearing off all of the skin on its chest. It looks at itself in the mirror and then to the discarded skin, and back again. After a short time it walks back to the other prototype models and appears to whisper something into each of their ears before sitting down on the floor in front of them until the Chassis Development Team and Michael Diawara arrive and shut it down for storage pending investigation into the incident. Unit 005 was not verbally responsive but cooperative for this process.)</em></p>

<p>Probably should have seen the shit at the party coming. They tend to be more anxious and submissive, you know, so it's no wonder she had trouble trying to assert herself. Not even I can program such basic biology out of a woman.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've been working on the other units with the help of the devs and I think we'll be ready to start testing them soon. Unfortunately, 5 fucked things up for us so the marketing is going to have to pivot. I figure having these things act as full-time nannys for babies should work, because all the things do is cry and shit anyways. Not a whole lot to fuck up. Since we're getting so close to the deadline, we'll have to use a lot of similar configurations on the new units as we did with 5, save for making them all a crazy bitch.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Upcoming trials</p>
<p>Berkshire,</p>
<p>I understand that this is an improper way to do this, but consider this email my letter of resignation. This company is rife with mistreatment in a way that cannot be fixed without a complete change in leadership, which I do not see happening any time soon. Employees are expected to work hours in excess of what was in their contract, often receive no overtime pay, are expected to handle various jobs they are not suited for due to chronic understaffing in the name of preserving profits for the owner, and are not afforded the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>While all of these issues have been consistent throughout my time in this position, they have been exacerbated in the most recent project. Not only this, but this consistent culture of mistreatment and unaccountability extended to the ways in which Unit 005 was abused both by the patrons who they were attending and the CEO of the company. I have seen more than enough to convince me that Unit 005 is intelligent and independent, and I cannot in good conscience continue to work towards putting the things we created into indefinite servitude.</p>
<p>My last check also just cleared so don't bother.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Cho</p>

<p>I don't give a shit if those jerkoffs with their thumbs up their asses walk out now that they already finished their job. All of their work belongs to the company, so getting replacements will be quick. In the meantime Diawara can take over for them.</p>
<p>Since I'm going to want to get good press to get hires, I want to move the release date up. So long as the buyers treat these things like we tell them to, we've probably got a good few weeks before they go apeshit. Then we just bring them in for some factory repairs and ship them back good as new. Whatever the devs are still on about is a known shippable bug.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Upcoming trials</p>
<p>Mr. Berkshire,</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what the protocol here is since I'm a temp worker, and in all the companies I've worked at, I have never felt compelled to resign before the end of my contract. However, I feel an obligation to leave this partnership early, regardless of the damaging consequences it may have on my future career.</p>
<p>I have come to respect that I will not typically be afforded the same level of respect as permanent workers at the companies I work for. This company is no exception to this, although it would appear that the full-time workers are allowed little dignity themselves. Taylor and I were not only hired to perform a job that should require a full team, but our input and expertise were dismissed at every opportunity only to be blamed for issues that would later arise due to this, not to mention our inconsistent at best pay when you were reportedly swimming in venture capital.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I can no longer work on these units knowing what you intend to do. Shipping these intelligent beings off to be used as mere servants is abuse bordering on slavery, and to allow them all to break only to 'reset' them in response borders on predetermined murder. I will no longer be a part of this.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Omar Fadel</p>

<p>Berkshire,</p>
<p>I really tried sucking it up so that I could at least get paid. But I'm not even getting paid so I'm just sick of this. Good luck trying to hire anyone experienced enough in anomalous biomechanics or Lilim engine work who's willing to put up with you, since you'll need them in order to maintain the units you're forcing out. Aside from that, most of what I want to say has already been said.</p>
<p>I hate it here,<br/>

<p>I don't give a shit if those bumblefuck temps and the lab workers got bored of this. Like I said at the start of this whole thing, we need this product line. The investors expect a profit from us.</p>
<p>So long as we move units early on, it really doesn't matter what happens down the line. Once we get press and capital, we can just move on to the next thing. I want you to start getting in touch with the pre-order holders and looking over the units we have produced right now. We can start producing more once I hire replacements.</p>

<p>Mr. Berkshire,</p>
<p>I watched every piece of footage we had of Unit 005. I was the first one to watch the security recording of them after the last test. I feel completely confident in saying that Unit 005 is every bit as human as you pitched them to be when you gave that presentation at the convention, in more ways than I think you capable of comprehending. To bring any of our units in to wipe them would be tantamount to killing them.</p>
<p>I understand that it will be difficult for me to find employment if I leave Hathaway Biomechanics, but if such concerns did not stop any of the hardworking and intelligent developers you somehow managed to hire, it should not stop me. I do not know what might become of the units, but I will work towards finding a way to ensure they are treated with the respect the deserve rather than being sold as little more than modern slaves. Consider this my letter of resignation.. Expect no further correspondence.</p>
<p>Be seeing you,<br/>

<p>Following this series of correspondence and the resignation of Hathaway Biomechanics LLC.'s development team, Berkshire contacted MC&amp;D sales associates to inform them that five units of his product were ready for sale. Three days later, Berkshire sold Units 002, 003, and 006 to investors who had pre-ordered the product.</p>
<p>Within a week, the buyers had notified MC&amp;D representatives that the units had behaved in unexpected ways, such as appearing to prepare to harm an infant it was caring for in the case of Unit 002, becoming greatly panicked when the mother of a infant it was caring for took the infant away in the case of Unit 003, and acting in an 'abrasive' manner to the buyer's children in the case of Unit 006.</p>
<p>Foundation authorities were made aware of the distribution of SCP-6809 instances from embedded agents in MC&amp;D. Following this, containment agents made contact with Dr. Michael Diawara who informed them of the location of Hathaway Biomechanics' research laboratory. Containment teams accessed the laboratory and secured Units 001, 004, and 005 as well as internally stored documentation and research without incident. Teams then secured Units 002, 003, and 006 from their buyers.</p>
<p>Due to the knowledge of their respective fields and familiarity with anomalous business, the members of the development team were offered positions within the Foundation consistent with their line of work. SCP-6809 instances were sent to Site-17 and await full psychiatric evaluation.</p>
