            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2963</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2963 is to be kept in two connected standard humanoid containment cells. Humidity of these cells is to be kept at 58%. SCP-2963-5 is to be fed once per day with liquid nutrient solution.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2963 refers to 7 distinct entities that formerly comprised D-3553-3, a D-Class individual previously used by researchers assigned to SCP-████,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> under supervision of Dr. McCauley. D-3553-3 was converted into its current state during a failed containment attempt of SCP-████, which also resulted in the deaths of two additional D-class and four containment personnel.</p>
Each entity grows and functions as a non-anomalous organ system would. SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6 are able to speak in some capacity, despite lacking the necessary anatomy to do so. For records of such communications see sample interview logs.<br/>

<td>Description</td>
<td>Notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-1</td>
<td>Nervous System</td>
<td>Most communicative instance, possesses personality very similar to D-3553-3’s original personality. Able to locomote by pulling itself along horizontal surfaces, despite lacking necessary cell structure to do so. All nerve structures are intact and functional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-2</td>
<td>Skeletal System</td>
<td>Communicates very rarely, but appears to possess intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -3. Bones are held together in form of human skeleton by unknown force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-3</td>
<td>Muscular System</td>
<td>Possesses intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -2, communicates often. SCP-2963-3 is most prone to hostility and violence if provoked, and should be treated with caution. SCP-2963-3 typically maintains humanoid form, but is capable of moving as an amorphous mass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-4</td>
<td>Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems</td>
<td>Moves in a similar fashion to SCP-2963-1, though it is able to scale sheer vertical surfaces. If SCP-2963-4 is deprived of oxygen, all 7 SCP-2963 entities will begin to suffocate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-5</td>
<td>Digestive, Renal, and Excretory System</td>
<td>SCP-2963-5 does not move, and is not believed to be self-aware. Entity must be fed a liquid nutrient solution in order to maintain entirety of SCP-2963. All waste produced by SCP-2963 is excreted by SCP-2963-5.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-6</td>
<td>Integumentary System<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></td>
<td>SCP-2963-6 is capable of communication, though does so rarely. Entity floats approximately one meter above ground by unknown means, and is capable of maneuvering through very small gaps. SCP-2963’s containment chamber has been made airtight as a precaution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCP-2963-7</td>
<td>Reproductive, Endocrine, and Immune Systems</td>
<td>Entity moves similarly to terrestrial gastropods, with organs forming a foot to pull the instance forward.</td>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> At time of interview, SCP-2963 had been in containment for 2 months. Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, Senior Researcher assigned to SCP-2963, formerly assigned to SCP-████ and thus familiar with SCP-2963</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Hello again, how are you this morning?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> Well, I still look like overcooked spaghetti and share a room with my own intestines, so you know, the usual.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Right. We have a few more questions for you today, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> How much can you remember of your life prior to your current state?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> You mean back when I was in one piece? All of it. Childhood, growing up, drug charges, other charges, death row, coming here, getting used like a lab-rat, and…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> And what?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> And the kid. The bender kid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> You mean ████?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> Yeah. Mark. That was his name.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Right. How much do you remember of your time assigned to the ████ team?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> A lot. They used us to deal with the kid. I guess they were afraid of him. But the other Ds didn’t talk much, but I got to know him pretty well. I liked him, good kid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Until he tore your organs apart.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> He was scared. What’s a kid supposed to do when armed goons come after him?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> They typically cry. He leveled a building.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> An <em>empty</em> building! He wouldn’t have done it if there were people there!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> He killed six, and did this to you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-1:</strong> Because they were holding a gun to his head! He was scared! He…he was just a kid. He didn’t know what he was doing</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Right. I think we can end here for now. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview conducted by Dr. McGann. SCP-2963 had been in containment for four months. Interview conducted through Plexiglas plate due to SCP-2963-3’s history of violence.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Good afternoon, three.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> Aaron. Don’t use the number, I’m not a D anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> No, just a scp. 2963<em>-3</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> Use my damn name. You motherfuckers are the reason I got this way.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> No, that would be SC-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> It’s not the kid’s fault. You can’t be mad at a bomb for going off. Especially if you planted it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Quaint. We have a few more questions for you, if you’ll cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Well as you know, we’ve determined that D-3553-3’s original personality was…fragmented by the incident that resulted in your creation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> That’s what you keep saying, yeah. I don’t buy it. I’m still me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Partially. As far as we can tell it’s -1 who got D-3553-3’s original personality. You’re close, but you display markedly higher aggression, host-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-3:</strong> Maybe I’m aggressive because I’m a fucking meat-puppet! Because you sons of bitches made me this way! Because that judge had it in for me! Because the last 6 fucking years have been nothing but tests and labor and the inside of a cell! Because you killed the fucking kid, because you-</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Enough, -3.</p>
<p><em>SCP-2963-3 throws itself at the glass, attempting to break through. During this, SCP-2963-3 screams unintelligibly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Right, I think that’ll be it for today then. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, SCP-2963 had been in containment for five months. SCP-2963-2 requested an interview - request was granted as this was only the second attempt at communication -2 had made thus far.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Good evening, can I ask why you’ve asked for this interview?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I have information.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Okay, did you not have this information when we tried to interview you previously?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Why didn’t you tell us before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I did not think it relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Ok, what do you have to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I do not know who we are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> We? You mean the rest of you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> Yes. The Brain knows. The Muscle knows. I do not. The Skin does not. The others do not know enough to know anything.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Do you mean you possesses a separate memory from -1 and -3?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I do not remember living as the person we are.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> So your memories start after separation?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> What? What do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I remember a life. A different life. The details are faded. I think it was a place far away.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> And you believe you and -6 came from this other person?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> No. I did. The Skin is something else. From somewhere else. A shaper of flesh. A god-eater.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> I see. Do you have any idea why you were chosen for this? How you were pulled into D-3553-3's skeleton?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> I believe we were tangent to this world. When the child was killed, it released an enormous amount of energy that tore through such barriers, and brought us here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> Ah. Well this is a lot of information to process. Thank you for coming to us with this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-2:</strong> You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong><br/>

<p><em>SCP-2963-6 remains silent for approximately 30 seconds</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2963-6:</strong> This is my ordeal. It is as the Ozirmok said, “I have stepped beyond the Floe of Dreams”. I have entered this realm on my crawl towards apotheosis. I have been thrust unto this lowly form so that I may…no, <em>must</em> claw my way towards godhood.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. McGann:</strong> I don’t…what are you talking about?</p>

<p><em>Note: It is currently believed that during the incident that created SCP-2963, SCP-████ pulled disparate consciousnesses from sources other than D-3553-3, and somehow pushed them into SCP-2963-2 and -6. Information regarding SCP-2963-6 has been forwarded to the Para-Religion Division. Neither SCP-2963-2 or SCP-2963-6 have been cooperative for further interviews.</em></p>
