<p><strong>CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL:</strong> <span style="font-size:small;">Individuals that correspond to the following SCP-7076 criteria are to be monitored until 21/9/2076:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Subject lives in the United States</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Subject regularly attends a facility specializing in secondary education</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Subject is currently following an academic trajectory that will culminate in graduation of secondary school in the spring and/or summer of 2076</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Subject is below the age of 21</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Due to the unknown range of SCP-7076's effect, secondary schools across Canadian and Northern Mexican regions are to be extensively monitored as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Due to the scope of the projected anomaly, successful containment has been deemed nigh-impossible without the use of mass amnesticization of the general global population. Upon the occurrence of the first wave of SCP-7076-1 events, news outlets are to be fed disinformation campaigns that reframe SCP-7076-1 occurrences as mass tragedies. Signal suppression is to be enacted in the vicinity of SCP-7076-1 events in order to stifle the flow of information and prevent the destruction of the Veil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Upon the second and third waves of SCP-7076-1 events, a media blackout is to occur regarding information leaving the United States, with all Foundation artificial constructs working at full capacity in order to generate and replicate informational output resembling baseline American activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">The entirety of the United States is also to be placed under complete martial law organized by Foundation input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">It is currently unknown whether the large amount of upcoming SCP-7076-1 events will be influential enough to constitute an RK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenario. If this is so, containment protocol is to be abandoned and <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench" target="_blank">sufficient measures</a> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000" target="_blank">are to be activated.</a></span></p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> <span style="font-size:small;">SCP-7076 is the designation number for a series of phenomena targeting the projected graduating American high school class of 2076.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Officially coined on 13 August 2068, SCP-7076 was initially the designation for a statistical theory regarding the potentiality of an uptick in anomalous activity pertaining to American adolescents. More specifically, SCP-7076 targeted the attendees of secondary public institutions, though mainly being centered on high school seniors that are to graduate in the late spring and early summer of 2076.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Upon its creation, SCP-7076 was strictly theoretical in its actual influence on the public, proposed as a possible encroaching threat due to the high frequency of prior anomalies that targeted American high schoolers in between late 1975 and early 1977. As is policy standard for projected anomalistic activity, various high-level Foundation <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-001-ex" target="_blank">computational engines</a> were fed portions of the SCiPNET archival and research database in order to parse the information given in order to connect data points and form generalized predictions for future containment efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">After two weeks of review, the F19 Anomalous-Prevalence Computational Engine, in collaboration with four Turing-standard artificial statistical analysis constructs, produced its results regarding SCP-7076 on 22 October 2068. These results confirmed the predicted likelihood that SCP-7076 would, in fact, increase in both number and severity, with models explicitly stating the high probability that this second wave of anomalies could possibly dwarf the recorded number of incidents that initially occurred in 1976.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">SCP-7076-1 designates a localized reality shift that is to occur during or immediately following a completed American high school senior graduation ceremony. The results of an SCP-7076-1 event are currently inconclusive, though the presented data suggests it will involve the sudden violent deaths and/or incorporation of all attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Statistical models also suggest that the sheer amount of SCP-7076-1 events in the following late spring and early summer of 2076 may potentially cause a reality cascade and mass reality restructuring event.</span></p>

<tr>
<td>31 May 2069</td>
<td><span style="font-size:small;">Four high school sophomores go missing in the midst of the school day. The incident was initially brushed aside as an instance of skipping class, though all four students were not friends nor were they part of an existing friend group. Security cameras in the hallway captured the students entering a supply closet before closing the door behind them. The closet was found empty with no exit points other than the main door.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>26 August 2069</td>
<td><span style="font-size:small;">Twelve high schools in the state of Iowa within a 50-mile radius do not open as planned for their first day of classes. Students and staff were unable to enter buildings on school grounds as both keycards and physical keys were useless in bypassing security locks. Several students claimed that they could see movement through various windows of the building, with two students reporting that they saw the classrooms were filled with "doppelgangers" of the student and staff body.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 September 2070</td>
<td><span style="font-size:small;">Michelle Easmon, a biology teacher at Ledeville High School in Robeson, Oregon, is reported to have initiated a lesson that was not in the class itinerary. The topic of the lesson regarded the effects of sound frequency on cellular bodies, in which she produced and powered on an antique radio c. 1950. The audio quality was discordant and caused pain and migraines to those present. Afterwards, students reported the persistent feeling that they had forgotten something important, though this faded over time.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 September 2070</td>
<td><span style="font-size:small;">During a broadcasted speech, Senator Denise Rivera (OH) congratulates the graduating class of 2076, stating that she will "work [her] damnedest to push all Ohio students into the empty, lonely, and lovely future that they deserve." Ms. Rivera's eyes then roll back into her head and she falls to the ground, seizing. The signal is cut through Foundation media tampering.</span></td>

<p><strong>Item Number:</strong> SCP-7076</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Pending</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7076 does not require containment, see below.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7076 was a series of escalating anomalous incidents that occurred across the United States and primarily targeted the senior high school graduating class of 2076. Foundation statistical models predicted SCP-7076 due to previous data and recorded history regarding a series of violent anomalous occurrences that victimized the high school senior class of 1976.</p>
<p>Foundation statistical models also predicted a culmination resulting from various reality failures occurring at graduation ceremonies across the United States. While anomalies pertaining to the class of 1976 experienced heightened activity, there was no resulting cascading event at any ceremony within the country.</p>
<p>Kant counters were eventually brought to various random graduation ceremonies, with resulting measurements displaying no deviation from baseline Hume levels.</p>
<p>Following the summer of 2076, all anomalous activity pertaining to SCP-7076 and SCP-7076-related anomalies ceased.</p>
<p>SCP-7076 is currently being decommissioned and will be archived within the Foundation's database.</p>
