<p>A component of the satellite array surrounding SCP-5609</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An array of Foundation-owned satellites surround SCP-5609 at all times, and are programmed to constantly project a selectively antimemetic field around the object to prevent its viewing by civilians. Unmanned research probe SCPS <em>Spearhead</em> has been landed on SCP-5609, and is currently being used to collect its tissue samples and take vital readings. Any changes in the orbital pattern of SCP-5609 are to be monitored, and circumvented via movement of the satellite array.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5609 is a massive (230 km in diameter), bioluminescent, spherical organism, currently in orbit 30,000 km above the earth's surface. SCP-5609 constantly emits yellow light, and upon cursory observation resembles a small moon.</p>
<p>Close-up inspection of SCP-5609 has shown it to possess features similar to those of some beetle larvae, such as a small, discolored head with two compound eyes and two short mandibles; two visible legs protruding from underneath its head; and soft, segmented skin.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Recovered Data</strong></p>
<p>The following is a list of data pertaining to SCP-5609, collected by SCPS <em>Spearhead.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-5609 moves periodically; however, such motion consists of not much more than momentary twitching of its legs and mandibles.</li>
<li>SCP-5609 lacks the ability to steer and propel its body through space. Its orbit is entirely passive.</li>
<li>The metabolism of SCP-5609 is hypothesized to be up to 3,000 times slower than that of any terrestrial insect.</li>
<li>The presence of spiracles<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> on the body of SCP-5609 indicate that it is not biologically suited for survival in a vacuum.</li>
<li>A section of skin on the back of SCP-5609 protrudes from the organism, as if being pulled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addendum: Incident Log</strong></p>
<p>On March 22, 2021, SCP-5609 disappeared, along with SCPS <em>Spearhead</em>. The anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized after an extensive search of the area of outer space surrounding Earth found no trace of it.</p>
<p>One month later, SCPS <em>Spearhead</em> re-appeared in high Earth orbit and immediately fell through the atmosphere. Despite sustaining heavy damage upon crash-landing, the following audio log remained intact.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>(Heavy static is audible, but dissipates after 7 seconds. Upon its dissipation, two voices are heard.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown-1:</strong> Hoooooo-eeee! Now <em>this</em> one's bound to be a doozy.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-2:</strong> Can't believe they bit. Oh, we'll sure be eatin' well tonight!</p>
<p><em>(After a few moments, the voices become louder. The recording distorts slightly as a result.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown-2:</strong> Hey, Willie? Uh… you gotta see this.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-1:</strong> What the- awwwww, c'mon, not this <em>again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown-2:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-1:</strong> Oh, just another one of those shiny bugs. Toss it back in.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-2:</strong> Could I keep it? It looks pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-1:</strong> <em>(Audibly sighs)</em> You can't <em>eat</em> cool, Amos.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown-2:</strong> All right, all right, <em>fine.</em> <em>(The sound of rushing air is heard, followed by a loud splash. The voices begin to fade.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Unknown-1:</strong> …gotta cast out by the moon next time. I heard tell the folks there're a bunch more gullible.</p>
<p><em>(Static becomes audible. The recording ends.)</em></p>
</div>
<p>The area surrounding the moon is currently being monitored for signs of SCP-5609 re-emergence.</p>
