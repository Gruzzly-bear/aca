            <h1>SCP-9084</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9084 does not require containment.</p>
<p>SCP-9084 did not happen. The information in this file is not factual. Procedures are to contain SCP-9084's existence, not validity.</p>
<p>Knowledge of SCP-9084 is inherently self-containing, and both acquisition and attempted acquisition of SCP-9084 show no risk of Veil breach. In spite of this, fragments pertaining to SCP-9084 should be scrubbed by Foundation .aic webcrawlers.</p>
<p>The sole copy of SCP-9084's entry is to be held by O5 Command for use in relevant negotiations. In the event of a leak, personnel are to be reminded of the following.</p>
<p>SCP-9084 did not happen. The information in this file is not factual. Procedures are to contain SCP-9084's existence, not validity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9084 is the designation for a fact that does not exist, is not true, and concerns an event that did not happen.</p>
<p>Fragments of SCP-9084 intermittently appear in printed and digital media through an unknown mechanism or vector in designated FORMATION events. These fragments and posited hypotheticals about SCP-9084 can be described in portions, but SCP-9084 in its entirety cannot be assembled.</p>
<p>Upon assembly of unidentifiable portions of SCP-9084, a sufficient number of correct inferences, or a sufficient number of individuals affected, SCP-9084 will completely remove itself and attempted inferences of its contents from the affected storage medium. These are designated as CULLING events.</p>
<p>This occurs irrespective of the nature of the medium; documented instances of CULLING events have occurred in analog, digital, and biological storage.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel initially attempted to control both FORMATION and CULLING events. Maximum strength measures for both uniformly failed. Further attempts have been deemed a waste of Foundation resources by O5 Command, in spite of rapidly increasing direct noospheric intrusions during FORMATION events.</p>
<p>Individuals attempting assembly of SCP-9084 in its entirety are at zero risk of serious side effects from assembly or CULLING events, irrespective of identity or background.</p>
<p>Repeated trials with noospheric activity radars (NARs) have shown increased localized noospheric activity the closer that posited inferences are to the entirety of SCP-9084, allowing for partial assembly of SCP-9084 while avoiding portions that trigger removal. This list of hypotheticals, as well as fragments that have appeared in media, can be found below.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Collected Information Regarding SCP-9084</strong></span></p>
<hr/></div>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9084 concerns knowledge of an event that occurred on the Indian subcontinent.</li>
<li>This event involved no anomalous activity.</li>
<li>This event was primarily localized to Northern India.</li>
<li>CULLING events are intentionally created.</li>
<li>CULLING events are designed to remove SCP-9084 from the global noosphere.</li>
<li>Consequences of SCP-9084 have indirectly affected individuals in other locations.</li>
<li>This event occurred to or directly affected at least one individual.</li>
<li>This individual, or individuals, were unaware that SCP-9084 was about to occur to them.</li>
<li>This group above was largely uniform in background.</li>
<li>That background was cultural, ethnic, or religious.</li>
<li>This event occurred between the years of 1970-1990.</li>
<li>Attempts to shorten the potential timeframe are at increased risk for removal.</li>
<li>The severity of removal in CULLING events was unintentional.</li>
<li>Other individuals were involved that did not belong to the group above.</li>
<li>These individuals were aware SCP-9084 was occurring.</li>
<li>These individuals allowed SCP-9084 to occur, or assisted in it.</li>
<li>SCP-9084 was unable to be documented by outside media for nonanomalous reasons.</li>
<li>CULLING events did not occur to select individuals.</li>
<li>This third group of individuals may have had ties to local, state, and federal authorities.</li>
<li>This event caused a strong, putrid smell across portions of Northern India for extended periods of time.</li>
<li>CULLING events' existence is inherently tied to the third group of individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-9084's existence was theorized following an unusual uptick of reports of astroturfing on social media channels in India in January 2010. This coincided with a sequential pair of events involving the Indian government:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, excavations of unmarked burial sites in Northern India.</li>
<li>Second, unexpected cooperation of Indian government anti-anomaly agencies with Foundation authorities for the first time in recorded history. This occurred following inquiries regarding the potential existence of an entity similar to SCP-9084.</li>
</ul>
<p>This cooperation has proven <strong><em>exceptionally</em></strong> beneficial to Veil protection and Foundation interests in a novel location. Containment of anomalies in the subcontinent has increased 430%, and Site construction has been fast-tracked by authorities in the Indian government. Investment in Foundation shell companies has increased fourfold, and local personnel recruitment is 50% higher than models suggested.</p>
<p>Ethics Committee inquiries have encouraged questioning of Foundation contacts within the Indian government regarding the nature of SCP-9084 when complete. These have been and should be uniformly denied by O5 Command to preserve bureaucratic relations.<br/>
