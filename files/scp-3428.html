            <h1>SCP-3428</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3428</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Reports regarding the discovery of SCP-3428 are to be investigated immediately, and the instance is to be secured as soon as possible. Should it activate before being properly secured, Mobile Task Force Alpha-21 ("DDT Did Nothing Wrong") is to be sent in to subdue and capture the instance. Class-A amnestics are to be administered to all witnesses.</p>
<p>SCP-3428 instances in custody are to be submerged in soil unless needed for experimentation. Testing involving SCP-3428 requires approval from SCP-3428's Head Researcher (currently Jared ████), and must be submitted 6 days in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3428 are crude statues of hummingbirds with wingspans no larger than 5 meters. "<a href="/scp-1285">CtM</a>" is engraved upon the underside of each instance. Individual instances differ slightly in make with one another, although most instances are composed of scrap metal and polyester fabric. SCP-3428 are typically found around .5 to 1.5 m underground, either in archaeological dig sites or urban construction areas. While buried underneath at least .5 m of soil, SCP-3428 remains inert.</p>
<p>Approximately 5 to 10 days after being unearthed, SCP-3428 will spontaneously animate. Behavior varies between instances, although most have shown destructive tendencies upon animating. Instances of SCP-3428 will generally only cause damage if the act of doing so is clearly visible. It is rare for instances of SCP-3428 to outright attack humans.</p>
<p>Although SCP-3428's crude physiology renders them unable to feed, instances have been observed attempting to scavenge for food and drink, much of which lies outside the typical trochilidae diet.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-3428 instances of note are listed here:</p>

<td>New Orleans, Louisiana</td>
<td>SCP-3428-5 was found harassing alligators outside of a sugar plantation, and sustained serious damage before being secured.</td>
<td>SCP-3428-5 appeared to be wearing a Mardi Gras mask and beads. Investigation into the possibility of a deliberate unearthing is underway.</td>

<td>SCP-3428-16</td>
<td>13/11/1990</td>
<td>Burbank, California</td>
<td>Upon waking, SCP-3428-16 headed towards [REDACTED] Studios before becoming distracted by a █████Co delivery truck.</td>
<td>Attached to SCP-3428-16 was a loudspeaker. As soon as SCP-3428-16 animated, the loudspeaker began playing <em>Night on Bald Mountain</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.</td>

<td>Site 56</td>
<td>SCP-3428-46 dug itself out of the ground and proceeded towards Site 56's front entrance. Its attempts to force itself through ended when the automatic security system decapitated it.</td>
<td>SCP-3428-46 is the first instance to unearth itself without observed human assistance. In addition, SCP-3428-46's insides housed a nest of wasps, which proceeded to fly out after SCP-3428-46's destruction and unsuccessfully attack a soft drink vending machine.</td>
