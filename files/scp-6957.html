            <h1>SCP-6957</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6957</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Witnesses to SCP-6957 during its brief appearance on Earth are to be amnesticized. As SCP-6957 has relocated to an unknown region of space beyond civilian space observation stations, further containment procedures of SCP-6957 are unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6957 is a sapient space-faring organism resembling a disembodied tongue, twelve kilometers in circumference, which entered Earth's atmosphere on 4 July 2307. SCP-6957 remained partially submerged in the Pacific Ocean for approximately seventy-two hours before ascending into Earth's atmosphere and subsequently leaving the planet's orbit. The cause of this is unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 6957.1:</strong> On 3 August 2307, SCP-6957 established a one-way communication channel with Earth's deep space communication relays that was intercepted by the Galactic Foundation. The message it sent has been transcribed below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I am a Gormetian culinary expert of the highest calibur, hailing from the Ramsey System of the Plastic Galaxy. You know me by many names: Killgaroth, Consumer of Worlds; Killmonger, Consumer of Worlds; The World Eater, Consumer of Worlds; or Johnathan.</p>
<p>My clientele have hired me specifically for my exquisite pallet and measure of character, as I am well regarded for my excellent taste when it comes to devouring worlds. A visit from me is a blessing. To exist in the micro-biome of a Gormetian such as I is the highest achievement any well respecting sapient race should experience.</p>
<p>Earth, however, will not receive the glory of my consumption, nor that of my clientele.</p>
<p>Your atmosphere is an assault to the senses. Overloaded with a horrid amalgamation of sweet and salty that do nothing to compliment each other. Quite frankly, penetrating the planet's ocean was a refreshing reprieve from the air, although only momentarily.</p>
<p>Your oceans, by the stars, your oceans. What good is there other than the fact that it's liquid? If you can even <strong>call</strong> that liquid. The stentch, rotten to the core. The aquatic life are both hostile and rude, and the flavor. I shudder to reflect on the flavor.</p>
<p>This simply will not do. There is far too much seasoning on Earth. You will rectify this immediately, and I return in another cycle to re-assess the dish. Do well not to fuck it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 6957.2:</strong> On 3 August 2310, SCP-6957 returned to Earth, remaining suspended above the Pacific Ocean for forty-eight hours before ascending out of the atmosphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I gave you explicit instructions <strong>not</strong> to fuck it up. Somehow you've made an overcooked, over seasoned, dish raw.</p>
<p>I would like to re-interate for emphasis.</p>
<p>Your planet has gone from cooked to raw.</p>
<p>How in the universe did you even manage that?</p>
