<p>Sample of SCP-1974-EX, remaining after distribution incident at [REDACTED].</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-1974 specimens are to be contained in Low-Value Item Storage at Site 61, when not needed for experiments.</span> <em>SCP-1974-EX specimens are to be contained in a standard small-item lockbox in the Research and Development storage area of Site-55.</em></p>
<p>When handled by personnel not being subjected to an experiment, butyl rubber or nitrile (NBR) rubber gloves should be worn to prevent exposure to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">anomalous effects</span> <em>drugs embedded within the SCP-1974-EX material</em>. Affected personnel must be removed from duty and quarantined until the effects of SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> wear off (approximately 36 hours).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Field agents have been issued Order 61-1974-B: a <em>low-priority</em> directive to capture and contain SCP-1974 specimens not under Foundation control, and gather evidence as to their source.</span> Field Order 61-1974-B rescinded 08/16/1992.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> are 20-sided dice (commonly referred to as d20s in role-playing games) which appear to be composed of a standard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer.</p>
<p>Anyone handling SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> for five minutes continually, or over approximately one hour when SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> is used in a typical role-playing game, is subject to the effects of hallucinations and extreme suggestibility. When SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> is used in a role-playing game, approximately 90% of affected subjects believe the game parameters and environment to be real, and begin to act accordingly. Effects typically persist for 36 hours. The remaining 10% of exposed subjects experience miscellaneous hallucinations typical of an unintentional exposure to LSD-25 or psilocybin, as do subjects exposed to SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> and not offered intentional or unintentional behavior suggestions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It is currently being investigated whether the effects of SCP-1974 are chemical, memetic, or <a href="/scp-1024">supernatural</a>.</span></p>
<p><em>Analysis has determined that in SCP-1974-EX, the ABS has been combined with [REDACTED], a solvent and carrier similar to Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but solid at room temperature. This is used to introduce a dose of an r-Ergotamine derivative, a long-acting hallucinogen. In addition, SCP-1974-EX contains a transmitter emitting non-audible sounds at frequencies of [REDACTED], generating a psychoacoustic effect that combines with the hallucinogen to cause extreme suggestibility in SCP-1974-EX-exposed subjects.</em></p>
<p><em>Since SCP-1974-EX is merely a novel means of hypnotizing subjects and secretively dosing them with hallucinogens, it is hereby declassified as an SCP and removed from the main SCP database as of 08/16/1992. Collection of further uncontained specimens is now a police matter and will not be conducted by Foundation Agents.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to the potential uses in clandestine activities and humanoid SCP control, Foundation Research and Development has requisitioned the supply of SCP-1974-EX, and is developing the means to reproduce its effects in different formats.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> came to the Foundation's attention when a large quantity were distributed as free samples during [REDACTED] Con, a Science Fiction and Fantasy convention held in ████████, ██ on █/██-██/19██. Over 200 individuals were detained after exhibiting bizarre behavior resulting in █ fatalities, ██ injuries, and numerous incidents of property damage and disorderly conduct. ███ specimens of SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> were confiscated, and the incident attributed to mass hysteria caused by an unusual variety of food poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Log 1974-01:</strong> The following is an excerpt from a list of incidents reported shortly after the initial release of SCP-1974<em>-EX</em> to the public. It demonstrates that while many affected subjects engage in harmless but absurd behavior, others pose a danger to themselves and others, especially to unsuspecting or defenseless persons.</p>
<ul>
<li>█████ ██████; severely beat █████ Hotel doorman; believed victim was “an orc.” Subject successfully restrained with minor injuries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>████ ████████; restrained while “casting a fireball” by chanting in an unknown language, waving a pool cue, and burning a carefully arranged circle of kitchen spices. No injuries reported.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>███████ ████; claimed to work for [REDACTED] after playing a game of “Paranoia”; interrogated and released when it was determined that subject had no knowledge of genuine classified information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>█████ █████; killed by ████████ police after charging a group of officers with a butcher knife, while shouting “Blood for the Blood God!”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>███ ███████; attempted to sacrifice his sister to “summon Yog Sothoth” after playing “Call of Cthulhu”. [DATA EXPUNGED].</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The source of SCP-1974-EX remains unknown. Relevant information anonymously transferred to ████████, ██ Police Department for continuing investigation.</em></p>
