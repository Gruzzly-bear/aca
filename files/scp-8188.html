<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The town of Bellamy is being monitored by Foundation personnel for SCP-8188 events. Conversations and dreams experienced by victims of SCP-8188 are to be extracted through interviews and sleep studies. Any individual affected by an SCP-8188 event is to be administered Class-B amnestics after completion of event and data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8188 is a set of anomalous events targeting seemingly random individuals in Bellamy, ███, consisting of two phases: an initial conversation, and the proceeding dream. Both phases appear to center around SCP-8188-A. SCP-8188 events have been observed to occur outside or within public areas<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-376131-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-376131-1')">1</a></sup>. SCP-8188-A has never been observed to materialize within a building or enter private housing.</p>
<p>SCP-8188-A is a humanoid figure that is consistently described as an approximately 6 foot tall male with pale skin, brown hair and eyes, and a scar on the left side of its face. It has been seen wearing a black or beige hooded sweater along with either black jeans or sweatpants, and blue sneakers. SCP-8188-A refers to itself as "Mouse" and/or "Marcus".</p>
<p>An SCP-8188 event begins with -A materializing nearby and walking up to the victim to start conversation, mistaking them for someone the entity recognizes. -A has routinely identified a victim with one of five different names: Marley, Daniel, Ivan, Lucas, and █████. There appears to be correlation between a victim's physical appearance and the name -A misattributes them with. Further research into these patterns is ongoing.</p>
<p>SCP-8188 victims have universally not recognized -A and will attempt to walk away or otherwise end the conversation. -A has shown different reactions to this, such as insisting on the mistaken identity, apologizing for bothering the victim, or acknowledging this, but forgetting or ignoring the correction. -A has not become hostile during any recorded SCP-8188 interaction.</p>
<p>While conversing, -A will eventually ask the victim "<em>Do you remember how we became friends?</em>"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-376131-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-376131-2')">2</a></sup>, and ended their conversation with a phrase involving the words "<em>I miss you</em>". The significance of these phrases are unknown. After the conversation has ended, -A will continue its previous activity (e.g., walking, shopping) while under direct observation from the victim and surrounding civilians. When out of sight, -A will dematerialize.</p>
<p>After initial contact with -A, a victim will experience a dream the next time they fall asleep within a dark and enclosed space. They will experience vivid dreams involving one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Shadowy" or indistinct figures,</li>
<li>Garbled or unintelligible speech,</li>
<li>Academic environments,</li>
<li>Amusement parks,</li>
<li>Psychiatric wards,</li>
<li>Closed offices,</li>
<li>A dark bedroom,</li>
<li>A set of up to five distinct adolescents (often described to be within their late teens and having consistent appearances),</li>
<li>A hooded figure (presumed to be -A).</li>
</ul>
<p>The dreams appear to have themes connected to specific names. Approximately 95% of victims identified as "Marley" denote their dream having taken place in the stands of a football field.</p>
<p>For approximately 10% of victims (up to 80% for victims identified as █████ by -A), the dream will instead consist of -A sitting or standing within the victim's sleeping environment, usually in the closest corner. It is often described to be "twitching" and whispering short phrases to the victim.<br/>
Logged phrases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<em>I miss you</em>",</li>
<li>"<em>It's freezing</em>",</li>
<li>"<em>Come back for me</em>",</li>
<li>"<em>I'm still here</em>",</li>
<li>"<em>Remember me?</em>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Other similar quotes have also been recorded. In these cases, -A is usually observed to have a section of the left side of its neck missing. No victim has been to said to experience another SCP-8188 event after the dream has ended.</p>

<p>Ms. Brooks described having a dream about a football field "hanging out" with 3 adolescents and speaking with them. A hooded figure (assumed to be -A) approaches the group with multiple boxes of food.

<p>Mr. Taylor reported his dream taking place within a high school "band" room, sitting down with an electric bass guitar in his hands. A hooded figure (presumed to be -A) sat across from him holding an electric guitar. An unidentified figure sat to the side of them behind a drum kit. The hooded figure asks Taylor if he is "ready". Taylor recalls nodding his head, and then beginning to play a "rock" song that he had "never heard before" with the rest of the figures in the dream. The dream ended as soon as the song ended.</p>

<p><strong>Schaffer:</strong> Hey, you need to have like, a car to be over here.</p>

</div>
<div class="note">
<p>Mr. Schaffer spoke of his dream as taking place within a sterile medical room. A hooded figure (presumed to be -A) is lying within a bed. Dream consisted of a nurse walking into the room, awakening the figure. The nurse then measured the figure's vital signs and bringing in a tray of food before leaving. During these events, the figure whispered "I miss you" to itself repeatedly. After measurements, the figure laid back down in bed, still repeating the phrase. After "multiple minutes" of remaining stationary on the bed, the figure becomes silent and suddenly sits up, ending the dream.</p>
