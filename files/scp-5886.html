            <h1>SCP-5886</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5886</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5886 is seemingly self-contained within Humanoid Containment Chamber #1939 (HCC-1939) at Site-42. Testing of SCP-5886 has been suspended until feasible means of doing so are found.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5886 appears to be a dark-skinned male, approximately aged in its late teens or early twenties. Since its discovery, the subject has been completely motionless and intangible. The only evidence to SCP-5886's identity is its T-shirt, which bears the words "I am James Biggio. Leave me alone." written in black marker. A background check into the name James Biggio turned up a missing person's report for the subject out of Athens, Ohio, dated December 4th, 2013.</p>
<p>Attempts to remove the bed SCP-5886 is lying on result in personnel appearing outside of the containment chamber with no memory of leaving the room. Adjustments to temperature within the chamber are similarly reversed.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Log:</strong> SCP-5886 manifested inside of HCC-1939 on October 7th, 2014. Janitorial staff discovered the subject lying on the bed and alerted site security. Security unsuccessfully attempted to apprehend the subject before contacting research staff.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-5886-1: Disappearance</strong></p>
<p>On August 18th, 2020, the Pegasus Rising Project<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> successfully created a wormhole for a span of 5 microseconds, causing a power outage throughout Site-42. Upon a safety check of containment chambers, SCP-5886 was missing from its chamber; a note was left in its place. The contents of the letter are transcribed below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The snowflakes froze mid-air.</p>
<p>So did everything around me. The cars on the street, my parents… I screamed at them. I pushed my dad and he hung in the air, frozen like the snowflakes. I called for help. I searched through town for anyone who would move. I walked around for hours. The whole town was stone still.</p>
<p>I don't know when I fell asleep, but when I woke up, it was still night. I went back for my parents. My dad had moved. Not in front of me, but he wasn't hanging in the air. He was half-way from where I left him and the ground. My mom was looking at him now.</p>
<p>I stayed with them for a while, but eventually I went exploring. I stopped in a restaurant and picked up some food. Left some cash, not that it matters at this point. While I was eating on a bench, I saw a hummingbird floating in the air next to the bushes. It had this beautiful red color under its throat, and I sat and watched it. After an hour or so (I'm guessing, my watch and cell phone are useless), I noticed its wings were moving. Not that I could see, but it was definitely halfway from top to bottom when it was at the top before.</p>
<p>In my time like this, I've read every new book in every library I've come across. Not a lot of TV shows I can watch. A ruby-throated hummingbird beats its wings 50 times every second, and it took an hour and a half for it to move halfway.</p>
<p>I've helped people too. People in front of cars about to get hit? Falling off a bridge? I've saved lives. But then they just stare off into nothing. I want to say I got used to not being thanked, but…</p>
<p>This fucking sucks.</p>
<p>I found one of your guys in a library in Chicago; they had dropped a bunch of books with pictures of a <a href="scp-3086.html">weird blue mouse</a> and I saw a logo I didn't recognize on their badge. I came here and found your library. The things you guys research here are incredible. God, I wish I could see some of it in action.</p>
<p>Then I saw this thing you guys are calling Pegasus Rising; a wormhole to another dimension? Finally, something different, maybe someone I could talk to.</p>
<p>So I picked an empty cell and stayed here. Stayed still long enough that you guys could actually see me. And now you don't.</p>
<p>Thanks for the room.</p>

<p>SCP-5886's reclassification to Uncontained is pending.</p>
