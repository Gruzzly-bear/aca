            <h1>SCP-1976</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1976</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-1976 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment chamber, located within <a href="/secure-facility-dossier-site-55">Site-55</a>'s Safe SCP wing. Personnel entering SCP-1976's containment chamber are to wear tinted goggles to prevent accidental viewing of SCP-1976. All images and videos depicting SCP-1976 have been destroyed, and the creation of new images is to be considered a breach of containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1976 is a humanoid organism, approximately 2 meters tall and weighing 80 kilograms. When viewed remotely, SCP-1976 resembles the subject believed to be responsible for its creation, an adult male named Alan ██████, in a persistent vegetative state.</p>
<p>If a human subject is able to view SCP-1976, whether by seeing it physically or on a reproduced image such as a photograph, they will come under the immediate and permanent belief that SCP-1976 is the person they recognize as their father, who has recently been injured due to a serious accident. Subjects will attempt to draw attention to their father's condition, which will invariably lead to additional subjects being affected by SCP-1976. If an SCP-1976-affected person is presented with their real father, they will not recognize them and react as though they were a stranger.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If more than one subject is affected by SCP-1976 at once, they will each believe that SCP-1976 is their father. They will attempt to conduct logical arguments with other SCP-1976-affected subjects, attempting to use their interpretations of SCP-1976's appearance to convince them. When these attempts invariably fail, subjects will attempt to take SCP-1976 by force, sometimes attempting to contact higher levels of authority in order to accomplish this.</p>
<p>SCP-1976 was discovered on 9/17/1976, after a case of massive confusion caused by SCP-1976 at a local hospital reached Foundation assets. Investigation into SCP-1976's origin revealed that it had been taken to the hospital from a residential address in Boston, MA. Several audio tape recordings were recovered from the address' basement, with neighbors and family members issued amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a series of audio tape recordings produced by Alan ██████, a former mortuary assistant who had expired two days prior to SCP-1976's recovery. Investigation into connections between this individual and possible <a href="/scp-814">groups</a> of <a href="/scp-332">interest</a> have not yielded substantial evidence.</p>

<p>Experiment 5.</p>
<p>The stiff actually woke up this time. I couldn't transfer what I had to onto him because he started freaking out, so I had to put him down. I don't think the girls heard it, so that's a relief.</p>
<p><em>[A wet cough is audible.]</em></p>
<p>This one, uh. It's a real catastrophe, I tell you. I don't know how I'm going to explain how all the corpses keep going missing from the morgue to Mitchell, but I can't stop now.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Hey Jess, hey Liz. It's dad. I wanted to tell you how happy I am that you graduated high school. And if you didn't, well, why is your mom playing this for you?</p>
<p><em>[Laughter, which is suddenly cut off by a single cough.]</em></p>
<p>You're on to your next big adventure; college! You're both smart cookies, so I just know you got accepted into Harvard. I just wish I could see you now. Be good, and remember, no boys until after you graduate, okay? I'm holding your mom to that.</p>

<p>Experiment 9.</p>
<p>Nothing is working anymore. I can't get them to wake up and Artie is starting to get suspicious that I'm at the dump every other night with a huge bag. Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><em>[There is a light snapping sound, presumably a lighter being turned on.]</em></p>
<p>What am I going to do? I'll have to make sure I get rid of these recordings so Anna doesn't flip her lid after I…</p>
<p><em>[A sigh.]</em></p>
<p>God damn it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Hey, Jess, hey Liz. It's dad. If you're hearing this, it's because one of you is getting married! Sorry I couldn't be there for you on your special day, darling, but you know how it is with these things. I love you. And I don't know who you're marrying, but if you love him, I'm sure he's real special.</p>
<p>I know that if you're getting married, a baby can't be far behind. Heh heh. You know, I never dreamed of being a grandfather? I always thought it would be me and my girls, forever young. But I know that's impossible.</p>
<p>Between you and me, I'd be a lousy grandfather. I'd spoil your kids rotten.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I have been a fool. All this time I thought making them wake up was what I had to do, but that <a href="/remembrance">schoolteacher</a> proved me wrong. I'd better get to work.</p>
