<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9043 is a pair of socks, featuring a light brown and navy blue striped pattern.</p>
<p>Any static electricity SCP-9043 accumulates can only be released by an electrostatic discharge; all other methods fail. The anomaly demonstrates greater elasticity than what its composition should allow. Attempts to trace SCP-9043's origins beyond the circumstances surrounding its acquisition have failed <em>(See — History.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:130%;"><tt><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HISTORY</span></tt></span></strong></p>
<p>Throughout 2023-2027 the Foundation has endured a series of raids, skirmishes, assassinations, and other forms of sabotage from <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chaos-insurgency-hub">GoI-002</a> ("Chaos Insurgency.") This campaign resulted in extensive property damage, casualties, and disruption to the Foundation's operations.</p>
<p>Foundation counter-activity against GoI-002 has yielded inconsistent results. On 12/04/2027, the Foundation raided a GoI-002 stronghold in Kalamata; the facility had been evacuated and stripped of primary resources. Recovered materials were limited to negligible quantities of rations, ammunition, and several low-priority anomalous objects.</p>
<p>SCP-9043 was recovered from a provisional testing chamber.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-320064-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-320064-1')">1</a></sup> It remains undetermined if GoI-002 abandoned the anomaly intentionally or inadvertently during evacuation. Multiple indicators suggested the facility likely functioned as an R&amp;D site for weaponizing anomalies. SCP-9043 and associated objects have been secured for evaluation <em>(See — Addendum.01.)</em></p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043 was rubbed against various insulators and conductors, then brought in close-proximity to the wall via a robotic arm.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-320064-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-320064-2')">2</a></sup> This test was repeated under multiple variables (humidity, temperature, ventilation etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> A low-level electrostatic discharge was always produced; the wall was not damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Several personnel were mistakenly shocked by the anomaly; electrostatic dissipative gloves were distributed among staff to amend this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043 was electrically measured.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Results state one set (SCP-9043-A) held an indefinite positive charge. The other set (SCP-9043-B) held a negative charge. Attempts to shift SCP-9043's charge to neutral have failed.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> A small portion of any quantity of static electricity that enters SCP-9043 is permanently stored inside the anomaly instead of being released. The reason this occurs remains unclear.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> Originally, both sets of SCP-9043 were to be analyzed in separate rooms. Not an official test.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> An attractive force prevented SCP-9043 from being seperated beyond 4 meters from each other. Separation was then again attempted. A series of electrical arcs discharged between SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B in rapid succession. Upon release, the phenomenon ceased.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-9043 suffered no visible damage. Attempts to separate SCP-9043 beyond 4 meters have so far been infeasible.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> D-00600 donned SCP-9043 , rubbing them against the carpet at variable velocities, ranging from low to high intensity.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Low velocities produced low-level electrostatic discharges. High velocities generated high-level electrostatic discharges, capable of damaging the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> All discharges were emitted through D-00600's finger, reportedly without any pain or injuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> While donning SCP-9043, D-00600 was electrically measured.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Results state the right side of D-00600's body possesses a positive charge; the other, negative. Electrostatic anomalies cease upon removal of SCP-9043.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The electric charge of D-00600's body depended on how SCP-9043 was worn onto his feet."</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> D-00600 donned only SCP-9043-A, rubbing them on the carpet.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-00600 was regularly inflicted with an electric shock by SCP-9043-A. Each attempt increased the shock's voltage. When examined, several burn marks were found on his right foot.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> D-00600 was placed on medical leave until his injuries had healed.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> One pickled cucumber, one photomultiplier tube, and one batteryless remote-controlled car were inserted into SCP-9043 sequentially.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The cucumber illuminated.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-320064-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-320064-3')">3</a></sup> The photomultiplier tube and toy car became operational, ceasing function upon their removal from SCP-9043.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Electrical measurement of the items, while inserted, revealed dual charge properties identically with D-00600. Despite disparate voltage requirements, all items were successfully powered. Current theory suggests SCP-9043 possesses an inherent electrical potential capable of transference to specific objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043 was placed inside a washing machine; the device was activated, then unplugged half-way through its wash cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The washing machine continued to operate. Upon completion of its wash cycle, the device immediately became non-functional.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The device did not appear to display a positive and negative like prior test items. The reason for this is currently unclear.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B were applied onto a large balloon (fully inflated.) A Van de Graaff generator was then to be used to supply the item with either a positive or negative static charge. The item was also electrically measured.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The item illuminated brightly. SCP-9043-A fell off during testing. The balloon ruptured immediately; a spherical mass of plasma hovered in midair before quickly dissipating.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-320064-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-320064-4')">4</a></sup> The item was confirmed to hold dual charges. This phenomena only manifested when either of the item's halves were extensively supplied with an opposing charge.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-9043's research team was later notified D-00600 finally recovered from his injuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> D-00600 donned SCP-9043, rubbing them on the carpet. Afterwards, D-00600 rubbed his hands onto the opposing halves of his body.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> A large multitude of electrical sparks were concentrated around D-00600's hands. A series of large electrical arcs were discharged from D-00600 as he pointed both index fingers at the wall. The wall, alongside a portion of the testing chamber violently exploded outwards. D-00600 willingly surrendered to the intervening security team; anomaly was confiscated without issue.</p>

<p>Researchers found that SCP-9043 can sharply amplify an object's electrostatic properties via rubbing the item's opposite halves together. This in turn produces a greater amount of static electricity than what should be feasibly possible, a process that directly violates the First Law of Thermodynamics.</p>
<p>GoI-002's sabotage concurrently compromised the energy infrastructure of various Foundation facilities. Research staff proposed SCP-9043 as a potential solution. Two weeks later, hostile operatives conducted a targeted raid on Site-46, specifically targeting its energy sector.</p>

<p><em>[A nearby operative buttstroked D-00600 when he attempted to speak; attached leg sensors are damaged during his fall. The gyroscope's robotic legs rapidly flail and batter against each other. Massive electrical arcs are created, electrocuting all operatives in the chamber. The operatives and security forces open fired upon each other. The observation chamber's windows shattered. Multiple sections of the carpet are burning. One of the flames makes contact with SCP-9043, setting SCP-9043-A on fire.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Distressed, D-00600 attempted to flee. In response, the gyroscope legs thrashed against the carpet even more. All loose objects in the room — including all individuals present — are rapidly pulled into the chamber's windows by an attractive force, adhering to the gyroscope. All objects are subjected to excessive and fatal amounts of electricity during adherence. D-00600 loses his grip on the ODT but is not pulled into the chamber due to the harness. D-00600 screams.]</em></p>
<p><em>[A blackout occurs three minutes later. The gyroscope becomes non-functional; the attractive force acting upon D-00600 ceases. D-00600 adopts the fetal position, still screaming, albeit much more softly.]</em></p>

<p>GoI-002 orchestrated the incident after acquiring intelligence on SCP-9043 through espionage. The assault specifically targeted the research team's progress regarding a potential alternative power source. Interrogations of captured GoI-002 operatives and interviews with Foundation staff confirm these objectives.</p>
<p>Research indicated SCP-9043 could function as a perpetual energy generator, with experimental yields exceeding projected capacities. Replicability studies were initiated; however, GoI-002's assault caused a partial power surge at Site-46, resulting in the loss of over half of SCP-9043-A's mass. As such, SCP-9043 was submitted for formal reevaluation <em>(See — Addendum.03.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-00600 failed to produce an electrostatic discharge.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> N/A.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B were separated beyond 4 meters.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Separation was successful. Although no electrical arcs were produced, all inanimate objects within the vicinity became electrostatically charged.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Following a 2 hour period, the affected objects returned to normal.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043 was electrically measured.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Repeated measurements show SCP-9043 regularly switches between charges.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-9043's net electric charge is no longer equipotential; SCP-9043-B and SCP-9043-A became highly and lowly charged respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> All previous test items were inserted into SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> No reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> When measured, all the test items were found to be neutrally charged. This occurred regardless of which SCP-9043 set they were inserted into.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043-A was (partially) reconstructed with non-anomalous fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The patched sections adopted the same anomalous properties as SCP-9043-A. SCP-9043-A net electric charge increased. In contrast, SCP-9043-B's net electric charge decreased.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B appeared to have readopted their original charges.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> D-00600 donned SCP-9043, rubbing them on the carpet.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> D-00600 produced a weak electrostatic discharge.</p>

</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> All previous test items were inserted into SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> All test items became semi-operational; test items would shift between a functional and non-functional state at indeterminate intervals when inserted into either set of SCP-9043.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Testing was temporarily placed on hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043 was electrically measured.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-9043's condition regressed; the anomaly was found switching between charges. SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B's net electric charge was disparate, but not as dramatically as prior. When examined, the patched sections of SCP-9043-A were found to be slightly seared.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-9043-A was amended with graphene; the repatched sections adopted the same properties as the anomaly. Both sets readopted their original net electric potential and static charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B were separated beyond 4 meters.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong> All previous test items were inserted into SCP-9043-A and SCP-9043-B.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Test items that were inserted into SCP-9043-B became operational. Test items that were inserted into SCP-9043 were excessively damaged from overvoltage. SCP-9043 again switched between static charges; their net electrical potential is identical. The graphene was not damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Research staff were bewildered by SCP-9043's regression, as D-00600 donned the anomaly to no ill effect. It was then hypothesized that SCP-9043 interacts with living subjects differently now as a result of its current state.</p>
