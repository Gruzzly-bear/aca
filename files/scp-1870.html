            <h1>SCP-1870</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1870</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its location, containment of SCP-1870 requires only minimal on-site supervision to keep anomalous activity confined. On-site personnel are tasked with interviewing and documenting behavior of entities housed within SCP-1870.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Per O5 directive no further personnel are allowed access to SCP-1870. Entrances to the site have been sealed and radio broadcasts from the site have been disabled. Any other communications received from within SCP-1870 are to be immediately deleted with no records kept.</em></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1870 is an underground complex located in ██████████, ██████, superficially built for the containment and transfer of anomalous objects. Records recovered from SCP-1870 indicate a relationship with the Foundation, although the Foundation has no records of any such facility prior to the discovery and containment of SCP-1870 itself. The anomalous properties of SCP-1870 are inherent to the location itself and its inhabitants. Most of the objects contained within SCP-1870 are not anomalous despite extensive on-site records which claim otherwise.</p>
<p>SCP-1870 is populated by six to ten humanoid entities which share the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantly changing facial features, often in drastic manners which do not align with standard bilateral symmetry.</li>
<li>An understanding of Foundation policy and history that, while incorrect, is detailed enough to present a serious security issue.</li>
<li>Detailed knowledge of several contained objects and entities.</li>
<li>An outer epidermis that resembles elaborate but functionless tactical gear. While some portions of this epidermis can be removed, doing so improperly causes great pain or distress to the entity.</li>
<li>An obsession with improvised weaponry such as gardening implements and power tools, most of which are tactically useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the entities often exhibit individual traits, a detailed accounting of their numbers or precise origins have proved impossible to keep. Even under direct observation the number of entities within a closed room will change and some entities have been observed in multiple locations simultaneously. Due to the fluid nature of SCP-1870 entities no permanent designations have been set to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Entities spend their time in training exercises and performing experiments with the non-anomalous objects stored on site.</p>
<p>Examples of the non-anomalous objects stored within SCP-1870 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gallery of poorly stuffed and mounted wildlife. Detailed records are kept on each specimen outlining a mission in which the animals were captured and contained, although the dates on the records do not match the confirmed ages of the specimens.</li>
<li>Seventeen vintage television sets.</li>
<li>Excerpts from an unpublished book on home improvement, author unknown.</li>
<li>A box of fluorescent light bulbs.</li>
<li>Living quarters for "Doctor Steampunk," an inanimate suit of 17th century ceremonial plate armor with brass cogs welded across its surface.</li>
<li>A pinball machine, with erroneous records describing it as a "Roman-era video game console."</li>
<li>A credenza-mounted record player.</li>
<li>Twenty-seven copies of a compilation album titled <em>"Greatest Party Jams 1990"</em> on compact disc.</li>
<li>A box of pamphlets titled <em>"How to Keep Your Facial Features Properly Arranged."</em> Experiment records claim that subjects who read the pamphlet are capable of altering their facial features at will, but only while in possession of a pamphlet. The pamphlets do not possess any anomalous properties at all and appear to be unrelated to the nature of SCP-1870 entities. An example copy is kept in File Room AE2. <em>(Update: Records in File Room AE2 were damaged by an environmental control failure. The example copy was not recovered.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excerpt from Interview 1870-E-4, conducted by E-class Agents D███████ and X███:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agent D███████: Please state your name.</p>
<p>SCP-1870 entity: Agent Redacted.</p>
<p>Agent D███████: Your name is 'redacted'?</p>
<p>SCP-1870 entity: Yes, "Agent Redacted."</p>
<p>Agent X███: Why are you carrying a power drill?</p>
<p>SCP-1870 entity: For luck. I once took out fifty SCP-███ with it.</p>
<p>Agent D███████: Records on SCP-███ are sealed. What can you tell us about them?</p>
<p>SCP-1870 entity: [DATA EXPUNGED] <em>(the answer was confirmed correct by O5. However, there have been no SCP-███ outbreaks within the last fifty years)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The original personnel files for Agent D███████ and Agent X███ have been lost due to clerical error and local database corruption. It is not known when they returned from SCP-1870 or where they were later assigned.</p>
