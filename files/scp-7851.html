<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7851 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber. All individuals must pass memetic screening before coming into contact with SCP-7851 to verify that they are not subject to any desirable mind-affecting anomalies, including amnestics. In the event of accidental contact with an unscreened individual, emergency memetic screening is to be performed. Any desirable mind-affecting anomalies found to have been nullified by SCP-7851 are to be re-administered if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7851 is an adolescent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> male humanoid. SCP-7851’s most notable anomalous characteristic is its seemingly total immunity to cognitohazards, infohazards, memetic hazards, and other mind-affecting anomalies.</p>
<p>In addition, interactions with SCP-7851 sometimes eliminate mind-affecting anomalies in others. For example, conversations with SCP-7851 regarding memories removed by amnestics cause subjects to recover erased memories, and interactions with victims of thaumaturgic compulsions in which SCP-7851 questions compelled behavior will negate said compulsions. Mind-affecting effects suppressed in this way usually remain permanently nullified, even after the interaction is concluded. However, some effects will instead reassert themselves once SCP-7851 is no longer present. What, if anything, determines which effects reassert themselves and which do not is the subject of ongoing debate.</p>
<p>SCP-7851 has limited control over its abilities. It can attempt to mitigate its effects by avoiding direct interaction with a subject or ensuring its interactions are unrelated to anomalies it wishes to preserve, but this is not reliable, and SCP-7851 sometimes accidentally negates desirable mind-affecting effects.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7851 was retrieved from its residence on February 24, 2017 in the aftermath of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-pt-1-the-galaxy-plaza-disaster" target="_blank" target="_blank">an attempted ritual sacrifice in Piton, Missouri</a>, during which renowned children’s author and Fifthist Aster Sterling attempted to sacrifice a crowd that had gathered for an event celebrating a new book release. After SCP-7851 intervened to foil the ritual, it was pursued back to its home by agents present at the event, where it was secured. From there, it was brought to Site-272 for processing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7851-1: Intake Interview Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7851</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Carol Barker</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> In the immediate aftermath of its capture, SCP-7851 was held in a standard humanoid interrogation chamber.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, February 25, 2017, 00:04&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[SCP-7851 is handcuffed to the table in front of it. It is pulling against its restraints. Dr. Barker enters the room along with two armed guards, including Agent Watkins, who was also part of the team that had secured it.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> Stop pulling on your restraints.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 ignores the order.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> I said <em>stop resisting.</em> I’m not going to ask again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Reluctantly complies.] Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> A safe place. Please don’t be frightened. We brought you here so we could help you. However, for us to do that, we need your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Where’s my brother? Did you bring him here too?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> No. You were the only one brought here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Then what did you do with him?</p>
<p>[Dr. Barker glances at Agent Watkins.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> We just gave him something to make him sleep and put him to bed. He’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Takes a long, deep breath.] Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> We brought you here so you could answer some questions. We want to understand what you did at the Galaxy Plaza, and how you did it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Why would I answer your questions after you handcuffed me and threw me into a black van?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Because we can’t let you out of this room until we understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>[Several seconds pass.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Fine. How much do you know about what Sterling was planning?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> He was going to perform a ritual sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I was warned that he was planning to hurt the people at that event, so, after I saw him use a mind-control spell to paralyze them, I broke it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> How did you break it?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I just told them to run.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> That much, we saw. What we don’t understand is why that worked.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I don’t really understand, either. I’ve known for several months that I can break that kind of spell. I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> So, you’ve done this sort of thing before?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Hesitates.] There’s this kid at my school, Callum. Callum Michaels,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-pt-2-spirituality-club" target="_blank" target="_blank">He’s the one who introduced me to magic.</a> At first it was cool. Really cool, and, for a while, that fact gave me a blind spot when it came to what kind of person he was.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> What kind of person was he?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> A whack job, and a control freak, prone to using magic to force people to do what he wanted. People would bow to his every whim until <em>I</em> talked to them about whatever he was making them do, and then they would snap out of it. Once I realized what was going on, I talked to everyone I thought he might be controlling. He didn’t like that, and we fell out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> You said a moment ago that you were warned something would happen in Galaxy Plaza? Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> It was Callum. He was taunting me. He knew Sterling, though I don’t know exactly how. It was dumb of him to tell me. Maybe he expected Sterling to do something more complicated than just using a spell I’d be able to break, or maybe he’s just not that smart. Either way, given how much Callum liked mind-control, I figured an ally of his might use it too, which might mean I could stop him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Did anyone else know about what you were doing?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> No. Just me. Bringing anyone else would’ve put them in danger.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> How much do you know about the limits of your abilities? Have you tried to neutralize any non-thaumaturgic effects?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> …Thaumaturgic?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Effects other than spells.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> There are others?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> I’ll take that as a no.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What else is there?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> A lot. Far too much to go over now. You’ll learn about a lot of it over the course of your work with us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Work with you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Part of our organization’s mission is to understand unusual phenomena. Given what you appear to be capable of, you count as an unusual phenomenon. We’d like to run some experiments to figure out how you work. Is that alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Who are you guys? Are you government?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> No. We’re an independent organization dedicated to researching anomalous phenomena and protecting the general public from them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Why didn’t you just say that? Why the SWAT team and the black van?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> The precautions we have to take with new anomalies can seem harsh. Right now, we don’t know what you’re capable of. You might be dangerous in ways we wouldn’t expect, ways even you might be unaware of. To determine if that’s the case, we’ll need to run those tests. Will you cooperate?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> And you really needed four guys in tactical gear to drag me here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> As I said, it was a necessary precaution. For all we knew, you were as powerful and dangerous as Aster Sterling.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Sighs] Fine. It might answer some questions I’ve been curious about, too. For the record, though, you <em>could</em> have just asked me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> I’m happy to hear that you’re willing to cooperate. Would you be alright to start testing tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Wonderful. I’ll have you escorted to your chamber so you can get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> My what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Unfortunately, we’re going to have to hold you at this facility for a while.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What? You can’t just do that!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> You’re a new anomaly. We don’t know how you work, or how you might affect the people around you. Until that changes, we have to assume you might be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How could I be dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> By definition, anomalies are unpredictable. You wouldn’t be the first, or second, or hundredth anomaly to be more dangerous than it appears, and failure to prepare for that possibility could get a lot of people hurt.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How long will I have to stay here for?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Until we understand your abilities. If you want to get home quickly, your best option is to cooperate with us.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Can I at least call my parents? Let them hear from me that I’ll be away for a while?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Please? They knew I was headed to Galaxy Plaza. If they’ve heard anything about what happened there, they’re probably worried sick about me. They might even think I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Let us handle them for now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> But—</p>
<p>[Agent Watkins approaches SCP-7851.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> Save your breath, kid. It’s late.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 looks up at Watkins but does not respond.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> Listen, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to uncuff you from this table. You’re going to follow me back to your containment chamber, and then you’re going to go to bed. You are <em>not</em> going to try anything, understand? You’re not going to like what happens if you do.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 doesn’t respond.]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> Understand?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Hesitantly] I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Watkins:</strong> Good.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851’s restraints are unhooked from the table. SCP-7851 does not resist as security personnel escorted it from the room.]</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>This is an extremely promising anomaly. If it can do what it says it can do, it could be one of the most useful humanoids we’ve ever encountered. I’d like to speak with it as soon as possible to attempt to recruit it into Alpha-9.</p>
<p>- Dr. Sophia Light</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I don’t think that’s a good idea right now. I don’t disagree that SCP-7851 has the potential to be extremely useful, but it could also be extremely dangerous. It reminds me of <a href="scp-4855.html">SCP-4855</a>, whose resistance to cognitohazards makes it a symptomless infection vector for dangerous memetic hazards. 7851’s immunity to memes might mean it poses the same danger. Worse, its ability to suppress the effects of cognitohazards on others might allow it to turn others into symptomless carriers as well. We should be extremely cautious.</p>
<p>- Dr. Carol Barker</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Agreeing with Dr. Barker. Recruitment of SCP-7851 into Alpha-9 is denied for now. This question will be revisited once we understand the anomaly better.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-3: Testing Log 1:</strong> In order to better discern the potential scope of SCP-7851’s abilities, SCP-7851 was exposed to a number of mind-affecting anomalies, as well as subjects who had been affected by such anomalies. A small selection of test results is presented below.</p>
<table class="wiki-content-table">
<tr>
<th>Object</th>
<th>Testing Procedure</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thaumaturgic Compulsion</td>
<td>SCP-7851 was instructed not to move, then subjected to a thaumaturgic compulsion which would have compelled it to stand up.</td>
<td>SCP-7851 remained seated.</td>

<tr>
<td>Thaumaturgic Compulsion</td>
<td>SCP-7851 was made to instruct D-34369 not to move. D-34369 was then subjected to the same thaumaturgic compulsion.</td>
<td>D-34369 remained seated.</td>

<td>Class-A Amnestic</td>
<td>Amnestic dose was surreptitiously administered to SCP-7851 in its morning meal.</td>
<td>The amnestic had no effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Class-A Amnestic</td>
<td>After being exposed to and asked to memorize several images, D-34369 was treated with Class-A amnestics. Later, SCP-7851 was instructed to interrogate D-34369 regarding the contents of these images.</td>
<td>Despite being unable to recall the contents of the images when questioned by Dr. Barker immediately after amnestics were administered, D-34369 was able to recall them normally when asked the same questions by SCP-7851.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="scp-426.html">SCP-426</a></td>
<td>SCP-7851 was instructed to request that Dr. Barker, who was administering the test, describe the same photograph.</td>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Researcher’s Note,</p>
<p>These results are consistent with SCP-7851’s own claims regarding its capabilities. So far, it seems both resistant to cognitohazards and capable of nullifying their effects on others.</p>
<p>However, the remoteness of Site-242 has limited the variety of anomalies we can cross-test it with. For us to truly learn its limits, and potential dangers, SCP-7851 needs to be transferred to a site where it can be exposed to a wider variety of objects.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7851</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Carol Barker</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> SCP-7851 is in its containment chamber, having recently awoken.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, March 9, 2017, 8:07&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[Dr. Barker enters the room. SCP-7851 stands.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Good morning, SCP-7851.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Yawns] Are we testing early today? You usually give me breakfast first.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> There aren’t going to be any tests today—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Oh, thank God. Am I finally done?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> No. There’s still a lot about your abilities we don’t understand, but we’ve run out of experiments we can do from this site. We’re going to transfer you to another one. There, you’ll be able to interact with a much wider variety of anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> …Where exactly are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> I can’t answer that for security reasons.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How far away is it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> That’s still information about its location. The most I can tell you is that the drive will take several hours.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Hours?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Yes. We will arrange for you to be provided suitable entertainment while you’re transported.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> You guys said you were going to let me go home after I finished your tests. Now you’re taking me to another site? How much longer am I going to be with you people?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> We still don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How long does it usually take? Because if you were going to let me go soon, you wouldn’t be moving me <em>further away</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> You’re right. It won’t be as soon as you’d hope. I’m sorry, but, as I’ve said, we have to assume you’re dangerous until we understand how you work.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Can I please visit my family before you move me? Just once? My little brother has to be dying to see me. The last thing he saw was you people dragging me away. Can I please tell him I’m alright?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Your family members have already been told everything they need to know about your current status.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Jerry’s not the kind of kid who would trust you guys. He’s going to be worried until he hears <em>from me</em> that I’m alright. Can I please at least call them?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> I’m afraid we can’t allow that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Please? There has to be something—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> No. There doesn’t. I understand that that’s frustrating, but it’s how things have to be. Will you cooperate with the transfer, or are we going to have to employ force?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Force?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> We’d much rather have your cooperation, but, ultimately, this site transfer isn’t optional. Are you going to cooperate?</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 doesn’t respond.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> 7851?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Stop calling me that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barker:</strong> Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What else would I do? Fight your guards? You people can do whatever you want to me. I have no way of stopping you.</p>

<p>Researcher’s Note,</p>
<p>The results of SCP-7851’s cross-test with SCP-3808 are quite reassuring. If SCP-7851 interacts with other anomalies in the same way it did with 3808, our ‘symptomless carrier’ concern will not be an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-6: Incident Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> On March 12, 2017, SCP-7851 was cross-tested with SCP-1168, a statue which causes individuals meeting certain profiles to experience a complex sequence of reality-altering phenomena, and compels them to respond with specific, ritualistic behaviors. Because SCP-7851 fit one of these profiles at the time, it was exposed to SCP-1168 along with D-87185, who fit the other profile. The purpose of this test was to observe how SCP-7851 would respond to a complex effect of which compelled behaviors were only one part.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, March 12, 2017, 13:19&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[While SCP-1168 was in its inactive state, SCP-7851 and D-87185 were led into SCP-1168’s chamber. Dr. Maddison observed the experiment from outside the chamber, while four security personnel were present inside. SCP-7851 holds a tightly wound ball of yarn, necessary to activate SCP-1168.]</p>
<p><strong>D-87185:</strong> What the fuck is that thing?</p>
<p>[Several seconds pass.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Doctor, I think that question was for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> It’s an anomaly. We want to see how you interact with it. Go ahead and place the yarn in the statue’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Okay. Sure.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 approaches the statue and places the yarn in its right hand. As expected, the yarn immediately disappears. The statue then animates and proceeds to point at D-87185 for five seconds.]</p>
<p><strong>D-87185:</strong> What is it with this place and moving statu—</p>
<p>[The activation event begins, with D-87185 playing the role of SCP-1168-1. As usual, this causes D-87185 to be immediately encased in a 3m<sup>3</sup> block of ice.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Becomes distressed and backs several paces away from the block of ice.] What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> Please remain calm. This object isn’t dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> He’s frozen solid! Can he even breathe in there?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> He won’t suffocate. That’s one of the anomaly’s effects. He’ll be fine after the ice melts.</p>
<p>[SCP-1168 animates once again, this time pointing at SCP-7851 for ten seconds.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Oh God, why’s it pointing at me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> Please remain calm. The activation event will be over in less than a minute, and everyone will be fine. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Please let me out of here. I want to get away from that thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> There’s—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I withdraw my consent to perform this test. You people said I could do that. Please turn this thing off before it freezes me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> There’s no way to turn it off at this stage.</p>
<p>[SCP-1168 briefly returns to its pending pose. After a short delay, its activation event begins with SCP-7851 now serving as SCP-1168-2. However, SCP-7851 does not exhibit any of the ritualistic behaviors typical of SCP-1168-2 instances. Instead, SCP-7851 runs toward the containment chamber entrance.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> 7851, do not attempt to exit the chamber.</p>
<p>[Panicked, SCP-7851 ignores Maddison’s instructions. In response, two security personnel grab SCP-7851 and restrain it. SCP-7851 resists, but personnel successfully hold it in place.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> SCP-7851, stop resisting. The activation event will be over in less than a minute. Everything is going to be alright.</p>
<p>[In accordance with SCP-1168’s usual effects, accessories appear on D-87185’s person even as he remains inside the block of ice. A moment later, a thin layer of frost appears on SCP-7851’s skin.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Oh God! No! Please don’t let it—</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 is teleported inside the existing block of ice. As normal, this does not prevent SCP-7851 from vocalizing, and its vocalizations appear to originate from the position it occupied at the start of the activation event. However, instead of uttering the expected ritualistic phrase, SCP-7851 simply screams. After remaining encased in the ice for four seconds, SCP-7851 appears back at the position it occupied at the beginning of the activation event. SCP-7851 looks around, confused and distressed.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Please, get me out of here. I want away from that thing!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> There’s nothing to be afraid of. The activation event has concluded. The anomaly won’t do anything else.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> That guy’s still frozen! I couldn’t breathe in there. He probably can’t either.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> As I said, the anomaly prevents him from suffocating. The ice will melt, and once it does, D-87185 will be fine. The creator of this anomaly specifically designed it not to cause any long-term harm.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Someone <em>made</em> this thing? What kind of sick fuck—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> I’m sorry that this test has been distressing for you. I promise, that wasn’t our intention. Would you like to take a break before we move on to the next test?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Considers for a moment.] No. Screw that. No more tests. I do not consent to any further testing.</p>
<p>[A moment passes.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> You want to stop testing for today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I want to stop testing, period. No more.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Maddison:</strong> That’s unfortunate. I hope you’ll eventually reconsider. For the time being, though, you can take a break. Security, escort SCP-7851 back to its containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> SCP-7851 was returned to its containment chamber without issue. However, in the days following this incident, SCP-7851 continued to deny consent for any further testing. Because of its non-compliance, SCP-7851 was placed in mandatory counseling with a Site-19 Psychologist.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 7851-7: On-Site Therapy Log:</strong> The following is a partial transcription of one of SCP-7851’s mandatory on-site therapy sessions.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7851</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Laura Cunningham, Site-19 Therapist</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, March 15, 2017, 15:21&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> Let’s turn back to why you’re no longer willing to cooperate with testing.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Is that your entire job here? To get me to start being your guinea pig again?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I’m here to help you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> You people clearly don’t care how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I promise, I do. You seemed to be fine with testing until your encounter with SCP-1148. Do you mind helping me understand what changed?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Is it really that hard to understand? That thing froze someone in a giant block of ice. I thought it was about to do the same thing to me. For a second, it <em>did</em>, not long after you said it wouldn’t. It was cold in there. So cold that it hurt. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know it was going to let me back out. For a second, I thought I was going to die in there. I’m not going through that again. I don’t need to see any more of the weird stuff you people have. You keep saying the point of these tests is to probe my limits. What happens when you find them? What if you stick me in the room with some screwed-up anomaly and my powers just… don’t protect me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> That’s an understandable concern. Though I can’t deny that testing is sometimes dangerous, I can promise that the Foundation is not looking for a way to kill you. While we clearly failed in this instance to anticipate how upsetting 1168 would be, please understand that we have been doing our best to test you only with anomalies that won’t do you any lasting harm even if you did not resist them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I’ll talk to your researchers about whether it might be possible to brief you more thoroughly on the anomalies you’re tested on. I don’t think SCP-1168’s effects would have been so distressing if you had been prepared for them.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 does not respond for several seconds.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Is this the rest of my life?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> When you people first grabbed me, you told me you would eventually let me go if I went along with your testing. That was a lie. The other anomalies say you keep people forever. Some of them have been here for decades. So, is this the rest of my life? Am I going to be imprisoned here forever, never again allowed to see anyone I care about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> One day, you probably will care about some of the people here.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Yeah, sure. I bet I’m going to develop a deep and abiding lifelong friendship with the fish-head guy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Because I don’t care about the fish-head guy. I want to see my parents. I want to see my friends. I want to see my brother. He looks up to me like crazy, and he counts on me to protect him from bullies. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-didn-t-forget-hub" target="_blank" target="_blank">Not having me around must be ruining him.</a></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I don’t doubt it’s hard for him, but loss is a part of life. Something everyone has to deal with. He will find a way to move on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> He’s twelve!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> He won’t be forever, just like you won’t be a new arrival forever. He’ll find his way without you, and you’ll learn to see a home for yourself here. Just give it time.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How much does he even know about what happened? I’ve never been able to get a straight answer from you people about where my family thinks I am. Do they even know I’m still alive?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> That’s not something they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Do you know what they usually tell the families of people they take?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> There’s no single answer to that question. Cover-up decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Do they think I’m dead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I can’t deny that that’s a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What else could it be? The last thing my family knew, I was at Galaxy Plaza when Sterling attacked. The simplest thing for the Foundation to do would be to tell them I died in the disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I can’t deny that that’s a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Quietly] Jerry thinks I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> If he does, maybe that’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How could that be for the best?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> Your loved ones might be better off with that closure than they would be with a mystery. False hope wouldn’t make things any better for them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> It’s only false because you people insist on keeping me here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> Perhaps, but that’s still better than them believing they might be able to find you. As I said, loss is a part of life. I’m sure it’s difficult for them, but they will move on.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> You haven’t met Jerry. You haven’t seen how much he looks up to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> And he hasn’t stopped looking up to you. Your presence in his life isn’t gone simply because you’re apart. Just as with any other loss, he still has memories of you. The example you set for him will shape him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Wipes its eyes] I’m going to miss his birthday soon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> I’m sure that’s difficult. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> We had a tradition. Late at night, after our parents went to bed, we’d always watch a movie together. One that our parents wouldn’t have let him watch, usually because it was PG-13. I’d secretly watch it ahead of time to make sure there was nothing in it that would actually hurt him. If there wasn’t, we’d hide in my room, and I’d pretend we were both watching it for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> That’s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> He’s finally going to turn thirteen in a few weeks, so we were planning to move on to R-rated movies. He wanted to do a horror movie, but we hadn’t picked one yet. Now, we never will. Now, I’ll never watch anything with him again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> Unfortunately, we’re coming up on time, but I think it would be a good idea to explore your grief in future sessions. Feelings like these are a perfectly normal response to bereavement—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Abruptly stands and begins shouting.] He’s not dead!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Cunningham:</strong> [Visibly flinching at the volume of SCP-7851’s voice.] Please remain seated, and please don’t shout.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I’m never testing for you people again, understand me? I’m never helping you people with anything, ever, no matter what. Not until I see my brother again.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-8: Acquisition Request Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>In light of additional testing, I would like to restate my request for a meeting with SCP-7851. My previous request was denied based on fears that 7851 could serve as an asymptomatic carrier for memetic hazards similar to <a href="scp-4855.html">SCP-4855</a>. Since then, cross-testing with <a href="scp-3808.html">SCP-3808</a>, among other anomalies, has shown that SCP-7851 does not transmit infohazards to others, even if it conveys information that would normally be infohazardous. On the contrary, it seems to shield others from cognitohazards while they interact with it. While this does not completely rule out the possibility that its powers could be used in a dangerous way, I believe it demonstrates that 7851 is safe enough to be recruited.</p>
<p>- Dr. Sophia Light</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I agree with your assessment regarding the “asymptomatic carrier” issue. However, SCP-7851’s recent non-cooperativeness with researchers raises a new concern. SCP-7851 no longer satisfies the compliance and loyalty criteria necessary for Alpha-9 recruitment. Further, given its repeatedly stated unwillingness to help the Foundation, it seems unlikely that you could persuade it to join regardless.</p>
<p>- O5-7</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I recognize the compliance and loyalty issue. However, with the understanding that 7851 can’t be a proper member of Alpha-9 until its behavior shifts, I request that I be allowed to speak with it regardless. I have a strategy in mind for regaining its compliance.</p>

<p>[SCP-7851 is seated on the bed in its containment chamber, having recently returned from the mess hall. Despite several enrichment objects, including several books and a television, being present in its room, it simply sits quietly.]</p>
<p>[Dr. Light enters, accompanied by a pair of security personnel. SCP-7851 reflexively scoots away, clearly unsettled by the presence of armed guards, but, after a moment, regains its composure.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Just to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I already told you people; I’m not doing more tests. I’m not doing <em>anything</em> for you, ever.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> So I’ve heard. [Dr. Light takes a seat in a chair near the chamber’s entryway.] I’m Dr. Sophia Light. [Dr. Light offers handshake. SCP-7851 does not accept.] I’m here to present you with an opportunity that will, hopefully, make you feel better about your place here at the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> The only thing I want from you people is for you to let me go.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> That’s understandable. Still, you don’t have anything to lose by hearing me out. If you’re not interested in my offer after I’ve explained it to you, you’ll never have to hear from me again.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I don’t have an actual choice, do I?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> You do. There’s no point in my presenting an offer if you’ve already decided you don’t even want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Sighs.] Fine. Get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I know you’ve not had a good experience with us so far. I won’t deny that the Foundation can be brutal at times. We have to assume the worst about every anomaly we contain, because we’ve learned the hard way that if we underestimate them, the consequences can be catastro—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I’ve heard all of your excuses already. I’m not interested in hearing them again. Do you have anything <em>new</em> to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> [Briefly considers.] How about this: I’m impressed with what you did in the Galaxy Plaza.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851’s gaze lingers on Dr. Light for a moment, but it does not respond.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Stopping attacks like that is supposed to be our job, but we dropped the ball. Our initial attempt to foil Sterling’s plans by covertly assassinating him failed. Before you intervened, we were poised to send a squad in, but against a thaumaturge of his caliber, they might not have managed to stop him, and we definitely would’ve lost people in the attempt. Then, you came out of nowhere and did most of our job for us, saving dozens of lives in the process. I’m guessing no one at the Foundation has thanked you for that, so let me be the first. Thank you, both for saving the people we were supposed to protect, and for making it so no Foundation agent had to give their life in the process.</p>
<p>[Dr. Light pauses to allow SCP-7851 to respond. It does not.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I believe that is only the beginning of the good you could do. Of the lives you could save.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> That’s what I was doing before you people took me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> And I think it’s past time you started doing it again. In testing, you’ve reversed, and even prevented, the effects of numerous mind-affecting hazards. We’ve done our best to keep you away from the nasty ones, but I think you still have some idea of how bad some of them are. There are anomalies that totally enslave a person’s mind, that make people prisoners inside their own bodies, torture them with hallucinations or intrusive thoughts, or force them to harm themselves or the people they love. There are thousands of people in Foundation containment purely because they’ve been affected by an anomaly that makes them dangerous to themselves or others. A lot of those people would be better off dead. All of them would be better off cured, but the sad fact is there’s nothing we can do for them. At least, there was nothing, before we met you. I think you might be able to cure a lot of those people, to save them, to set them free. I want to give you the opportunity to try.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> If you’ve had those people in containment the whole time I’ve been here, why am I first hearing about them now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Because the Foundation is secretive, sometimes to a fault. We weren’t initially sure you could do what I’m asking, but, at this point, we have every reason to believe you can.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Considers for several seconds.] What you’re saying is too good to be true. What’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> There’s no catch, other than what you already know.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> That I’d be doing it under your banner?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I’ve already said that I won’t do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Even if we’re asking you to save people? Whatever crimes the Foundation has committed against you, surely those innocent civilians don’t deserve to suffer and die for them. I don’t believe you’re the kind of person who would allow them to. If you were, you wouldn’t have risked your life to save the people at Galaxy Plaza.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> And how do I know any of this is true? It wouldn’t be the first time you people lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Given what you know about our organization and the threats we fight against, would it make any sense for what I’m saying <em>not</em> to be true? Surely you can see that we’d inevitably encounter people with the sorts of supernatural mental afflictions. What would we do with them if not put them in containment?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Okay. Sure. You probably do have some mind-control victims locked away somewhere, but this could still be some kind of trick, even if it’s just a ploy to get me used to obeying you again. You people are sly like that. I can’t trust you, ever.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Would you like some time to think through everything? I’ve given you a lot to process. It’s only fair that I also give you time to process it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Sure, but I doubt my answer is going to change.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> After everything you’ve been through, I can only thank you for considering my offer at all. With that, I’ll get out of your hair. [Stands]. I hope to see you again soon, SCP-7851. [Dr. Light turns to exit the chamber.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> My name is Evan.</p>
<p>[Dr. Light exits the chamber without responding.]</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-10: Incident Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> On March 30, 2017, a civilian named Trevor Andrews was recovered by the Foundation after an imbedded agent flagged a 911 call from Andrews’ roommate as potentially anomalous. When agents arrived at the scene, they determined that he had been affected by a powerful thaumaturgic compulsion. Prior to the discovery of SCP-7851, there was no cost-effective treatment for this compulsion, and victims were euthanized. At the request of Dr. Sophia Light, Andrews’ euthanasia was stayed to give her an opportunity to persuade SCP-7851 to assist him.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, March 30, 2017, 18:27&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[Dr. Light enters SCP-7851’s containment chamber. SCP-7851 lays in bed, staring upward.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> SCP-7851?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Something urgent has come up. We’ve recovered a civilian affected by a lethal thaumaturgic compulsion. He will almost certainly die without your immediate assistance.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Sits upright.] Lethal?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> It’s a spell we’ve encountered before. It compels the victim to injure themselves as much as they can. The victim was severely injured by the time we got to him. We’ve done our best to restrain him, but that only buys us time. His compulsion won’t go away unless you remove it, and he will eventually find a way to inflict lethal damage.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> You’re sure it will kill him?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Completely. I know I said I’d give you time, but this man doesn’t have much left. You’re going to need to decide quickly. Are you willing to help?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I guess I have no choice. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Come with me.</p>
<p>[Accompanied by four security personnel, Dr. Light leads SCP-7851 out of its chamber and to the padded room containing Andrews. Andrews has been restrained in a strait jacket and made to wear an oral restraint designed to protect his tongue. Because of this oral restraint, Andrews is unable to speak. Andrews’ legs were also restrained when he was detained, but he has escaped these restraints by the time SCP-7851 and Dr. Light arrive. As they enter, Andrews violently thrashes against his restraints. He retains several self-inflicted injuries from before he was secured, including a broken arm, several missing teeth, and a large head wound.]</p>
<p>[SCP-7851, Dr. Light, and two security personnel enter the chamber.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Upon seeing Andrews] Holy shit.</p>
<p>[Upon seeing that the door has opened, Andrews rises to his feet and charges at security personnel, who raise their weapons in response and prepare to fire.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Stop running!</p>
<p>[Andrews ceases moving. Guards keep their weapons raised.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Can you nod if you can understand me?</p>
<p>[After a moment of hesitation, Andrews nods.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Okay, good. You’ve stopped moving. Do you feel any better? I know something’s been controlling you. Was it trying to make you provoke these guards just now?</p>
<p>[Again, Andrews nods.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Well, you’re standing still now. Do you think you could avoid hurting anyone, including yourself, if you were free to move?</p>
<p>[Andrews attempts to speak but is incomprehensible.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Right. Sorry. Hopefully we can get that thing off of you soon. Just… just try to keep my voice in your head, alright? You don’t have to do <em>anything</em> you don’t want to do, okay?</p>
<p>[Andrews attempts to speak again.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [To Dr. Light] I don’t know how to tell if it worked.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> [To guard.] Is there any part of his restraints you can release without endangering us?</p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> Nothing completely safe. We could take out the oral restraint, but if this kid’s mojo didn’t work, he’ll go back to trying to bite off his own tongue, unless he starts trying to bite us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I think we have to risk it. We have no other way of determining whether it worked.</p>
<p><strong>Guard:</strong> Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p>[The guard approaches Andrews and removes his oral restraint. Andrews begins speaking as soon as the restraint is removed.]</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> Where am I? Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Well, he’s not trying to bite his tongue off.</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> Could you please answer me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> You’re somewhere safe. Hopefully we’ll be able to get you home soon.</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> What was happening to me? Why did I do all of that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I don’t know, exactly, but it’s over now. Everything’s going to be okay. Do you think you could continue not to harm anyone if the rest of your restraints were removed?</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> I think so. The… the urge, it was strong. I think I would still feel it if it was still there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Alright. Keep cooperating with the people here. Hopefully you’ll be able to go home soon.</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> My arm…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Once your restraints are off, we’ll take you straight to medical.</p>
<p><strong>Andrews:</strong> [After a moment of hesitation.] Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> We should clear the room.</p>
<p>[Dr. Light and SCP-7851 both exit to the hall outside. SCP-7851 takes a long, deep breath.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> That went as well as we could’ve hoped. Good job.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Thanks, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Would you be willing to help us with more anomalies like this? Like I said, we have a lot of people who could use your help.</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 does not reply.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> It’s okay if you need more time to decide.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [After a moment, shakes his head.] No, it’s not. If there are thousands of people as badly off as that guy… I don’t have the right to make them wait.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> The compulsion’s effect on Andrews did not reassert itself after this incident. After his remaining injuries were treated, Andrews was amnesticized and released. After this incident, SCP-7851 consented to the resumption of testing under Dr. Light’s supervision.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-12: Acquisition Request Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>SCP-7851’s behavioral problems seem to have subsided. In light of this fact, I would like to once again raise the prospect of recruiting it into Alpha-9. Though Ethics Committee regulations prohibit us from deploying SCP-7851 into combat due to its age, I believe it’s in our best interest to begin the recruitment process now. For one thing, it will give us a head start on training. I believe we should endeavor to be ready to field SCP-7851 as soon as possible. If we’re unlucky, and we usually are, we may find ourselves in desperate need of its abilities far sooner than we’d hope.</p>
<p>I also believe status as an MTF member will encourage SCP-7851 to identify with the Foundation and its cause. Every humanoid I’ve ever met has preferred viewing itself as an agent over viewing itself as a prisoner. Self-identification with the Foundation will help foster the loyalty we need for SCP-7851 to best serve us.</p>
<p>- Dr. Sophia Light</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Request granted. Membership in MTF Alpha-9 will be provisional until 7851 is no longer a minor, but I strongly agree that training should begin ASAP.</p>
<p>- O5-7</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 7851-13: Interview Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7851</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Sophia Light, Project <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/resurrection" target="_blank" target="_blank">Resurrection</a> Director.</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> After being informed of Dr. Light’s request to speak with it again, SCP-7851 agreed to meet the following day.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, April 23, 2017, 15:59&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[SCP-7851 is seated in a meeting chamber. It is unrestrained, though two security personnel are present.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> [Enters the room.] Hello, SCP-7851.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Hesitates for a moment before speaking.] Hey. They told me you wanted to talk to me again?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I did.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I want to propose something to you, something that I think will ultimately allow you to do even more good than you are right now.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Okay, I guess I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Have you heard the term “Mobile Task Force” while you’ve been here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I think so? That’s your guards, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Some of them. Mobile Task Forces are groups of agents specialized in dealing with a certain type of situation. We deploy them wherever their expertise is needed. There are hundreds of Mobile Task Forces. Most of them specialize in a specific type of anomaly or environment, but one of them, my pet project, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/resurrection" target="_blank" target="_blank">is made up of anomalies like you</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Like me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Who have useful powers, or something else to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> How’s that different from what I’m already doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Right now, we’re just bringing people to you and having you dispel anomalies affecting them. That, alone, is very helpful, and you will likely continue to do that kind of thing for as long as you’re with us. However, there are other potential uses for your power. If we could deploy you into the field, send you to the anomalies instead of always having to bring them to you, you could be one of our greatest assets. You could wade through deadly cognitohazards and empower other agents to do the same. You could enable the capture and containment of powerful mind-controlling anomalies, including some of the nastiest thaumaturges in the world. With you around to counter their abilities, capturing that sort of person would be far, far easier. I am not exaggerating when I say that having you as a full-on MTF agent might save the world one day.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> The world?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> The Foundation sometimes deals with threats on that scale. There could one day be a memetic contagion virulent and deadly enough to destroy civilization as we know it. If there is, you might be the only one who can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Did you have this in mind from the moment you first spoke to me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> You joining Alpha-9 is a hope I’ve had since we found you. I’m sorry for not mentioning it right away. It wasn’t my intent to mislead you. I was just afraid you might be overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Sighs] I get it. Before you spoke with me, I spent every day sulking in my cell. Now, I’ve freed dozens of people from mind control. Part of me hates to admit it, but you probably had the right to be a bit manipulative in order to accomplish that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Thank you for understanding. I take it you’re leaning toward accepting my offer?</p>
<p>[SCP-7851 starts to speak but then goes silent.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> It’s okay for you to take some time to consider it. This is a lifelong commitment. You don’t have to rush into it.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> A huge part of me wants to say yes, but… I keep thinking about my family. You lied to me about being able to see them when I finished your tests. It seems like you, personally, have been relatively honest with me so far, but that could be a trick. How do I know this new offer is what it seems to be?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> There’s no quick answer to that question. Given your age, you’ll likely spend years in training before you’re deployed. Hopefully, over the course of that time, I, and the Foundation, will be able to earn back your trust.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Maybe.</p>
<p>[Several seconds pass.]</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Do you know what my favorite thing about Alpha-9 is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> The psychological effect it has on its members.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I’m surprised you care about that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> I do. The Foundation does too, in its own way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> They don’t act like it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> The Foundation recognizes the necessity of tending to a humanoid anomaly’s psychological needs. Perhaps the greatest human need is the need for purpose. When Alpha-9 was still a proposal, many in the Foundation worried its members would use their new privileges to escape containment, but, so far, none of them have even tried.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Really? None?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Not one. Mind you, we don’t recruit an anomaly unless we’re under the impression they’re loyal, but I don’t think that’s the only reason. I think Alpha-9’s members stay with the Foundation for the same reason the rest of us do. They believe in the work they’re doing. They believe in protecting people from the things that go bump in the night, and they’re willing to dedicate their lives, and their unique properties, to doing that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> The question is, are you ready to believe the same?</p>
<p>[Several seconds pass.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> I don’t want to trust you, but… the people I could save, their suffering won’t wait for me to make up my mind. They need my help right now. I don’t have the right to make them wait. I’ll join your team.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Thank you. [Extends hand for handshake.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> [Shakes Dr. Light’s hand.] One last thing. About my family, will this mean I can see them again? I mean, if you’re going to send me on missions, that means you’ll let me leave the site, yeah? If it’s okay for me to leave containment, would it maybe be okay if I went back home, just for a visit?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Unfortunately, no. As a member of Alpha-9, you’ll see far more of the outside world than you ever would otherwise, but your existence will still be a well-guarded secret. If you interact with anyone who knew you before you came here, they’ll have to be amnesticized afterward.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Does that change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7851:</strong> …No. It doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Light:</strong> Good. Welcome aboard. I look forward to the work we’ll do together.</p>

Entities whose only unusual property is the tendency to negate other anomalies are not always classified as SCPs. However, SCP-7851’s ability to negate amnestics and other widespread, desirable mind-affecting effects makes its nature inherently threatening to normalcy, necessitating its containment.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-3"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')">3</a>. This individual, another Fifthist with moderate thaumaturgic abilities, has since been secured and classified as SCP-████.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-4"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')">4</a>. SCP-7851 has since admitted this statement was false. In reality, it brought three acquaintances to the event. These individuals had already been amnesticized along with the other survivors at Galaxy Plaza and were later treated with additional amnestics to remove all knowledge of Fifthism and thaumaturgy.</div>
<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-5"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')">5</a>. In accordance with protocol 1-2-04-Graham, Foundation personnel charged with the initial containment of humanoid anomalies are permitted to use the prospect of future release or family visitation to secure early cooperation.</div>
