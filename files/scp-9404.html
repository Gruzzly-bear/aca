<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Site-898 Cryptozoology Sector is to continue their pursuit in information pertaining to SCP-9404, as well their attempts at capturing a living instance for proper analysis and study.</p>
<p>The discovery or reports of disemboweled corpses within the Northern Appalachian mountains are to be attributed to bears, cougars, and coyotes if local news reports do not assume this automatically. SCP-9404's own properties are otherwise considered self-concealing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9404 is the designation given to a species of anomalous predatory animals from North American folklore, simply referred to as "hidebehinds," that are believed to exist throughout the forests of the Appalachia region. Utilizing both folktales relating to these entities, and sparse eyewitness accounts from various newspapers, the following has been gathered:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-9404 instances are exceedingly difficult to observe directly;</li>
<li>SCP-9404 instances are keenly aware of attempts at observation, and will hide behind the nearest object<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> to avoid detection. The mechanics in which it achieves this are presently unknown;</li>
<li>SCP-9404 instances utilize this property in hunting — stalking prey within the woods for extended periods of time, while remaining completely unseen — before striking.</li>
<li>The appearance of these animals is unknown, though they are reported as making "hissing" or "clacking" sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, SCP-9404 instances are rumored to predate primarily on people who wander the woods alone.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Containment Efforts:</strong> The following details the efforts by Site-898's Cryptozoology Sector to discover and capture an instance of SCP-9404 for the purpose of further research. World's End State Park, due to its proximity to Site-898, was chosen for investigation.</p>

<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Officer Micah Eardwulf<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> On 12/05/1975, Drs. Hargroves and Rune departed Site-898 to meet with Officer Eardwulf, a local game warden of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, in an attempt to garner information relating to SCP-9404.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Hargroves and Dr. Rune are walking along a forest trail at dusk. Dr. Rune is holding the camcorder as the two of them walk towards a small, dirt lot. A patrol vehicle is sitting parked there with a large, bearded man sat atop its hood. He turns his head as the two of them approach.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Aha! You the lot that wanted to talk?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Yes sir-ree. Thanks for agreein’ to speak with us.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune makes a flagrant hand gesture sideways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> I know it’s all a bit strange, but I reckon you’re someone who sees the strange all the time, out here. Off the record, of course.</p>
<p><em>Eardwulf gives a hearty laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> What ain't strange out here, ey? I've seen plenty, in these woods. Guess it comes with the territory a' the name.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> It's hardly a subtle one. I almost thought my friend here was playing a prank on me until I saw the State Park's welcome sign.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Told ya. It’s fun, if a little ominous. Anyhow, we were wonderin’ if you’ve gotten any reports of people feeling watched out there? We think something’s hiding ‘round the trees in the area, but good info is scarce. Sightings even scarcer.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Ah, people say that all the time. I hear it from my buds, too. Some folk are just running into mountain lions, but hunters round these parts do talk a' more fantastical things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Have you ever heard of a "hidebehind," sir?</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Indeed I have.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Curious bit of folklore, but every story’s usually got a bit of truth to it. Have you ever met one? You look like you’ve got some interesting stories.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> You don't exactly <em>meet</em> 'em. Most people don't know it, if they do. It's in the name. They'll stalk folks from outta sight, hissin' and gigglin' all the while. I haven't gotten the honor to meet one of them hunter of hunters myself, though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Hunter of hunters?</p>
<p><em>Eardwulf shifts a bit, sliding off his car's hood to walk closer to the pair of doctors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Aye. Huntsmen are the folk who are out in these woods the most. Them and lumberjacks. It's said a hidebehind will feast when men walk the woods alone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Checks out. No one would be there to watch their back.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune pauses and leans against a tree.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Well, you got any favorites? Stories, I mean. Any specifics will help, really. We got time, and I like a good yarn.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> <em>[He chuckles]</em> A few. They make for good campfire talk.</p>
<p><em>The game warden folds his arms over his chest, and taps a finger in consideration as he thinks. Dr. Hargroves chooses a rock to sit on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> There's this one 'bout a lumberjack. A young fellow, who had a bit too much to drink with his buddies out in the trees. Went for a walk, probably to find a place to piss. <em>[He barks a laugh]</em> Got more than he bargained for, with it!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> He was being followed, of course. Not by his buds, but by one of those beasts. He heard the footsteps, called out "Now you better not be playing any games with me!" in a drunken slurry. His eyes were down on the dirt, trying not to trip in the dark, so he was unaware of the hulking thing creeping up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> <em>[Under his breath]</em> Poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> <em>Lucky</em> bastard, cause there's something you should know about hidebehinds. They can't <em>stand</em> the taste a' booze. The things favorite treat is munchin' on your intestines, but if you got alcohol in your system? They'll turn up their nose to ya. They hate it! So when that hidebehind sunk its fangs into his arm only to smell booze on his breath? Nasty shock for the critter!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune opens his mouth and raises his eyebrows, momentarily at a loss for words.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Well… duly noted. Guess now I’ve got a good excuse to drink booze.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> That's what I'm saying! The thing spat him out and scampered off back where it came. So some folk take to making sure they got a pint in them before going for a walk. <em>[He laughs]</em> Though some people say that it's just an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> What do you think, in regards to that?</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Eh, I don't care as long as they don't leave the bottles in my park.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> …Are there rumors of hidebehinds here?</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Hm… I think I've heard talk of strange things stalkin' round the Rock Garden by Canyon Vista? Heavily wooded and full of big rocks 'n cliffs, folks say they like being in those sorts of cracks and caves.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune playfully nudges Dr. Hargroves.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Looks like we’ll have to stop by a state store ‘n check it out, sometime.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hargroves laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> A lead is a lead!</p>
<p><em>Eardwulf tilts his head and smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> You two fancy yourself cryptid hunters?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune glances at Dr. Hargroves, who smiles and shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> I suppose we do.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Then it's good luck, to you both. Pairs are good, in these woods. Keep eyes on each other's backs.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rune gives a humorous salute to the man.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Yes sir. If we aren’t found dead in a ditch somewhere, you’ll know we made it.</p>
<p><strong>Eardwulf:</strong> Ha! Stay alive, keep my job easy.</p>
<p><em>He gives the two a good natured smile and wink. Dr. Hargroves shakes her head with a light chuckle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Loud and clear.</p>

<p>Transcription of symbol, "hidebehind."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On 13/05/1975, the personnel of the Cryptozoology Sector began scouting World's End State Park in the area that Officer Eardwulf had recommended. During the exploration, a new <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8411">SCP-8411</a> symbol was discovered etched onto a tree. Members of the team were immediately receptive to its memetic meaning, determining that it was representative of "hidebehind." In addition, the symbol for "stay alert"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> accompanied it.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not Officer Eardwulf was aware of the symbol's existence.</p>
<p>Nearby, personnel would find a small overhang in a rocky hill, with clear traces of animal activity within the cave. Most notably, various scratches and scattered bones.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> In conjunction with the SCP-8411 symbol, it was concluded that this area was actively inhabited by an SCP-9404 instance.</p>
<p>The location was marked on the team's map, and containment efforts began. Below is a truncated list of containment attempts for SCP-9404.</p>
<div class="jotting">
<p><strong>Containment Attempt #:</strong> 1</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> A video camera was mounted near the cave in attempts to film SCP-9404 to gain information on its physiology as to fine-tune containment attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Failure. After a two day period of no activity, the camera was found destroyed.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>I suppose video counts as being watched. — Dr. Rune</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="jotting">
<p><strong>Containment Attempt #:</strong> 2</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> A trip-wire and bola trap was constructed at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> While the subject was successfully ensnared, it escaped and vanished from sight upon being spotted by approaching personnel. The only information gleamed is that the SCP-9404 instance had dark and shaggy fur.</p>
</div>
<div class="jotting">
<p><strong>Containment Attempt #:</strong> 3</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> A deer carcass is placed outside of the cave. Its digestive tract has been filled with sedatives.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Failure. Remains untouched.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>Perhaps the rumors of them preferring the meat of men is true. — Dr. Hargroves</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="jotting">
<p><strong>Containment Attempt #:</strong> 4</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> A visual memetic stun agent was placed within the cave.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Failure. Despite evidence of multiple returns to the cavern by the SCP-9404 instance, it appears to have not reacted to the agent.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>Fascinating! — Dr. Viceroy</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="jotting">
<p><strong>Containment Attempt #:</strong> 5</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> A weighted net trap was rigged within the trees surrounding the overhang where tracks indicate the SCP-9404 instance typically passes through.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Failure. Trap was triggered, but the netting was shredded by the instance.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p><em>We need to stop booby-trapping its den. If it runs off, we'll never find it. — Dr. Warren</em></p>

<strong>Foreword:</strong> An impromptu meeting within the Cryptozoology Sector between members of staff.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Hargroves heaves a sigh. She braces both hands on the table, and leans towards the team. Drs. Rune, Warren and Viceroy are sitting with her. Cpt. Weller leans against the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> We're going to need to try from a different angle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Clearly.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren shifts on his feet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> It is, ah, a bit difficult to catch an animal when we barely know anything of its physiology. The best I've been able to gather is from its footprints. It's bigger than your average bear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Maybe we need to beef up our efforts then? What do they use to catch polar bears?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Rudy:</strong> Tranquilizers, if I had to guess. Polar bears don't <em>disappear</em> when you look at them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> I think our biggest issue is that we don't have an effective way of luring it anywhere. We can't exactly bait an animal whose preferred diet is human intestines.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Viceroy scrunches up her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Well, I mean, we <em>could</em> but—-</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Anyone we send out there would be <em>eviscerated.</em> Body armor can only do so much.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hargroves pauses, squints.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> …there might be a different type of defense though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> The game warden we spoke to mentioned one way to make sure that a hidebehind doesn't eat you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Alcohol.</p>
<p><em>There's a pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Like rubbing alcohol or—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Booze. She talkin' booze.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Rudy barks a laugh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Rudy:</strong> They allergic or something?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> I don't know. He said they have a severe aversion to it, that they wouldn't eat someone who's got it in their system. Something about the taste and smell pains them.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Rudy:</strong> Are you suggesting we get someone wasted in the woods as a backwards sort of <em>bait?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> It sounds asinine when said that way, but yes. In theory, it would prevent it from harming them. If we can lure it into striking, only for its target to be drenched in a scent that would repel it, it would be open to counter-attack.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> For an incredibly tight window of time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> And it would be the world's most horrific game of chicken.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Weller taps a finger against his arm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> You'd need it to spring a tripwire, a heavy bola to knock it down. Some folks layin' in wait with darts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> We tried to bola it before, though. It just vanished the moment we got close enough to see it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> You could blindfold the tranq team.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> …blindfold the people who need to shoot at it?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> The only person in this Site that I'd trust to quite literally fire blind is the Chief.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Is she busy?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> I could find out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> This is actually insane. You people are insane.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> I mean, if we got people on stand-by, it'd be easy to abort the attempt and make it go away. The biggest risk here is trustin' the whole alcohol bit — but I'm willin' to believe it.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren bites his lip, but Dr. Viceroy nods eagerly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> So, we'd also need alcohol. Which we… don’t have a lot of, huh? Unless we take a few hour drive to civilization to hit a liquor store.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Warren looks confused, Dr. Rune sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Director Eden refuses to add anything more than some shitty draft to the shipments. Probably so no one gets in a drunken fight with a not-deer. So we don’t have much and what we have tastes like ass.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Actually, I know a guy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> You… know a guy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> <em>[Murmuring]</em> This site doesn't even have 100 people, don’t you know everyone?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Hold on, hold on. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><em>Ten minutes of extraneous footage removed.</em></p>
<p><em>Cpt. Weller places a mason jar of dark purple-red liquid on the table with a heavy thunk. Dr. Rune raises an eyebrow, interested.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Some actually good booze.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hargroves pinches her nose.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> Eden is gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Bah! He can thump a Bible about it. Not that he knows.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> <em>We're literally recording—</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Viceroy nudges past Dr. Warren.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Who’s the bootlegger?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> Do I <em>look</em> like a snitch?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Viceroy giggles. Dr. Warren puts a hand to his forehead as Dr. Rune leans forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Do I get to know what’s in that or is it a trade secret?</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> It’s a blueberry mead. Made from some shit in the swamp and doctored with a little extra, this’ll knock you off your ass faster than you can shake a tail at.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Weller grins widely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> A bit of behind-the-back brewing to catch a hidebehind.</p>

<p>On 28/05/1975, the Cryptozoology Sector determined a revised plan to catch the SCP-9404 instance. Despite the unorthodox proposal, the plan was approved for execution by Chief Zoe Miranda<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> and the attempt was undergone the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Containment Attempt After-Action Report</strong><br/>
<strong>Officer of Record:</strong> Director Julian Eden</p>
<hr/>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> We think the mechanics behind its ability to "hide behind" things is a form of observational teleportation.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Mhm.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> When observed, they vanish into the shadows or behind things where they are unseen. It's not that they're incredibly fast on their feet, I'd reckon they're probably as fast as your average bear, it's a dematerialization.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> So this meant you had to blindfold the people wielding rifles?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hargroves:</strong> In our defense, it is incredibly difficult to try and catch a creature — in an open forest — that you cannot look at. We had to get creative in terms of baiting it into an open spot to be tranq'd.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> And the other part of your "creativity" was to get drunk?</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> It was a tad risky, but I've long learned to trust the words of folk out here when it comes to warding. We did some cross-referencing after talking to that game warden. Turns out it was a consistency we missed in our first diggin', and consistencies in folktales are always important.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Risky is not how I would've described it. I have never heard of alcohol as any sort of ward.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> Ya could call it a ward 'gainst bacteria.</p>
<p><em>Dir. Eden pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> I… suppose?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rune:</strong> We did actually find out <em>why</em> it's so adverse to alcohol, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Oh?</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> It's an incredibly fascinating animal! Like a polar bear, almost, in the way it sees — well, mostly smells — people as viable prey.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> People are its <em>preferred</em> prey, are they not?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> They'll eat the guts of anything alone in the woods, but it seems to prefer people, yeah. Which is why we had Warren stand out there as bait!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> Oh my God you made Murphy do it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> Hey, if we messed up, it's not like he would've been hurt!</p>
<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Viceroy:</strong> …much.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><em>Dr. Warren is sitting with his head in his hands. Dir. Eden is sitting next to him, worried.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Please don't let them talk me into that again. Oh my god I drank too much. I didn't even <em>know</em> I was a confident drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> I'm not letting them do that again.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> It was so big. Did you <em>see</em> how big it was? I bet it's 4 meters on its hind legs.</p>
<p><em>Dir. Eden pats him on the back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> It nearly touched me when the bola downed it. I felt its CLAWS whiff the air behind my head! Or maybe that was one of the darts. I can't tell which one of those is the worse option.</p>
<p><em>He pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> I'm not in trouble, right, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Warren:</strong> Are any of us in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> I'm debating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> And you wonder why I don’t add more alcohol to the shipment list.</p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> That crap is barely 5 proof!</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> And yet you still found a way to get drunk on it.</p>
<p><em>Cpt. Weller pauses. Dir. Eden is regarding him tiredly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cpt. Weller:</strong> …Yup.</p>
</div>
<div class="notation">
<p><strong>Dir. Eden:</strong> What in God’s name made you think this was a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> I mean…</p>
<p><em>She clicks her tongue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Miranda:</strong> It worked.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The SCP-9404 instance has since been successfully transported to Site-898 and placed within one of the Cryptozoology Sector's outdoor containment units. The entity's containment procedures and upkeep have been established as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All cameras within Outdoor Containment Unit B are to be deactivated; a series of motion sensors are to take their place as to more effectively monitor SCP-9404's activity.</li>
<li>SCP-9404 is to be fed deer viscera on a twice-daily feeding schedule.</li>
<li>In the event that the instance needs to be subdued — whether for medical examination or containment cleaning purposes — it is to be sedated via its food.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the SCP-9404 instance was tranquilized and transported to containment, members of staff were able to examine the anomaly's physiology in-full.</p>
