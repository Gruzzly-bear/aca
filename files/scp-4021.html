<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4021 is the designation given to both SCP-4021-1, which is the incinerated remains of a mandarin orange tree, and SCP-4021-2, which were sentient humanoid fruits that were previously produced periodically by SCP-4021-1.</p>

<p>SCP-4021-1 is a 7m tall mandarin orange (<em>Citrus reticulata</em>) tree. Instances of SCP-4021-2 religiously worship this tree, possibly considering it as a deity. SCP-4021-1 requires a large amount of [REDACTED] to continually produce SCP-4021-2 instances and remain healthy.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-4021-2 instances are gradually produced at a varying time frame from SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 are sapient mandarin fruits with limbs that appear to be made of material analogous to non-anomalous plant stalk matter, with a series of interior organs that function similarly to those found in humans. SCP-4021-2 have been found to have a sense of sight, taste, and hearing; it is unknown if they have a sense of smell and touch. SCP-4021-2 are able to engage in communication through mouth-like structures. However, the language that SCP-4021-2 instances communicate in is unknown. SCP-4021-2 are docile in nature, and seem to enjoy conversation amongst other SCP-4021-2 instances. When SCP-4021-2 instances are not tending to their crops, they are typically seen conversing with each other <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">or staring outside of the containment area for long periods of time.</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>While there are 17<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> SCP-4021-2 instances in existence, SCP-4021-1 appears to cease producing fruit until an SCP-4021-2 instance has expired; it also requires for the remaining SCP-4021-2 instances to have completed their burial ritual, and that sufficient time has transpired for the buried instance to have completely decomposed, typically taking up to 7 weeks. When an instance of SCP-4021-2 expires, the other instances of SCP-4021-2 will pick up the dead specimen and bury it under SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 "pray" daily at dawn, and during births of SCP-4021-2 instances in groups of 3-4. The frequency of these praying rituals has been observed to be gradually increasing over time, sometimes straying from SCP-4021-2's common praying routine patterns. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Additionally, writing on the ground from SCP-4021-2 instances in what is presumed to be their language has been found multiple times following these rituals.</span></p>
<p>SCP-4021-2 instances have shown a significant interest in gardening, often tending to fruit crops in their containment chamber. It should be noted that crops not classified as fruit were ignored by SCP-4021-2. The harvested crops have been tested by Foundation personnel and have shown no anomalous effects. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">When crops are ready to be harvested, SCP-4021-2 instances will allow personnel to take as many as they want, provided that the fruit taken is not part of the citrus genus.</span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4021-01:</strong> A series of 6 tests with SCP-4021-2 instances was held. All of these tests were proposed by the Project Head to learn of their reactions to various objects and animals.</p>

<div class="collapsible-block-content">
<p><strong>Behavioral note dated 04/22/15:</strong> Proportionally less conversation and overall activity has been observed between the SCP-4021-2 instances. It has also been noticed that SCP-4021-2 have not been tending to the crops within their containment chamber as often as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral note dated 05/03/15:</strong> The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has decreased to 13, despite sufficient time having elapsed for SCP-4021-1 to produce further offspring. Additionally, SCP-4021-2 instances have neglected their crops for several weeks, requiring personnel to maintain them instead.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral note dated 05/28/15:</strong> SCP-4021-2 instances seem to be spending a significantly increased amount of time near the entrances to the containment area. Furthermore, SCP-4021-2 instances have begun taking on a more wilted appearance than previously noted. No signs of any disease found.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral note dated 06/19/15:</strong> The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has again decreased to 9. SCP-4021-2 have been writing indecipherable symbols on a more common basis, often near any entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral note dated 09/20/15:</strong> Over the past few months following the previous note, the number of instances of SCP-4021-2 active at one time has gradually decreased until none have been produced at all for extended periods of time. On 09/20/15, SCP-4021-1 has died, its features consistent with decomposition. SCP-4021-1 has been incinerated, and SCP-4021 reclassified to Neutralized along with a revision of its documents.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4021-03:</strong> On 08/17/15, the Project Head left a note on the document directed at the researchers assisting in containment of SCP-4021.</p>

<p><strong>Notice from Project Head Alan Phid:</strong> I've gone through this document and crossed off unimportant parts. In the future, please refrain from including unnecessary information as it makes the document less easily accessible. I've also received several questions as to what was removed from the document; everything that was removed was clutter, making it damn near unreadable. I will be taking no further questions regarding this matter.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4021-04:</strong> Dr. Phid has been reported missing since 09/20/15.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4021-05:</strong> After an investigation on the SCP-4021 Project Head, "Alan Phid" was found to be an alias he had adopted for currently unknown reasons. Further efforts to gain insight into his background are ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-4021-06:</strong> On 09/23/15, viable seeds from remaining fruit of SCP-4021-1 have been extracted, introducing the possibility of SCP-4021-1's revival.</p>
