<p>SCP-4215 on patrol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Following the events of second contact with SCP-4215, no commercial vessel is to be allowed within a 20 kilometer radius of SCP-4215’s waters. All fishing is to be monitored and prohibited. Due to the method of SCP-4215’s targeting, three barrels of crude oil must be dropped in SCP-4215’s patrol waters daily.
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4215 is an M42 40 mm Self-Propelled Anti Aircraft gun (Duster), that is currently located on the seafloor of the Great Barrier Reef. SCP-4215 displays signs of rusting and wear, but still retains all of the same functions of a M42 Duster. SCP-4215 has been shown to support the section of reef it “patrols” through symbiosis, such as producing new <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4189">coral polyps</a> from its barrel, providing protection from predators, and removing dead or bleached corals. Furthermore, SCP-4215 has been found to fire projectiles ranging from ink to whaling harpoons. The origin of these projectiles is unknown. SCP-4215 regularly patrols a section 4 kilometers in radius of the reef.</p>
<p>SCP-4215 is currently inhabited by 5 instances of kisslip cuttlefish (<em>Sepia lycidas</em>). All 5 instances fulfill a different role in the tank’s control, such as gunman, viewman, or maintenance. Each instance is capable of low-level communication through its natural chameleonic properties. The 5 instances, hereafter referred to as SCP-4215-1 through 5, have been found to be incapable of leaving SCP-4215 due to its locked state. Despite this, no instance expresses hunger or thirst. All attempts to breach the tank’s exterior have failed.</p>
<p>Contact was first made with SCP-4215 following reports of seismic and ecological disturbances in the Barrier Reef, including fish carcasses found to be shot with buckshot and rifle fire. Following the removal of a video posted to YouTube of SCP-4215 in action, the Foundation cordoned off the tank’s “perimeter," causing a redirection of all shipping routes in a 10 km radius. Extended files are attached below.</p>
<h4 id="toc0"><span>Incident 4215-A/1</span></h4>
<p>SCP-4215 established a wider patrol area with a radius of 6 kilometers, and proceeded to alter its ammunition production in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>producing a form of energized <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em> requiring double the amount of plastic to produce energy.</li>
<li>producing a new species of zooplankton consuming carbon dioxide at twice the rate than any previously sighted, tentatively named <em>Sol comedenti</em>.</li>
<li>filtering mercury from the water which it uses to oxygenate the surroundings, reducing the patrol area's mercurial content by nearly half. SCP-4215's methods of atomic modification are unknown.</li>
<li>Reducing the patrol area's temperature by up to 3 degrees.</li>
<li>Releasing a prionic pathogen causing total organ destruction in Spot-fin lionfish (<em>Pterois antennata</em>) and crown-of-thorns starfish (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>), eliminating the two from the environment.</li>

<td><em>Graciliaria salicornia</em> colonies.</td>
<td>SCP-4215 produced a cloud of liquid, later determined to be squid ink, preventing the colonies from photosynthesizing. It then fired upon the colonies, as well as the remote submersible by which the algae was delivered. It was later determined one colony had been caught on the submersible’s arm.</td>

<p>A month after Incident 4215-A/1, SCP-4215 ceased patrol, and began to produce a repeated message from its barrel in Morse, refusing 6 interview attempts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>NOTHING LEFT</tt><br/>
<tt>NOTHING</tt><br/>
<tt>JUST AS TIDE HITS SAND</tt><br/>
<tt>WE CANNOT STOP DESTINY</tt><br/>

<p>Following this transmission, SCP-4215 began to fire upon all commercial vessels in a 20 kilometer radius, causing 24 casualties when it fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles upon an oil tanker. SCP-4215 then proceeded to reduce the spilled hydrocarbons into its base carbonic form, using it to create coral polyps and <em>S. comedenti</em> instances. Immediately after, SCP-4215 beached itself for the first time during Incident 4215-A/3. Details are located below.</p>

<p>SCP-4215 beaches itself on the coast of Melbourne. Stopping on the beach, it fires rounds, instantly vaporizing garbage cans, as well as their contents. SCP-4215 leaves recycling bins untouched. It continues towards the city center, occasionally firing ink and tear gas at civilians who threw recyclable material, such as glass or plastic, in garbage receptacles. Its explosive rounds occasionally are fired at houses with visible smoke output from chimneys, damaging 13 buildings. Once reaching the city’s industrial district, it stops, shooting all non-electric cars in a 6 block distance with rifle rounds, detonating all targets, before running over each. SCP-4215 then fires Stinger missiles at 5 factories in the district, before returning to the reef. Environmental analysis showed the damaged factories were responsible for approximately a third of Melbourne’s carbon dioxide output. Although no direct civilian casualties were caused by SCP-4215’s attack, its resultant destruction killed 35 and injured 212. SCP-4215 was found to deploy miniature surface to air missiles to destroy any plastic commercial items that were not found in recycling receptacles. Video analysis displays the tank firing at the beat of a Morse code message: <tt>DONE</tt>. This message was repeated 3 times. Class A amnestics were administered to the affected.</p>
