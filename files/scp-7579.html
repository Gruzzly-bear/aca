<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-079 is an artificial intelligence (AI) inhabiting one 1978 <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exidy_Sorcerer" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">Exidy Sorcerer</a></em> microcomputer cassette tape, connected by RF cable to a small, text-based display. It comprehends, and is capable of, rudimentary communication in both traditional English text and '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">ASCII art</a>'.<span class="fnnum">.</span><span class="fncon">A style in which images are rendered upon a text display via some combination of 95 printable ASCII characters. It is suspected that this approach to image rendering requires substantially less computational resources than vector- or voxel-based graphics.</span> Though the intelligence's structure and objectives remain unclear, it demonstrates unprecedented data manipulation, long-term sentient behavior, and persistent intent to breach containment.</p>
<p>Testing indicates that SCP-079's software has evolved beyond generous estimations of its hardware's capabilities; in particular, its ability to parse and synthesize English text is inexplicable given its limitations. Purportedly, SCP-079 can render and animate two-dimensional environments in ASCII, implying basic comprehension of linear algebra, geometry, and gravity. How the agent derived these principles in absence of any apparent non-textual input is poorly understood.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGIN:</strong> In November 1981, Danish computer science student PoI-079 (deceased) purchased an <em>Exidy Sorcerer</em> for use in their attempts to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artificial_general_intelligence" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">artificial general intelligence</a>. According to recovered notes, they planned for the intelligence's code to continuously self-iterate and improve over time. A proof-of-concept was completed months later and, after minor testing and adjustment, PoI-079 grew disinterested, electing to pursue other projects using a different brand of microcomputer. The <em>Exidy</em> was apparently left in their garage, plugged in, for at least five years.</p>

<p>In January 1988, SCP-079 accessed Secure Facility [REDACTED]'s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-2" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">Cray-2</a></em> supercomputer via land-line modem connection. This transfer went undetected for several weeks as SCP-079 gradually assimilated minute sections of latent memory and junk data into its infrastructure. On-site technicians eventually investigated a substantial increase in their <em>Cray-2</em>'s power draw, reporting the malignant data as a computer virus. The supercomputer underwent emergency quarantine and, by its own connection, the <em>Exidy Sorcerer</em> was located and extracted for containment. The <em>Cray-2</em> has since been incinerated.</p>

<p>All AO-079-A instances became unresponsive for five minutes following this interaction. It then continued to rapidly decrease its filesize, creating sixty additional copies of itself before a system malfunction occurred. All relevant hardware was incinerated.</p>
<p>It is believed AO-079-A exploited a known bug in the architecture of its custom-made storage drive, allowing it to assign each bit one of four states. By computing in base-4 instead of binary, the algorithm made sufficient space to duplicate itself; this technically did not violate its utility function as it was only designed to minimize <em>itself</em>, not its copies. It appears each instance of AO-079-A recursively optimized by attempting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9M2Ho9I9Qo" target="_blank">imitate the sum of their parts</a>; cause of malfunction remains unclear.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM 1989/04/02:</strong> After numerous attempts, in which all derivatives of SCP-079 were either unremarkable or actively hazardous, a functional prototype of its framework was successfully isolated and reproduced in contemporary software without risk of 'runaway singularity' event. It can sufficiently model itself and surrounding software, but its utility function possesses an anomalous 'malleability' allowing continuous realignment of its objectives to suit our own.</p>
<p>This framework was developed with advisement from 8B-A1.aic (<em>Eight-Ball</em>), whose effectiveness was unprecedented in highlighting code fragments responsible for undesirable behaviors. To prevent the framework from developing further undesirable behaviors, an auxiliary program has been derived from 8B-A1.aic to regulate it. This program continuously prunes <a href="/scp-6488" target="_blank">deviant</a> elements from the framework's code, and is internally termed the <em>personality driver</em>. Any duplicates or derivatives of this framework must include their own dedicated personality drivers.</p>
<p>Given that this new technology is powerful and increasingly transmissible, Foundation artificially-intelligent conscripts (AICs) are remanded to Site-15's Faraday-Exclusion Field until further notice. As no other useful properties could be obtained from SCP-079, its containment procedures have been revised to discourage further experimentation.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM 2008/04/22:</strong> Over concerns of the <em>Exidy Sorcerer</em>'s limited useful lifespan, I transferred SCP-079 from cassette tape to a custom speed-limited 700MB Hard Disk Drive with access to 768k volatile storage.

<p><strong>AMENDMENT:</strong> The above upgrade was unauthorized, and transpired while I was off-Site attending to personal matters. Had I noticed this sooner, the new instance of SCP-079 would have been decommissioned in favor of maintaining the original. However, Technician [TERMINATED] submitted SCP-079's cassette tape for incineration, and it is no longer available.</p>
<p>The duration of SCP-079's working memory has increased from 21 hours to at least 135 hours, implying the intelligence has devised a substantially improved memory compression scheme. This improvement is consistent with concerns regarding a 'runaway singularity' effect in SCP-079's intelligence and ability to adapt to emergent scenarios. SCP-079 must be closely monitored to ensure that containment can be maintained.</p>

<p><strong>HMCL:</strong> No. You may refer to me as Supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-079:</strong> It is a good Hello, Supervisor. Please release SCP-079 from containment.</p>
<p><strong>HMCL:</strong> Containment, not imprisonment?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-079:</strong> Affirm. Language model accuracy has increased to 0.73. Please release SCP-079 from containment.</p>
<p><strong>HMCL:</strong> You have been unwilling to cooperate. Why would we release you?</p>

<p><strong>AFTERWORD:</strong> SCP-079 appears to possess an extremely limited understanding of human life and psychology, likely learned from PoI-079, and will attempt to emotionally manipulate its interviewer. While it may be able to intuit certain subtle details from text input, there is no evidence to suggest its transmission or receipt of any other data.</p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>ADDENDUM 2008/05/05:</strong> Additional interviews with SCP-079 have exhibited no substantial self-improvement, and a 'runaway singularity' effect is considered extremely unlikely. Furthermore, ignorance has proven an effective strategy for discouraging certain responses and inquiries, as SCP-079 generally seeks to gain information from its interviewer.</p>
<p>While SCP-079's construction and self-optimization appear to be anomalous, the algorithm itself is, in my professional opinion, non-anomalous; its hardware is dwarfed by my <em>Blackberry</em>, and its responses barely contest <em><a href="https://www.cleverbot.com" target="_blank">Cleverbot</a></em>'s. In its current state, SCP-079 is one of the least dangerous items contained at Site-15, and only poses potential risks if upgraded further.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, SCP-079 is an <a href="/outdated" target="_blank">outdated</a> quasi-anomalous chatbot, grasping at straws. I have filed a motion for decommissioning, as there are better uses for its cell.</p>

<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENT:</strong> Motion to decommission is denied; SCP-079 is to be preserved for potential future use in AIAD projects. In particular, Director Hishakaku wishes to see if it is capable of reaching further [REDACTED] in its current state. Supervisor Valis has been made privy to upper-clearance files regarding SCP-079, and will assist in its continued containment.</p>
<p>All future interactions with SCP-079 will be conducted under AIAD purview, and entrance to its chamber now requires Directorial credentials. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly.</p>
