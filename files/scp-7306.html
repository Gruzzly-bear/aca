<p>Photograph of SCP-7306 in active state with Foundation photographer's memory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7306</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures</strong>: As of 10/03/2023, SCP-7306's containment procedures have been updated. No Foundation personnel, except for the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, are to know of the existence of SCP-7306. The Director of Site-02 is to be informed of the containment procedures of SCP-7306 but not its descriptive function in order to reduce information leaks. All documents, digital or physical, are to be stored in SCP-7306's storage unit and never displaced from the room.</p>
<p>SCP-7306 is to be contained in an unmarked private storage unit at Site-02. Multiple targeting systems and devices scanning the room controlled via Site-02's A.I. system have been installed for security purposes. Due to previous incidents, no other Foundation or site personnel are to test or use SCP-7306 for any reason.</p>
<p>Continuous utilization of SCP-7306 will cause rapid mental deterioration and will require psychological evaluation and therapy. It is recommended any future use of SCP-7306 is limited to one use to avoid <strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7306 is a blank, pristine polaroid film with no distinctive identifying marks. It is impossible to be damaged or destroyed in any manner. It exhibits no visual anomalous properties until held by a human subject with average memory retention and mental acuity. The blank image is then slowly replaced by an image the subject is familiar with, usually a prevalent moment in the subject's life.</p>
<p>Once the image has been fully colorized in the film, the subject will be unresponsive to any interaction or communication for a short period of time. Their consciousness will then transfer to the time period to which they have traveled and experience a duration ranging from one to twenty-four (1-24) hours before their consciousness spontaneously returns to their physical body. After said subjects' consciousness returns, opening SCP-7306-2 will reveal a new polaroid film (-A to -G), containing no anomalous properties, capturing a random moment the subject was photographed as well as a new entry in the journal found in SCP-7306-2. </p>
<p>SCP-7306-2 is a small steel lock box that contains SCP-7306-A to -G, a photographer's journal, several used pencils that are utilized each time SCP-7306 is activated, and a replacement lens for a polaroid camera. The journal describes events that SCP-7306-3, the photographer, has photographed and logged. It is not yet clear if the journal itself is the anomaly manipulating spacetime.</p>
<p>SCP-7306-3 is indicated to be Pater Beard, a famous photographer who has been missing since 2020 and was found dead in Camp Hero State Park. No other information pertaining to SCP-7306-3 is known at this time. <span style="font-size:18%;">lies</span></p>

<strong>Summary</strong>: SCP-7306-2 was found in Montauk, Long Island on Pater Beard’s property (who at this time is missing). It was immediately recovered when his family reported his wife finding a strange lockbox that gave her vivid dreams of her late husband. All witnesses were interviewed and were given amnestics shortly after object retrieval. The following is an audio log recorded during the execution of Operation "Tag and Bag", conducted by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots") with interference from Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings").<br/>

<p><strong>Closing Statement</strong>: SCP-7306 and SCP-7306-2 were successfully recovered with no casualties or damage to Foundation property. Regarding Epsilon-6 Lieutenant "Sentinel", they are currently undergoing psychological treatment for injuries sustained during interaction with SCP-7306. Apart from this, SCP-7306-3's body remnants have been found in a densely wooded area in Camp Hero State Park. The body was examined, and forensics showed Pater Beard's mind died before his physical body began to decompose. What remained of the body was shortly handed over to local authorities and family members for burial.</p>

<h1><span>Experiment Logs</span></h1>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Determine the extent and purpose of SCP-7306. All experiments were conducted with subjects of mixed backgrounds, which included, but were not limited to: age, ethnicity, family, and criminal history. All experiments were authorized by the O5 Council as well as the Ethics Committee (which was represented by EC-08). Listed below are only starred experiments for future research and/or investigations:</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #90162d">Experiment 1</span></strong> — "The Soldier"</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: <em>Subject #D82718</em>, Afghanistan War veteran, age twenty-nine (29). Convicted of armed robbery and homicide of law enforcement officers and mutable counts of 2nd-degree homicide. Caucasian, only child with two (2) married parents.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Subject #D82718 used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 7 seconds. After the subject returned, they were unresponsive for 2 days. They recalled being back in Afghanistan, where he previously failed to save his former squad mate from oncoming fire from enemy forces. They attempted to save his former squad mate but ended up failing again. The subject requested to use SCP-7306 a second time but was denied and reassigned to regular duties.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7306-3 Journal Entry</strong>: This photograph shows extreme dedication and the love of brotherhood, but sometimes the outcome we want is just confined to dreams. Reality is much too harsh.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><span style="color: #90162d">Experiment 5</span></strong> — "The Student"</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Amir Bugti, a current college student at Harvard University, age twenty-one (21). Pakistani, no siblings, and two (2) married parents.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 4 seconds. After returning, they were immediately responsive and cooperative with Foundation staff. They recalled being back on campus where he was shortly asked if he would like to go to a party hosted by the unofficial ασʊ fraternity. They noted he declined the offer previously but accepted it in this case due to regretting not being involved in "college activities". He remembered inviting a few of his friends to party and relax after Friday classes. Upon looking at his record, it is shown he was arrested for simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs as well as drug-induced homicide. Three out of five individuals who were present during that time overdosed and died before paramedics could arrive. Campus police caught and detained Amir Bugti, charging him and those who rented the property. When the subject was informed of what he did, he refused to believe the Foundation staff. Staff then ended the experiment and returned him to MCI-Cedar Junction <em>(Note: Subject was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> charged prior to using SCP-7306)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7306-3 Journal Entry</strong>: In an effort to live life to the fullest, the young adult did the opposite and killed his future. Disappointing.</p>

<strong><span style="color: #90162d">Experiment 9 / Incident CI-7306</span></strong> — [<span style="color: #e1002a"><strong>Unauthorized</strong></span>]</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Mitch Kang, Security Chief for Site-02, age forty-three (43). Asian, no children or spouse.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: On 09-02-2023, Security Chief Mitch Kang was found frantically sobbing and shaking in SCP-7306’s previous containment chamber for a long period of time. Once calmed down, they were questioned and put into quarantine for further analysis. During further investigation, Security Officer Mitch Kang admitted to working as an informant for multiple hostile factions towards The Foundation, most prominently the Chaos Insurgency. His actions led to the breach in containment of many SCP subjects which caused a K-Class scenario. In an effort to reverse the situation and danger he put himself in, he used SCP-7306 on his own accord.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7306-3 Journal Entry</strong>: Cornered by foxes and wolves, the little piggy had no choice but to be devoured. Very humorous… I might even frame this one.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong><span style="color: #90162d">Experiment 11</span></strong> — "The Father"</p>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: Kelvin Mikel, United Airlines Pilot, age fifty-three (53). African American, no current children (1 dead), divorced.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 9 seconds. They were unresponsive for an estimated 11 hours. During the interview, the subject recalled being on duty and walking to his appointed terminal. He then received a familiar call from his ex-wife, telling him their sixteen-year-old child was robbed and then stabbed on the way home from school. They immediately ran towards the nearest available vehicle and left for the hospital where she was being treated. When they were told what he had done previously, he mentioned remaining on duty and continuing his flight. He noted," This didn't change anything. This put fire to a once-dying memory."</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7306-3 Journal Entry</strong>: No father should ever outlive their child, but if so, they should be in your arms. Cruel photograph…</p>

<p><strong>SCP-7306-3 Journal Entry</strong>: [<strong>DATA EXPUNGED</strong>]<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: On 9/19/2023, shortly after Experiment 17, the Ethics Committee ordered all research and tests with SCP-7306 to be canceled, and the research team led by Dr. Michael Olson disbanded and dispersed to other Foundation projects. Due to the unethical consequences SCP-7306 brings, SCP-7306 is to remain in its containment chamber, and no Site-02 personnel, specifically research personnel, are allowed inside. Cleaning crews and security personnel are the only exceptions to this order. <br/>

<strong>Summary</strong>: On 10/03/2023, Senior Researcher Michael Olson, Assistant Researcher Kyle Jacobson, Assistant Researcher Brooke Bayfield, and several other Site-02 staff were discovered to have used SCP-7306 with malicious intent for personal gain. No experiments were conducted with the necessary approval by the Ethics Committee, and several resulted in major changes to our current timeline of history. During the investigation, via the SCP-7306 journal, several outcomes have or have not occurred due to its use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor Bryan Holland becomes a punk rock musician, never to work for the Foundation.</li>
<li>Coffee in the Site-02 break room would always have sugar and cream instead of the ordinary stevia and oat milk.</li>
<li>SCP-████ "The Grimace Shake" is neutralized, becoming an ordinary blueberry milkshake, due to the predetermined efforts of Foundation staff.</li>
<li>The Site-02 Assistant Director has a wife and three daughters.</li>
<li>[<strong>DATA REDACTED</strong>] became the President of the United States instead of working for the janitorial staff.</li>
<li>As well as similar cases conducted by Site-02 staff.</li>

<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: This is Agent Becker beginning Session 01 of the investigation concerning Incident IMF-7. Date is… October 3rd, 2023… time is… 00:48. The interviewee is Dr. Olson, head researcher and supervisor of SCP-7306. Now, if you may, Doctor…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Dr. Olson is silent as Agent Becker begins to tap his pen on the metal desk</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: You seemed really talkative earlier when they were dragging you out of your office, Michael. This is your last cha—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: (Softly) Those people deserved a second chance, Becker. The Foundation owed them that and a lot of a hell more.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: You don't get to decide that, Michael, the Ethics Committee does.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: The Committee? (Raises voice) The Committee? What a joke. A body of ignorant people that decide what is right or wrong. They are no better than the O5s. (Directed towards the camera) The same cunts that hid [<strong>DATA EXPUNGED</strong>].<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Michael, calm yourself. Don't do this.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: (Directed towards Agent Becker) No! You should all be ashamed of yourselves. (Looks towards the camera) I thought you didn’t want to search for them, but no, you just want to hide it under the rug. You ruthless hypocritical bastards… all in the name of ethics and yet you let people [<strong>DATA EXPUNGED</strong>]!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Enough, Michael! This is childish, even for you!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Silence drowns the room for a short period of time.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Back to my questions… We know a few of the Foundation personnel involved or are at least aware of this operation. A couple of security, research, and even administration staff, but we suspect there are more. Apart from you, who else conducted these experiments?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: Doctor Bayfield helped me conduct most of these experiments, but she wasn't involved as much as I was. Most of the other researchers were just… "participating".<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: And how many times have you conducted these unauthorized tests?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: (Pauses) I can't determine that even if I wanted to.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Jesus Christ.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Agent Becker pulls out a Polaroid film containing a picture of Researcher Jacobson. Noticeably, Dr. Olson's facial expression changes.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Researcher Jacobson, one of your assistants in conducting these experiments. We know you let him use SCP-7306, and during retrieval, we found him unconscious by his bedside.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: I… I told him not to…<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: You told him not to use SCP-7306, yet it was in his possession, and he used it. (Leans in) I would start saying names… now.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson:</strong> (Silence)<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Come on, Michael, we both know you don't have time for this.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Dr. Olson begins sobbing.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: What are you crying for?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: I didn't mean to hurt them. I-I just wanted to help them. Everything I did… for what?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Silence drowns the room for eleven seconds until the door to the interrogation room opens</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Foundation Security</strong>: Might want to finish up; EC-08 wants a debrief before the proceedings.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: <em>(sigh)</em> Fine. There's nothing else to gather from this. Officer Lamson will escort you to your holding cell.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The metal chair screeched followed by the jingle of handcuffs and heavy steps.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: Michael?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Doctor Olson looks back from the frame of the open door towards Agent Becker.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Agent Becker</strong>: For all it's worth, I’m sorry you're in this mess.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The door then quickly opened and banged shut, leaving Agent Becker alone in the room.</em><br/>

<strong>Summary</strong>: Upon concluding the Incident IMF-7 interview, Dr. Olson was escorted back to his holding cell until an Ethics Committee member could view and verify future proceedings. The transcript below is the audio recording containing a conversation between Dr. Olson and Dr. Bayfield.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;<strong>Begin Log</strong>&gt;<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Scuffling is heard with the sound of a jail door squeaking open with more scuffling and footsteps</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Foundation Security</strong>: Give me your hands.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The jingle of handcuffs is followed by the shutting of the jail door.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Are you alright?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: … No.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[Silence]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Do you know what will happen to us… to me?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: I…<em>(hesitates)</em> I don't know for certain. Time will tell.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[Silence]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: I never wanted this to happen, Brooke. To hurt people. All I wanted was for them to live a life worth living. Imagine being cooped up in an office filled with these diabolical beings, never being able to see your family and loved ones… it was the least I could do. <em>(Sighs)</em> It's all my fault.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: You shouldn't blame yourself, Michael. We all took the risk. We knew what would happen if we participated, even me. I thought… I thought that <em>it</em> would help. It's nothing but a dangerous toy that creates fleeting memories.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: You know what that researcher said when we gave him a chance to use SCP-7306? It was the most boring response I ever heard. (Mockingly) I regret nothing because every decision made me who I am today. (Pauses) For years I forced myself to believe in that. I wanted to think in the exact same way as he did. I just wish we never got caught.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: You cannot be serious, Michael. Do you still believe that what we did was worth it? Do you still believe that natural order is something you can play with?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, Brooke. I’m not saying that people who believe in that are wrong, especially him. If they truly don’t regret anything, then they are both lucky and happy. I’m saying that if I have a chance to have a drop of power over what could've been and keep it that way, I would rather have that than fame or fortune.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: And yet that drop of power you talk about is your undoing. All it will do is leave you unsatisfied and begging for more. Even if you try to change it, the constant dread and fear of what is and what could’ve been will forever haunt you, either in these cells or in that fucking thing's containment chamber. Could it have been better? What if I did this or that, and maybe it could have been—it's nonsense!  <br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: You can't stop a person from diving back into their past. This time is barely any different. The only difference is that this time we have the possibility of change. The opportunity to have some other meaning in our lives that we haven't had before.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Whatever you or others on the team sought is dead and should be long forgotten.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: What are you talking about? The past can never be forgotten. It can never die. Our present is always determined by our past. Both an enemy and a friend, our past will never let go. We can finally control that bastard and keep it in check.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Then answer me. Are you really living in the present? You say you have your past in check, but it still controls you. It is haunting you. Right. Now. We can let the past die. Both of us know we’ve let it live for too long. Don't make me go into that void with you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[Silence]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Can I tell you something, Michael?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: (Chuckles softly) Of course. Nobody can stop you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Bayfield</strong>: Life is full of wrong choices, but if I were the perfect daughter, I would have never met you. I would've never come to work at the Foundation. One could say they were never mistakes in the first place. Whether they are mistakes or not, never in a single moment of my life will I regret all the choices I made. I don't need <em>it</em> to tell me that.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>[Silence]</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Dr. Olson</strong>: (Softly) Thank you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>Dr. Olson quietly sobs, as he and Dr. Bayfield tell each other goodbye. The audio cuts.</em><br/>

<strong>Closing Statement</strong>: Moments after the audio recording was cut, Dr. Bayfield and Dr. Olson were terminated due to the unlawful use and gain of SCP-7306. Dr. Jacobson, as well as other Site-02 staff who were involved in the incident, are to be interviewed, given amnestic treatment, and punished accordingly. Ethics Committee Member 08 was present for the proceedings, reporting the results to both the committee and council. New containment procedures for SCP-7306 are to be put in place, and no research team is to ever be affiliated with SCP-7306.<br/>

<strong>Summary</strong>: Experiment 17 was authorized by the Ethics Committee, allowing multiple previous experiment subjects to use SCP-7306 a second time.

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Wait. This isn't… God damn it. Where the hell did it bring me?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The sound of rain and wet thuds on pavement overcome the static and hum the audio picks up</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Hello?! (Knocking) Is there anybody here?! I'm freezing my ass off out here!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: (In the distance) Doors open!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The door opens with a creak and the sound of a bell jingling</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Who are you? Where ar–<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Hey, I've been waiting for you! Yes, I know, we’re not in Afghanistan. Not quite what you expected, huh? (Chuckles) Anyways, take a drink, kid. You look like you need it more than I do.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>#D82718 takes the glass of liquid and ice, and the sounds of heavy footsteps on wood begin to distance itself</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Thanks… wait, you look familiar. Weren’t you on the news some time ago?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Pater Beard, the photographer who went crazy and got stuck in a ditch… or God knows where. Yeah, that’s me.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: How did you even get here?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: I could say the same about you, kid. My best guess is we probably dug ourselves too far and its nature's way of saying "fuck you". Heh. If you expected a dramatic story, you won't find one.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The sound of pouring liquid into a glass of ice echoes throughout the room</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Quite the photographer, huh?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Oh yeah, you could say that. As a kid I loved to take pictures and store them in my journal. As time went on, I began to store som—<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Aw shit, is that Keith Richard's electric guitar?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>A quiet sigh is heard as the strum of strings is played</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: (Sighs) I can still remember the sand against my feet. Life and death, chaos and peace, both living in complete harmony—now I’ve been confined to this hell alone. Well, that was until all of you showed up.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: All?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Well, you are the first to come to see me, you know. I'm waiting for the rest of them. I just hope it was in a diner with some coffee and not… here… this desolate wasteland.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: You have no idea. It's too damn cold out here.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>#D82718 walks around the room with a rhythm of footsteps. The crackle of fire is quietly picked up</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Is there something in particular you like to photograph?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: I like things that don't look like you're in control. Like a lion chasing down a fleeting gazelle. Maybe that's the simplest way I could put it. The same way we make mistakes in life that we don't have full control over. (Softly) Nature sometimes kills you for those mistakes.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Pft, believe me, that's happened way too many times for me to count. My ex almost killed me for sleeping with her sister. Twice!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Sounds like a story alright.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The wood floorboards creak and snap as heavy footsteps get closer</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: I don’t agree with the person or thing that decided that these mistakes should be reversed, but it teaches us that some things were meant to be left alone. In this case, left behind to rot in the past. (Under his breath) If you fuck around, you'll eventually find out.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The room echoes with a thump and the creaking of a rocking chair, overcoming the background noise in the audio. The crackle of fire begins to get louder</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Do you have any other cool shit that, I don't know, got "transported" here?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: It would probably be best if you leave. I can help guide you to your new place if need be.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Heh. What do you mean?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Pater Beard</strong>: You don't know? Well, I don't know why they brought you here, but I have a feeling they knew you wouldn’t be able to come back. <em>Not in one piece, anyway</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Wait. Are… Are you saying I’m t-trapped here?<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: Unfortunately, yes. You're just as stuck as much as I am. Those who get stuck in the past will become part of it. An inevitable, cruel joke some might say. Sometimes the thoughts that flood our mind can either drown us or help us float. It all just depends on what you hold onto.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<em>The sound of electricity buzzes and snaps at the audio</em>.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>#D82718</strong>: Enough of your lessons! Please, don't make me stay! There has to be some way back!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>SCP-7306-3</strong>: I'm not in control here, kid. If there was a way out, I would’ve found it by now. We should've faced our demons a long time ago.<br/>

<p>The terminal slowly cried once more as the light from the LED screen slowly faded away. I stood alone in the empty room and began to process everything I gathered. I looked to my left, seeing the closed lockbox that contained dust and grime.</p>
<p>My heart began to race.</p>
<p>I would have no more regrets. I could remove the nightmares that haunt me every night, waking me up in a pool of sweat and tears. A simple "life reset" is all it was. Nobody would even know. How could they?</p>
<p>But what if they will?</p>
<p>Panic started to rise and fill my chest as I struggled to find a calming breath. I couldn't breathe and unbuttoned my wet dress shirt.</p>
<p>I was tempted…<br/>
