            <h1>SCP-2993</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2993</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2993 is to be contained in a standard secure locker at Site-19. Access to SCP-2993 is available only to staff Level 2 and above. Any personnel wishing to use SCP-2993 must contact the current leading researcher assigned to SCP-2993.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2993 appears to be an unremarkable pair of aviator sunglasses with no visible markings or logos. The durability of SCP-2993 is unremarkable and without proper care may be damaged in a way similar to its non-anomalous counterparts.</p>
<p>When viewed from the front, SCP-2993 is opaque and acts as a mirror. No form of radiation is able to pass through SCP-2993, including visible light. Replacing parts of SCP-2993 while preserving its original function is possible as long as more than 50% of the original mass is present. The most notable feature of SCP-2993 occurs when it is viewed from behind: SCP-2993 shows exactly six hours behind the period of time the user is wearing them (see Addendum SCP-2993-1).</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-2993-1:</strong> A Junior Researcher under Dr. A████████ compared security footage to the view through SCP-2993 while searching for any abnormalities that lead to the containment breach of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Security footage showed the researcher writing on a piece of paper "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the alphabet. Six hours later, the researcher (using SCP-2993) noted that the sentence read, "A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent," a sentence that also contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Further testing has revealed that the past as viewed through SCP-2993 contains many minor changes. Examples include Junior Researcher B█████'s hair as shoulder-length instead of neck-length, an Agent's first name spelled as Hannah instead of Hanna, and the color of Dr A████████'s favorite pen appeared green instead of red.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-2993-2:</strong> Due to differences in details found when viewing the past while wearing SCP-2993 (detailed in Addendum SCP-2993-1), Dr A████████ used SCP-2993 to look over notes he had taken on SCP-████ six hours before. The notes on SCP-████ appeared to be minimally different, excluding ten millimeter differences in length of the steel bars keeping SCP-████ in containment. Although this difference appears negligible, the difference in length would normally lead to a security breach by SCP-████.</p>
<p>Although these dimensions should have caused a containment breach for SCP-████, no such breach occurred. Approximately three hours later, when Dr. A████████ used SCP-2993 to observe the containment area of SCP-████, SCP-████ did not break free of containment, and the differences in measurement observed by Dr. A████████ while wearing SCP-2993 were non-existent when he performed measurements of the containment unit himself.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Memo from Dr: A████████: "Is what SCP-2993 shows us consistent? We know that it maintains at least some level of accuracy in regards to reality, at least nominally, as noted in Addendum SCP-2993-1. Is SCP-2993 selectively altering information? I can't help but wonder what mechanisms influence the effects of SCP-2993.</em></p>

<p>At 23:54, 5/11/████, Dr. A████████ reviewed notes on SCP-2993. Exactly six hours later, Dr. A████████ donned SCP-2993 and viewed himself looking over his notes. Content of the files appeared completely unchanged other than a select testing log that had been appended. The log contained tests that Dr. A████████ had never conducted. The appended log has been exactly reproduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Past-Experiment-Log-2993-1</strong></p>

SCP-2993 forcibly hit with a hammer. No effect.<br/>

SCP-2993 ████ ██ ██████ ██████ █████ █████. No effect.<br/>
SCP-2993 ██████ █ ██ ████ ██████ ██ █████████. █████.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*It should be re-noted that SCP-2993 is no more durable than a regular pair of sunglasses.</p>

<p>Dr. A████████ donned SCP-2993 to view an interview for [DATA EXPUNGED] in person six hours after it had completed. Although differences between recordings of the interview and Dr. A████████'s observation were minimal at first, the end of the interview observed by Dr. A████████ was different than the recording. Following is the transcribed audio recording of Dr. A████████ describing the interview through SCP-2993:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Audio log capture</em><br/>
<em>Experiment 2993-B</em><br/>
Date: 07/13/████<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED]<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> ██ █████████, ████<br/>
<em>Skip to 23m 05s</em></p>
<p><strong>23:07:</strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. A████████</em></strong>: Something is changing. The officer is - (extended pause) - there is something different with the way he's looking at the Subject. I can't quite say what the difference is, but it's there. The Subject is nonplussed - wait, was nonplussed. They appear to be agreeing on something. They are nodding to each other.</p>
<p><strong>23:40</strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. A</em></strong>: The officer is no longer talking to the Subject. The two are staring at each other from across the table, doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>24:05</strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. A</em></strong>: The Subject and the officer are still looking at… fuck, now they are looking at me. They can - (pause) - I think… they can see me.</p>
<p>At this point Dr. A████████ hurriedly takes SCP-2993 off and searches his immediate surroundings.</p>
<p><strong><em>24:22</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Control</em></strong>: Doctor A████████, can you continue?</p>
<p><strong><em>24:26</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. A</em></strong>: [Pauses] I can.</p>
<p><strong><em>24:28</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Control</em></strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong><em>24:30</em></strong><br/>
Dr. A████████ re-dons SCP-2993.</p>
<p><strong><em>24:31</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr. A</em></strong>: HOLY SHIT.</p>
<p>Dr. A████████ quickly removes SCP-2993 once again, showing signs of severe distress.</p>
<p><strong><em>24:35</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Control</em></strong>: Doctor A████████?</p>
<p><strong><em>24:43</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Dr A</em></strong>: They - (pause) - they were standing right in front of me, right there, shoulder to shoulder, staring at me.</p>
<p>Dr A████████ terminates the experiment.</p>
