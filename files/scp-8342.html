<p>Location of SCP-8342. British Columbia, Canada.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8342</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Disruption Class:</strong> Keneq</p>
<p><strong>Risk Class:</strong> Danger</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8342 remains confined within the caves system on Cortes Island, Canada, where it was originally discovered. Due to the partially unpredictable nature of the astronomical events associated with the anomaly, SCP-8342 cannot be directly contained; consequently, the containment strategy adopted is based on progressive structural isolation, constant observation, and damage limitation in the event of anomalous events.</p>
<p>The entire facility has been designed according to a concentric ring model, with the exact location of SCP-8342 at its center. This layout is intended to limit the spread of anomalous effects, facilitate staggered evacuations, and allow for the selective sealing of sectors in the event of large-scale emergencies. The structural plans approved by the Engineering &amp; Technical Service Department are organized as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Sector 1</span></h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Sector 1 constitutes the outermost ring of the facility and houses areas designated for general operations, staff accommodation, and emergency evacuation. It includes the following wings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A:</strong> Temporary light-containment area.</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> Administrative offices (1 to 5) and meeting rooms (1, 2, and 3).</li>
<li><strong>G:</strong> Main entrance to the facility and changing rooms.</li>
<li><strong>H:</strong> Break area (1, 2, and 3), basic infirmary, loading and unloading docks, and meeting room 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>All wings of Sector 1 must remain interconnected and have direct access routes to the outside of the island. These routes must remain operational at all times to allow for immediate evacuations in the event of emergency protocols being activated.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Sector 2</span></h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Sector 2 acts as a transition and buffer zone between the operational and direct containment sectors of the anomaly. The connection between Sector 1 and Sector 3 is made exclusively through main corridors oriented along the North–South and East–West axes, equipped with armored isolation gates. This sector houses the following wings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C:</strong> Maintenance room and warehouses (1, 2, 3, and 4).</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> Secondary research area, medical emergency area, security and rapid response outpost, and central control and security room for the facility.</li>
<li><strong>E:</strong> Exclusion zone and Class D personnel accommodation.</li>
<li><strong>F:</strong> Forward administrative area, meeting rooms (1, 2, and 3), and server area (1 and 2).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Sector 3</span></h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Sector 3 constitutes the core of the facility and the highest risk area. Access to this sector is strictly restricted and remains closed by default. It contains the wings directly related to SCP-8342:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Internal containment security and rapid response outpost.</li>
<li><strong>J:</strong> Astronomical, magnetometric, thaumaturgical, and spatial monitoring area dedicated exclusively to SCP-8342.</li>
<li><strong>K:</strong> Primary containment wing, built directly around the cave system housing SCP-8342 and SCP-8342-1 instances.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Heavy exclusion and containment wing. Used solely for the containment and analysis of entities, test subjects, and objects, both anomalous and normal, related to SCP-8342.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the events recorded on December 21, 2010, certain security measures and protocols have been updated. These will be carried out by qualified personnel. Please follow the measures indicated.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8342 refers to a megalith measuring 7 meters high and 3 meters wide composed of an unknown material (temporarily designated 8342-A) located at an ancient pre-Columbian cultural site on Cortes Island, Canada. SCP-8342 is located inside the main room, which contains various paintings and writings made with pigments of animal and plant origin; in particular, the use of blood from various sources stands out, but human blood is used in greater proportion.</p>
<p>Spectrometric analysis has revealed that the structure of the temple housing SCP-8342 has a total expansion of 1 main room (Room A1), 2 ornamental rooms (Room B1 and Room B2), 1 antechamber (Room C1), and a single entrance.</p>

<p>First room upon entering the temple. Also called the "Solar Chamber" due to its characteristic symbolism related to the Sun, it is located at the end of the entrance passageway. The room measures approximately 25 m² and features more detailed decoration with references to what is understood to be a pre-Columbian deity native to the island. The room connects directly to room B2 on one side and to room A1 at the front, at the entrance to which there are various bone remains and bowls with pigmentation identified as animal and human, suggesting that work on decorating the room continued until its final days.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>This room is adjacent to room B1 and is also known as the "Moon Chamber" due to its distinctive drawings of what appear to be lunar phases with various unidentified symbols in the same language. The room is similar in size to room B1, although slightly larger (30 m²). The room is filled with different leather containers of various sizes containing animal and some human bone remains, including 5 teeth, 7 skull fragments, and 2 pelvises. Like its counterpart, the room connects to the main room but also to room C1 preceding the main room.</p>

<p>Main hall of the temple and location of SCP-8342. The hall measures approximately 50 m², forming what resembles a circle around SCP-8342. Its walls and floor show remnants of paintings representing both the Sun and the Moon, along with unknown humanoid figures and unknown symbols. In the central part, next to SCP-8342, there are 5 sarcophagi sealed using complex runic thaumaturgy; they are placed symmetrically around SCP-8342, in the remaining space where a sixth sarcophagus would be, there is a small stone slab carved with canals leading to SCP-8342. At the top of SCP-8342, what appears to be a slit leading to the outside can be seen, which has been covered over time. Its use or original purpose is unknown.</p>

<p>SCP-8342 remains in a state of latent inactivity for most of the year, except for certain specific dates. All of these dates are marked by certain astral events involving the Sun and Moon. During these events, SCP-8342 emits a distinctive glow depending on the event. Along with it, the five sarcophagi located around it begin to display various unknown symbols in sync with a glow similar to that of SCP-8342. Depending on the event, SCP-8342 will manifest various space-time alterations in an area around it within a radius of 3000 m. These anomalies have an estimated duration similar to that of the event occurring at the time. So far, the anomalies recorded cover the following events:</p>

<pre><code>20:45 - Recording equipment activated.</code></pre></div>
<p>Lieutenant Luark's camera shows a narrow passageway descending into the cave in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Oxygen confirmed. Moving forward. Lavoie, lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>Lavoie:</strong> Copy that. Environment stable… Although I sense a hum in the air. Does anyone else feel it?</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> Magnetic readings at the entrance show nothing. It's likely just the underground echo typical of the planet's internal cavities. Nothing to worry about for now.</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>20:56 - Access to initial passageway</code></pre></div>
<p>Unknown symbols can be seen on the walls. The equipment's lighting flickers briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Roman:</strong> Lieutenant, I'm recording symbols on the walls. They look like… Glyphs?</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> Could be, but don't get distracted. The entrance to this section is too narrow.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> (Checks his equipment) Magnetic signal increasing by 6%. Could be local mineralization. Not dangerous levels.</p>
<p><strong>Surge:</strong> (Pauses momentarily to check the air in front of him) The air contains metallic microparticles. Nothing dangerous, but unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Let's continue. Stay alert.</p>
<p><strong>21:04</strong> - Arrival at the Solar Chamber (Room B1)</p>
<p>The chamber opens before the team: skeletal remains, reddish pigmentation, ritualistic decoration.</p>
<p><strong>Ortega:</strong> Holy shit… This is recent. It's not thousands of years old, not even decades.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> Don't touch anything. Just document visually. Especially you, Ruiz.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> I detect a magnetic pull… Very faint, but constant. The readings are… Somewhat inaccurate. Strange…</p>
<p><strong>Surge:</strong> (Nervous) Uh… Guys? My stethoscope is vibrating…</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Take it off for now, Doctor, it could be dangerous. Let's continue, we can't stay in this room. Look, it continues on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> I suggest taking that path, Lieutenant. It looks like the other one leads to the main section of this ritual chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Okay, we'll check the other chamber before going to the front section. Come on, team. Don't forget to check your oxygen levels.</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>21:13 - Lunar Camera (Room B2)</code></pre></div>
<p>The temperature drops abruptly. Leather containers and human remains.</p>
<p><strong>Roman:</strong> This place is even worse than the last one. The bones are… Deliberately arranged. It may have been some kind of warehouse or similar, combined with a room for… Offerings, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> The magnetic pull went up again. 18%.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> (Turning quickly to look at Patel) Huh? It doesn't make sense. There is no source powerful enough to—</p>
<p>A dry, metallic clatter as something falls to the floor interrupts the second lieutenant's words.</p>
<p><strong>Surge:</strong> The hell? My instrument… It's slipping?!</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> All the team's metal is moving into the next room! Hold on tight to your weapons and communication devices!</p>
<p>The recording shows several metallic medical objects falling out of Dr. Surge's bag and accelerating toward the door leading to the next room (Room C1).</p>
<p>Surge tries to hold them back.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Surge, no, wait—!</p>
<p>Agent Ruiz's primary weapon, positioned several steps behind Doctor Surge, slips forcefully from his hands, and he is unable to catch it. A direct blow to the Doctor's ribcage sends him hurtling into the archway leading to the next section (Room C1). Blunt-force impact. Medical alarm activation.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> SURGE! (With difficulty, he frees Surge and lowers him to the ground) Surge isn't responding!</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Lavoie, quick check.</p>
<p><strong>Lavoie:</strong> (Trembling) No breathing. Non-reactive pupils… I can't detect a pulse…</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Shit… (A long sigh lasting several seconds, followed by almost 20 seconds of silence) Note the death. Let's move on. We need to know what's causing this.</p>
<p>The team continues, with noticeable tension.</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>21:25 - Intermediate Stay (Room C1)</code></pre></div>
<p>The heaviest breathing of all the remaining team members. The floor of the room is covered in tapestries. They show circular wear.</p>
<p><strong>Lavoie:</strong> I don't like this at all. The magnetism is pulling my weapon more and more. It's lifting itself up.</p>
<p>The camera shows his rifle trying to point toward the main room.</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> (Checks Patel's instrument readings) 43%… 46%… This is going up too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> We must be close. Let's move forward.</p>
<p>A sudden magnetic pull forces Lavoie's rifle forward with great force. The weapon slips from his hands, its lanyard yanks his neck hard, dragging him and throwing him into the Main Hall (Room A1).</p>
<p>Luark's camera shows Lavoie being dragged at high speed toward SCP-8342.</p>
<p><strong>Lavoie:</strong> AAAUGH—!</p>
<p>It slams into the megalith with a dry, fatal impact. His body remains motionless, held fast by the growing magnetic force.</p>
<p><strong>Roman:</strong> Shit! Shit! We shouldn't have come in here!</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> No one else is to approach any metal objects. Remove all metal objects. NOW!</p>
<p>The team begins to shed weapons, tools, and metal uniform parts.</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>21:32 - Main Stay (Room A1)</code></pre></div>
<p>SCP-8342 emits a faint, barely visible light. The magnetic intensity continues to increase.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus in the room begins to emit a soft, runic glow.</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> Lieutenant… That thing near where Lavoie is… It's activating.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> (Forced voice) I'm getting an 83% increase… If it keeps going like this, anything metal will become a lethal projectile.</p>
<p><strong>Roman:</strong> So what the hell are we doing here?! We have to evacuate—!</p>
<p>A metal buckle on his vest that Roman hadn't managed to remove is suddenly ripped off, flying toward SCP-8342.</p>
<p>The buckle pierces Roman's collarbone and drags him at full speed, slamming him into the nearest sarcophagus and bending his body in a fatal way.</p>
<p>Instant collapse.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> ROMAN—!… Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>Ortega:</strong> We have to get out of here, NOW!</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>21:36 - Evacuation</code></pre></div>
<p>The team runs toward the exit. The magnetic field is increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>The camera records tremors, static, and light distortions.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> (Shouting) I'm losing the signal! The readings are going crazy—</p>
<p>A metal fragment from the collapsed floor tears loose and strikes Patel in the leg. A bone-cracking sound is heard.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> Aaaagh! My leg! I can't—!</p>
<p><strong>Ortega:</strong> Hold on! I'll take you!</p>
<p>Ortega places Patel on his back.</p>
<p>As I tried to cross the main passageway, one of the work lamps at the entrance was violently torn loose, drawn by the intensity of the field.</p>
<p>A lamp tube is fired from the entrance, impaling Ortega on impact and sending him into the shadows.</p>
<p>Patel falls to the ground a few meters later with a heavy impact, unable to get up.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p><strong>Patel:</strong> ¡NO! ¡ORTEGA!</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Sophie, load Patel! Quick!</p>
<p>Krammer assists Patel while Ruiz covers the retreat.</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>21:44 - Exit from the cave system</code></pre></div>
<p>Magnetic readings begin to decrease as you move away from the core.</p>
<p>The remaining team reaches the outside.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> (Gently lays Patel on the ground and checks him) Patel is… Stable, but his leg is…</p>
<p><strong>Ruiz:</strong> (Checks the readings on Patel's instruments, which are closer to the entrance than the others) The magnetic event is slowly decreasing… Should I keep taking measurements here, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Luark:</strong> Affirmative. Sophie, send an extraction signal. No one else enters until this is mapped and contained.</p>
<p><strong>Krammer:</strong> At your service.</p>
<p>Extraction of the remaining exploration equipment. Cameras off.</p>

<p>After seven hours and twenty-three minutes of continuous deliberation, the central administration of Site-64, under the direction of Director Edgar Hoffman, together with the Deputy Director of Research and Development, Dr. Avery Sanchez, and in the presence of official representatives of the United States Government, the Government of Canada, and two delegates from the FBI's Anomalous Affairs Division, a joint resolution has been reached regarding the territorial and operational management protocol for the anomaly recently classified as SCP-8342.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire territory of Cortes Island (Canada) is hereby closed, including a 100-meter maritime exclusion zone along the entire coastline of the island.</li>
<li>No civilian, commercial, recreational, or research vessel may approach the designated perimeter.</li>
<li>Access to the island is restricted exclusively to: Authorized Foundation personnel with appropriate accreditation, U.S. or Canadian government personnel who have been previously accredited, and/or specialized support teams approved by the assigned Research Director.</li>
<li>All tourist, commercial, fishing, or maritime transport routes will be compulsorily diverted to avoid the island and its exclusion zone.</li>
<li>Coastal authorities will receive surveillance protocols and corresponding narrative coverage.</li>
<li>In the event of a significant anomalous manifestation that compromises the Veil or regional civilian integrity, the governments of the United States and Canada are authorized to provide direct logistical, military, and operational support under the Foundation's supervision.</li>
<li>Cortes Island will no longer be under Site-64's jurisdiction and will be designated as an Independent Provisional Containment Facility, with future development and expansion as a top priority.</li>
<li>The formal designation of the facility will be determined once the initial infrastructure phases are completed.</li>

<p>Following subsequent investigations into Incident 8342-1, more than 200 glyphs have been discovered throughout the three chambers, most of them in Room A1, along with 17 glyphs inscribed on SCP-8342. Of the 154 unique glyphs identified throughout the cave, only 14 have been recognized as Old Daevite thanks to records in SCP-140.</p>
<p>To date, a total of three distinct languages, one entirely unknown,have been detected among the glyphs that make up the SCP-8342 cave; along with the two languages from which the glyphs in SCP-8342 are derived. Epigraphers from the Anthropology Division, together with linguists from the Tactical Theology Division, have worked together to identify and decipher the glyphs; these are some of the glyphs that have been deciphered to date:</p>

<p>On December 5, 1982, four more sarcophagi were unearthed around SCP-8342. The sarcophagi, designated SCP-8342-1-A/B/C/D/E, form an almost complete circle around SCP-8342; in the remaining space where a sixth sarcophagus would appear to have been placed, there is a small stone slab dating to 970 BC. The slab is ritually carved with various inscriptions around its perimeter in an unknown language; circular canals connect to the base of SCP-8342. Any liquid poured onto the slab is absorbed into the base of SCP-8342.</p>

</div>
<p>Due to the high Aspect Radiation density in the area, any attempt at thaumaturgical or theological manipulation is strictly prohibited, owing to the risk of triggering an uncontrolled Speckmann chain<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>.

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>[UPDATE | 24/07/1993]</strong></span><br/>
<span style="color: blue">The first two layers of seals on SCP-8342-1 instances have been opened; the Thaumatology Division is currently working on decrypting the next seal based on the new data obtained thanks to the</span> <span class="dblock"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2140" target="_blank">Project Kallinikos</a></span><span style="color: blue">.

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>[UPDATE | 18/04/2001]</strong></span><br/>

<p>On December 20, 2010, construction of the containment facilities dedicated to SCP-8342 continued. Astronomical reports predicted a total lunar eclipse in the area on that same date, which would last until the following day.</p>
<p>On that same date, the facilities were occupied by 83 workers, 17 members of the Maintenance Department, and 9 armed security personnel.The celestial event began at 23:40 local time. Communications with the facility were lost 22 minutes and 30 seconds after the initial time.<br/>

<p><strong>00:15:04:</strong> Manual opening of the armored door.</p>
<p><strong>00:15:04:</strong> Southwest entrance to the facilities. Sector 96% complete, corresponding to Wing H.</p>
<p>The mechanism responds with a 3-second delay.</p>
<p>The camera shows the interior of the facility's main corridor. Emergency lighting active. Several lamps are flickering without a regular pattern. Drag marks and dried bloodstains are visible on the walls, floor, and ceiling, leading inward.</p>
<p>Delta-2 operatives begin checking each room, while the captain advances down the main hallway with her teammates on either side.</p>
<p><strong>00:24:55:</strong> Intersection with a maintenance corridor. Signs of internal structural damage: walls deformed inward, as if they had been subjected to uneven pressure, along with traces of more recent blood.</p>
<p><strong>00:42:17:</strong> A shadow is observed crossing several meters from the battalion. There is no reaction from the members of Delta-2. Continuing review of rooms adjacent to the main hallway.</p>
<p><strong>01:01:18:</strong> Encounter with survivor in break room No. 3. Identified as Julius Abraham, a member of the Maintenance Department. Two members of the battalion begin treating him right there on the floor. The Captain moves forward with four members to cover the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>01:25:43:</strong> The Captain's body camera remains fixed on the main hallway. Four armed members of Delta-2 are covering side intersections. There are no signs of additional movement.</p>
<p><strong>01:28:06:</strong> Death of engineer Julius Abraham due to blood loss from severe internal injuries.</p>
<p><strong>01:30:19:</strong> Movement at the end of the hallway. The emergency lighting flickers, revealing a humanoid figure approximately 2 m tall approaching the battalion.<br/>
The Captain and the rest of the battalion immediately open fire upon spotting the entity.</p>
<p><strong>01:31:34:</strong> The entity falls, struck down after two full bursts of gunfire just a few meters from the battalion.</p>
<p>The Captain and four members of the battalion examine the entity on the ground. Individual identified. Security Colonel Samuel Jhones. Highly altered body, abundant fleshy tumors attached to his torso, face, and legs, excessive bone deformation.</p>
<p><strong>01:33:02:</strong> Visual examination of the lifeless body. It is observed that the tumor tissue continues to contract autonomously despite the absence of vital signs. Several fleshy masses exhibit eye-like structures in the individual's thoracic cavity.</p>
<p><strong>01:34:27:</strong> Colonel Samuel Jhones's body begins to deform. The chest is opened by forcibly separating the ribs. From the inside, muscle filaments emerge and adhere to the floor and nearby walls.</p>
<p><strong>01:35:41:</strong> The entire battalion falls back several meters. The body ceases to have a recognizable humanoid form and partially merges with the hallway floor. A member of the battalion throws an incendiary grenade at the creature. Total incineration in seconds and complete cessation of movement. Entity neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>01:38:29:</strong> Emergency: three additional entities. Irregular morphology, height varying between 1.5 and 2.3 m. The entities lack skin and have exposed bone structures arranged in a non-anatomical configuration. They are approaching at high speed from the southwest entrance.</p>
<p><strong>01:39:54:</strong> Five members cover the retreat into the facility with direct fire on the entities. The Captain is the last one to follow the rest of the battalion. Several seconds later, it is observed that the three creatures had suffered no damage and were devouring the five individuals as the rest retreated.</p>
<p><strong>01:44:11:</strong> The Captain leaves Wing H, arriving at the access entrance to Research Wing K along with the rest of Delta-2 Battalion. The wing was noticeably destroyed, with fresh bloodstains on the doors and foundations.</p>
<p><strong>01:52:45:</strong> Direct encounter with survivors of Delta-23 Battalion<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> as they open direct fire on a large entity. Estimated height: 5.8 m. The entity has a central cavity in its torso that houses a large mass of flesh; this mass emits rhythmic pulsations synchronized with the movement of nearby flesh masses.</p>
<p>Captain and Delta-2 Battalion join forces with Delta-23 Battalion to neutralize the entity.</p>
<p><strong>02:01:15:</strong> Creature neutralized thanks to the use of over 12 incendiary grenades and direct fire. The Captain's camera records 14 corpses killed during the confrontation with the entity: 9 members of Delta-2 Battalion and 3 members of Delta-23 Battalion.</p>
<p>The Captain continues to advance into the facilities, now accompanied by Delta-23 Battalion.</p>
<p><strong>02:31:11:</strong> As the Captain advanced toward the center of Wing K, she suddenly turned. The three entities reappeared, lunging at three members of Delta-2 Battalion and devouring them with bites in front of their comrades.</p>
<p>Battalions Delta-2 and Delta-23 withdraw several meters and begin firing directly at the entities.</p>
<p>One of the entities manages to pounce on the Captain. It can be seen that it bites her arm, and the Captain, with her free arm, manages to activate an incendiary grenade from her belt.</p>

Analysis of the recovered material, both from Captain Jane Sue's recordings and from those of other agents involved in the operation, confirms that the entities found within the facility are not conventional hostile organisms but functional Sarkic structures. Records from Delta-23 Battalion and some recovered from Delta-5 confirm the appearance of tears in the fabric of reality in areas near SCP-8342 in Wing K of the facility from which these entities began to emerge.</p>
<p>The entities demonstrated the ability to reconstitute themselves after partial neutralization, as well as their cooperative behavior during the event; it invalidates any containment protocol based solely on direct lethal force and necessitates a far more comprehensive logistical approach. The loss of the majority of Delta-2 Battalion, Delta-5 Battalion, and the remaining personnel involved in the operation will not be classified as an operational failure. The decision to continue advancing toward Wing K was tactical and necessary to confirm the true nature of the event.</p>
<p>As the operation leader and a senior officer of the Detachment, I strongly recommend the immediate suspension of all internal exploration operations during major astronomical events, regardless of their intended classification. Any future containment or investigation attempt must assume total personnel loss as the baseline scenario. Should this event recur, a perimeter must be established around the facilities to prevent entities from escaping beyond them. Additionally, I recommend changing and modifying the facility's construction plans to provide greater security for your personnel in the future.</p>
<p>I also formally recommend that SCP-8342 be treated, from this date forward, as an active, large-scale Sarkic ritual site, not as a passive anomalous structure.<br/>

In light of the events that occurred during December of last year, and considering the damage sustained by the facilities as well as the personnel losses associated with Incident 8342-32, it has been resolved to implement a comprehensive restructuring of the general security and compartmentalization systems at the containment facility dedicated to SCP-8342.</p>
<ol>
<li>As of the date of this notice, it is confirmed that a minimum of three armored isolation doors will be installed in the construction of all Wings, at strategic points previously defined by the Maintenance Department with the support of the facility's central management.</li>
<li>These doors will remain open by default, only becoming operational upon manual or automatic activation of the Smoke Detection System, controlled from the Central Operations Room.</li>
<li>System activation will enable the selective sealing of specific sectors of the facility where large-scale reality alterations are detected, with the aim of:
<ul>
<li>Limit and/or slow the spread of hostile entities generated by possible similar events in the future.</li>
<li>Facilitate the neutralization, containment, or isolation of such entities.</li>
<li>Ensure the availability of safe evacuation routes for personnel located in unaffected wings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All personnel are reminded that any unauthorized manipulation, blocking, or alteration of isolation systems will constitute a serious breach of safety protocols and will be sanctioned in accordance with the Foundation's current regulations.</p>
<p>The full implementation of these modifications will be considered a priority and will be subject to periodic inspections.<br/>
