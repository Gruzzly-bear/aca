<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9933 must continuously broadcast a signal to the SCiP-net relay every second. Under the <strong>2010 Austria Accords</strong>, this time signal is also relayed in real-time to all signatory Groups of Interest. As signal loss could be misinterpreted as a temporal destabilization event, the signal must reside on triple-redundant systems.</p>
<p>The central anomaly must be contained within its dedicated measurement apparatus at all times, supported by multiple independent backup power sources. The apparatus must maintain a stable connection to SCiP-net, even during transportation and field deployment.</p>
<p>As the sole authoritative reference for Foundation Standard Time, SCP-9933 is to be protected at all costs. Since concealing a device required to continuously transmit a signal is impossible, security teams must possess sufficient firepower to repel counterattacks<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. During deployment, it must be escorted by a sufficient number of Mobile Task Force units to counter all known Groups of Interest operating within the surrounding area<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Due to the inclusion of DELTA as a standard tool in field kits, Procedure 9933-ICARUS is to be conducted on a monthly schedule to replenish available units.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9933 is an extradimensional spatial anomaly that morphs its physical geometry<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> at a perfectly constant rate. Due to its design, it is immune to all known forms of time manipulation, including timeline resets or reality bending.</p>
<p>The anomaly is deterministic and follows an infinite series of unique<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> shapes. Every second, the monitoring array measures the anomaly's current shape and cross-references with where it appears on the pre-calculated sequence<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>. Using this and the constant rate of change, the computer can determine exactly how much time has elapsed.</p>
<p>Since this count cannot be altered by any reality benders, <strong>Foundation Standard Time (FST)</strong> is used by the anomalous community as the only objective method to measure time.</p>
<div class="project-container green">
<div class="project-inner inner-green">
<p>Human time is a headache. Between time zones, leap years, and daylight savings, it’s all circumstantial. Programmers fixed this with UNIX time: a single, growing number that counts seconds from a fixed point in 1970.</p>
<p>The anomalous world is worse. To a reality bender, 'Tuesday' is just an opinion. We need a clock that doesn't rely on regular physics. We need a number that keeps counting even when the universe won't.</p>
<p><em>- Excerpt from the Project EPOCH proposal</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Project EPOCH</span></h1>
<p>SCP-9933 was initially proposed by Director Maria Jones as a definitive record-keeping instrument for RAISA. After the O5 Council recognized its potential for tracking temporal anomalies, the project was approved.</p>
<p>Initial development with the Department of Esoteric Physics attempted to recreate the atomic clock, but with temporal shielding. However, despite theoretically shielding the atom from temporal anomalies, researchers could not establish a method for tracking elapsed time and therefore could not prove its success.</p>
<p>Without proof of progress and with increasing costs, Project EPOCH was under threat of cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Parker:</strong> Dr. Adrian Parker. I was interested in your Epoch project, but I think you need to pivot.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> Your clock relies on a repeating cycle. No matter how fast or slow, the atom always returned to the same states, so there was no way to tell how much time had passed between measurements. So, a magician can speed up time between measurements, but as long as it ends up in the same place again, you can't see anything different.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Yes, the project stalled due to that issue.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> Then you shouldn't use something that repeats. You need a deterministic mathematical anomaly that will never form any repeating pattern. That way, even if the magician speeds up time, it can <em>never</em> return to where it should be.</p>

<p>2D mathematical representation of the sequence. Note how no path is ever repeated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Adrian Parker joined the team and led the pivot toward the artificial creation of a mathematically irrational anomaly. Early stabilization attempts revealed issues arising from the anomaly’s higher-order dimensional structure, producing discontinuities when projected into three-dimensional space. These errors compounded over time, threatening long-term determinism.</p>
<p>Dr. Parker conducted an extended review of Foundation archives, surveying several thousand records related to dimensional projection anomalies. He subsequently conducted further research on <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-045" target="_blank">SCP-045</a>, examining its stability as a lower-dimensional projection of a higher-dimensional structure. From this, he derived a projection framework that eliminated cumulative error in SCP-9933’s morphic encoding.</p>
<p>Adoption of this framework proved instrumental, and Project EPOCH was completed in 2009. Subsequent analysis confirmed the sequence to be deterministic, allowing its forward progression to be reverse-engineered and pre-calculated. Backtracking the sequence, however, remained infeasible.</p>

<p>A petition by both Dr. Parker and the GOC to the Foundation Ethics Committee received no response. Dr. Parker then submitted additional requests to continue SCP-9933-related research and publish works unrelated to its creation.

<p>A section of the containment unit of SCP-9933 being transported for ICARUS experimentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the 2012 incident, the O5 Council declared a new goal of backtracking the sequence to get a more accurate analysis of previous time jumps. Dr. Parker was recruited back into a newly formed 9933 team and assigned to Project ICARUS to analyze SCP-9933 to find further uses and back-track the sequence.</p>
<p>In Experiment ICARUS-1508, the 9933 team successfully entangled the state of SCP-9933 into a sealed containment unit. Upon opening it and measuring, the state collapses to match "SCP-9933 Prime" at the moment of observation. By using the "collapsed" state, a computer can accurately determine exactly how much time has passed relative to the Foundation's baseline without requiring the original SCP-9933 instance. This was then compressed into a portable device called "Deviation from Epoch, Local Time Analyzer" (DELTA).</p>
<p>While DELTAs are pivotal for field agents to determine if they are subjected to localized temporal dilation, it has limitations. DELTAs are non-recoverable once activated and cannot be recalibrated or reused. Therefore, it can provide a one-time "check-in" but cannot continuously measure the fluctuations in reality. SCP-9933 itself is still transported to various anomalies to accurately analyze the temporal geometry.</p>
<div class="project-inner inner-yellow">
<p><em>Transcript from the ICARUS-1508 post-meeting</em></p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> The experiment worked, but it was risky. You came close to destabilizing SCP-9933. I need to be clear: its value is that it’s a stable clock.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> It’s not just a clock. It’s a <em>true</em> constant, more constant than the speed of light. I’m not pushing it for nothing. This is the first thing I’ve worked on that actually <em>matters</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Adrian, you have contributed to a groundbreaking project, much younger than most.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> But a much bigger name is attached to the project, <em>director</em>. Barely anyone’s even heard of me, and if they have, they just think I made a clock.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> That’s not how the Foundation sees it.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> Maybe. But history won’t. This is a bigger discovery than e, pi, or any other irrational number. Yet I’ll still end up buried in some secret file cabinet. Now I’m close to an even bigger thing. Closer than I’ll ever be to something like this again.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Using the anomaly like this isn’t relevant to recordkeeping.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> It never was for me.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> That’s not what you said when you approached me about EPOCH.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> I know. I lied. I needed an opening, and feigning interest was harmless enough to get me in.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> I appreciate the honesty, but RAISA is vital.</p>
<p><strong>Parker:</strong> Not to me. I don't care about filing. I cared about being attached to something that couldn’t be ignored. Something permanent. I was ready too, but those bureaucrats blocked it. Now I’m standing in front of <em>time itself</em>. I’m not letting it go again.</p>
</div>
<p>After many disagreements, a procedure for the creation of DELTA was approved by RAISA to be within acceptable safe limits. Procedure 9933-ICARUS has been added to the special containment procedures.</p>

<p><em>Transcript from the Project ICARUS Status Review</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Congratulations on Project ICARUS. It is a rare privilege to design a Foundation-made SCP that functions as intended without inadvertently destroying the world.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Thank you. As for the secondary objective-</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> No. ICARUS was successful. The project is being closed.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> What? Dr. Parker is still working on-</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> The project was a charade. We needed the team to give us leverage against the Coalition. Whether that leverage manifested as a usable tool or information about their cover-ups was irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Our intelligence indicates the GOC is approaching an independent implementation. I remember the degree of control orbital eigenweapons once afforded us. Now we possess control over the definition of time itself, and we cannot allow the Coalition to approach parity. With DELTA, we can convince the Coalition to drop its development in exchange for giving them access to the tools.</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> You’re reducing DELTA to a pawn. It has fundamentally altered field operations. The idea that any operative can see their time dilation is revolutionary.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> His work was always intended to be a pawn. We simply did not anticipate it being this effective. This Dr. Parker is intelligent, isn't he?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Yes, I believe all he wants is recognition. Your actions in 2010-</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> How is progress on the other objective?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Well, limited. Even though I provided RAISA supercomputers, we are basically brute-forcing guesses of temporal jumps with low confidence. We need more data on previous states.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Is that an issue of his capability, or of available technology?</p>
<p><strong>Jones:</strong> Technology.</p>
<p>*<em>O5-7 pauses</em>*</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> That is fixable. Finding the GOC cover-ups could be vital for future bargaining. Perhaps he can be made aware of our more classified technology.</p>

<div class="forum__post-content">
<p>We would like to acknowledge the success Dr. Parker has achieved with SCP-9933.</p>
<p>However, his OMPHALOS proposal is incredibly unethical. We are talking about a large sacrifice just to check our math. While our brute forcing attempts have been so far unsuccessful, that is simply the nature of brute forcing. It can be any day now that we will suddenly crack the code.</p>
<p>This has gone far from the goal of SCP-9933. If we are continuing with this, I will openly resign from the team.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>RAISA Director Maria Jones</p>

<p>Dr. Parker's research has concluded the infeasibility of brute forcing. We understand the controversy, but it is nonetheless your team's failure in brute-forcing that led to this as the only outcome.</p>

<h1 id="toc2"><span>Project OMPHALOS</span></h1>
<p>Due to early research into <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-palisade" target="_blank">Project ████████</a>, technology that can ██████████████████████ was made available to the 9933 team. Project OMPHALOS was initiated to use this technology to create 9933-Ω in which previous states of the SCP-9933 sequence could be directly observed. Dr. Parker claims that access to this historical data would enable the identification of temporal discrepancies resulting from anomalous activity or Groups of Interests.</p>
<p>The remaining team was relocated to Site-███ to use their technology to create 9933-Ω.</p>
<div class="project-inner inner-red">
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Phase I</span></h2>
<p>Phase I used ████████ and a temporal acceleration field derived from <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-155" target="_blank">SCP-155</a>, adapted by Dr. Parker to artificially advance the creation. Its history was initialized to begin exactly one year prior to our Foundation’s creation of SCP-9933. Through controlled intervention, they were guided to independently develop their own instance of SCP-9933.</p>
<p>Measurement of the simulated SCP-9933 concluded two things:</p>
<p>1. While the temporal field accelerated their entire reality by 400%, their SCP-9933's morphic rate remained the same as ours. The inhabitants perceived the morphic rate as normal, unknowingly defining their 'second' to match the accelerated timeframe. This confirms the rate as constant across all realities.</p>
<p>2. Due to more data and the relatively short sequence length, backtracking their sequence was trivial. This prompted the discovery that the sequence was not infinite but instead terminates at an "origin state", a zero point of the sequence. The total elapsed time since the origin state <em>perfectly</em> matched the total elapsed time of the simulated sub-reality.</p>
<p>With a new understanding of the start of the sequence, backtracking the sequence became feasible using Foundation Supercomputers.</p>

<p>The above document was extracted from a simulated Foundation in an artificial sub-reality created as part of our Project OMPHALOS.</p>
<p>Despite observing the psychological outcome of his simulated counterpart, Dr. Adrian Parker formally requested continuation into Phase II. He stated that every version of himself would understand his reasons and that he was willing, along with all others, to sacrifice himself for another version of himself.</p>
<p>However, the simulation's "Phase II Incident" prompted significant hesitation among our own 9933 team over measuring our reality's lifespan. The O5 Council is currently in deliberation.</p>
