<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The symbol used in the Foundation's expanded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA notation system</a> to transcribe SCP-3735</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3735</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation scanners must analyze phonetics blogs and popular online linguistic databases for any recordings with a sonic match for SCP-3735.</p>
<p>In any cases where an SCP-3735b-positive individual produces SCP-3735, MTF Mu-143 “Prescriptivists” is to be deployed to use class-B amnestics upon all surviving SCP-3735a-negative individuals who are exposed, contain all SCP-3735b-positive individuals present, and provide Standard Linguistic Cover Story 78 (Pirahã Malaria Strain) to family members and friends of deceased or contained individuals.</p>
<p>Any SCP-3735b-positive individuals contained are to be placed in Standard Humanoid Containment Units outfitted with full soundproofing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3735 is a cognitohazardous linguistic phone<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> determined by Foundation linguists to be a pharyngeal nasal. According to non-anomalous phonetic analysis, said sound is impossible for human beings to produce. Nevertheless, approximately 0.03% of humans are anomalously able to produce SCP-3735 (a condition henceforth designated SCP-3735a). In most cases, this ability never manifests itself and SCP-3735a-positive individuals live normal lives, albeit at a statistically significant higher risk for late-life hearing loss.</p>
<p>However, when SCP-3735a-positive individuals are exposed to SCP-3735, they have a 93% chance of developing the ability to produce SCP-3735, upon which their condition is reclassified as SCP-3735b. SCP-3735b-positive individuals feel a compulsion to repeatedly produce SCP-3735, developing in multiple stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage B1 (immediately after exposure): SCP-3735 immediately replaces all dorsal nasals in the affected individual’s phonetic inventory.</li>
<li>Stage B2 (1 week after exposure): Coronal nasals, dorsal approximants, and any and all laryngeal consonants are replaced.</li>
<li>Stage B3 (7 weeks after exposure): All nasals and approximants, as well as voiced coronal and dorsal fricatives, are replaced.</li>
<li>Stage B4 (5 months after exposure): All consonants other than labial plosives and unvoiced labial fricatives are replaced, as well as all back vowels.</li>
<li>Stage B5 (1 year after exposure): All phonemes are replaced with SCP-3735.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as Foundation linguists can determine, SCP-3735b is entirely unconscious and irreversible, whether by amnestics or by any other means. SCP-3735b-positive individuals can understand spoken language, and hear nothing abnormal about their own speech.</p>
<p>Upon being exposed to SCP-3735, SCP-3735a-negative individuals develop symptoms based on exposure time. These symptoms cease upon conclusion of exposure, and their effects can easily be removed from memory through use of class-B amnestics if concluded before reaching Stage A5.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage A1 (upon exposure): Mild headache</li>
<li>Stage A2 (thirty seconds of exposure): Throbbing headache, hyperventilation, a sensation of a “swollen tongue.”</li>
<li>Stage A3 (one minute of exposure): Sharp headache, difficulty breathing, overproduction of saliva, visible swelling of the tongue</li>
<li>Stage A4 (two minutes of exposure): Acute anaphylaxis</li>
<li>Stage A5 (three minutes of exposure): The pharynx and tongue [REDACTED], inevitably causing severe blood loss and expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> SCP-3735 was first identified in 2015, when an SCP-3735b-positive individual posted a recording of SCP-3735 in an online linguistics hobbyist group. Foundation online automated auditory memetic hazard scanners were triggered, and upon investigation by a Foundation linguist SCP-3735's anomalous properties were identified. The recording was deleted, SCP-3735a-negative listeners were treated and amnestized, and MTF Mu-143 “Prescriptivists” was deployed to contain the recording's originator, by the name of C██████ N████.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> C██████ N████, SCP-3735b-positive individual</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. I████ P███████, Foundation linguist</p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview was, except when <em>marked in italics</em>, conducted solely through written means, so as to prevent exposure to SCP-3735.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> I don't know what you are doing here, but it has got to be illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> This will go a lot easier for you if you cooperate, sir. When did you first develop the ability to produce a pharyngeal nasal sound?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> I have no idea what you're talking about!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> Are you aware of the fact that your phonetic inventory is abnormal?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> So that's a no, then. Okay. Have you noticed any odd reactions to your voice? Things you wouldn't have expected?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> For instance?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> Well, headaches, aches and pains, nosebleeds, difficulty breathing…</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> Well, I don't go out much – I'm not a very social person. Most of my time I spend on the Internet, and I can order food online – I work from home. The last time I tried to talk to someone, she left in, like, thirty seconds. She said she had a bad headache, and never came back. I think that was a pathetic excuse. What a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> Ah. So when was the most recent time you had a full conversation with someone?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> Why are you judging me for being antisocial? At least I work from home at a normal job, instead of at some sort of weird secret research facility.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> Again, it would be easier for both of us if you work with us. When was the most recent time you had a full conversation with someone?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> I guess it was about five months ago. An old friend from ████ High<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> called me. I don't know how he got my number, to be honest. But we talked for a few minutes until he abruptly hung up. Don't know why.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> Can you tell me this high school friend's name?</p>
<p><strong>C██████ N████:</strong> You know, I can't quite remember right now. It started with an N, I think. From Brazil<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>. Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. P███████:</strong> I'm afraid that won't be possible. <em>Security, put Mr. N████ here in a regular quiet box.</em> Sorry about this, sir.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> It seems clear from this interview that SCP-3735b-positive individuals are completely unaware of their condition. This could be a difficulty in maintaining containment.</p>

<p>As of 13 May 2018, reports have come in of a remote tribe in the Amazon Basin whose language makes regular use of SCP-3735, whose members show no signs of any of the effects of SCP-3735 exposure. This group has been tentatively assigned as GoI-3735. Connections to PoI-3735 are being investigated.</p>

<div class="footnote-footer" id="footnote-1"><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')">1</a>. In linguistics, a <em>phone</em> is defined as a distinct speech sound or gesture regardless of whether its exact sound is critical to the meaning of the word. This is distinct from a <em>phoneme</em>, which, if swapped with another phoneme, could alter the word's meaning. For instance, in English, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant#Allophonic">aspirated phones</a> are <em>allophonic</em> and do not alter the meaning of the word, whereas in Hindi aspirated phones are distinct phonemes.</div>
