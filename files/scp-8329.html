<p>Incident</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Cadavers attributed to SCP-8329 are to be preserved within on-site Foundation mortuaries. Associated objects are to be stored in adjacent item lockers following a brief post-recovery analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8329 is a manner of death in which an individual becomes subject to lethal amounts of external pressure without an apparent source.</p>
<p>Necessary criteria in the identification of SCP-8329 occurrences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of discernible methods of spontaneously and successfully applying such pressure by the victim themselves or an assumed perpetrator</li>
<li>Dismemberment of a portion or section of the body</li>
<li>The presence of an unorthodox object or objects, usually anomalous in nature, within the cadaver</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects retrieved from SCP-8329 cases have been designated SCP-8329-1.</p>
<p>SCP-8329 has yet to be directly observed in any form. All deaths have occurred in entirely isolated spaces, absent of potential witnesses or surveillance equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Following the first recorded observation of SCP-8329, a revision of this file is pending. See Addendum.8329.2 for details.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum.8329.1:</strong> Select Documented Occurrences</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Kirsten Pera, 67</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Woods near home, Corbu, Romania</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject found mutilated by immense pressure applied to chest. Thoracic cavity crushed and pried open.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieved Item:</strong> 12 paperboard cards were found within the chest cavity. Cards -1 through -11 depict Kirsten Pera performing a mundane activity within her home, including sleeping, cooking, or cleaning. Subject appears aware of a camera, staring head-on and smiling on each card. Card -12 contains a sheet of 11 stickers depicting the subject's face expressing terror.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Angelina Eugen, 34</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Lux Apartments, New York City, New York</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject found completely eviscerated, with object large enough to disrupt composition of entirety of the body’s frontal features.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieved Item:</strong> A plastic combination puzzle in the shape of the subject, 1:1 scale, was found sitting directly atop the viscera. Attempts to successfully solve pending.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Isiah Christopher, 62</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Bathroom stall at “Skull Bar”, Moros, Spain</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject found dismembered and pulled apart lengthwise, presumably from the legs outwards.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieved Item:</strong> The body of a stingray, heavily modified in the style of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Haniver">"Jenny Hanniver"</a>, was retrieved from the subject’s intestines. When placed in water, the object exhibits properties of a living creature until removed and dried. Behavior observed while ”active” is consistent with an aquatic animal experiencing extreme distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Lukas Mooni, 29</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Subject’s Home, Balau, Germany</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject found decapitated; analysis of neck and throat show forceful, swift rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieved Item:</strong> A miniature, plastic model of the subject's house was removed from the larynx. The interior of the object has been examined, and found to be wholly accurate to Mooni's house at the moment of the corpse's discovery. Features include functioning utilities, such as a power system and running water, as well as a replica of the subject's damaged corpse. Examination of the miniature corpse has found a smaller model of the house within the miniature larynx, exact in its features. At present, Foundation analysis has found 837 increasingly smaller iterations of this object, recurring within one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Lidia Rolands, 40</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Subject’s Home, Malibu, California</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject found flattened, with resultant pressure squeezing innards through orifices.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieved Item:</strong> Approximately 3,300 toy marbles were retrieved from the body. Cross-section analysis has revealed the subject's internal organs, tissue, and musculature present within the objects. Organs respond to stimuli despite inadequate functional support. State of consciousness indeterminate.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum.8329.2:</strong> Intercepted Footage</p>
<p>On 2025/6/12, a video depicting an SCP-8329 event began circulating on social media app <em>TikTok</em>. Foundation Webcrawlers flagged the instance and successful coverup was carried out within hours.</p>
<p>A transcript of the video has been provided below.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><em>A man, later identified as Emil Lewandowski, 32, is seen from above. He stands at his stove, apparently unaware of any recording presence.</em></p>
<p><em>Synthetic speech, the voice of a nondescript, adult woman, is played over the clip. Subtitles in a large, yellow font concurrently transcribe the audio.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Wow, another ‘Prize People’.</p>
<p><em>A cut in the video. Lewandowski is shown head on, still apparently unaware. He continues to cook, stirring a pot. This action is edited as a sped-up shot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> What ‘Prize’ is inside the ‘People’?</p>
<p><em>Another cut, now depicting the subject from behind. Two massive, black tentacles slide into view from offscreen, picking up the subject with ease. Lewandowski screams, struggles, and finally faints when manipulated to face the ‘camera’.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Guys, a ‘Prize People’. Where is the ‘Prize’?</p>
<p><em>Cut. The tentacles are flaying Lewandowski, peeling the subject at the eyelid and pulling to the back of the leg. This process is edited, sped-up for brevity, and continues until Lewandowski is entirely flayed. The sounds of skin peeling are edited to be heard as the forefront of the audio track.</em></p>
<p><em>The tentacles manhandle Lewandowski’s corpse, shaking and twirling it around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> ‘Prize People’! But no 'Prize'?</p>
<p><em>The tentacles compress Lewandowski’s head in the direction of his feet, grinding the corpse’s bones and damaging its innards. A stock sound effect of a crowd clapping is edited over the footage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Let’s find out! ‘Prize People’!</p>
<p><em>Cut. Lewandowski is held sideways and pulled. The body comes apart with ease, pouring the crumbled effluvia over the apartment floor. A small, plastic can falls out of the subject’s midsection.</em></p>
<p><em>Cut. The tentacle picks up the can, opens it, and reveals a viscous, oozing material, green and white in coloration. The tentacles stretch and pull at the material, playing with it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Wow, guys! Look at the 'Prize'!</p>
<p><em>Cut. The tentacle places the liquid back in the can, which is in turn placed in Lewandowski’s torso. A tentacle waves.</em></p>
<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Bye, guys! Let’s find more ‘Prize’!</p>
</div>
<p>After successful containment of the video and identification of the subject, a team was dispatched to their home in Kraków, Poland. Recovered evidence was consistent with footage. A small, plastic can of viscous material, green and white in coloration, was found within the body. Chemical analysis found little to no difference from ordinary, store-bought “slime” toys. Object screams when manipulated.</p>
