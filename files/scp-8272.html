<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8272 is to be kept in a standard storage locker within Site-898's Containment Wing. Upon request, it may be utilized by Site-898 staff for field usage, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8272 is a <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8987">RUNS RED anomaly</a> recovered from the Red Brook Mine on 23/08/2011. It was one of several anomalies resulting from a magnitude 5.8 earthquake that originated in central Virginia, but would be felt in Pennsylvania and Site-898 by proxy. It is a 91.5 cm cane carved from oak, with the steel head of a dragon attached to its handle. A steel ring sits underneath the handle, and is composed of multiple bands of entwined metal. The manner in which the metal has been shaped appears similar to symbols found on various spellcasting focuses.</p>
<p>SCP-8272 is a thaumaturgical tool, specifically one tuned to leylines.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> When near a leyline, the eyes of the dragon's head on SCP-8272 will glow at a level that increases with said proximity — turning from white to blue once in direct "contact". Additionally, it can be used as a thaumaturgical focus, and can siphon off leylines as an EVE<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> source when activated in one's direct proximity. This enables even non-thaumaturges to utilize it for spellcasting. Spells that can be channeled through SCP-8272 appear to be strictly limited to geological ones.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Activation of SCP-8272's thaumaturgical properties requires the speaking of the word "Asterom," discovered via the word's engraving upon the wood of the anomaly.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/09/2011</p>
<p><strong>Individuals Present:</strong> Dr. Sarah Lindsey,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> Dr. Ezra Delvaux<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, Dr. Erwin Soch, Rsr. Dino Draws, Rsr. Bernice Older<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following is the first of several field tests led by Dr. Lindsey utilizing SCP-8272. The testing was chiefly impromptu, and Dr. Lindsey gathered several personnel to accompany her in search for any possible leylines in the environment around Site-898.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey is leading the group through thick brush and laurels. She is holding SCP-8272 and using it to hit aside brush that gets in her path. Dr. Soch, directly behind her, is occasionally hit by a branch as the group moves, though he makes no audible complaint. Dr. Delvaux is muttering quietly and occasionally glancing at a map in their hands, or the compass held by Rsr. Older as she trots next to them. Rsr. Draws is in the back of the group.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Alrighty, so this trip is gonna be a little more loosey-goosey. Who's got the map?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux raises his map, still muttering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Have you been counting your paces?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> <em>Cent cinquante-quatre, cent cinquante-huh?</em> Oh. 156 Northwest from the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Damn, you're good. Keep it up, 'cause if 8272 hits something out here, we need to know where.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux nods, and continues counting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> You do realize I have a GPS, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Won't have one everywhere! Satellite reception out here is a mess, anyhow. It's good practice for when coordinates may not be applicable.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws picks up fir pace slightly to catch up with the group.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Like other dimensions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Exactly! Your GPS would go haywire if you stepped out of baseline.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch sighs, then grunts as he pulls himself over a log in their path. Dr. Lindsey continues forward as the rest of the group follows suit. Rsr. Draws scrambles up and over.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Are we going to be exploring the swamp, or Dutch Mountain?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> I'm feeling like I want to keep my boots dry, so we can check the mountain first and work our way down. That sound good?</p>
<p><em>There is murmur of agreement amongst those present; Rsr. Draws nods.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey adjusts the direction she's heading in, and the group can see Dutch Mountain's slopes through the brush. Site-898 is already close to its base.</em></p>
<p><em>They continue to travel through the woods, stepping over mossy rocks and the occasional wild blueberry bush. Rsr. Older snags a few off the branch as they pass and pops one into her mouth with a hum. They get out of the thicker brush, and the ground begins to slope more heavily. Dr. Delvaux pauses to squint.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Have people been here before? Looks like there's a switchback on that slope.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Oh absolutely. This mountain is no stranger to us poking around, and if it wasn't us, it was from back when the mine was in operation or something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Makes climbing a tad easier for us, regardless.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Yup! Never stop watching your steps though, still a bit steep.</p>
<p><em>The group slips up the switchback; Rsr. Draws braces firself on a small tree as fi climbs. Dr. Delvaux mutters a few swears to themselves as they try to reconcile their counting with the zig-zag manner the group is walking in.</em></p>
<p><em>The switchback leads up to an old, partially overgrown trail. Dr. Lindsey puts a hand on her hip, and briefly removes SCP-8272 from under her elbow to squint at its head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Nothing yet. Anyone else want a turn holding this?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I can.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey nods, and she passes SCP-8272 to Rsr. Draws. Fi takes it by the middle, and holds it down at fir side as the group resumes walking. Dr. Delvaux marks the switchback and their arrival to the trail on his map, and resumes counting.</em></p>
<p><em>The group continues along the trail as it winds through the wooded slope of the mountain. It starts out level, but gradually begins to increase in steepness.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch glances back, noticing that Rsr. Draws has lagged behind slightly as the group climbs up the incline. When fi notices him watching, fi flashes a thumbs up and tries to pick up fir pace once more.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey hops up onto an outcropped boulder, puts a hand on her hip, and surveys the field.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Brush is a little thick on the left, so let's keep heading right.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws catches back up with the group, but seems winded. Rsr. Older waves at fir, and fi waves back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Heya!</p>
<p><em>Fi walks over to her with a smile, and peers at her compass as they walk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh shit, they let you have one of the fancy ones. It's got the little levels in it and everything! That's sick.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> I know right! Maybe we'll get to use it. You think leylines have strike and dip? Like, that they're not just flat down and are at angles?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Be interesting if they did!</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Could you measure something that's like… metaphysical? Leylines aren't visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> We could use 8272. <em>[Fi holds it up.]</em> Maybe it's <em>super</em> tuned to leylines, and we can like… lay it along the line.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older snickers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Measuring stick.</p>
<p><em>The two giggle, before returning their focus to walking. Dr. Delvaux is engrossed in mapping their path, still quietly muttering to himself as they keep count of the steps taken.</em></p>
<p><em>As the group continues on the mountain trail, Dr. Soch purposefully slows to walk next to Rsr. Draws. Fi is turning SCP-8272 over in fir claws as fi walks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Are you doing alright?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Huh? I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I've noticed you've lagged behind a few times. You've been having difficulty on the slopes.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh, that. Uh — my balance isn't good. Kinda hard when things get steep, I guess?</p>
<p><em>Fi shrugs, though sounds confused.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> You should start giving shouts, so that you don't get left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Don't wanna slow everyone down.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch tilts his head, but the two's attention is drawn when they notice the rest of the group has stopped.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> <em>[She chuckles]</em> Dear, it's no trouble to slow down. This isn't any rush.</p>
<p><em>Rrs. Draws glances away. Dr. Lindsey elects to change topics.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Has 8272 picked up anything yet?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws turns SCP-8272 so that fi can look at its decorative head once more. The eyes have a very faint white glow. Fi perks up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh! Hey, it's faint! That means something, right?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey grins and claps her hands together.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Wonderful! How about you take the lead, and start waving that puppy around so we can zone in?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey smiles and gestures vaguely to the mountain around them. Rsr. Draws perks up at the prospect of leading. After a few moments of glancing around, fi begins to move forward — keeping SCP-8272 in fir view as to watch the eyes. Rsr. Draws begins to lead the way.</em></p>
<p><em>Fi leads the group on a bit of a winding path that eventually causes them to break off from the trail they'd been walking on, and through heavier tree cover. For about five minutes they walk through an old deer trail that cuts through some of the thicker bushes.</em></p>
<p><em>It leads them to standing before a slope too steep to climb in most spots. A large outcrop sticks up from the mountainous earth. Its geological layers are near vertical, in stark contrast to the horizontal layers exposed on the slope a few meters away.</em></p>
<p><em>The white glow from SCP-8272 morphs into a brilliant blue. Rsr. Draws grins, and stamps a foot on the ground with a hearty thunk.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> <em>Ow—</em> it's blue! It's here.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey looks up at the outcrop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Oh, now I haven't seen this little spot before! Look at this beaut of an unconformity! Draws, can I see 8272? Let's try to map our little friend out.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws has been holding SCP-8272 by its handle. Fi passes it to Dr. Lindsey, who takes it and begins to pace the area. Rsr. Draws sits down on the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch crouches next to fir, and the two watch Dr. Lindsey walk along with SCP-8272 extended while Dr. Delvaux maps her path as they determine where the leyline lies. They are laying down small colored flags and string to mark it. Rsr. Older has slipped to the side in order to examine the surrounding area.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Draws, I think we should schedule something, when this expedition is done.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws removes a small, yellow field notebook from fir hip and clicks open a pen. Fi starts to diagram the outcrop. Fi pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Wait, huh? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> A medical appointment. Examination, primarily. It would not take much of your time.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I don't think you should be struggling as much as you seemed to in the field. I want to see if there's anything wrong.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws stiffens, fi furrows fir brow. Fi's quiet for a few long moments.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> It does, um, hurt a little.</p>
<p><em>Fi's lowered fir voice, sounding confused.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I don't know why.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Then I can do an examination when we return. Would you like that?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws inhales, exhales. Fi nods at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Alright.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Good, good.</p>
<p><em>He pauses, almost awkwardly, his eyes gazing to the outcrop. Rsr. Draws pushes firself up, which seems to require significant effort. Fi trots over to Rsr. Older.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Benny! What do you think we're looking at?</p>
</div>
<div class="medic">
<p><em>Dr. Soch tilts his head as he drums a finger against his clipboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> What do you mean? I meant like, <em>[He makes a gesture]</em> at what point during the expedition?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws' ears twitch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh, oh! Uh — probably once we were halfway there? Started aching.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Where? Can you show me?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws adjusts fir sitting position, before placing a claw against fir ankle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Right here. Guess the interior of the ankle? Not like, not like <em>inside</em> but, you know —</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Yeah, yeah I do.</p>
<p><em>He pushes himself up and out of his chair, before walking over to open the door of the medical room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Can you walk down the hall for me? Just to the end, then come back. I want to see your gait on flat ground.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh! Okay, yeah. Yeah, I can do that.</p>
<p><em>Fi hops off the table and slips out the door.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch watches as Rsr. Draws walks down the hall. Fir feet are pivoted slightly inwards, ankles turned. The way fi walks seems somewhat unsteadily. It prompts the doctor to furrow his brow as Rsr. Draws returns back to him. The expression makes fir hesitate slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Alright, let's sit back down. I'm going to take some measurements of mobility.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws tilts fir head as fi does so.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> How do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> With the medical equivalent to a protractor, essentially. I'll test both ankles.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws nods at him, and has since sat back down on the examination table. Fir limbs are tucked in close.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I'm going to be applying pressure against your joints, I want you to push back against me as hard as you can each time, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Yes sir.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch has Rsr. Draws pivot fir ankles in a variety of directions — measuring with the protractor how far fi can turn them or tip them back. Fi seems to struggle, throughout the process, when it comes to pulling back or forward.</em></p>
<p><em>He sits back in his chair, and writes on his clipboard for roughly a minute, as Rsr. Draws straightens back up. Fi shifts, nervous.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> You're looking at what seems to be a 45% disability in the left foot, and 33% in the right.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Didn't know you could have a percentage on that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Well, it's what your range of motion is compared to what it should be.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh. That… makes sense.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch's pager beeps, and he glances down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> X-rays finally printed. One moment.</p>
<p><em>He stands and exits the room. Rsr. Draws watches him as he leaves, silent.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few moments fi frowns and pulls fir knees up to fir chest. Rsr. Draws exhales heavily.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I… how did I not…</p>
<p><em>Fi trails off into silence, and buries fir head in fir hands with a whine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> <em>Twenty years?</em></p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws remains in this position for two minutes before Dr. Soch returns. He has a manila folder tucked under his arm. Rsr. Draws raises fir head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> It looks like a cut-and-dry diagnosis.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws raises fir head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch removes some printed X-rays from the folder, and spreads them out on the table. Rsr. Draws canes fir neck to look.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> With the cross referencing I've done between you and other data on Droganians the Foundation has on file, it's likely a dysfunction in your posterior tibia tendon. It runs along your ankle. <em>[He taps the corresponding part on the X-ray]</em> Judging by your mobility and bones, it's completely broken down. You have no arch, claws are flat on the ground when the inner back portion should be raised slightly.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws stares at the X-ray.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Is that why it hurts?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Essentially. Your body isn't built to stand like that, your Achilles tendon has never been properly stretched. It's too tight, and you've lost a lot of mobility as a result between the two tendons.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws makes a quiet sound, eyes widened. Fir breathing has picked up. It makes Dr. Soch pause, awkwardly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> …Are you alright?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws shakes out fir head and looks away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Sorry. I'm sorry. <em>[Fi sniffles, rubs fir face]</em> I… I just should've noticed this. It's <em>always</em> hurt. Even when I was little.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Did you never tell anyone?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws shakes fir head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I guess I just thought it was like that for everyone. That everyone started to hurt when going up the stairs. That everyone's feet ached really bad when they stood and waited for more than a few minutes. But it's not.</p>
<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> No. It isn't.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> So I didn't have to be hurting all this time. If someone else had just bothered to <em>look.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch frowns at the sudden bitterness. He picks up his clip board, clears his throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I want you to start physical therapy. It won't fully assuage everything, but it can improve your flexibility. I can set up some scheduling and we can move forward from there. It's just the room next over, medical wing's quite small.</p>
<p><em>He pauses.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Is that alright?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws is scowling at the ground, now. Fir claws grip the examination table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 06/09/2011<br/>
<strong>Individuals Present:</strong> Dr. Sarah Lindsey, Dr. Ezra Delvaux, Dr. Erwin Soch, Rsr. Dino Draws, Rsr. Bernice Older<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> The second expedition relating to the study of leylines around Site-898. Dr. Lindsey and her team returned to the previously marked location for a more in-depth analysis.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Footage begins 40 minutes into recording.</em></p>
<p><em>The team is re-approaching the location of interest, the outcrop visible through the foliage as they climb. Dr. Lindsey trots up ahead, and pushes through the brush to get to the gap in the trees. There is a series of small wires and flags around the formation, having been placed during the previous expedition to mark the leyline.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> There she is! Y'all alive back there?</p>
<p><em>She turns and calls this over her shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Yup.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older gives a thumbs up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Muddy. Otherwise fine.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Alive!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> You sure this is good for you, Draws? Don't want you getting hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Soch said that exercise and getting out and about is good, just as long as I don't push myself too hard. And, well, I'm either walking around the Site or walking around here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I did say this.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Wonderful! I did bring you a chair though, so you're not having to sit in the mud the whole time.</p>
<p><em>She gestures to a brightly colored beach chair she's been carrying on her back. Rsr. Draws gives her a genuine smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Aw— thanks, ma'am. I was wondering what was up with the beach chair.</p>
<p><em>Fi gives a little chuckle, as Dr. Lindsey hands fir the chair so fi can unfold it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> I really gotta get to a beach again. There are downsides to being in a landlocked state.</p>
<p><em>The group heads over to the outcrop, and the wires already set up. Dr. Lindsey is holding SCP-8272.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> I see that as an upside.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Not a water person?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Absolutely not.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older gives a laugh. Rsr. Draws sets up the chair and sits down, before fi takes out fir field notebook and turns back to the pages from the previous expedition.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Alright, alright — can someone recap on the outcrop?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Interbedded layers of slate and quartzite.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Which means we're looking at some heavy metamorphism!</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Of which checks out for being right on a mountain. It was probably some other event that led to the unconformity, though. Different tectonics.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux puts a hand on his hip. They're walking along the wire that indicates where the leyline is.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> I do find it interesting the line here appears to have a dip of some type. Though I'm not sure if it's measurable.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Detection terminates at the base of the outcrop, but also terminates a few meters in the other direction. 6.8 meters I believe was the measurement. I was under the assumption leylines were continuous.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> If there <em>is</em> a dip, then perhaps it still is. There must be some rhyme and reason for how their placement operates.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> If we're trying to see if there's any sort of correlation between the leylines and anything here — hold on a sec.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older clambers over to the base of the outcrop, tracing a hand along its surface. She pauses at a specific spot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Outside of just the unconformity, there's a fault here too. Splits riiight along here — there's slickenlines inside it.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Good eye, Bernice!</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws squints up at the outcrop, tracing fir eyes along the fault that splits it. Fi pushes firself up with a grunt, and trots over to Rsr. Older. The two glance at one another, then down at the fault.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> …is it..? Hey! Dr. Lindsey, can we see 8272?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey tilts her head, walks over to the two and extends SCP-8272. Rsr. Draws takes it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Care to share with the class, kids?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Hold on. The tree gap means I can get up there —</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws spreads fir wings, and bursts into the air. The action makes Dr. Lindsey jump slightly. Fi flies up to the top of the outcrop, and scrabbles up on top of it. Fi briefly uses SCP-8272 to push firself back up to standing, before lifting it back up as fi peers at it. Then, fi leans over the edge and calls out.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> It's still blue. The leyline <em>continues</em> up through here. Along the fault! I can see some of its surface along the top part here, it continues through the rock and across the back up here.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older gasps, as Rsr. Draws hops back down. Fi briefly leans on SCP-8272 again, before returning to the chair to sit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> They're correlated!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> What a fascinating chicken or the egg we've stumbled across.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Mm?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey circles one of the flags marking the leyline.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> If there truly is a correlation between some faultlines and leylines, then either leylines can cause faulting, or faults can cause leylines. Or there's a separate thing, that we are perhaps missing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> We don't want to out rule coincidence, but this is intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> We should get the strike and dip of the fault. It may show us where the rest of the leyline is — we can look for more features.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Maybe even follow it up. <em>[Fi points up the mountain, towards where fi had flown up to]</em> I saw some spots that look climbable, if we loop around.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey claps her hands together.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Wonderful! Bernice, do you still have your Brunton?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older unclips a heavy compass from her belt. Dr. Soch has since leaned against the outcrop to watch the group.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Right here, ma'am!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Go at 'em!</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older perks up and nods, and she trots over to the fault that splits the outcrop. Rsr. Draws pulls fir chair up closer so that fi can write down the values the other junior researcher produces. Dr. Lindsey and Delvaux approach as well to aid in double-checking.</em></p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older positions her compass against the fault surface, and watches the levels.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> …Looks like 68 degrees Southeast for the strike, aaaannddd…</p>
<p><em>She swaps the position, and positions a second level within the compass — watching for the air bubble inside to center as she moves it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Dipping 50 degrees Northwest.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws nods, as fi writes this down within fir field notebook. Fi's tucked SCP-8272 under fir arm.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux briefly re-takes the measurements to check their accuracy, then nods as their gaze trails upwards along the outcrop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> That angle is likely doable for the slopes next to this, we may find more if we push upwards.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey grins.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Then our work is cut out for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="medic">
<p><em>The secondary medical room is small. It is made for patient recovery. There are objects utilized for physical therapy: various balance boards, mats and a single stationary exercise bike that lay in the corner.</em></p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws sits on a half-reclined chair, holding a paper in fir claws. Upon it are printed instructions for physical therapy procedures. Fi is reading and re-reading it over and over.</em></p>
<p><em>Fir ears perk up when the door opens, though seems surprised when Dr. Rudy Weller<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> enters the room with a huff. When he removes his shoes, the prosthesis that replaces his right leg clacks against the floor. He glances over, and casually remarks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/amnesia-was-fir-name">Oh, hey. You.</a></p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws stares for a moment, as the man walks over to sit in one of the other chairs. Fi shakes out fir head and looks away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Hi. Um — I'm waiting for Dr. Soch. Do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Eh, probably lollygagging or nose deep in something else. He'll be by eventually.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller grunts loudly and stretches. He braces a hand on his right knee and kicks his prosthesis in the air idly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> What'cha here for, kid?</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws hesitates at first.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> There's something wrong with my ankles.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Ah, PT then?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Physical therapy, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> You don't sound too happy about that.</p>
<p><em>A pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> If ya don't mind me prying.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws frowns, glances away.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I wasn't expecting to need this. I wasn't expecting… any of this.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller tilts his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Got a surprise diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> …Yeah. Dr. Soch saw me struggling during a field expedition and said I should make an appointment. So I did and…</p>
<p><em>Fi curls up slightly. Rsr. Draws rubs fir hand against fir forehead with an exhalation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rrs. Draws:</strong> I'm — I'm glad this is happening, I really am! Now I know that it wasn't just me being <em>slow</em> or weak.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> But?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I'm just… frustrated? I'm frustrated. I've spent all this time hurting when I didn't <em>have to.</em> And for what? To what ends? There's been something wrong with me, and I'm only now just being told.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller seems caught off guard. He sits up a bit straighter, and turns to face Rsr. Draws. His expression softens.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Doesn't all have to be for a reason, kid. Sometimes things just happen. Accidents, 'n all that.</p>
<p><strong>Rrs. Draws:</strong> But that means it was for nothing. And all of it was just… hurt. For years.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> <em>[He huffs]</em> I'd take 'just hurt' over any time someone tries to peddle pain as righteous.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws quiets down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Bah! You're fine. You've been thrown out of a frying pan and into the fire, it seems. Probably didn't feel good.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Didn't, yeah. <em>[Fi rubs the side of fir face.]</em> I guess it just made me feel like an idiot. For not saying anything until <em>someone else</em> saw. For not even stopping to consider it was a problem. I probably seem stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Who was the doctor that ya spoke to? Soch?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Well, Soch's 'bout as emotionally constipated as an abatement pipe, and has all the serenity of a fuckin' serial killer, so I doubt it was any better a feeling to get his verdict.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> …He gave me a percentage.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller winces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Whelp, that sounds like 'im alright. But what I'm trying to get at here is that you don't have to feel stupid for not realizing. Sometimes people just go about life thinking one way instead of the other. Sometimes its harmless, sometimes it isn't. Ain't your fault that no one taught you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I guess. I just… I don’t know what it all means for me. I — I love doing field work, being outside, and exploring. What if this affects my ability to do it? It already has.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Well, alright, I don’t think I can help you there. Only so much half-shoddy advice one old man can give. <em>[He chuckles]</em> You’re likely the best judge for what you can and can’t do, but don’t go jumping the gun just yet. You haven’t gotten any help for this.</p>
<p><em>He pauses briefly to stretch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> You came because you want to get help, so you’re making a first step.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Sorry—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Don’t gotta keep apologizing.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I know I just… shouldn’t be dumping this all out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Well it’s either me hearing it or Soch hearing it, and that man's got the bedside manner of a mortician. He may have a medical degree, but you know what I got?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> What?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller raises his right leg so Rsr. Draws can see his prosthesis.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Experience!</p>
<p><em>He pushes himself off the chair with a loud grunt, and walks over to the exercise bike in the room's corner. Rsr. Draws opens and closes fir mouth, then looks down. After a few moments, fir gaze lingers at towards the room's door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Is Dr. Soch the only physician? I haven't seen any other medical staff.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller climbs onto the exercise bike, taps a few buttons on its small screen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Oh, absolutely. We've got, like, four doctors tops, and a med evac copter for that reason. There used to be a fella before Soch transferred in from 17 who did my PT, but he retired years ago. And as much as I rag on Soch, it’s all good fun. He does his job. He’s a medical doctor, not a therapist. I’m a yapper, and neither of those.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> How long have… <em>[Fi pauses, looks away]</em> actually, never mind.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Mm?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Nothing. Rude to ask.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Kid, we're both here for therapy. I started askin' questions bout you first anyhow, so it's fair trade in my eye. Story for a story, we're in the same boat 'ere.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws hesitates, then awkwardly gestures to Dr. Weller.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> How long ago?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller leans back on the exercise bike, now pedaling idly as he starts to speak.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Ah, since the 70s? Was part of the Site’s MTF once upon a time, and we were working to wrangle something that’d come crawling out of the mine after an earthquake. Second shock from the quake brought one of the tunnels down, I got caught in the collapse. Crushed everything below my knee, big ol’ sharp piece of stone damn near cut me clean.</p>
<p><em>Rsr Draws winces.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Yeah. Hurt like a bitch, hurt more when my team had to cut it the rest of the way off to get me out. Got dragged back topside, they staunched it the best they could, and fired up one of the helicopters to take me somewhere better equipped. I was on medical leave from the MTF for about two years before I was good enough to return.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> You went back to work? Even after all that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Yup. Loved that job, ‘n life moves on. I was still young and stir crazy back then — wanted to keep helping. The MTF was half containment team, half search and rescue. I came back figuring, “Well, I got some rescue experience outta that!”</p>
<p><em>He laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Grim way of looking at it, maybe, but it works for me. I wasn’t able to go back to doing everything I was before, though. I took more a role of leading, left a lot of the running around to the rest of the team. It was a bit hard to accept that at first, but ey growing old is sorta the same principle. You aren’t gonna be in the same shape now as you were in high school, yadda yadda, shit changes. Take it from an old man.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> …Makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Now I know that may be a little disappointing for you to hear, but eeeehhhh. Shit happens. So what if you’re not gonna be able to do field work the same as other folks? No shame there.</p>
<p><em>He waves a hand in the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> On the plus side, I got some say in designing this.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller reaches down and taps his prosthetic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Got two, actually! One for mingling round the Site, a second for more active field work if I gotta be quicker on my feet.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws nods again, fi smiles a little.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Once you get some proper accommodation kid, I’m sure you’ll feel at least a little better.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> It’s never a one-and-done fix, but I’m sure the docs here will be able to find something that can further help ya — outside just PT.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Have you been doing physical therapy ever like… since then? That's a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> I mean, <em>teeeechnically</em> I don't gotta, but it's good practice to keep up with this sorta thing to keep your muscles good. So don't follow my example, I'm a god damn slacker.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> And well, this site doesn't got a gym. But we <em>do</em> got this puppy.</p>
<p><em>He taps the exercise bike with a snicker.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> So I drop by.</p>
<p><em>Rrs. Draws considers this for a few moments, before smiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Doesn't sound too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> It ain't! You'll definitely liven things up in here, won't be just me and Soch occasionally buttin' heads over shit.</p>
<p><em>He laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> A referee, finally!</p>
<p><em>The joke prompts Rsr. Draws to laugh along with him, before Dr. Soch re-enters the room. This startles Rsr. Draws, and Dr. Weller simply gives a nod in acknowledgement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Are you finally going to stop skipping appointments, Weller?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Bah! Maybe. If only to try 'n set a better example.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> You trying to set any example is a frightening prospect, but that is good to hear.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Weller mock-scowls at Dr. Soch, prompting Rsr. Draws to chuckle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Apologies for the delay, Researcher Draws. Had another patient. Have you been reading the printout?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Yeah! I did. These don't seem too hard.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch nods. He walks over to a small desk in the room and sifts through them. Dr. Weller has began to pedal more readily on the exercise bike.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Feel free to begin, following those. If you need aid, say so.</p>
<p><em>A brief pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I have another thing to discuss with you, as well.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws adjusts fir position on the reclined chair and picks up a set of resistance bands. Fi braces fir feet against them, and leans back, as fi looks over at Soch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Oh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> In terms of accommodation and aid, typically your condition can be aided via orthopedic inserts or braces. With your physiology, I believe braces would be the ideal choice for you.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> <em>[Fi chuckles]</em> Yeah, I can't exactly wear sneakers. What would getting braces mean?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> A quick session of me taking a cast so they can be custom made, and it would take a week or so for them to come in. The braces would elevate your arch properly, and hold your ankles in proper position. It will decrease some mobility in that aspect, but should alleviate pain. A trade-off, if you are willing to accept.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Weller:</strong> Could prolly get'cha something to help with that mobility thing, if needed.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws perks up, and smiles. Fi looks relieved.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I think that's a trade-off I can work with.</p>

<strong>Individuals Present:</strong> Dr. Sarah Lindsey, Dr. Ezra Delvaux, Dr. Erwin Soch, Rsr. Dino Draws, Rsr. Bernice Older<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> Conducted a few weeks after the second expedition due to weather complications. Dr. Lindsey re-gathered the same small team for a return to the location of interest with SCP-8272 to search for anything that previous trips might have missed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Footage begins roughly 45 minutes into the recording.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent rain has made the slopes muddy. The team is all aiding one another up the slope, as they attempt to climb past the original location of interest to follow the fault plane. Dr. Lindsey has a hand braced against Dr. Delvaux's back as he grips a tree trunk to pull them up. Dr. Soch watches the group, having decided to take the rear. Rsr. Draws has a set of leather braces around fir ankles. Rsr. Older offers her hand to help pull fir up the slope.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> I see some larger rocks further up, those'll be better — <em>achk</em> — better for our footing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Oh thank goodness!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux is able to continue upwards, and each member of the team follows his path — utilizing the slim tree as a grip for balance.</em></p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws grips the tree, and shakily stands against it. Fi appears to hesitate for a moment, feet scrabbling against the slope. Rsr. Older glances over her shoulder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> You need help?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Yeah, yeah — wait. Dr. Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Mm?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Can I see 8272?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey tilts her head, before realizing what fi means, and nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Oh! That ain't a bad idea. Multipurpose!</p>
<p><em>She passes SCP-8272 to Rsr. Older so that Rsr. Draws can take it.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few moments of gripping the tree, Rsr. Draws takes SCP-8272 by its handle. Fi braces the cane against the slope and uses it to push firself up. Dr. Soch watches fir continue to use the anomaly as he too pulls himself up behind fir.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I can hand it back once we're up.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Nah, you've been doin' a good job using it on the past few trips. Plus, I gotta lay out more measurements and flags once we get up and re-find the fault, which will need my own hands free.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws ducks fir head in a nod.</em></p>
<p><em>The team is able to proceed without much incident — outside of Dr. Soch and Rsr. Draws slipping, and Dr. Delvaux tripping. Everyone is thoroughly muddy, by the time they reach more even ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> <em>Phew!</em> Always a workout.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Is everyone okay? Delvaux, you took a fall.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Only thing wounded is my pride, sir.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey giggles at this statement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> How about you, Draws?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Winded, but peachy.</p>
<p><em>Fi smiles, and Dr. Soch nods his head. Dr. Lindsey trots away from the group, glancing around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Let's see if we can track the fault again.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws glances down at SCP-8272. The eyes are glowing white.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> We're still near it.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older wipes her muddy hands on a nearby tree, before walking over to scan around. She takes a moment to scoop up a small shard of rock, and clicks it against the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> We're still on the same rock body, slate's still here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> As is the quartzite.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Good. Keep an eye out for the displacement, then.</p>
<p><em>The team fans out and examines the wooded area. Dr. Lindsey glances over her shoulder, squinting at where the previous outcrop can be partially seen through the thick trees. It takes roughly seven minutes to relocate the fault from the previous outcrop, as Dr. Delvaux finds it via an exposed and raised chunk of rock.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux leans against the new outcrop as the rest of the team approaches. Rsr. Draws raises up SCP-8272 to confirm that the leyline continues through this area.</em></p>
<p><em>The eyes on the cane shift from white to blue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> It's still here!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> And thus it's the return of flag time.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Older chuckles a bit as Dr. Lindsey takes out a few wire flags from her bag, alongside a can of vibrant orange spray paint. She shakes it twice before glancing at Rsr. Older.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Bernice, can you mark the trees we used to get up here? Just so it's easier to find our path. You don't have to mark all the way down, just probably those top ones over yonder.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Yes ma'am!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey tosses the can to her, and she catches it, before slipping off. Rsr. Draws has taken the initiative to walk with SCP-8272 and start tracing out where the fault and leyline lie. Dr. Lindsey marks this path with the flags.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Soch walks alongside Rsr. Draws.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Have the braces been suiting you well?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> They fit! Makes the slopes trickier, like you said. But… nothing hurts as bad. When I'm walking, at least.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> <em>[He smiles]</em> That's great to hear, Draws.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> It feels great, too. I — It's almost weird without it, but it definitely makes being out here more fun.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws smiles. Fi spins in place as if for emphasis, before returning to position.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> I don't have to tough it out anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> I see you've taken to using 8272 as well.</p>
<p><em>He gestures to the cane, as Rsr. Draws has been actively using it to walk. Fi glances away, as though sheepish.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Ah— I was just doing that out of convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Soch:</strong> Convenience is what they're for.</p>
<p><em>From behind, Dr. Lindsey raises up her head from the flags.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> You do match! Dragon with a dragon.</p>
<p><em>The comment makes Rsr. Draws chuckle.</em></p>
<p><em>Fi has been walking while talking, tracing further along the fault line with SCP-8272. Fi leans on it, as fi squints down at a broken slab of shale on the ground that borders the split. Rsr. Draws wedges SCP-8272 under the slab of rock, and pushes down to pry it away from the ground. This enables fir to crouch down, and shove it further as to flip it over completely and break it away from the rock body.</em></p>
<p><em>The underside of the rock is broken up and dirty. However, a small glint catches Rsr. Draws' eyes. Rsr. Older has wandered over to see what fi's looking at, having returned from marking trees. Dr. Soch leans back against a tree and tilts his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Hey Benny, you ever see anything like this?</p>
<p><em>Fi pries off a small, cubic crystal from the rock — with some effort. It is a brilliant blue-green, and shines in the light.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> …It looks <em>almost</em> like copper but… <em>really</em> oxidized. Which is weird. Both for this area, and for copper.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> It's incredibly bright too.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> We should show the others.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws nods. The two turn around and walk over to Dr. Lindsey, who pauses mid-shoving a flag into the earth to tilt her head at the two junior researchers. She pushes herself up with a grunt.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Do you know what mineral this is?</p>
<p><em>Fi extends the crystal forward. Dr. Lindsey carefully takes it from Rsr. Draws, and tilts it in the light, watching its blue-green luster. She squints at it for a long moment, before rooting around in her bag. She takes out a small piece of tile, and scrapes the crystal along it. It leaves an electric blue streak, and Dr. Lindsey's eyes widen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Along the fault surface, there's some veins in the shale.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Delvaux trots over and peers over Dr. Lindsey's shoulder. He squints.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Orichalcum.</p>
<p><em>There is a pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Like the mythical metal?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> It's <em>real?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Quite real! The Foundation has discovered a plethora, but it's all dreadfully under-researched, and most is more <em>stolen</em> than it is mined or made.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> Such as irrilite?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Exactly. And most orichalcum the Foundation acquires is apprehended or purchased from Mehkanites. We've never been able to pry out of them how they find it. They use it to make beryllium bronze. We actually know more about that alloy than we know of orichalcum itself.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> So we don't know the conditions by which it deposits.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Barely. We've <em>assumed</em> like copper, but… this throws a wrench in things.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Because you don't find copper in northern PA.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Delvaux:</strong> But we <em>did</em> find it inside a fault.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> And a leyline. We found magic metal along the magic line. It is magic, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Essentially!</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws is perked up, speaking excitedly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> So there may be mechanics at play we've never even <em>seen</em> before! Magic affecting the way minerals form! Leylines and faultlines correlating could mean like — I dunno — they're like tectonics!</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> Like they're less criss-crossing lines, and more the borders of plates?</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Draws:</strong> Exactly like that!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Lindsey hums happily at the two's exchange, pocketing the piece of orichalcum.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> I do believe we have found a fascinating tip of an iceberg here, gang.</p>
<p><em>She shoots a grin to the others.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> Wanna see if we can find more? Gibbs would love to hear about this. The more evidence, the stronger the hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Rsr. Older:</strong> If that means you'll let me carry the big slate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lindsey:</strong> If you can fit it in your bag and carry it down the slope, then anything's game.</p>
<p><em>Rsr. Draws snickers as Rsr. Older scrambles over to heft up the large piece of slate. Fi walks over to start picking and prying at other rocks along the fault line — joined by Drs. Lindsey and Delvaux — the former of whom removes a rock pick from her belt.</em></p>
<p><em>The team spends the remainder of the expedition harvesting samples of the metal from the area.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The examination of the location of interest would find a series of small, impure veins of the anomalous metal orichalcum. Samples were harvested by the small team and taken back to Site-898, where their composition and identification were confirmed upon lab inspection.</p>
<p>Research into the implications of this discovery has been proposed, as Rsr. Draws has since requested further usage of SCP-8272 for a possible research project under the name "Project Leymine" to investigate the possible correlation between leylines and thaumaturgical metals. This request was forwarded to Director Hellen Gibbs, and approved as of 30/09/2011.</p>
<p>In tandem, Dr. Soch’s request to allow Rsr. Draws full-time usage of SCP-8272 as a mobility aid has also been approved.</p>
