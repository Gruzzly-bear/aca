            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8737</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8737 is to be stored in a low-security archival container. Level 2 preservation procedures must be followed regarding its usage in research.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8737-A must be stored in individual containment aquariums marked with the previous identity of the instance (if known) and the most recent cognitive analysis results. Instances that maintain a sapience quotient below 3.55 for 2 consecutive months are to be considered non-anomalous and transferred to standard biological resource storage; the research lead may suspend this transfer if necessary for experimentation, and members of staff may request termination of instances prior to transfer at the discretion of the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8737 is a narrow booklet composed of four sheets of paper, measuring 20 centimeters in height and 8 centimeters in width. Each page is coated in an uneven layer of wax, and signs of water damage are visible in regions where the wax has worn away. The cover depicts a horned, faceless humanoid in three poses superimposed at the center of the page. The seven remaining pages each contain an image of the same humanoid in a different pose, with seven characters of Daevic script written in a column below it. The inscriptions on each page have been translated into English below.</p>
<p><em>Note: Due to the inherent ambiguity of Daevic culture, not all phrases have a definitive translation into English. Any words with uncertain translations are marked in brackets.</em></p>

<li>To [die/submit] is to [fall/sink]</li>
<li>To [fall/sink] is to see</li>
<li>To see is to [understand/receive/accept]</li>
<li>To [understand/receive/accept] is to [bear/carry]</li>
<li>To [bear/carry] is to learn</li>
<li>To learn is to know</li>
<li>To know is to [die/submit]</li>
</ol>
<p>Material analysis has revealed that the chemical composition of the ink used to draw the pose on the final page of SCP-8737 does not match the ink used in the rest of the document. Further examination discovered a square of paper had been attached to the final page, covering the image which was originally in the document and allowing the currently visible pose to be drawn over it. Due to the fragility of SCP-8737, it is not possible to uncover the original drawing without compromising the integrity of the document.</p>
<p>Of the seven poses, six of them have been deemed impossible for a typical human to perform without permanent injury; pages 1, 3, 4, and 5 require at least one joint to be hyperextended past safe bounds, page 2 requires hyperrotation of the spine, and page 6 requires the arms to bend in locations which lack joints to allow the motion. Attempts to perform these poses, either by subjects with hypermobility in the relevant joints or by subjects forced into the poses in spite of resultant injury, have resulted in no observed anomalous effects.</p>
<p>The pose on the final page of SCP-8737 is the only pose which is possible for a typical human to perform. When the pose is performed while within close proximity (approximately 2 meters) of SCP-8737, the performer will immediately transform into a mature member of Enteroctopus dofleini<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, designated as SCP-8737-A.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum A: Discovery</strong><br/>
SCP-8737 was purchased by Mobile Task Force Mu-3 ("Highest Bidders") during an auction held by GoI-12<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> on 23/05/2023. The item was purchased in a set along with other purported Daevic artifacts which the seller claimed were recovered during a dive several kilometers south-west of Amchitka Island; a search to find the original location of the artifacts is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum B: Testing Log</strong></p>
<p>The following logs detail the experimentation performed on D-28763, who became an instance of SCP-8737-A after performing the seventh pose in SCP-8737 during initial testing.</p>

Subject containment procedures have been updated to include increased observation, and most visually obstructive features of its tank have been removed.</td>
