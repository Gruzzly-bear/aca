<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3483 is the fossilized remains of a <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em> that exhibits an abnormally high level of Akiva radiation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and was unearthed in an area of anomalous discontinuity with current understandings of geology and paleobiology.</p>
<p>SCP-3483 was discovered on 02/08/2016 when a constructed expansion of Church of Our Lady in Trivio<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> resulted in the partial uncovering of the remains within the church’s basement. Its heightened Akiva radiation would be detected shortly after its unearthing, and would be reported to the Tactical Theology Department.</p>
<p>The surrounding strata that SCP-3483 was unearthed in has been found to be noticeably younger than the Late Cretaceous Era (and notably, outside of the range where <em>Velociraptor mongolieniss</em> is known to have lived), being roughly Cenozoic in origin — though filled with a multitude of discontinuities. It appears that SCP-3483 was buried only a few hundred years ago. Under normal circumstances, these details would be dismissed as non-anomalous human interactions<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> with the bones, if not for the fact that radiometric dating on SCP-3483’s fossils have revealed it died around the same time it was buried.</p>
<p>The remains were extracted and re-constructed by staff of Paleontological Site-403, and sent to Reliquary Area-27 for further study. It was noted that, during re-construction, the bones exhibited an odd behavior of adherence during assembly — resulting in a minimal use of typical cementation and gluing.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 3483.1:</strong> On 15/08/2016, a small scale breach occurred when an sludge-like, possibly <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1844" target="_blank">Tartarean</a>, entity manifested in Subterranean Wing B. It proceeded to approach the displayed remains of SCP-3483, and attempted to damage them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The unknown entity was fended off via <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4967" target="_blank">holy water</a>. Though, during the initial attempts to keep it from damaging SCP-3483, the bones had become partially soaked with the holy water as well. The application of holy water did not dispel the attacking entity in full, and only served to cause it to flee into the Site's pipes.</p>
<p>Attempts to find the unknown entity have been unsuccessful, and upon a member of staff returning to clean SCP-3483 a few hours later, it was found that the bones had seemingly vanished.</p>
<p>Review of security cameras would then show that after the application of holy water to SCP-3483, the bones had reanimated after personnel had left the room in pursuit of the other entity. SCP-3483 regained organs, flesh, blood and feathers, before leaving its display podium and beginning to wander the site — eventually wandering into Low Security Artifact Storage, where it was discovered by two members of staff who were about to take inventory at the time.</p>
<p>The resulting encounter is attached below.</p>

<p><strong>Interview 3483:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Carol Barsbold, Dr. Adeline Altair<br/>
<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-3483<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> While original intention was the re-containment of SCP-3483 after its reanimation, it became swiftly apparent that the subject was both cooperative, and capable of speech, upon re-discovery within Low Security Artifact Storage.</p>
<p>The following exchange was recorded upon first contact with SCP-3483 by Drs. Barsbold and Altair.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Camera footage from the hallway shows SCP-3483 trotting down the hall. It pauses outside the door of the Low Security Artifact Storage, and sniffs at the bottom of it. After a few moments, it begins to claw at the underneath of the door, trying to get inside.</em></p>
<p><em>This goes on for several seconds, before the entity gives up. SCP-3483 looks up at the door handle. It leaps up and smacks it a few times. Eventually, the combination of hitting the handle and pushing its body against the door in the process, results in getting it open. SCP-3483 enters the storage room.</em></p>
<p><em>Drs. Barsbold and Altair are walking down the hall, the two are approaching in order to take inventory, but the commotion draws confusion from the two.</em></p>
<p><em>They notice the claw marks upon the ajar door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> Oh, what now?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Barsbold narrows her eyes, and silently slips forward and pushes the door open.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> Carol what are you—?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> It might be that thing from earlier— keep your voice down.</p>
<p><em>The two quietly creep into the storage room, where a rustling and clattering can be heard.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 is perched up on one of the storage shelfs, head half shoved into an open box.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> Nnnnnevermind.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> …that… may explain where the missing dinosaur skeleton went.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> It <em>reanimated..?</em> That's… fascinating.</p>
<p><em>The box that SCP-3483 has shoved its head into falls to the floor with a loud clatter, and the anomaly jolts with a squawk. Its head then snaps to stare at the two. Dr. Barsbold winces as the contents of the box scatter across the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> Oi! Get down from there—</p>
<p><em>The two of them then move towards SCP-3483, who again squawks and leaps down — dashing to another part of the storage room. Dr. Barsbold swiftly goes to shut the door, preventing SCP-3483 from slipping into the hallway.</em></p>
<p><em>It takes approximately five minutes for them to herd SCP-3483 into the corner of the storage room, its feathers are puffed up in an agitated manner — its toe-claws tap against the tile floor.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 opens its mouth and makes a series of chittering noises, mixed with what sounds like garbled words.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> Per Sant'Agata protettrice degli occhi! Che ci fate qua?</p>
<p><em>Drs. Barsbold and Altair stare at SCP-3483, dumbfounded. Dr. Barsbold glances at Dr. Altair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> …was that Italian?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> The dinosaur speaks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> Italian.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> Yeah I noticed that now, Carol!</p>
<p><em>She punctuates her exclamation a frantic wave of her hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> …volete una zampa?</p>
<p><em>There is a brief pause as both parties continue to stare at one another.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> Mhm. What's it saying?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> I dunno. I don't speak Italian.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> And you think <em>I</em> do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> You identified the language!</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 spins in a tight circle, stares up at the two, then screeches.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> Yeah, yeah, <em>uno momento</em> or whatever. Uhhhhh…. <em>[She clears her throat, the following is translated from Latin]</em> &lt;Can you understand me?&gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 perks up, looking Barsbold in the eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;You speak the language of the Church… It is reassuring that you are people of God.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;Which Church…?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Why, the Roman Catholic Church of course. And you, good ma'am…&gt;</p>
<p><em>It approaches Dr. Barsbold, who tenses, circling and sniffing her.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Hm. Presbyterian.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;Is… is there a problem?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;No. Not at all, no. God still loves you, and as long as He does, so shall I.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;And how exactly is it that you are Roman Catholic?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;To be of any other faith is to defeat the purpose of being a pastor. Although, I suppose in this day and age, I am merely a priest from a parish buried beneath bedrock.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;…shit — so if it wasn't you, then that Tartarean from earlier is still lurking around— &gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 perks up visibly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;One of those blights are here?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;Blight?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Ah. Permit my elaboration. There is a grand festering rot, upon which your civilization has been strangled and choked in blissful ignorance.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;A pestilence, would you say?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;In a sense. But this is no disease of the flesh. It is an upset of the natural order, of which only faith and prayer may remedy.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;Do enlighten us. Perhaps we could assist.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;I speak of petroleum oil. Your society engorges itself on black gold ripped from the bowels of the earth itself, disseminating it throughout your cities, your homes, bending its form to serve your whims and wills.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;You have disturbed the eternal rest of the ancients. Unwittingly so, yes, but it does not diminish the desecration that you have wrought on our ancestors.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;But petroleum doesn't come from dinosaurs? It's like, plants and plankton?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Correct. Neither possess souls, but in the deep earth where they slumber, other malignant forms of the waking dead cling on to whatever blood of life they can sink their unearthly teeth into.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;Unsettling! Thank you!&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;And now it's in the Site. We don't even know where it went.&gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 stares at the two of them, cocks its head to the left and right a few times, before ducking its head in something like a nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Then we must take up arms, sisters. If one of those fiends has animated, we must act quick before it damages your sanctum. What holy symbols do you have to offer?&gt; <em>[SCP-3483 turns in a tight circle, stomps its left foot once]</em> &lt;For I… appear to have lost my own tools.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;Is that why you broke into here?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Time is of the essence. I understand this to be a reliquary, of sorts.&gt;</p>
<p><em>Dr. Altair rummages through a nearby box labelled "Decommissioned" and draws out a plain wooden cross at random.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> &lt;Will this do?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;In times of crisis, even the littlest objects of faith may yet provide salvation. This will suffice.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Barsbold:</strong> &lt;I'm not sure if this will be enough for a Tartarean entity that was capable of entering this facility to begin with. I'm calling in backup, hold tight.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Alas, there shall be no rest for the wicked.&gt;</p>
<p><em>Before Dr. Altair can react, SCP-3483 leaps and snaps the wooden cross up in its teeth, before sharply pivoting. SCP-3483 charges out of the room and down the hallway. Despite Drs. Barsbold and Altair's best efforts, they lose sight of SCP-3483 after a few turns.</em></p>
<p><em>In the middle of the hallway, they both slow to a stop. Dr. Barsbold lowers the walkie-talkie she'd gone from talking to shouting into, and glances at her companion. Dr. Altair purses her lips.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Altair:</strong> …shit.</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483, meanwhile, dashes down corridors — scampering down a stairwell into the lower depths of Area-27.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a dark splattering of sludge across the tile floor. SCP-3483 briefly skids to a stop, sniffing it. After a few moments, SCP-3483 snarls, and shoots off down a hall. There is more of the sludge — a growing trail.</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of the hall, attempting to ooze into a ventilation pipe. It stops when it notices SCP-3483. From the bubbling, black sludge, a bone-white skull of a protoceratops rises — with clacking teeth and empty eyes. The Tartarean entity drops down from the pipe with a splat as bone spurs rise from its amorphous form.</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Your final hour comes, old blight.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Petroblight: YOU WERE DEAD.</strong><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 growls, feathers raised and claws bared. The cross stays clenched in its teeth, its toe-claw clicks against the tile.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;What is dead may again rise. Pray that His mercy is gentler than mine.&gt;</p>
<p><em>The petroblight's spines rattle against each other, before it draws itself up and flings itself towards the other.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 lunges forward in tandem.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Begone from here, foul demon! Return to the chthonic bowels from which you festered!&gt;</p>
<p><em>The petroblight shrieks as SCP-3483's claws slam against its skull, toe-claws slicing against the bone as the dinosaur hops off the skull and lands behind it. SCP-3483 whips around, its toe-claw strikes the floor and carves a deep groove into the tile.</em></p>
<p><em>The backup called by Dr. Barsbold is en route.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a low growl from the petroblight, claws pierce from its body and swings at SCP-3483. Black oil sheers against white feathers, as SCP-3483 leaps to the side. Again, its claws scrape the floor as it lands a few meters away from its previous spot.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 darts around the petroblight, running a tight circle around the demon. The demon snarls, a tail rising from its oily form — it swings at SCP-3483. It ducks, slides under, and snarls loudly. The raptor launches itself again at the petroblight's skull, claws gripping into the empty eye-sockets to hold on and slash with its back feet as the petroblight thrashes and screeches in its attempts to throw it off.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few moments, a few deep slashes, SCP-3483 is thrown to the side with a yelp. The petroblight makes a low, rumbling gurgle that almost sounds like mocking laughter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Petroblight: IT IS WE WHO SHALL SEND YOU BACK INTO THE EARTH.</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 hisses, toe-claws again striking against the tile with a shrill squeal. It returns to circling the petroblight — both tense and waiting for the other to strike. SCP-3483 keeps scouring the floor as it does so.</em></p>
<p><em>The petroblight lashes out with its claws once again, striking true on SCP-3483's leg and splattering blood against the tile. It shrieks in pain, staggering away before shaking off the pain to clash against the petroblight again. Claws hit bone, teeth gnash against the air.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 continues its pattern. Circling, striking, backing off. It lunges inwards with its claws, slicing at bone and oil, as the petroblight thrashes and retaliates in turn — turning in tight circles as it struggles to keep track of SCP-3483.</em></p>
<p><em>They clash once more, and after a moment of struggle, the two break off again. Circling. SCP-3483 walks with a slight limp, panting. The petroblight's skull is marred by claw marks, it holds its head noticeably lower.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;You grow weary.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Petroblight: AND YET WE SHALL NOT DIE. THE BLACK GOLD FLOWS ETERNAL, MONGOLINESIS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Is that so, demon?&gt;</p>
<p><em>With a low growl, SCP-3483 claws grind against the tile — scraping the ceramic tiles. The petroblight chatters its teeth and tries to straighten.</em></p>
<p><strong>Petroblight: FOOLISH CHILD. YOUR NAIVETY IS ALMOST REFRESHING.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;For a being of the hellish depths…&gt;</p>
<p><em>The dinosaur drops the wooden cross from its jaws, which clatters to the floor. SCP-3483 crouches and places its front claws upon it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;You've neglected to look down.&gt;</p>
<p><em>The various grooves and claw marks that SCP-3483 had previously etched into the floors during its lunges and strikes suddenly begin to glow with a white-gold light. It shines in a crisscrossing, jagged array that surrounds the petroblight. The entity shrieks in surprise.</em></p>
<p><em>Area security arrives on scene — composed of Agents Ingram, Silvanus, and Reva. As the three skid to a stop just a few meters away, Agent Ingram's arm shoots out to the side.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Ingram:</strong> HOLD! Stay back.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Silvanus:</strong> Ambient Akiva readings just spiked, rising still. Can't tell if its from 3483 or the circle.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Reva:</strong> I've never seen an array look like that.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Ingram:</strong> 3483 made that?</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 ignores them as it walks towards the petroblight.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.&gt;</p>
<p><em>The petroblight attempts to flee, but the sigil on the floor burns brighter as it tries to cross. A sizzling fills the air.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Silvanus:</strong> It sure did.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.&gt;</p>
<p><em>The petroblight's cries grow louder, the liquid that makes up its body bubbling and spitting — smoking against the light. The entity has collapsed against the tile.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt;And lead us not into temptation— &gt;</p>
<p><em>SCP-3483 puts its clawed foot against the petroblight's skull. It presses down.</em></p>
<p><em>Cracks splinter across the skull, laced in gold light. SCP-3483 forces its entire body weight down against it, as the black-oil sizzles and evaporates to smoke, as the demon howls beneath it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-3483:</strong> &lt; —but deliver us from evil.&gt;</p>
<p><em>And the skull shatters into dust.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> Following the disposal of the Tartarean entity by SCP-3483, the anomaly willingly complied with the security team to follow them to a temporary holding cell, after returning the wooden cross to Dr. Altair. SCP-3483 would receive medical attention for the wounds it sustained in combat.</p>
<p>Containment procedures and updated status are under consideration, as is further interview efforts to learn about the entity that SCP-3483 slew, and the methods it had used to do so.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p>As of 18/08/2016, SCP-3483 is formally classified as neutralized, due to the reconstitution of the item into the non-anomalous skeletal structure of an active member of Foundation staff. Relevant documentation has been attached to this file at the request of the aforementioned staff member.</p>

<p>Rev. Doug Kaisen</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Reverend Doug Kaisen</p>
<p><strong>Security Clearance:</strong> Level 3</p>
<p><strong>Position:</strong> Reliquary Area-27 Pastor, Anti-Tartarean Security Specialist (Abrahamic Division)</p>
<p><strong>Denomination:</strong> Roman Catholic</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Reliquary Area-27</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Rev. Kaisen, formerly classified as SCP-3483, was recruited into the Department of Tactical Theology following his corporeal reconstitution and subsequent suppression of a Tartarean Incursion Event in Reliquary Area-27. In addition to his duties as the pastor of Reliquary Area-27, Rev. Kaisen currently serves as a consultant for the DoTT, with special focus on the Abrahamic Division and Nonhuman Faith Committee.</p>
<p>Notable contributions include the formalization and study of the "Petroblight" Tartarean entity subclassification, the analysis of Akiva generation in crow murders, and the development of novel Tartarean suppression techniques, which were extrapolated from Rev. Kaisen's skillset for application by bipedal entities.</p>
