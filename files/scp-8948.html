<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A fenced perimeter has been established around Hallward Drive and the sole means of ingress by foot and road traffic has been barricaded to dissuade civilian exploration.</p>
<p>A Foundation front company has purchased all properties on Hallward Drive, establishing the Foundation as their legal owner.</p>
<p>All instances of SCP-8948 are presently vacant of any living persons.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8948 refers to the properties of Hallward Drive, a <em>cul-de-sac</em> located in Langfirth, Temes Valley, United Kingdom. Despite visible external differences and differing architectural features within existing blueprints, each instance of SCP-8948 is topologically congruent.</p>
<p>Instances of SCP-8948 exhibit numerous topological anomalies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascending or descending stairwells results in subjects entering unrelated floors.</li>
<li>Points of ingress/egress within each instance of SCP-8948 connecting to neighbouring properties.</li>
<li>Inexplicable noises originating from adjacent rooms. Upon entering the aforementioned room, all noise will immediately cease.</li>
<li>Unintelligible voices are audible from the exterior of SCP-8948, but cease upon crossing the property’s boundary lines.</li>
<li>All properties are clean of domestic dust particulates.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-8948 is believed to be responsible for the disappearances of one-hundred-and-sixty-three people, including the entire population of Hallward Drive. No trace has ever been found of the disappeared persons.</p>

<li>The window panes of the property consist of taut corneal epithelial tissue, stretched across the frame.</li>
<li>It is impossible to enter the property between the hours of 10pm and 8am.</li>
<li>The drive is filled with crushed gravel composed of enamel and dentin. Samples failed to match any dental records.</li>

<li>All duvets, blankets, and textiles conform to a thread count of 400. Each room is furnished with a single pillow.</li>
<li>All plumbing throughout the property has been replaced by the renal system. Fluids inside the system are filtered and recycled by this process.</li>

<li>The lawn is covered by a downy layer of keratin fibres aesthetically reminiscent of cropped grass. Grey fibres have been isolated within the predominantly brown-coloured mass.</li>
<li>Furniture and household appliances are aligned such that each item’s shortest edge faced east. Navigation was frustrated by entire doorways being blocked.</li>
<li>The heating system, including pumps, pipes, and radiators, has been replaced by elements of the circulatory system. Operating any of the faucets in the property releases blood heated to 65°C. The boiler has been noted to thrum at 60-100 RPM.</li>
<li>The garage is a mirror image to all other instances of SCP-8948. Empty picture frames hang from the wall.</li>
<li>There is no access to the 13th floor.</li>

<li>The upstairs hallway possesses an indefinite length. Despite an hour of continuous walking, subjects have never reached the end.</li>
<li>Attempts to retrace their steps from the stairwell back to the ground floor resulted in the subject entering the basement. Navigation of the space therein led to [DATA EXPUNGED].</li>

All such pamphlets were destroyed by the Foundation. This phenomenon continued unabated for the next two months.</p>
