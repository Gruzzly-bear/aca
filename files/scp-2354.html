<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Lack of knowledge regarding SCP-2354 has made direct containment infeasible. Containment efforts should instead focus on monitoring likely targets of SCP-2354 and attempting to preempt the entity. This policy is to continue until more effective containment procedures can be developed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2354 is an anomalous ambush predator targeting individuals who have recently experienced the death or disappearance of a loved one.</p>
<p>SCP-2354 is believed to stalk a given subject for an extended period of time, variably ranging from three weeks to six months, before luring its target to an isolated location and bludgeoning them to death. SCP-2354 will then lacerate the subject post-mortem, typically by removing a single body part<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The significance of this process is unknown.</p>
<p>Beyond these factors, little is known about SCP-2354’s appearance, movements, or current whereabouts. Although initially attributed to a series of non-anomalous serial killings, the inexplicably broad range of SCP-2354 manifestations has made the likelihood of anomalous influence a near certainty.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Log:</strong> The following is an abridged record of deaths connected to SCP-2354 and descriptions of their circumstances.</p>
