            <h1>SCP-3177</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3177</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3177 is to be stored in a standard anomalous object containment locker. Level-2 clearance is required to remove SCP-3177 from its locker and allow viewing.</p>
<p>Should personnel unintentionally come under the effects of SCP-3177, they are to seek immediate amnestic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3177 is a cardboard cutout of American actor Steve Buscemi standing 1.8 meters tall. SCP-3177's anomalous abilities only become relevant when a subject is able to visibly comprehend SCP-3177 after witnessing a murder. Subjects who meet these requirements believe that SCP-3177 was responsible for the murder, and report witnessing them performing the act, regardless of the means of murder.</p>
<p>A subject does not need to witness both the murderer and the victim, only the victim dying. A subject who witnesses a victim dying without seeing the murderer is able to recall SCP-3177 committing the act itself, regardless of any events which happened that might contradict this memory. For example, a subject who witnesses a victim being poisoned would recall SCP-3177 giving the victim poison through whichever vessel it was delivered.</p>
<p>Currently, no time limit has been discovered between witnessing the murder and interacting with SCP-3177, however amnestic treatment has been shown to reverse the process.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3177-01:</strong></p>
<p>The following interview is between Dr. Robert Douhni and D-30044, who was previously convicted for the murder of a family in █████████, Virginia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> Alright, D-30044, I have a few questions about something that happened a while back. We've gotten word that you were present during the murder of the ████ family back in September of 20██?</p>
<p><em>D-30044 leans back in his chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Oh, yes, yes… Fucking hated those greedy wastes of space.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> Obviously not a fan then, I see. If you could remain as impartial as you could when describing what happened? It'd… it's going to make it easier for me, personally.</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Oh, of course. If you want to know what happened, it starts with an interesting coincidence; I was actually about to kill them myself, if you'd believe it. I had everything prepped and ready for the fun I was about to have. Intended to blow the brains out of that preppy kid first and then torture the old fucks before finally ending their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> You seemed to have quite the plan already. Why didn't you go through with it?</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Well, if you'd believe it, that man that you introduced me to earlier? He was already there! Just as I was about to take aim at the kid with the shotgun <em>I</em> brought, he just pulled out his own shotgun and killed him before I could even pull the trigger!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> The cardboard cutout?</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Yes! I didn't believe it myself when I first saw it, and honestly I was a bit upset that he got the shot off first. He didn't pay me much mind when I went over and unloaded a few more rounds into that man-child's corpse to make sure he was dead, so that much I appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> Mhm…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Douhni is seen quietly writing on his clipboard before turning his attention back to D-30044.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> Right, sorry. Can you continue?</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Of course. As I was saying, I don't know where he went next, but he didn't get in the way when I went upstairs and tied up the parents. I had this whole routine practiced, this speech about greed and entitlement and how much pain they've inflicted on me and all the other people of █████████. Each cut was supposed to be symbolic, one cut for every person who was suffering beneath their boots.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> I can't personally relate, but, um…</p>
<p><em>Dr. Douhni coughs into his hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> I, I think I understand what you were trying to go for.</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Yes, so, I got to work. I cut their tongues out first so they couldn't scream, then I sawed off the fingers and toes in case they tried to escape. Then… I'm sorry, did you want the details? I can go through the whole routine. I still have the speech memorized.</p>
<p><em>D-30044 is seen smiling to himself. Dr. Douhni is seen covering his mouth with his hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> Please, do not go into specific detail, for my sake personally.</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Of course, my apologies. So, just as I'm about the finish the job, <em>he</em> comes back into the room. Out of nowhere he's there, and he looks just as angry at these people as I was. I figured I had my fun, so I offered him the knife. He took it gladly and just slashed their throats open, let 'em bleed out. I was impressed, truly I was. A slow, excruciating death choking on their own blood was what they deserved. Then he simply gave me back the knife and left.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Douhni lowers his hands and picks up his pencil to write again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Douhni:</strong> It just killed them and left? Did you see where it went?</p>
<p><strong>D-30044:</strong> Sadly no. Shame though, I was the one arrested for it. I didn't even kill them, technically. But hey, at least you all found a way to lock him up, hm?</p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
