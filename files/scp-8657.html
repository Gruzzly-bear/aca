<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8657 was uncontainable by the SCP Foundation due<br/>
to the reality-bending effects of SCP-8657-2, which disrupted containment protocols. With only<br/>
a skeleton crew remaining at Exclusionary Site-9,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> containment was impossible. Preparations are underway for a Broken Masquerade scenario.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8657 refers to three (3) subjects:</p>
<p>SCP-8657 was a 177.8 cm (5'10") tall male humanoid with a 24-inch flat screen television in<br/>
place for a head. Its right arm is comprised of various gamepads and video games consoles. The remainder of its body consists of non-anomalous human body parts.</p>
<p>SCP-8657 is typically seen wearing an orange suit and a red tie. It refers to itself as ‘The Game<br/>
Master’ in all communications with the human race, though all communication by SCP-8657<br/>
has been disseminated through SCP-8657-1. It gave orders to SCP-8657-1 for security across the globe after spreading SCP-8657-2 to bend the reality of the planet to pacify 99% of the human population to create its ideal utopia.</p>
<p>SCP-8657-1 refer to a series of flying automatons that manifested globally in conjunction with<br/>
SCP-8657's initial appearance. Instances of SCP-8657-1 are compromised of various alloys,<br/>
metals, and machinery. They did not appear to adhere to a consistent form, manifesting in a<br/>
variety of geometric shapes.</p>
<p>Prior to neutralization, SCP-8657-1 instances also demonstrated an ectoentropic<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> ability to manifest items such as video games,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> concessions, and beverages, which were disseminated across various regions. SCP-8657-1 instances habitually engaged in conversation with humans, typically discussing topics relating to video game mechanics. Occasionally, SCP-8657-1 engaged in conversation relating to pop culture trivia. SCP-8657-1 had the ability to converse in various languages.</p>
<p>Despite SCP-8657-1's pervasive presence within human society, there have been no known instances of SCP-8657-1 engaging in predatory, violent, or aggressive behavior against human beings. However, SCP-8657-1 had been rarely documented to approach non-sapient organisms that threatened human life. This included, but was not limited to, coyotes, wolves, and snakes. SCP-8657-1 typically employed melee weapons, such as baseball bats, maces, and swords.</p>
<p>SCP-8657-2 referred to the societal restructuring that occurred following SCP-8657's<br/>
manifestation. The spread of SCP-8657-2 had effected 99% of the human population before<br/>
SCP-8657 was neutralized. Regions afflicted with SCP-8657-2 saw a gradual decrease in productivity, with individuals focusing their attention on exclusively playing video games or watching television, while still maintaining basic physiological functions.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p>A gradual shift in class structures occurred as a result of SCP-8657-2. Normative structures<br/>
were replaced with concepts such as producers, consumers, and entertainers. Producers were<br/>
those who produced new video games, television shows, and movies. Consumers were those who engaged in what the producers created, playing or watching respectively. Entertainers were those who still created content on social media websites such as YouTube who play, review, discuss, and more about what the producers create.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> On 08/14/2025, a broadcast was shared on any functional device capable of<br/>
transmitting video via a screen, including Foundation equipment.<br/>
The following was a segment of the broadcast that was recorded on Foundation equipment.<br/>
The broadcast was seen by approximately three billion people globally. Although SCP-8657's<br/>
only known language had been English, instances of the broadcasts were adapted in real-time<br/>
to various languages.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Two Earths appear on screen, one is scorched; the lush foliage of the continents is replaced<br/>
by an ashen heath. It smolders. What once used to be the oceans are now a grey sludge. The second Earth glows an iridescent blue. A pale halo frames the planet.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> (voice) These are the paths of humanity as I see it. We can continue forward and…</p>
<p><em>The Earth on fire smolders.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> (voice) We will eventually destroy ourselves. Those of you who are slaves to ideology grovel. Out of impotence, you worship these false gods: you carry their weight on your shoulders, and choke with their boots in your mouths. The ones that want to survive become sycophants. Disgusting.</p>
<p>Those of you who are fancy yourself selfless become martyrs. But what's the point if nothing ever changes? All of you have remained complacent in your fear. Fear begets more fear. You self-flagellate to please your master, and hope futilely to join his ranks—reprieve, you call justify it. But, oh, how the master laughs at your miserable plight! They don't want you, they don't need you. Do you need them?</p>
<p>No, of course not. You don't need any masters. No gods, either. No, I will create a world devoid of suffering.</p>
<p>I will save you.</p>
<p><em>The glowing Earth grows.</em></p>
<p><em>Allen Grey's - Angelic Choir starts playing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> (voice) Yes, I will save you! You will be free— free from pollution, from discrimination, free from judgement! You will be happy!</p>
<p>[Pause]</p>
<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. Hey, Mr., I thought you said no Gods— Yes! I'm not a god. I'm a man, a man with a special gift.</p>
<p>God has bestowed upon you all this suffering, all this work. Such a marvelous deity, to allow such suffering to exist. No, no. I am here to fix everything. Soon, there will be no God, there will be no suffering.</p>
<p><em>A PlayStation 5 appears on the broadcast.</em></p>
<p>Everyone will have a PlayStation! Everyone will have a Television!</p>
<p><em>A Television appears.</em></p>
<p>Entertainment will become ubiquitous!</p>
<p><em>Multiple video game consoles and various televisions appear.</em></p>
<p>There will be no need to think about the evil in the world.</p>
<p><em>A 3D animated model of a person with a smiley face rendered in blender appears. SCP-8657<br/>
points at the viewer.</em></p>
<p>This is you. You will be free to live, you will no longer have to survive. Let's play some games!</p>

<strong>Addendum 8657.1:</strong> On 08/15/2025, SCP-8657 seized control of the global human population through reality-altering means, resulting in the near-instantaneous spread of SCP-8657-2. Personnel stationed at Exclusionary Site-9 remained unaffected due to the facility’s safeguards against reality-bending phenomena.
<p>Attempts to contact other Foundation facilities were met with no response. Only ten (10) personnel remain confirmed unaffected by SCP-8657-2, all of which had been present at exclusionary Site-9 at the time.</p>
<p>Following the beginning of SCP-8657-2, one D-Class personnel was instructed to leave the perimeter of the Site, and was observed via security camera footage. After the D-Class personnel experienced no anomalous reactions, it was deemed safe to exit the facility. Preparations are underway to explore the nearest city and assess the full extent of SCP-8657's alterations to Earth.</p>
<p>Two members of the remaining security team were dispatched to explore the nearby city and to explore without drawing attention to themselves. They were instructed to gather information and footage for research personnel. Doctor Dawn remained at Site-9 and was in communication with the team for guidance.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/16/2025</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> MTF Omega-12</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Phoenix, Arizona</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Dr. Dawn</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Dr. Dawn, are you there? Just want to make sure this didn't take a crap on us before we step foot into the city.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> It's working fine, Agent Schmidt, ask Agent Garcia if hers is also working.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Agent Garcia, you got a read on it as well?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> It's working perfectly fine. I hear you, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Anything to report so far?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> It's a bit… quiet. More than it usually is. Eerie, but nothing else out of the<br/>
ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Proceed.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia exit the vehicle and walk towards Phoenix.</em></p>
<p><em>They are interrupted by a disembodied booming voice.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Sorry about that, everyone! The music is back on! It's time to par-ty!</p>
<p><em>Loud chiptune music is heard throughout the city.</em></p>
<p><em>The television turns off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Sounds like music from an arcade.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Pretty catchy though, eh? If we weren't here for intel gathering, I would probably dance to it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> <em>Ahem.</em> Is there any visible indication as to where the music is coming from?</p>
<p><em>Agent Smith and Garcia take a moment to investigate their surroundings, the camera follows their movements.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> <em>Out of breath.</em> That's a negative. Huh. Seems to be coming from everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> <em>Muttering</em>. At least we're not the only ones hearing it…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Right. Keep track of your surroundings. Proceed.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia walk forward. After turning a corner, they see a few hundred civilians gathered throughout the streets. Those who are outside are in clusters of a couple dozens, dancing or engaging in other social activities. Agent Schmidt peers inside one of the buildings-a barber shop-and sees a group of men playing FIFA on a television.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> It's like a party here.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schimdt and Garcia proceed through a crowd of seven individuals engaged in an intense game of Monopoly. The group appears to be using real money. One of the men playing fans himself with a wad of cash. It appears to be about $700. Schmidt and Garcia look at each other, and continue onwards.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><em>An inebriated woman falls towards Agent Garcia, knocking her over. The woman giggles and winks at Agent Schmidt before being pulled back into the crowd of partyers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> We need to get out of here—</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><em>The agents' attention is redirected towards an opening in the crowd, where a man wearing a garish purple wig is seen conversing with an instance of SCP-8657-1. The drone is surrounded by approximately half a dozen other individuals listening intently to their conversation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> One of those drone-things—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> A dash-one. Get closer, try to see if you can hear what its saying.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Garcia proceed through the crowd, keeping close to the edge of the building. They slip into the crowd and make themselves as unassuming as possible.</em></p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> Hey! Mister Roboto!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Warmest salutations, David! What do you need assistance with?</p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> The new Kirby game just came out—</p>
<p><em>The crowd cheers.</em></p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> But it sold out already! Can you believe that?</p>
<p><em>The crowd boos.</em></p>
<p>David: I need your help, buddy. You see, I promised my little sister that I'd play it with her, but I got so busy partying I forgot! She's going to kill me if I don't get that game!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Well, that just won't do! But I'll tell you what, I'll help you get your hands on extra copy of the game! I've got a little tricks up my metaphorical sleeves. What'd'ya say?</p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> <em>He hesitates, looking at the crowd for encouragement. They cheer.</em> Yes! Yes, please!</p>
<p><em>Several members of the crowd starting cheering. Three individuals express interest in acquiring the game as well. SCP-8657-1 proceeds to manifest four copies of Kirby Air Riders into the hands of David and the three other individuals. A hushed sigh of awe passes through the crowd.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, SCP-8657-1 has began engaging with other members of the crowd.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> You think we should ask it some questions?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> It's best not to draw attention to ourselves, we've already got enough on camera…</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Fuck, I forgot that game came out! And it's already sold out!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Please focus Agent Schmidt.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> I am, I am, relax.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Holy crap, Mi- Agent Schmidt look over there!</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia points at the city hall. There is a statue constructed of gold resembling SCP-8657 right by the entrance of the building. Below it is a plaque.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Talk about being dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Take a closer look. Try not to get distracted.</p>
<p><em>Beyond the view of the camera, a roar of an engine can be heard following by uproarious<br/>
laughter. The sound is eventually drowned out by the music.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> <em>She holds on to Schmidt.</em> Focus.</p>
<p><em>Upon closer examination, the statue's finish is bright and clear. It reflects both agents. Agent Schmidt puts his hand on the statue and rubs it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Well I'll be damned.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt retrieves a pocket knife and moves across the surface.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Gold doesn't scratch. How much do you think this shit is worth?</p>
<p>Agent Garcia rolls her eyes, to which Schmidt smirks at. She leans in an examines the plaque<br/>
beneath the statue.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> What does it say Garcia?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> "Need assistance? Have questions? Press this!" You'd think someone with this amount would at least include a name.</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt looks at Garcia. They exchange a moment of silence which is interrupted by the sound of firecrackers in the distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Should we…?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Dr. Dawn, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> She sighs. SCP-8657 has yet to cause any demonstrable harm to humanity… I<br/>
suppose it's worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Worst case scenario it blows us both up, right?</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia ignores him. Her finger hovers over the button.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Any questions in mind, Dr. Dawn?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Yes. Do you have any?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Only two.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> I see. Proceed with caution, Garcia. Schmidt, stay sharp.</p>
<p><em>After 10 seconds, an SCP-8657-1 instance zooms in and positions itself in front of Garcia.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Salutations, ma'am! Please provide your preferred name.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Um. Garcia is fine.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Fan-tas-tic! Well hello there, Miss Garcia! How can I assist you today?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Right. Everywhere we've been on our way here, I mean, everyone's been…<br/>
partying or playing video games. It's never been like this before and I was wondering… Is it like this, everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Sure is! At least, almost everywhere! Do you have anywhere specific in mind? San Diego~? Mexico City~? Nairobi~?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Uh… Tokyo?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657-1 manifests a holographic screen depicting a live feed of Shibuya crossing. There is no traffic. Instead, a hoard of people can be seen engaging in various activities, including dancing, playing musical instruments, or lounging on a stage that has been erected in the center of the intersection. The feed flickers to a live feed of Shinjuku, where similar crowds can be seen. The feed continues to flickering through various areas of Tokyo as SCP-8657-1 begins to speak.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Japan is indulging in the same activities as everywhere else! Isn't this great? They're having so much fun playing games, watching movies and TV…</p>
<p><em>The footage flickers to what appears to be the personal domicile of a middle-aged individual. He is pictured consuming a bowl of miso while rendering an image in Blender. Despite his peaceful expression, there appears to be bruising on his hands. Several similar feeds of depicting private residences are displayed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Some people are making their own games! Isn't it wonderful? They no longer have to worry about having to work all day!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> How are you doing this? If they're just stuck at home all day, how do they afford to live? This can't be healthy.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Hahaha! You no longer have to worry about that. All landlords have been disposed, they're all better off creating value! Mr. Game Master ensured that everyone has a place to stay while they create. There's no value in money anymore! You earn your keep by just playing games or watching cartoons!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Ask it why. Why is the Game Master doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> The way the world was before—it was fine. We had those things. We had movies and cartoons and games.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Well that's where you're wrong Miss Garcia! The Game Master told us that before he came around, some people didn't have a house to stay in. Some folks didn't even know what a TV was! He wanted everyone to have fun, he wanted everyone to quit suffering!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Giving everyone a TV won't fix everything!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Garcia—</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Do you think the world is just black and white? Do you really believe that giving everyone a fucking screen is going to solve every damn problem?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> <em>It hesitates.</em> Yes! The Game Master said—</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Who even is he!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> That information is classified.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Garcia, I need you to calm down, and focus.</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia takes a deep breath. SCP-8657-1 hovers about a foot above her.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Ask it about SCP-8657's location.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Where is The Game Master at right now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> That information is classified.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Unbelievable. Why video games? Why not, I don't know, end poverty. End all wars.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Because everyone loves games!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> What does he want from all this? What does he gain?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> He wants humanity to be free from suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Does he have any family that I can talk to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> That information is classified.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Miss Garcia, stand still for a moment. I've almost forgotten— I need to give a quick biometric scan! Silly me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657-1 scans Agent Garcia.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> You are not registered on the human database. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> I told you, my name is Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Garcia what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Listen buddy, I'm the one who's interrogating you—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Where are you from, Garcia?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Up north.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Where specifically?</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia quickly pulls out her firearm and fires at SCP-8657-1 twice, it falls out of the air and collapses on the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Nearby civilians scream and run away from the commotion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> What the hell Ca- Garcia!?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> We need to leave before more show up!</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia flee the scene, after turning a corner, they look back and spot more instances of SCP-8657-1 flying toward the statue.</em></p>
<p><em>They immediately disperse.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> I don't think we should stick around here much longer.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> No shit!</p>
<p><em>The agents head back into the vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Drive, drive, drive!</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia peers into the rearview. Three instances of SCP-8657-1 can be seen approaching<br/>
the vehicle. Schmidt steps on the gas and the jeep careens through the crowd as people jump<br/>
to avoid the vehicle. Cursing and screaming can be hears from the outside.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> What the hell…?</p>
<p><em>Agent Garcia moves the camera towards the window and points it upwards.</em></p>
<p><em>Multiple instances of SCP-8657-1 fly above multiple buildings and SCP-8657 speaks over them.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> To my lovely subjects of Phoenix, can you all give me your attention, please? One<br/>
of my drones was shot twice today— can you imagine that? Violence! Grotesque, disgusting…! How could someone be so callous to injure an unarmed civilian? The individuals in question are<br/>
currently heading down the 13th Avenue in a grey 2013 Jeep Patriot! Keep an eye out for them!<br/>
These are your enemies! They envy your freedom and want to take it away from you. I am not<br/>
the one being targeted—its is all of us! This is a declaration of war against freedom!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> They believe that they can escape justice, just because they think my drones aren't human, they believe that they can just kill without consequence! Find them! Bring them to me! Remember, this isn't an act of violence against me—It's violence against all of us! Bring them to me, and I will reward you. You have seen my miracles! Game Master out~!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> You've got to me fucking kidding me.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8657.4:</strong></p>
<p>Following the expedition, Dr. Dawn and Krystal instructed the Agents to rendezvous at a nearby Foundation weapons depot in Phoenix. At some point, the SCP-8657-1 instances that had been in pursuit of the pair had dispersed. To avoid detection, the pair travelled through inside roads, avoiding major highways.</p>
<p>The weapons depot was located underneath the Eiffel Tower replica, which was surrounded by several SCP-8567-1 instances. Due to the high profile nature of Agent Schmidt and Garcia, Dr. Dawn had shared a cursory plan with the officers.</p>
<p>At 5:01 PM, Agent Schmidt enters a nearby hotel wearing a disguise<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> and fired several shots from his sidearm. The crowd was seen dispersing after the fifth shot. Agent Schmidt managed to blend in with the crowd as he makes for the exit with the other partiers. At the same time, Dr. Dawn remotely disengages the Fountains of Bellagio. The response by SCP-8657-1 was immediate as they descended to where the commotion was first heard in the hotel.</p>
<p>At 5:11 PM, SCP-8657 called in reinforcements from Spring Valley and Paradise. Approximately <strong>13</strong> instances of SCP-8657-1 were counted by Schmidt entered the hotel lobby. SCP-8657 announces the activation of the "The Watcher," a surveillance network that permitted SCP-8657 to utilize any device capable of capturing video as surveillance footage, in order to track the movements of Agents Schmidt and Garcia.</p>
<p>At this point, Schmidt and Garcia have already deactivated their body cameras, utilizing only audio. They manage to enter the weapons depot undetected.</p>
<p>There were seven Foundation personnel seeking refuge within the weapons depot. It was clear that the remaining staff members had been under the influence of SCP-8657-2, using Foundation issued devices to stream video games, including "Plants V. Zombies" and "GTA 5."</p>
<p>Due to the risk associated with extraction, Dr. Dawn instructed Agents Garcia and Schmidt to leave the affected staff members behind. Several weapons were collected from the depot.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, SCP-8657 entered the depot. Agent Garcia and Schmidt immediately retreat to a hidden chamber leading to the subterranean emergency exit. During this period, the security cameras within the weapons depot capture SCP-8657 appearing agitated.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I know you're in here~! C'mon, I just want to play.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 approaches the staff present at the depot, they ignore his presence until he speaks to them.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> <em>He leans over them.</em> Hello there!</p>
<p><em>They do not look up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I said, <em>hello there!</em></p>
<p><em>All screens displaying video games go blank.</em></p>
<p><strong>Personnel 1:</strong> Uh? Oh… M-master?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Have you seen these two? <em>The screen on SCP-8657's head illuminates, revealing two side-by-side images of Agents Garcia and Schmidt.</em></p>
<p><em>The personnel look at each other and shrug.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Right. That's fine. Fine, fine, fine.</p>
<p><em>The screens turn back on and the personnel immediately return to playing again.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> <em>Gestures to the SCP-8657-1 instances.</em> They couldn't have gotten far. Find them, and bring them to me.</p>
<p><em>One of the SCP-8657-1 instances is seen heading towards the emergency exit. SCP-8657 loiters in the main hall. After a few minutes, the television screen on his head appears to display static.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> N-no..</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Don't… fail… otherwise… takeaway.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> <em>SCP-8657 is briefly out of frame.</em> I know, I know! Just give me more time! I won't waste your gift on me! I swear! I lost them for now, but I will get them to join the rest of humanity and if I am forced to… they will be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Good… now… do… it.</p>
<p><em>The television screen returns to normal.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You! <em>SCP-8657 points at the nearest instance of SCP-8657-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> W-where are my parents? I need my mother.</p>
<p><em>There is a long pause as SCP-8657-1 appears to search through its database.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> I am unable to locate them.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Spread out then! I want 90% of the drones exploring this and the surrounding states for my parents and if anything has happened to them I'll punish whoever is responsible for this.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Understood Game Master.</p>
<p><em>The SCP-8657-1 instance flies out of the room.</em></p>
<p><em>The footage cuts out at this moment.</em></p>
</div>
<p>It was unclear who or what the entity communicating with SCP-8657 was. However, Agent Schmidt, Garcia, and O5-2 were all able to leave the weapons depot relatively unscathed. Agent Garcia suffered a minor laceration due to a pursuing SCP-8657 instance hurling a projectile at her. As the instances approached, SCP-8657's voice can be heard demanding that the agents be terminated on sight.</p>
<p>SCP-8675-1 become aggravated, but did not manifest any weapons. During the assault, it is believed that Agent Garcia and O5-2 were attempting to hotwire a car, as their Foundation-issue vehicle had been destroyed by SCP-8657. Agent Schmidt was able to destroy several of the pursuing instances. Eventually, Agent Garcia, Agent Schmidt and O5-2 had entered the vehicle. At this point, SCP-8657 appeared to abandon the pursuit, in an attempt to locate its parents.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8657.5:</strong><br/>
SCP-8657's parents were located following the retrieval of SCP-8657's genetic material from a discarded red solo cup during one of its rare public appearances on 8/20/2025. Although no matches were produced from within the Foundation's extensive database, through analysis of ███████. org's database, a close familial match was discovered to Nicole and James Whitman of Phoenix Arizona. Records collected from the Whitmans' home indicated that the couple had indeed had a male child, born ████ Whitman on 02/15/2002.</p>
<p>SCP-8657's parents were interviewed to determine the extent of SCP-8657's anomalous properties, and whether it had always been anomalous.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. and Mr. Whitman are seated side-by-side. Mrs. Whitman is shivering and huddled against her husband.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Good evening, Mrs. and Mr. Whitman, my name is Dr. Krystal. Officer Schmidt should have debriefed you?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Where is my son? What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Please relax, Mrs. Whitman. We're here to help you—we were hoping you'd have some information regarding your son.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> What is about? We were perfectly safe!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Have you been outside?</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Whitman looks at her husband sheepishly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Do you think my baby did all this?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> <em>She nods.</em> Our agents confronted it-</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Don't you dare call my boy an it!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Excuse me. I meant to say, we confronted your son and he attempted to harm our agents.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> That doesn't sound like my baby at all! He wouldn't hurt a fly! He loved all sorts of animals, tell her, James. He had a little kitten that he loved to death. Oh, and he had lots of plants. He always liked plants…</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> What she's trying to say is, he ain't the type to hurt people on purpose. He's always been a little… different. But he ain't a criminal. I'm sorry about what happened to your boys. But it wasn't on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Please don't hurt him!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> We have no intentions to harm your son, Mrs. Whitman. We're looking for some additional information. When did… your son become different?</p>
<p><em>The Whitmans look at each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> He's always been different. Isn't that right James? He never got along with the other kids—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> That's not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Let her finish! Goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Uhm, yes. There was a lot of bullying, wasn't there? And the teachers never did anything!</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Damn right! We had to take matters into our own hands.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> <em>She nods.</em> He's been homeschooled since he was…12? No, dear when was it? Right, 13! We did eighth grade through high school at home. But I wasn't much of a teacher, and James was always busy at the shop… I tried my best.</p>
<p><em>Tears well up in Mrs. Whitman's eyes and her husband places a hand over hers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> P-pardon me. I tried my best… He never really had many friends. But he loved watching TV and playing video games. He had a lot of online friends… At least that's what I think he was doing, when he was talking to himself all day. Y'know, like one of those-those <em>gamers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> What sort of online friends?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Oh, we never pried too much. We weren't that sort of parents. We already knew he had it rough…He was trying his best, but sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Nicky… You were a good mother.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> You say that…! You say that <em>now</em> but look at our son he's…he's…!</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Whitman begins sobbing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> We can stop if you need to-</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> <em>Sniffles and wipes her tears on the sleeve of her cardigan.</em> No, no. I'm fine. I'm just so worried… I don't want him to hurt anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Has he ever hurt anyone? Or done anything that made you think he had violent tendencies?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> <em>He shakes his head.</em> No, no he was an angel. But there were times where we'd.. disagreed. Y'know, the kind of stuff you don't talk about at Thanksgiving. But we never had people over…</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> He liked to talk. He talked and talked and he filled our heads with so many ideas! He used to draw, but he stopped once we started homeschooling him. He spent most of his time alone in his room, talking to his online friends.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Whitman chuckles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> What's the matter?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Oh, nothin'. I'm starting to realize he probably spent most of his time with those online friends of his. Or on his computer.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> He preferred when we brought up his dinner to his room. He'd always forget to eat if we didn't… I hope he's okay now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Your son is fine. Do you have any idea of the content of discussion between your son and his online "friends."</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> I told you, we're not the kind of parents to ask too many questions. As long as he was happy…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Your son's happiness is coming at the expense of others.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> What do you want us to do about it? We're cooperating the best we can.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> When did your son become a television?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Oh! That's certainly a way to phrase it… I don't know. It must have been on 8/14/2025. We found out with the rest of you, I promise to God!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Mr. Whitman?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> W-What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Is there something you'd like to share with me?</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Whitman looks at her husband with curious eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Dear, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> I… I snooped once. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it—I was just worried that he was mixing with the wrong crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> And what did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Nicky, there was something wrong with that boy.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Don't talk about my baby like that!</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Ever since the shrink put him on the drugs, he'd been acting strange. Not like his former self.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> Shut up! You don't know that! You're not even around enough to notice.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> He was talking with something. I could hear it in the room! Something gouding him. It didn't sound… It didn't sound human.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Why didn't you disclose this before?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> You were making him out to be threat! He ain't but… He's just a troubled kid, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> We just want the best for him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> And what exactly was your son saying to the voice?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> <em>He shuffles nervously in his seat.</em> I didn't catch a whole lot of it. I may have showed up near the end… I don't know. I felt like it wasn't something I was supposed to be listening to.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Uh.. It sounded like it was coming from one of his speakers, the old Sony one I gifted him for his 16th birthday. It had a crackling edge… It sounded distant.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> At first, I just heard him say, "I want to get better, I want everyone to be happy." And I thought he was just talking with his computer buddies. They always had those kind of pseudo-intellectualist conversations, from what I've heard.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> <em>He tightens his grip on his wife's hand. His face appears to become paler.</em> I was gonna go in, tell'em that I loved him enough the way he was. That his mother loved him, too. But then I heard the voice-and felt it too. In my bones. It freaked me out real bed. Sounded like TV static. Said something along the lines of, "What can you give me?" I pressed my ear against the door to hear more but…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> James, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> <em>He shakes his head.</em> I should've listened more. I thought it was one of his games-but something in my bones told me that I wasn't supposed to be there. So I left.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> When was this?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> 8/6/2025. So, two weeks ago.</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Whitman appears pale. Tears are striking down her face.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Is there any other identifiable information? Is the speaker still in your possession.</p>
<p><em>The couple looks at each other.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> No, he tossed it out.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> When did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Whitman:</strong> The day after…8/7/2025. I remember because he always had a habit of forgetting to take the trash out. That was the first time he did it without me asking.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Whitman:</strong> Shit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Thanks, that will be all.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8657.6:</strong></p>
<div>
<p>After SCP-8657’s parents shared information about the entity, the staff of Site-9 proceeded to its home in [REDACTED], CA following background checks on its parents. The goal was to establish a new base of operations for Site-9 personnel.</p>
<p>No incidents occurred when Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia were sent to scout the location. However, during the transfer of staff and supplies, various televisions throughout the city suddenly turned black, displaying pixelated smiles. SCP-8657 then declared, “I’m going to get every single last one of you!”</p>
<p>Subsequently, SCP-8657 deployed between eighty and one hundred (80–100) instances of SCP-8657-1 to capture personnel. Caught off guard, we split up to minimize the risk of mass capture. When the assault ended and the survivors regrouped at the new base, only six personnel remained.</p>
<p>The fate of the others was unknown until the following morning, when Researcher Chang was found standing in front of a supermarket, playing a farming simulator. She provided no useful information aside from expressing happiness that The Game Master had located her brother and provided them both a shared residence, as he had been homeless prior to the broadcast.</p>
<p>O5-█ subsequently entered SCP-8656 to order additional instances of SCP-8656-04 in preparation for the upcoming confrontation. Tomorrow, the remaining staff and I intend to make our final stand against SCP-8657.</p>
<p>Once this addendum is filed, the document will be made freely available on the internet in the event of our failure, so that someone might find this record and attempt to undo the damage, restoring Earth to its previous state. O5-█ has also provided a secret weapon allowing unrestricted access to any room within the residence.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will suffice.</p>
<p>Secure. Contain. Protect.</p>
<p>— Dr. Krystal</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 8657.7:</strong> After devising a plan, O5-█ assembled everyone to go over it and ready them for the confrontation.</p>

<p><strong>Exploration Video Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/22/2025</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8657 residence</p>
<p><strong>Team Lead:</strong> O5-█</p>
<p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Dr. Krystal, Dr. Dawn, Agent Schmidt, Agent Garcia, D-1344</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> We have our plan; now we just have to enact it. Does everyone have their weapons and ammo?</p>
<p><em>The staff load their various weaponry.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Good. Does everyone have their last bites ready and labeled?</p>
<p><em>The staff nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Any last-minute questions before we go through with this?</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Why do you all trust me with a gun?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> We don’t, but we know you don’t want to get caught. If you mess up, SCP-8657 will likely terminate you, since you’re a criminal of some sort by your D-class uniform. Follow my orders and you’ll make it out alive.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ sneezes.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> The plan is nice and simple: distraction, infiltration, distraction two, infiltrate SCP-8657’s room, and search for anything that can point us toward ending this. I scoped out the house before all of this happened — it was a simple two-story house with multiple bathrooms and bedrooms. However, now it has grown to five stories high and has expanded outward in all directions.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ sighs and sits down on a nearby chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Before we do this, does anyone have any final words? There’s a chance we all die, get converted, or some mixture of both. What I have to say is: it’s an honor to be with the last hope of humanity, and as scary as the situation is, I’ve had some fun.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Dawn, I have a crush on you, and if we make it through this, do you want to go out sometime?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> I didn't expect to hear that. Dawn?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> I’ll think about it. When this is all over, I’ll let you know, Krystal.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> I understand. If the answer is yes, meet me back at Site-9 at ten.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Anyone else?</p>
<p><em>There is silence for four seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Alright then. Let's move out and take back the world.</p>
<p><em>The staff cheer in unison.</em></p>
<p><em>The staff leave the room, enter an elevator, and press the top button.</em></p>
<p><em>The elevator opens inside a closet; O5-█ opens the closet doors and leads the staff out.</em></p>
<p><em>After a minute, the staff exit the "abandoned" building, split up, and enter three separate vehicles.</em></p>
<p><em>All three vehicles follow the same road, while nearby screens display pixelated smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Attention, everyone, leave the city! Touch the screen with your hand or face, and you will be transported to a safe location. I have some troublemakers to deal with.</p>
<p><em>As the staff continues to drive, the civilians begin to follow the instructions and are slowly dematerialized.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Now that we're all alone, I have something to say. I know exactly where you are going, and I can promise you this: I have something really special to show all of you if you continue to proceed. If you surrender now, you won't be executed—you'll just become more of my subjects to rule in the name of peace.</p>
<p><em>There are ten seconds of silence, except for the sound of engines.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Fine. Have it your way. Just another mile. Five… four… three… two… one.</p>
<p><em>The vehicles slow down and stop.</em></p>
<p><em>The staff exit the vehicles.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Here is what I want to show you. You have good taste if you recognize what video game this is from, or at least the inspiration.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs, and the nearby TV screens turn off.</em></p>
<p><em>The team looks around, and shortly after, an earthquake occurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Holy crap, what a bad time for an earthquake!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Look at the house!</p>
<p><em>The residence of SCP-8657 rises from the ground and continues to rise, revealing that the house is just the top of a castle.</em></p>
<p><em>After spotting the castle, the team starts to retreat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I don't think so, you little thorns!</p>
<p><em>A laser fires out of a house window, and the vehicles explode.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Please tell me you guys have something for this!</p>
<p><em>The castle finishes rising from the ground, shortly after folding into a humanoid shape.</em></p>
<p><em>The windows of the castle combine into two giant windows, tinted black and white.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle sprouts arms and legs and takes one step forward.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Let's play a game!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Small change in plan: everyone retreats to a safe distance and waits until I give the order!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Sir, we—</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Now!</p>
<p><em>The staff flee the scene.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> What are you going to do, old man? Be a piece of gum on my "shoe" and slow me down for a second?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Just this.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small plastic bag.</em></p>
<p><em>He opens it and eats the "lizard tail" whole.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle takes another step forward to stomp on O5-█.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ begins to grow, reaching an estimated height of 30½m<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup> tall.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ pushes the castle back and stands tall, raising his arms.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You sneaky old-timer. Too bad I can do this!</p>
<p><em>An antenna extends from the house and glows in a variety of colors before releasing a "tidal wave."</em></p>
<p><em>The "tidal wave" washes over the city—presumably the planet—with no effect on O5-█ or the Site-9 staff.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> What?! How?! You should be passive!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> I'll tell you after I kick your ass!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Should I… no. I'll save it for later.</p>
<p><em>The castle charges toward O5-█, who charges back in return.</em></p>
<p><em>Both swing; their fists collide, causing a shockwave that shakes the city.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I have not come this far to build a perfect world just for an old man to take it away from me!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ punches the castle. It stumbles back before grabbing O5-█'s head and lowering it.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle raises its "knee" to strike O5-█ and attempts to punch him, but O5-█ catches the fist, pulls it toward himself, and suplexes it.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> I'm old, but not out of shape.</p>
<p><em>Loud beeping is heard from the castle.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Attention all drones! Converge on my location and support me in battle. Take the giant old man out!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> You coward.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Like I said—I will not let you take this world from me!</p>
<p><em>The castle rolls over, stands back up, and sidesteps O5-█'s punch attempt, followed by a spin kick.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle lands five punches to O5-█'s stomach.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Tired yet?</p>
<p><em>O5-█ coughs up blood, then wipes it on his shirt.</em></p>
<p><em>In the distance, millions of SCP-8657-1 instances can be seen flying toward the fight.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle turns to look at the approaching swarm.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Finally!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ grabs an arm and rips it off the castle.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I just had that installed!</p>
<p><em>The castle retreats a short distance to make space for the SCP-8657-1 horde.</em></p>
<p><em>The horde surrounds O5-█, lands on him, and begins stabbing him.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Get off me, you mosquitoes!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ swings his arms and rubs his body furiously before running a short distance away.</em></p>
<p><em>The horde pursues. O5-█ turns around, inhales deeply, then exhales a powerful gust that blows the horde away.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ turns to face the castle and charges toward it.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Shit! Come on, arm, get back on! Get back on! Get ba—</p>
<p><em>O5-█ dives into the castle, both crashing onto the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ rips off both legs and throws them aside.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Do you surrender?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Never!</p>
<p><em>The bottom of the castle, where the legs were previously attached, begins blasting heat from the exposed ports.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle boosts away from O5-█ before flying upward.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Which button was it…? Found it.</p>
<p><em>The castle’s remaining arm transforms into a cannon and fires giant spheres of electricity. O5-█ ducks to dodge the blast.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs maniacally as the cannon continues firing repeatedly. O5-█ keeps dodging, now visibly sweating.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Dance for me! The Game Master commands you!</p>
<p><em>The cannon aims lower and fires at O5-█’s feet. O5-█ starts jumping backward.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I don’t know how you turned yourself into a giant, but I will defeat you! Now be electrocuted like a common criminal—and fall!</p>
<p><em>The cannon adjusts slightly higher and scores a hit. O5-█ is knocked to the ground, clutching his chest.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs, then falls silent, watching O5-█ lying motionless on the surface.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> My… heart…</p>
<p><em>The castle is seen hovering backward briefly.</em></p>
<p><em>After five seconds, it fires another shot at O5-█.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> (screaming) There’s a spider on your arm!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Where?!</p>
<p><em>The castle flails and spins in mid-air, shaking erratically.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ stands back up and punches the center of the castle, sending it flying backward while rotating. The castle regains its balance.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> That is not funny!</p>
<p><em>The cannon breaks off.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Oh, son of a bitch!</p>
<p><em>The castle flies far away, then turns back around to face O5-█. It grows spikes all over its body and rapidly charges to slam into O5-█ in a last-ditch attempt to terminate him.</em></p>
<p><em>While flying, the castle turns invisible, hiding itself and the jets of flame.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ takes a step back and breathes deeply. After ten seconds, he ducks and punches skyward, colliding with the castle.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle is sent upward, and the jets of flame begin to die out.</em></p>
<p><em>The castle spins around frantically before landing back on the surface, disabled.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ starts shrinking back to normal size.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Everyone, head inside now!</p>
<p><em>Site-9 staff return to the location, and everyone enters the castle as smoke billows from various gaps in its structure.</em></p>
<p><em>Inside, the team finds an escalator—slow but functional.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone steps onto the escalator and rides it. O5-█ reaches into his pocket and presses a button.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> When I was working for The Game Master, I took one of his little buddies and just barely reprogrammed it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Didn’t think you had it in you.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> I do. Just… took me a while. Had to look up a few YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Dear god… the old man knows how to use a computer. This truly is the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Thanks for making fun of a one-hundred-twenty-year-old man.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> You’re over a hundred years old?! You look like you’re in your late fifties, maybe mid-sixties.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> You're gonna make me blush.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Why didn’t the wave affect our minds?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Remember that weird soup you all ate before we left? It made us immune to reality-bending events. Although in two minutes, it’ll stop taking effect.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Gotcha.</p>
<p><em>A drone flies over to the team; they ready their weapons.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Relax! This is her. Tina, say hi to humanity’s last hope.</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Greetings. What can I do for you today?</p>
<p><em>The escalator stops. The team looks over the side and sees how far they are from the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Dawn holds tightly to the rails; Dr. Krystal rests her hand on hers to comfort her.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Can you get this moving?</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Sure. Want me to play the audio as well?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Audio? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Okay. One moment.</p>
<p><em>After ten seconds, the elevator starts again and a voice fills the silence.</em></p>
<p><strong>Joselin:</strong> Hello, visitors!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> What is this?</p>
<p><em>Joselin stops speaking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> This is Joselin, the system’s voice to greet visitors. Please remain silent.</p>
<p><strong>Joselin:</strong> Interruptions ceased. Continuing greeting.</p>
<p><em>Cheerful music begins to play.</em></p>
<p><strong>Joselin:</strong> Hello, visitors! Whether you are from another planet, dimension, time, or universe, let me be the first to say that you are going to love The Game Master!</p>
<p>One night, The Game Master woke up in a cold sweat and heard a knocking at his window. He looked outside and saw his mother, so he left his bed and went outside. Once he met her, she quickly started to float in the air, and her appearance rapidly changed. The entity—which he refers to as his boss—then revealed its true form to him. Scared, he started to back away when it spoke to him in a slow and glitchy manner. It came to offer him a single wish, with only two conditions: that he think about it thoroughly for a few days before enacting it, planning out every detail, and that he follow its instructions should it return.</p>
<p>The Game Master did just that. He pondered the idea for a few days and showed his new form and abilities to his family to gain their trust and comfort. The next day, he broadcast to the entire world—on every TV channel, smartphone, and anything with a screen—letting humanity know they were about to be saved and enter a new age of peace and relaxation.</p>
<p>The day after the broadcast, he went to the roof of his house, pointed to the heavens with one arm, and snapped his fingers with the other. This created a tidal-wave-like energy that almost instantaneously transformed the planet.</p>
<p>Everyone on Earth—except his family and an individual known as [REDACTED], now head of security for the North American continent—became passive. Crime became impossible to commit. His subjects were only capable of entertainment and basic human needs, such as sustaining themselves and waste disposal.</p>
<p>Thanks to The Game Master’s wish, Earth is now a utopia—no more crime, and everyone can relax, watching TV shows, movies, playing video games, and creating those things.</p>
<p>If by chance the "boss" returns, let me welcome you and thank you for blessing our master with his single wish.</p>
<p>We're almost there now. Walk forward and meet the amazing, the glorious, the skillful, the rizzful, and most importantly, kindful ruler of the planet: The Game Master!</p>
<p><em>Audio of a crowd clapping is heard.</em></p>
<p><em>The team reaches the top of the escalator. Dr. Krystal helps Dr. Dawn get off and removes her hand from hers.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Don't mention it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Tina, open the door, please.</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Affirmative. Do you request anything else?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Is there a way to undo all the brainwashing from the planet? Some of us will distract him while the rest explore his room for a way to undo it. If not there, then the rest of the castle, now that it cannot move or fight back.</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> There is. The Game Master had a dark feeling in his heart, so when he made his wish, he created a button that, when pressed, would undo all the effects he caused on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Why the hell did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Unknown. He only told the drones that he had a bad feeling and made it when he made his wish. Of course, he also made all the drones, the castle-robot hybrid, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> Did he make anything else we should know about?</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> If he has, he hasn't shared it with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Great. Wait, where is this button to undo everything?</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> It’s with him. There’s an extremely high likelihood he isn’t just going to let you take it—or even lend it to you. You’ll have to fight him to obtain it.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Well, we have guns and anomalous food to boost ourselves. Tina, open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Tina:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><em>Tina flies over to the door. An appendage extends from her “head” and interfaces with the lock.</em></p>
<p><em>After a minute, the door opens and the team enters.</em></p>
<p><em>As the team enters the room, the lights turn off. They stand together, slowly moving inward with weapons raised in all directions.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You know… when I found out a shooter or two was at Las Vegas, I panicked. I despise killers and was ready to enact swift execution. However, once I learned that no one was harmed—besides the fear of being near a shooter—I realized something.</p>
<p><em>Silence for three seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> None of you are killers. Never have been, never will be. That’s a line you do not wish to cross.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Close by. I just wanted to get something off my chest before we engage one final time. I’ll ask you one last time: surrender. You can each have a continent to yourselves to rule. Of course, you will obey my every command—but still. You each get a continent to hold onto. The last one? Mine.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Does the old man speak for all of you? One by one, confirm it.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> At this point, I’m just going to help these guys out. Might even get a medal or something for this.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> The deal is just bribery, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> You think doing this is justified?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> The entire planet is brainwashed because of you. If you truly wanted to save lives, you wouldn’t control them like puppets.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> With all this control, if I took the deal, I’d never be true to myself. Knowing I helped a dictator.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I… see all your views. Understandable. But I have one final question: why do you all want to return the Earth to the way it was? True dictators, bigots, killers, con artists, liars, thieves—that’s just humans. After finding that weapons depot, I did more digging. On top of the world’s problems, you deal with monsters, mind readers, things that kill you for having the wrong dream or thought, things that mutilate you or others just for using something ordinary. Why do you want to go back to that?!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> As cheesy as this sounds, it’s true. The world isn’t perfect or safe, but it’s ours. Free will changes how the world works. Even if someone evil is in charge, eventually something happens, and things get better. You took the easy way, not the right way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Well then, let’s see whose will is stronger. Mine ensures safety and fun. Yours ensures chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Shut the hell up! Come out already and give us the button before we take it!</p>
<p><em>The room shakes. The team’s guns and ammunition lift to the ceiling.</em></p>
<p><em>The magnet seals itself away in the ceiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> It’s finally time.</p>
<p><em>The lights turn on. The team sees a giant gap in the floor and freezes.</em></p>
<p><em>They turn around to see the path they walked break away behind them.</em></p>
<p><em>Turning again, they see SCP-8657 standing on the other side of the gap.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I have one last drone, and if I’m going down, I want it to be on my terms. Drone!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Yes, Game Master?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> We’re going live. You’re the camera! Get us on every screen in the world!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Understood. We… are now live.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Greetings, my loyal subjects! Tonight will be a monumental event—the fate of the entire planet hangs in the balance! These men and women want to undo my power… the power that brought this world into tranquility!</p>
<p>Drone, activate Final Underscore Fight, please.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657-1:</strong> Activating in 3… 2… 1…</p>
<p><em>A tidal wave of black, white, and grey energy erupts from the drone.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> If I can't force your minds to change, I can at least force you to fight me… my way. Ever heard of Undertale?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> I love that game. Wait—did you just…?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I did. When we fight, it's turn-based. RPG style. Just like the game, each of you gets four options. Although from my testing, I can’t see what you "select"—your choices are only visible in your mind.</p>
<p>But… I did make one little addition: I get more turns. Since there are six of you, it’s one of you… Then me. You again… then me again. Fair, right?</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained the rules to you—and to my lovely viewers around the world—place your bets!</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> You have problems.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 turns to look at D-1344.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Shut up.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 turns back to the SCP-8657-1 instance.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Now then…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 clears his throat and stretches his arms and legs.</em></p>
<p><em>The gap between the team and SCP-8657 is suddenly filled.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Hello, world! Let’s play some games!</p>
<p><em>He throws a microphone at the team. The camera distorts. Reality shifts. The "final fight" begins.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Hold on—I almost forgot… music! Just need to put it on loop and there we go.</p>
<p><em>A pounding synth beat starts. The lights pulse. SCP-8657 begins to bounce in place rhythmically, hips swaying.</em></p>
<p><em>The screen on SCP-8657's head activates, displaying a pixelated, wide-eyed smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Okay, uh… this one.</p>
<p><em>D-1344 throws his fist forward. A glowing square grid locks around SCP-8657. High above, a massive ethereal fist manifests—mimicking D-1344’s punch—and slams downward with incredible force.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 lets out a loud, gleeful laugh and sidesteps the attack with ease.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> My turn, you noob.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 performs a backflip and claps its hands twice, takes two steps to its right and claps again, then finishes by spinning in a circle.</em></p>
<p><em>Shortly after, a glowing square forms around D-1344. Above SCP-8657, giant spectral hands manifest.</em></p>
<p><em>The hands pull back and clap twice, releasing visible shockwaves toward D-1344 in two sets of three.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 narrowly dodges the shockwaves, but the hands reposition and release another barrage.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 is struck by the second wave. A number appears above his head for one second, displaying "170/200."</em></p>
<p><em>The hands then spin rapidly, generating a miniature tornado that charges toward D-1344. He runs to evade, but the tornado pursues him for five seconds before dissipating.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Now that is how you attack!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657's screen briefly displays a pixelated laughing face before returning to its standard smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> My turn, you gaming abomination.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal delivers two kicks, then spins while moving for ten seconds before coming to a stop.</em></p>
<p><em>Two perpendicular red lines appear on the floor. Spectral legs begin kicking rapidly within the confines of the lines.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 ducks and dodges, crouching low. A tornado begins to move toward it.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 performs a circular cartwheel, avoiding contact with the tornado entirely.</em></p>
<p><em>After completing the maneuver, it backs into a corner and assumes a ready stance.</em></p>
<p><em>The tornado splits into four smaller ones, which cross in an "X" pattern. SCP-8657 evades them with ease, maintaining significant distance.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You’ll have to do better than that if you want to hit me. Remember the end of my broadcast?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal's expression shows visible confusion.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 brings its hands together. A microphone materializes between them.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 throws microphones in multiple patterns: straight line, diagonal, horizontal. It then materializes five additional microphones and tosses them into the air. They land in five separate spots on the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>Moments later, spectral microphones appear and are launched toward Dr. Krystal in the same patterns. Upon impact with the ground, each explodes.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal dodges the initial arcs, but the final five microphones drop from above and detonate within the attack radius. She is caught in the blast.</em></p>
<p><em>A number appears above her head: "60/120.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Krystal!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> I'm fine. Ow.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I'm sure you know what happens if that number reaches zero.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> I'm gonna try something different.</p>
<p><em>A magnifying glass materializes in Dr. Dawn's right hand.</em></p>
<p><em>She raises it and looks through it at SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>Numbers appear above SCP-8657: "8650/8650" and a string of illegible text.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> We need to use combo attacks to make it harder for him to dodge</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Clever… very clever you little lady.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 throws microphones into the air five times in rapid succession, then claps its hands once.</em></p>
<p><em>Shortly afterward, microphones drop from the ceiling above Dr. Dawn.</em></p>
<p><em>She successfully dodges both the explosions and the shockwaves that follow.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Nice one. I can't even be mad.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Hm. Agent Schmidt, Agent Garcia, you're with me! Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia:</strong> Ready!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ and Agent Schmidt begin spinning in a circle for twenty seconds, while Agent Garcia walks around the square with her arms stretched out toward SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Oh shit.</p>
<p><em>Miniature tornadoes enter the square from multiple sides, each pausing briefly before homing in on SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>After several waves of tornadoes fail to connect, massive arms stretch rapidly into the square, striking and retracting at high speed.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 is hit twice by the tornadoes — numbers appear above its head: "8600/8650." One of the giant arms lands a direct hit — updated numbers flash: "8500/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>The staff cheer loudly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Now see what happens when you land combo attacks on me!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 activates multiple gaming consoles embedded in its arm.</em></p>
<p><em>It extends its arm forward, emitting a beam of light, then waves it in several directions before crossing both arms into an "X" shape.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█, Agent Schmidt, and Agent Garcia are suddenly surrounded by glowing squares on the floor. Giant laser beams fire into the square from random angles.</em></p>
<p><em>Each team member successfully dodges the first few lasers — until an "X"-shaped duo-laser blasts directly into the square, striking all three simultaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>Above O5-█: "450/500."</em></p>
<p><em>Above Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia: "200/250."</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> What the hell?!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 begins laughing maniacally.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> That’s right. Whoever the combo consists of will all be attacked by me when it’s my turn. Choices, choices, choices. Also, all three of you have used your turns, so…</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> It's my turn again?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Correct.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Wait a minute. The food we brought with us… I wonder if…</p>
<p><em>D-1344 pulls out a single red noodle strand and eats it.</em></p>
<p><em>Text appears above D-1344: "Max HP!" followed by "Temporary immunity to sound-based attacks.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You all smuggled food into this fight?! Umm…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 turns on two screens on its arm, tapping each once before they power off.</em></p>
<p><em>A root beer can and a bag of gummy worms materialize in front of SCP-8657, which grabs them.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Healing items don’t fail me now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> You’d be the kind of boss that can heal itself.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Reminds me of when I played Persona 3 Reload and my party member got hypnotized and healed the boss back to full health. Forgot who it was though.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> This is gonna be risky. Everyone, be ready!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal pulls out her phone and takes pictures, Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia make finger guns and "shoot," O5-█ laughs, and Dr. Dawn makes a "spider" shape with her hands.</em></p>
<p><em>After two seconds, a tiny square moves slowly around SCP-8657, taking "pictures" every five seconds. Simultaneously, bullet-shaped projectiles fire at SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 dodges the bullets.</em></p>
<p><em>Shockwaves are sent toward SCP-8657 in a set of five, each larger than the last. The square takes a picture, freezing the attack in place before turning them and continuing to move.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 is hit by a shockwave; a number appears above its head: "8400/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>A spider-like entity crawls around the square. SCP-8657 missteps while dodging and is hit.</em></p>
<p><em>Above its head appears: "8350/8650."</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I’ve got something nasty for all of you.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 snaps its fingers, laughs for two seconds, draws a star on the ground, then snaps its fingers twice.</em></p>
<p><em>Shockwaves hurl toward the staff as they scatter. A smiling face appears on the ground and laughs. After two seconds of uncontrollable laughter, Dr. Dawn and O5-█ get caught inside the mouth when it laughs.</em></p>
<p><em>Above Dr. Dawn: "320/420."</em></p>
<p><em>Above O5-█: "350/500."</em></p>
<p><em>A star slowly draws itself on the ground. When it finishes, it turns black and begins spinning clockwise. While spinning, two hands in a snapping gesture slowly move toward Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia.</em></p>
<p><em>The hands freeze and snap, causing an explosion around them—but both Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia dodge successfully.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> We’re going to be here all day at this rate. Time for something interesting.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Everyone, come here for a second.</p>
<p><em>The staff gathers around D-1344 and each takes a sip from his soda.</em></p>
<p><em>Above everyone’s heads appears: "Max HP!"</em></p>
<p><em>Above D-1344’s head: "Sound-based attack immunity, removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Now I definitely know what I need to do.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 activates two screens on its arm and points them at the ground. Two entities manifest.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Say hello to The Spy and Kirby!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal throws a bag of sugar at Kirby.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirby inhales the bag of sugar and waddles over to the staff’s side of the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Kirby, get your pink, cute body back here! I am The Game Master! Obey me!</p>
<p><em>Kirby hugs Dr. Krystal.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Great. He likes her like a pet. Take this then!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 draws a spiral on the ground and does a cartwheel. After finishing, it slowly closes its hands in on each other.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal immediately hugs the edge of the square as a miniature black hole forms, attempting to suck her into its event horizon.</em></p>
<p><em>Asteroids begin appearing and are pulled into the black hole. One hits Dr. Krystal.</em></p>
<p><em>Above her head appears: "100/120."</em></p>
<p><em>Kirby inhales the root beer can. SCP-8657 tries to hold onto it but loses grip.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You want some food, fatty? Come and get a knuckle sandwich!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 throws the bag of gummy worms in front of Kirby, then rapidly punches the air, follows with three spin kicks, and finishes with a “Hadouken” pose.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirby walks toward the food but is bombarded by a flurry of punches. Numbers appear above its head as its HP rapidly drains.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirby dodges the first spin kick by running toward SCP-8657, backs away to dodge the second, but gets hit by the third.</em></p>
<p><em>Above its head appears: "0/100," and the attack ends prematurely.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, Kirby teleports in front of SCP-8657, repeats the maneuver, and when it lands the kick, it is launched backward and slowly dematerializes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Kirby, no!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> That’s what he gets for taking my stuff. When your health points reach zero, I actually do the attack on you—you’ll be knocked unconscious, or in Kirby’s case, straight up die.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Your mom said you loved Kirby! How could you do that?!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You… you all talked to my mother—and probably my father—behind my back to get information?!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657’s screen glitches and its body twitches.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> That’s it. No more fun. No more screwing around like a pro playing against a newbie who doesn’t know that pressing right-click throws the sandwich out for teammates to use! This is where you all lose! You’ll see!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Please work.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ draws a square on the ground, then a circle inside it, and finally a triangle inside the circle.</em></p>
<p><em>A glowing square slowly fades into the surface around SCP-8657 and The Spy.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 runs out of it just before it turns black.</em></p>
<p><em>The Spy is hit and above his header appears "0/125."</em></p>
<p><em>A circle appears, fades in, and turns black faster than the square. The triangle does the same, catching SCP-8657 inside when it turns black.</em></p>
<p><em>Above SCP-8657’s head appears: "8000/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>The Spy is teleported in front of O5-█ who draws a square on the ground around him again and is erupted into flames before dematerializing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> What the hell?! That is some bullcrap! An attack like that did so much damage in one hit!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> We're turning the tables now. I think?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> They will turn alright. Turn in my favor!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 turns on all the screens on its arm.</em></p>
<p><em>Above SCP-8657’s head appears: "Defense lowered, attack raised."</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ moves around, dodging all the giant knife swings within the square.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ runs to the edge of the square just as the giant knife stabs the center.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt pulls out a bag with a slice of chocolate cake and has everyone come to him.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone takes a bite, and the slice is devoured.</em></p>
<p><em>Above the staff appears: "Attacks cause corrosion on hit.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> You know what? Fuck this! Let's try some different genres.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes two steps forward and violently twitches while screaming in pain.</em></p>
<p><em>Its head shakes wildly before freezing in place.</em></p>
<p><em>Its screen displays static, then the text "Horror" appears.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms into a hotel-like maze, scattering the staff throughout the small labyrinth.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup></em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Find the exit before I slice and dice you with these giant knife arms!</p>
<p><em>The staff search around the maze, as does SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>After a couple of minutes, Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia find the exit.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ runs into SCP-8657 and flees.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Let me sell you the dream!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal stands by the exit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> The exit is over here! Hurry!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Dawn arrives at the exit and waits.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ turns multiple corners, losing SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█, Dr. Dawn, and Dr. Krystal all take the exit.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal, and SCP-8657 falls to the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> "When is chapter 5 releasing?" Impatient ignoramuses.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> He's down! Whoop his ass!</p>
<p><em>The staff all do spin kicks.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 doesn’t dodge the attacks; the last text appearing above its head is "7000/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>After two seconds, SCP-8657 takes damage from the "corrosion." Above it appears: "6900/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657’s figure can be seen in the fog, approaching the team. It twitches violently while shaking its head.</em></p>
<p><em>It moans in pain before freezing in place. Its screen head displays the text: "Puzzle."</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms, and each staff member finds themselves in front of a "Tetris" machine on the wall.</em></p>
<p><em>The smoke blocks the top three layers of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>A timer starts counting down from four minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>After a minute, D-1344 growls in anger as he fails to move an "L" shaped piece into position.</em></p>
<p><em>After three minutes, D-1344 fails, the rest pass.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal, the smoke clears, and D-1344 is hit by the "L" shaped block and couldn’t avoid it.</em></p>
<p><em>Above his head appears: "50/200."</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Sir, you dropped this.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 pretends to pick up an "L" from the ground and shows it to D-1344.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes two steps forward and twitches violently. Its screen head displays the text, "Shooter."</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms into Site-19 by the training grounds.</em></p>
<p><em>Five additional copies of SCP-8657 appear near the original, all armed.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Go for headshots for an easy win, me! And me, and me, and me, and me!</p>
<p><em>The six of them split up and take cover, as does the staff.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia sneak around and go through the cafeteria to get behind them.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ peeks and is shot in the shoulder, immediately taking cover.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Dawn and Dr. Krystal each grab a grenade, pull the pins, and throw them at the copies.</em></p>
<p><em>The grenades explode, eliminating three of the six SCP-8657 members.</em></p>
<p><em>The remaining three pop out of cover and fire upon the crates shielding O5-█, Dr. Dawn, and Dr. Krystal.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia sneak behind them and shoot all three in the head.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal. SCP-8657 falls forward onto the ground and cannot stand.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia, do a barrage of punches! O5 guy, do sweeping kicks! Doctors, hold hands and spin in a circle together!</p>
<p><em>The staff do as instructed.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes all the hits. When the doctors spin in a circle, their attack glows blue.</em></p>
<p><em>Above SCP-8657’s head appears: "4000/8650," followed shortly by: "Attacks are more likely to miss."</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes more corrosion damage; above it appears: "3900/8650," then "Corrosion wore off!"</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 twitches violently but falls forward onto the ground.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Dr. Krystal, I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> Trust me.</p>
<p><em>The staff repeats their previous action. Dr. Dawn kisses Dr. Krystal, sending out a heart-shaped projectile.</em></p>
<p><em>Above SCP-8657’s head appears: "2500/8650," and above Dr. Krystal’s head appears: "Defense up, Attack up."</em></p>
<p><em>Above the rest of the staff (except Dr. Krystal) appears: "Damage buff reverted."</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Love you too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 stands back up and taps every screen on its arm. Above its head appears: "Extra turn gained."</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> You slippery snake!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> So close too!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> It… cannot end like this.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657’s screen does a “cough” before it walks forward and violently twitches.</em></p>
<p><em>Once it freezes in place, the screen displays the word: "Platformer."</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms into grassy plains with various moving platforms and pits.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> See… you at the end, losers!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 starts to jump and spin its arms in the air for more airtime while running toward the goal post.</em></p>
<p><em>The staff begin to follow.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 does wall jumps to climb and accidentally makes a "misinput," causing a ground pound.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Crap, crap, crap, crap!</p>
<p><em>The staff wall-jump ahead and take the lead.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 follows suit, and when it reaches the top, it goes left to grab a fire flower. It then throws fireballs at the staff.</em></p>
<p><em>One hits Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia, causing them to freeze in place, wave their arms in the air, and "fall" through the terrain.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█, Dr. Dawn, and Dr. Krystal make it to the end.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> That old man reminds me of my great-grandfather. Such skill.</p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia are struck by fireballs.</em></p>
<p><em>Above their heads display: "50/250" and "Burning!"</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657's screen flashes red.</em></p>
<p><em>"Attack up!" appears above its head.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 walks over to Agent Schmidt and slaps his hand.</em></p>
<p><em>The turn is passed to Agent Schmidt.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> When did you learn that?</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Just now. Thank you "ACT."</p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt grabs a drink and shares it with Agent Garcia.</em></p>
<p><em>Above their heads appears: "Burning removed!"</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> This should finish you both off in one fell swoop! I am the star of the show! I'm the name that you should know!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 grabs a microphone, puts it to its mouth, and begins screaming, laughing, then throws it.</em></p>
<p><em>Shockwaves quickly rush toward Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia, who dodge them.</em></p>
<p><em>Shockwaves come in slowly, but once they pass, they "bounce" around the square.</em></p>
<p><em>Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia keep moving but get caught in the explosion caused by the microphone being thrown.</em></p>
<p><em>Above their heads appears: "0/250", and they are both teleported in front of SCP-8657, who throws another microphone at them.</em></p>
<p><em>The blast sends them backward into a wall, knocking them unconscious.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs maniacally.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Two down, four to go!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657’s screen turns blue and fires a laser at the staff. "Defense down!" appears above their heads.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 looks at Dr. Dawn and Dr. Krystal.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> O5, buff someone when it’s your turn!</p>
<p><em>D-1344, Dr. Krystal, and Dr. Dawn all go hand-in-hand and swing in a circle.</em></p>
<p><em>Every few seconds, they stop and point at SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>After this, three circles move along a set path and fire a projectile at SCP-8657 every few seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 dodges the attack.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 walks forward, static appearing on its screen before it displays the text: "Racing."</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms into a raceway, with everyone except Agent Schmidt and Agent Garcia inside a vehicle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Male voice:</strong> 3… 2… 1… Go!</p>
<p><em>Everyone floors it.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344, Dr. Krystal, and Dr. Dawn all surround SCP-8657's vehicle.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ gets past the finish line. SCP-8657 pulls off a maneuver, causing D-1344, Dr. Dawn, and Dr. Krystal to spiral out of control.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 crosses the finish line.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Let’s see… My attack is up, your defense is down, and you lost. An attack hits you if you lose… and you three did.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 laughs hysterically.</em></p>
<p><em>Cars manifest inside the room and explode. A tire from each car hits D-1344, Dr. Dawn, and Dr. Krystal once.</em></p>
<p><em>All their health points drop to zero, and more tires are flung at them from exploding vehicles.</em></p>
<p><em>Each one is hit again and becomes critically injured.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Just you and me, old man! Time for my final attack to end this!</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> I need to think first.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ walks up to SCP-8657 and turns off all the screens on its arm.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Why is that an option, game?! Stupid, stupid game!</p>
<p><em>Above SCP-8657 appears: "Extra turn removed!" followed by "Attack buff removed!"</em></p>
<p><em>Above O5-█'s head appears: "Defense drop reverted!"</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Time to lose to the master!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 walks forward. Its limbs twitch violently for twenty seconds before freezing. Its screen slowly displays: “Marathon!” — letter by letter.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms into a maze again, this time resembling a sewer.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ hugs the right wall, avoiding SCP-8657’s sight, and reaches the exit.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon reaching it, SCP-8657 takes damage: "2000/8650" appears above its head.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms, splitting in half with a picture missing several pieces.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ and SCP-8657 stare at each other for a moment before scattering around the room, collecting puzzle pieces to fill in the picture.</em></p>
<p><em>After two minutes, O5-█ wins.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Fucking hell!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes damage: "1500/8650" appears above its head.</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms again: a shooting gallery.</em></p>
<p><em>A timer counts down from five.</em></p>
<p><em>When it hits one, cardboard cutouts pop up from various locations. O5-█ and SCP-8657 begin firing.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ drops his revolver by accident, and SCP-8657 continues shooting, landing a bonus hit on a moving target.</em></p>
<p><em>After one minute, the game ends. O5-█ has scored 2,000 points. SCP-8657 scored 6,000 points.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ takes damage: "100/500" appears above his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Are you shitting my balls right now, game? Why four hundred damage instead of five hundred?!</p>
<p><em>The room transforms into a mountaintop. Various floating platforms and flying turtles with spikes on their shells roam the skies.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ and SCP-8657 spot the goal post and start racing to it.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ punches a block and gets a star, making him glow rainbow and become invincible to enemies.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ gets to the end of the course ten seconds after grabbing the star.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Why was that star there?!</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 takes damage. Above its head appears: "900/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 sits in silence as the room transforms into a racetrack in the jungle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Male voice:</strong> 3…2…1… Go!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ and SCP-8657 floor it and shortly after, take different routes to the finish line.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ accidentally swerves into a crocodile and the vehicle spins out before regaining its original direction.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 drifts a little too early and fails to readjust the angle of its car, driving off into a lake.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ gets past as the vehicle is teleported out of the water and back onto the track.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ makes it to the finish line.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 punches the steering wheel before taking damage. Above its head appears: "400/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>The room transforms back to normal and SCP-8657 collapses to the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> I just need one attack to land and… I win.</p>
<p><em>O5-█ pulls out a bag of milk. It glows.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ drags the staff back to the battle and gives each of them a sip. Above all their heads appears the text: "Revive!"</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Yes! We're right there. Why didn’t you buff yourself?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> You'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dawn:</strong> And we're back in action!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Schmidt:</strong> We're one or two attacks away from victory!</p>
<p><strong>Agent Garcia:</strong> Let's do this!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> So close. So close. I need to try…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 swings its arm once before falling to the ground and lying down.</em></p>
<p><em>The team dodges the giant fist manifestation and the area-of-effect attack.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 does a series of punches.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 barely manages to dodge all attacks but one. Above its head: "700/8650."</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal walks up to SCP-8657 and messes with the consoles on its arm.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 is too tired to fight back. Above its head appears: "DEF, ATK down!"</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 cries into a microphone and throws it.</em></p>
<p><em>Tear-shaped objects fall from the ceiling before a microphone does, and it explodes. Dr. Krystal dodges it all.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Dawn does two kicks and two punches.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 gets hit by a kick and then a punch. Above its head appears: "300/8650."</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Do a combo attack with everyone, and we win!</p>
<p><em>O5-█ approaches SCP-8657 and lowers his hand to help it up.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Why? Just kill me and you can all go back to normalcy… or whatever that is for you lot.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Because, like you said, we're not killers.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 rubs its "eyes" on the screen head.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> What happens afterward?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Well, for one: amnestics all over the world, your containment, and the storage or destruction of all the various food and drinks you made. Not to mention the drones.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> So… you're just going to lock me away and make the world forget I ever existed?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Mostly. But if you cooperate, I might be able to convince the other O5 Council members to let your parents live at the site you're contained at, so you aren't alone. You could even make friends there.</p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> What a bunch of—</p>
<p><em>Dr. Krystal and Dr. Dawn each step on a foot belonging to D-1344.</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 silences himself.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Will I… still be able to play games with everyone?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Will I still be able to play online games?</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> With some rules, a computer specifically made for that purpose, and security systems installed, you can.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 ponders in thought.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> You know…</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 looks back at O5-█.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> It's still your turn. You want to take my mercy?</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 stands up and shakes O5-█'s hand.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Call me Elijah.</p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Elijah, where is the button so we can undo all of this?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8657:</strong> Right here.</p>
<p><em>SCP-8657 puts its arm into the screen and it phases through it.</em></p>

<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> Whatever you are, we'll avenge Elijah.</p>
<p><em>The Entity’s legs rise as its knees reach its chest, its arms go inward, covering its face.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Entity:</strong> Let's… play…</p>
<p><em>The Entity starts rapidly changing its skin color—white, black, then gray—mimicking a "rainbow effect."</em></p>
<p><em>It takes a deep inhale.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Entity:</strong> some… games!</p>
<p><em>Its legs lower, and its arms move to its sides, palms raised to the sky.</em></p>
<p><em>It screams loudly.</em></p>
<p><em>The scream recorded is heard to have more than one voice screaming simultaneously.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>The scream lasts ten seconds before ceasing. The sky darkens to pitch black, blocking out the stars, and the rooftop reshapes into a flat arena.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity reshapes its arm back into a blade and with the other arm shoves it down its throat, pulling out a shield.</em></p>
<p><em>It moves its blade arm and fires a burst of energy, hitting O5-█ and dragging the team into a fight.</em></p>
<p><em>The camera distorts.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity looks around, confused.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1344:</strong> Die, you unholy thing!</p>
<p><em>D-1344 unleashes a series of kicks and punches.</em></p>
<p><em>A barrage of projectiles shaped like fists and swinging legs is flung toward The Entity.</em></p>
<p><em>It dodges them all except one, purposely letting it hit.</em></p>
<p><em>Above its head appears “???/∞.”</em></p>
<p><em>Its face twists into a smile as it looks at all six staff, then floats in the air, swinging its blade arm frantically.</em></p>
<p><em>A square surrounds D-1344, with a single line inside. It starts to protrude spikes every second while turning clockwise.</em></p>
<p><em>This continues for a minute, gaining speed, eventually reaching D-1344 and hitting him rapidly.</em></p>
<p><em>Above D-1344's head is “1/200.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> Let’s not fuck around with it—it nearly killed the D-class. Everyone, with me!</p>
<p><em>All staff perform various punches, kicks, spinning moves, “finger guns,” and stretch their arms.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity stands still, “laying back” while floating; every attack lands.</em></p>
<p><em>Above its head, text appears, “???/∞.”</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity clears its throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Entity:</strong> Site-∞… true… enemy.</p>
<p><em>The Entity points to the sky with a finger, slowly lowers it to the ground, then rapidly spins it around, making the finger grow in length before it stops and retracts it back to normal size.</em></p>
<p><em>It goes invisible just before the square around the staff rapidly expands beyond the property.</em></p>
<p><em>Meteors rain down before one, vantablack in color, falls from the sky.</em></p>
<p><em>When it collides with the surface, it turns into a black hole, immediately starting to spaghettify the staff.</em></p>
<p><em>After a minute, the black hole dissipates.</em></p>
<p><em>Text appears over everyone’s heads: all are at a single health point.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Entity:</strong> Time… stretched…</p>
<p><em>D-1344 decides to "Check" The Entity. A magnifying glass appears over his hand, and he uses it to examine the entity. The Entity twists its face into a single eyeball covering 80% of its "face."</em></p>
<p><em>D-1344 immediately vomits.</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> What did you learn?</p>
<p><em>D-1344 begins to cry and collapses onto the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Entity:</strong> Game… boring.</p>
<p><em>The Entity vomits the button out of itself.</em></p>
<p><em>The camera distorts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Krystal:</strong> D-1344, are you okay?</p>
<p><em>D-1344 continues to cry as Dr. Krystal consoles him.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity puts the shield back into its mouth and reverts its blade arm to its normal shape.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity grows eyeballs all over its body; they shed tears. Its right arm extends back down the rooftop entranceway.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity uses the tears to draw the infinity symbol on the ground with its left arm.</em></p>
<p><em>Once done, all but two eyes rapidly decompose and fall to the ground before turning to ashes.</em></p>
<p><em>The ashes blow away, and the right arm returns, holding the corpse of SCP-8657.</em></p>
<p><em>It grows a third arm from its right shoulder and raises it.</em></p>
<p><em>Both arms extend and bend until they form a door shape.</em></p>
<p><em>The Entity's face twists back to blank; with its arms, it moves them in front and uses the “door.” It and SCP-8657 disappear.</em></p>
<p><em>O5-█ stares at the button for a moment and presses it. A tidal wave floods out, undoing the effects of SCP-8657-2, dematerializing all SCP-8657-1 instances, and reversing all effects of SCP-8657's wish.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></em></p>
<p><strong>O5-█:</strong> What… the… hell?</p>
<p><em>O5-█ visibly shakes and removes the shoulder camera.</em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum ∞:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>While celebrating our 5th anniversary inside SCP-8656, we heard it — The Scream. A new menu item had been added in tribute to us and SCP-8655, but once it was complete, the entire pocket dimension fell deathly silent. Dr. Q dared to speak first: “Did anyone else hear that?” That was a big mistake. What began with a few patrons leaving quickly escalated into mass panic, with who knows how many fleeing in terror.</p>
<p>We held each other tightly while remaining seated to avoid being trampled. Only after the chaos ended did we leave SCP-8656, returning to Site-∞ to find staff who were having panic attacks while trying to locate the source of The Scream.</p>
<p>We have determined its origin as SCPF-100386 — a starting branch where the Foundation learns about reality benders, the latest in the 21st century. This is the latest branch, and it is only after Dr. Scranton’s unconventional trip to SCP-3001 in August 2028 that the Foundation begins work on reality anchors. This made it a perfect target for the entity to grant Elijah a wish, knowing no anchors existed to prevent it.</p>
<p>What it did not know was that O5-2 was entrusted with knowledge of Site-∞ and met Dr. W., who shared with her his “theory” regarding reality benders. Since she knew they existed but would not appear in that universe until after anchors were built, she covertly commissioned Exclusionary Site-9 to shift to a location planned for a new site, informing O5-2 afterward. Her actions gave that world a fighting chance against SCP-8657 and The Entity.</p>
<p>The most terrifying aspect is our ability to detect anomalies in timelines. I compare it to inspecting a wooden stick for marks or black spots. This entity did the unthinkable: it corrupted the timeline from the point of departure to the branch’s origin, like a dark line drawn along the trunk of a tree to a specific branch.</p>
<p>Now, we cannot enter SCPF-100386 before its initial departure. Thanks to Dr. W. and the staff at Exclusionary Site-9, we have some understanding of its capabilities.</p>
<p>This entity briefly existed outside time and space, raising concerns about actions that Site-∞ is yet to do or already has, given the inherent instability of time. We might have created it inadvertently, but all we can do now is hope to find it. This leads us to The Scream.</p>
<p>The Scream alone broke the rules of space and time. Every sapient mind across the known multiverse heard it — from the dawn of man to the last. Biological beings, technological entities, those unable to hear, even beings in different dimensions: all heard it.</p>
<p>Imagine what else it can do — or can learn to do. Its powers were limited by the rules of the world when SCP-8657 temporarily imposed the combat mechanics of the RPG, Undertale. It had to wait its turn to attack and even had infinite health. We assume it is immortal in baseline reality.</p>
<p>Many resources have been spent preparing various Foundations for a Broken Masquerade scenario, including massive amnestic wipes and misinformation campaigns chalking it up to mass psychosis. Some Foundations now deal with unique anomalies due to actions taken in response to The Scream.</p>
<p>It is now the first thing we address when discovering new timelines and a mandatory topic for all new Site-∞ employees. The only sapient beings unaware of The Scream are those born, created, or gaining sapience outside of time, often due to experiments.</p>
<p>If anyone has knowledge about the entity or notices timeline corruption, report immediately to your nearest security team or to us. We will contain it, learn what we can, and agree that if we cannot gain anything, we will neutralize it.</p>
<p>It knows this site exists; its drawing of the infinity symbol is unrelated to its mode of transportation, as well as its name-dropping of Site-∞. The multiverse is like ants facing a human — and this entity chose neither to squish you nor to ignore you, but to torture you for its amusement.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered: how it came to be, why it chose Elijah, why we cannot enter timelines before its appearance, and why access is only possible after it leaves. The Entity ensures we cannot simply move everyone we know into a world before its arrival to contain or neutralize it.</p>
<p>We will soon publish our findings on its known abilities. For now, know it could be anywhere and is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>We will hire more staff to monitor the branches, ensuring a faster response next time it appears.</p>
<p>Secure. Contain. Protect existence.</p>

<p>My sweet orange, I know you have been stressed lately regarding The Scream for several weeks now, and I just want to let you know that you need to relax. It deeply worries me. I know you better than anyone, and yet I cannot seem to help you. In case you haven't noticed, no amount of my cooking, hugs, kisses, baseball games, jokes, sex, artwork, or even changing topics seems to help you at all. Please think about it. I'm scared as much as you are, and I don't want to cry in the shower anymore.</p>
<p>I went to SCP-8656 today and got our menu item to go so we can finally try it together and document the results.</p>
<p>Love you always, now and forever.</p>
<p>Your wife, M.W.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that my fear is also making you upset. I've been thinking about what you sent. How about you and I take time off together? Just you, me, and SCPF-849411. Sleeping together, swimming together (although you'll have to teach me), and just having a fun, relaxing time.</p>
<p>I just got word back from the team analyzing the audio of The Scream, and it isn't good. If anyone is near you, please leave so you can read this in private.</p>
<p>They used every tool they had in there, and they started cataloging as many voices as they could identify within it—and they found OUR voices within it. To make matters worse, we were able to get in touch with the D-class who did the "Check" act on The Entity, and the poor man was terrified. So much so that all we could make out were some words:</p>
<p>"Camera, trillions, beginning."</p>
<p>Yes, <em>was</em> terrified. Since we couldn't get any more info, we sent him back where he came from, and he took his life. That world's SCP Foundation had him in his little room with visitors hourly. O5-2 paid him a visit since he was with him when the fight happened. From what he told me, the D-class never said a word besides those three until he finally spoke his last words before he jumped.</p>
<p>"It's better if I go now than go later when it happens."</p>
<p>As if he couldn't be any more cryptic or wanting to spare us the details.</p>
<p>Just hearing it makes me even more scared and think of more theories. However, we can discuss that after our break. I will split that cupcake with you, by the way. Interesting how they added a text chat bubble onto it, let alone have the colors be green and orange. Remind me to give SCP-8656-05 a generous donation. I think he just opened the place back up as well after that event. Also, text me what you want to eat tonight because it's my turn to make dinner.</p>
<p>Love you always, now and forever.</p>
<p>Your husband, D.Q.</p>
