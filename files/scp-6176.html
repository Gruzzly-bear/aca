            <h1>SCP-6176</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6176</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Wing G of Site-301 has been converted to act as SCP-6176's primary containment chamber, currently a 4.5m wide cube-shaped room, initially intended to act as a supply room for janitorial staff. Organic personnel are not permitted to enter wing G. Instead, Kederesk.aic has been assigned to monitor and report on SCP-6176.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="distorted_doctor_care" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bread-tyrant-authorpage/distorted_doctor_care"/>

<p>Dr. Carè after exposure to D-2133 (SCP-6176)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6176 is a <a href="/scp-2470">specific existential</a>, metaphysical construct or entity currently maintained in wing G at Site-301.</p>
<p>SCP-6176 is a metaphysical embodiment of its metaphysical self, which has produced an intense feedback loop in which SCP-6176 continuously reiterates itself. This process is indefinite as long as SCP-6176 remains conceptually alive. This is due to SCP-6176 being capable of visualising how subjects externally perceive itself, which inturn alters its own metaphysical self, which results in the feedback loop. SCP-6176 invariably becomes inert once it no longer becomes subjectively perceived by an organic individual.</p>
<p>Due to external perception of it, SCP-6176 primarily has taken a humanoid shape. Whether SCP-6176 in this state is conscious is still unknown, as external perception doesn't lead to change in SCP-6176 internally. However, if an iteration of SCP-6176 is produced off the basis of a hominid-centred perception, then it is likely SCP-6176 has manifested some form of consciousness. SCP-6176 iterations that are likely to be conscious are designated as SCP-6176-Prime instances. While the exact parameters for a prime instance are unclear, the Foundation has documented the appearance of 4 prime instances which have come about since SCP-6176's containment in 1972.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> Several tests were performed on SCP-6176 to see its reactions to external perception of it based on different states of consciousness.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Waking<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 performed as was expected, in which a humanoid shape was formed during the subsequent iterations. No prime instances were produced.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Sleeping<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> No result, as D-4972 did not visually perceive SCP-6176.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Dreaming<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-2133</p>
<p><em>D-2133 was exposed to several images relating to SCP-6176, symbolic and metaphorical in nature. D-2133 was also allowed to converse with D-4972 regarding SCP-6176 before the test was conducted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 formed a humanoid shape which assumed the supine position. D-2133 proceeded to open their eyes, however was in a paralytic state. SCP-6176 formed superficial eyes which rapidly looked around before they formed into three images.</p>
<p>The first featured a young boy sitting beside an older woman in a hospital bed hooked up to a breathing apparatus.</p>
<p>The second featured the same young boy pulling away the blinds of a window at several other children playing basketball in the street.</p>
<p>The third featured the young boy in a suit and tie sitting at the bottom of a wooden staircase, crying into their hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Transcendental Consciousness<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972 and D-2133</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 formed several hominid-centred conceptual identifiers present within the noosphere, specifically ones which relate to both D-4972 and D-2133. Notable examples were: names, memories, aspirations and personalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Cosmic Consciousness<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972 and D-2133</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 formed a brain, with several roots growing from its base. This was followed by the manifestation of several symbolic images, which were incomprehensible to D-4972 and D-2133.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> God Consciousness<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972 and D-2133</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 became a unified self-expression of its own perceived deific status among several GoI's. These formations expressed their own consciousness, which further reinforced SCP-6176 during later iterations.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Conscious State:</strong> Unity Consciousness<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-4972 and D-2133</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-6176 becomes the expression of all human perception. This was demonstrated when D-4972 broke visual contact and stared down at the concrete floor. This prompted SCP-6176 to form into concrete, as well as manifesting several symbolic images of concepts such as "Underneath" and "Floor".</p>
</div>
<p>Testing was concluded after it was deemed SCP-6176 had gained too much of an understanding of human consciousness to the point where it became capable of self-sustaining itself. SCP-6176 began to form a symbolic representation of consciousness which later evolved into an isolated conscious form within SCP-6176. This form then internally perceived SCP-6176 which then prompted the formation of a volatile prime instance.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong> Once the SCP-6176-Prime instance was formed, it was deemed too essophysically dangerous to remain in wing G. Thus it was put to a vote for whether SCP-6176 should be transferred to the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4972">Adaptive Containment Chamber (ACC)</a> at Site-301.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><span style="color: green">For</span> — 67%<br/>
<span style="color: orange">Novote</span> — 13%<br/>
<span style="color: red">Against</span> — 20%</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-6176 was subsequently transported into the ACC.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>Transcriptor:</strong> Kederesk.aic</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Begin…</strong></p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> SCP-6176 is placed within the chamber via the use of a transport automaton. The chamber is sealed and the adaptive lining is activated.</p>
<p><strong>12:34</strong> The walls of the ACC begin to glow measuring around 650°C.</p>
<p><strong>12:45</strong> Several adaptive plates begin to melt off the chamber walls. SCP-6176 grows more volatile.</p>
<p><strong>13:11</strong> The chamber begins to stabilise with SCP-6176 reducing in size.</p>
<p><strong>13:25</strong> SCP-6176 forms into both D-4972 and D-2133. Both D-class are found to now be absent from their quarters.</p>
<p><strong>13:56</strong> SCP-6176 forms several thought forms. These forms then are reduced into their base concepts.</p>
<p><strong>14:05</strong> SCP-6176 projects a noospheric pattern onto the chamber walls.</p>
<p><strong>14:17</strong> Kederesk.aic is compromised as SCP-6176 forms into a deific automaton that begins breaking several of the adaptive plates.</p>
<p><strong>14:48</strong> SCP-6176 then disappears. D-2133 is found back in their cell. D-4972's bed is found to be covered in dead butterflies.</p>
<p><strong>…End</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ACC was examined for structural damages. It was discovered that the ACC has already been used to contain <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4972">another anomaly</a>, which was likely the reason SCP-6176's containment was compromised.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum-3:</strong> An interview was performed with D-2133 following SCP-6176's transference into the ACC.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> So you were temporarily transported into the ACC. Could you tell me a little bit about what you saw?</p>
<p><em>D-2133 is silent for 10 seconds, looking down at the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> The ACC? It's pretty simple…</p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> No, that (D-2133 points behind Dr. Care).</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> (Looking behind) I'm not sure what you're referring to?</p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> Oh, this is a pretty new experience for me.</p>
<p><em>D-2133 looks down at their hands, the number of digits fluctuating from 1 to 400. Dr. Carè doesn't notice this.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> Do you think if mankind ever heard God, they'd react in fear or hope? Just a piece of God, like a heartbeat or something?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> I… don't think I've got an answer for that. Could you please try and answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> Well the chamber I was in adapts to contain it right?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carè wipes blood away from his nose.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> Yeah that's what it was designed for. Your point?</p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> If the embodiment of itself eventually became conscious, then the chamber introduced something that would break this. That would be showing the entity nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> So you're saying the ACC performed an unauthorised termination?</p>
<p><strong>D-2133:</strong> Well, nothing ain't something a human's capable of perceiving. Most likely it repurposed the robot to do that. Even then it only caused its consciousness to burst. You can't introduce something as complex a consciousness to something as miniscule as nothing, that would simply break the laws of thermodynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Carè:</strong> (Coughing) So where is SCP-6176 now?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Carè vomits and collapses onto the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>
