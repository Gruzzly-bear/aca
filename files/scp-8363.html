            <h1>SCP-8363</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class: Safe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong><br/>
SCP-8363 instances are to be kept in a locked storage container at Site-36BM. Testing with the object is not to be carried out without the authorisation of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Site Director</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Head of Research</span> Head Researcher in charge.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures: 28/9/2005</strong><br/>
SCP-8363 instances are to be kept in a locked storage container at Secure Storage Facility-16. Use of SCP-8363 is forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8363 is a 20 mL transparent plastic mist spray bottle containing a yellow liquid of unknown full composition. The substance possesses a vanilla-like odour and chemically resembles an <em>eau de parfum</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> solution. Laboratory analysis confirms a base of ethanol (approximately 75%), with the remainder consisting of unidentified organic compounds. As of writing, there are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">seven</span> three instances, all of which are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">half full</span> nearly empty.</p>
<p>Application of SCP-8363 to human subjects results in anomalous changes to social perception. Affected individuals are perceived as significantly more physically attractive, charismatic, and trustworthy, resulting in subjects exposed to the scent exhibiting increased openness and compliance toward the user.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong></p>
<p>SCP-8363 was discovered in 1998 by the Foundation's Thai Branch. A string of home invasions had occurred throughout northern Thailand where victims reported voluntarily allowing the suspects into their homes or left their homes to approach them willingly, often citing the perpetrators' pleasant odor as a factor—one victim described it as "smelling like ice cream."</p>
<p>Four suspects were apprehended by the Thai Police. During interrogation, one stated that they used "black magic oil" provided by a relative—identified as Banthorn Yongchaiyudh, age 48. SCP-8363 was found in their possession.</p>
<p>When following this lead, it was discovered Banthorn had died in his sleep from a snake bite two days prior. Search of his residence revealed four more full instances of SCP-8363, a tin box full of US Dollars, 20 <a href="scp-8366.html">baskets</a> in a shed near his house, and two live <em>Bungarus fasciatus</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> specimens under his house.</p>
<p>During transport to the provincial jail, the suspects fatally wounded a police officer and attempted to escape. A shootout ensued where all suspects were killed. Lt. Thitipan Supasawat, an embedded Foundation asset, was credited with neutralising the escape and declared a national hero; later promoted to Police Major.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Long-Term Exposure and Revised Testing (28/09/2005)</strong></p>
<p>Over a seven-year period, an unusual pattern of health deterioration was observed among senior personnel at Site-36BM, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle tightness.</li>
<li>Numbness in the extremities and face.</li>
<li>Dyspnea</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Syncope</li>
<li>Severe abdominal cramps</li>
<li>Reduced scores on memetic and psychological resistance tests</li>
</ul>
<p>The deaths of two of these senior staff prompted an internal review. Investigation revealed widespread unauthorized use of SCP-8363 among Site-36BM personnel, allegedly for career advancement and interpersonal manipulation.</p>
<p>Subsequent chemical analysis with the latest available technology identified the unknown compound as containing:</p>
<p>- Omega-3 fatty acids<br/>
- Trace concentrations of α-, β-, and κ-bungarotoxins<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Further testing via Kirlian photography indicated that affected individuals also exhibited significantly diminished bioenergetic fields (aura), correlating with increased susceptibility to psionic and memetic influence.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br/>
It is believed SCP-8363 artificially reduces the subject’s aura signature, obscuring them from instinctual detection or "sixth sense" by others. Additionally, exposure to the neurotoxin may also dampen the instinctual danger detection in others, further facilitating deception or coercion.</p>
<p><strong>Action Taken:</strong><br/>
- All affected personnel were referred for immediate medical and psychological intervention.<br/>
- Disciplinary proceedings are underway for the personnel in the Thai Branch.<br/>
- SCP-8363 is to be transferred from the Thai Branch to another facility under stricter protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
Due to its documented effectiveness in interpersonal compliance, research has been approved to explore a derivative of the item for controlled use in interrogation settings and field work.</p>
