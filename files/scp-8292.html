<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8292 is currently uncontained. At least one field agent must be stationed in understaffed or underfunded medical facilities in case of an SCP-8292 event.</p>
<p>Mandatory questionnaires are to be administered at these facilities to identify overworked medical staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8292 is a phenomenon affecting medical professionals.</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption show">Material recovered from a subject affected by an SCP-8292 event.</div>
</div>
<p>When a subject becomes affected by SCP-8292, they will undergo an SCP-8292 event and vomit medical instruments. Notably, some instruments will become lodged inside the subject's throat.</p>
<p>Regardless of the physical trauma received, the subject retains their composure and can survive for longer durations despite wounds sustained. They will attempt to 'stop' SCP-8292 by performing self-mutilation. When questioned, affected subjects respond with a desire to fix SCP-8292.</p>
<p>The average duration of an SCP-8292 event is unknown; current estimates range from 5 minutes to 2 hours.</p>
<p>To date, no subjects have survived an SCP-8292 event. Notably, SCP-8292 mainly occurs in hospitals that are over capacity or otherwise struggling. Furthermore, SCP-8292 is more likely to occur to medical staff who are overworked or stressed.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8292-B:</strong> The following is a coroner's report of what is presumed to be the first SCP-8292 event.</p>

<ul>
<li>Minor and major lacerations, 2-9cm long.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trachea and Main Bronchi: The trachea was filled with 10cm-wide compression badges, causing a 7 inch bulge around the throat. Main Bronchi had instruments stuck inside its wall. Removing instruments resulted in parts of the Main Bronchi being removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Esophagus: Traces of vomit. 1.2cm fragments of test tubes lodged inside its walls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abdomen:</strong></p>
