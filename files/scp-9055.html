<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9055 is uncontained and currently under ongoing research efforts to further ascertain the anomaly’s nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Research priorities include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:white;">The extent of SCP-9055’s influence on Site-14</span></li>
<li><span style="color:white;">The length of time SCP-9055 has remained undetected by Site-14 and the Foundation at large</span></li>
<li><span style="color:white;">The mechanism behind SCP-9055’s antimemetic potency</span></li>
<li><span style="color:white;">Preparation for an eventual excursion into SCP-9055</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:white;">Research on SCP-9055 is asynchronous, assigned researchers are those currently reading this file. That is, those dosed with Class-Z Mnestic and within their period of sufficient cognitive function.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9055 is a large, complex, subterranean structure located directly below Site-14.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">SCP-9055 is potently antimemetically cloaked in its entirety, with only Class-Z Mnestics able to render it perceptible to sentient creatures. When others are made aware of SCP-9055, or have their attention drawn towards it in any way, they exhibit a profound disinterest and are unable to recall any data about it, including its existence in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The ‘top’ of SCP-9055 is approximately 150 metres below Site-14’s basement. The structure extends at least a further 450 metres downwards, but its exact depth is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Addendum 9055.1:</strong> Discovery</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I found it whilst looking for a cure to this overdose. Apologies, I’m dropping the format because I don’t have much time left, I spent it all setting up this file and the cloaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I don’t remember how I was dosed, which is strange, because I remember <em>everything</em>. Once I realised what was happening I took to the local database, I didn’t want to involve anyone else in case I was under a significant memetic threat – or at least until I’d ruled out virality.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">When you’re dosed, you spot the filled in gaps. Our Deep-Set Pansensors in the building’s foundations have been picking up non-anomalous radiation and baseline hume fluctuations emanating somewhere below ground. It seems nobody has noticed these readings or at least can’t remember noticing them – they go back years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">There’s also trace amounts of antimemetic radiation in Site-14’s basement. I took a deep-range scanner from the anomalous seismology department and that’s when I saw SCP-9055.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It’s huge, I couldn’t even see all of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I don’t know what the next move is. Fuck, I can’t see. I suppose somebody will have to find a way to get inside, or at least closer to it. Shit, I’m gonna die here. Soon. There’s no cure, I always knew there was no cure… Wait, stop recording. Erase that. Erase that! Damnit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I can’t see. The mnestic’s burning me up. I smell burnt hair, it’s just like when my mother used her straighteners, she’s here now. Everything’s here now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I can remember every butterfly I’ve ever seen. Every splinter I’ve ever felt is under my skin, right now. Sorry, I’m taking up space, whatever move is next is not mine to make. I’m dying, I’m dying right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I remember every breath I’ve ever taken… I think, I think I remember the womb. My brain is fizzing, there’s CO<sub>2</sub> coming out of my ears.</span></p>

<strong>Addendum 9055.2:</strong> Next up</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Okay, whoever came before me may have used the term <em>asynchronous research</em>, but they didn’t really abide by it. For posterity, here’s how it’s done:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I am Junior Researcher Helena Barton.<br/>
I work under Dr. Crane, and am currently between assignments.<br/>
The date is 22/6/2021.<br/>
It is 10:33 a.m local time.<br/>
I also don’t know how I was dosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I am going to take some further scans in the basement with the seismology equipment, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of SCP-9055’s structure – and maybe a way in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">If for whatever reason my efforts prove fruitless, <em>you</em> need to try something else.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I took scans from all over the basement and some from outside:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">SCP-9055 is roughly cuboidal, with a width of 300 metres, length of 400 metres and a depth of somewhere between 700 and 1200 metres. I could drag a seismologist into this to use the equipment properly but I don’t want to get them killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">There are narrow shafts running up through the Earth from SCP-9055 towards Site-14. I can’t quite make them out. Some are meandering and rough, others almost perfectly vertical. It looks like some of them make contact with Site-14 systems, I’ve identified one which I believe has integrated with the ventilation system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I believe SCP-9055 has infiltrated Site-14, possibly years ago. I could raise the alarm and tell as many people as possible, but to them I would be screaming and pointing at absolutely nothing. A raving drugged up lunatic lunatic. An affected vent is in the ground-floor break room, I’m going there now.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">It’s here, a grate above the fridges. When I saw it, I thought I hadn’t noticed it before. I hadn’t. I tried pointing it out to a bloke eating his lunch, he said I was pointing at nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I climbed onto the fridges and tore the grate out of the wall. Nobody tried to stop me, nobody even noticed me. My predecessor called for an eventual excursion into SCP-9055, I say there’s no time like the present present.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
<em>The camera is on a table in Site-14’s ground floor break room. The room is empty. A figure comes around the table and enters the frame.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Helena Barton is pale and visibly sweating. A heavy flashlight is in her left hand, a makeshift eyepatch is wrapped around her head. Her visible eye is bloodshot and twitching.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Red light, hello. I’m Junior Rese- nevermind you already know.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She scratches sharply at her scalp</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> I crawled in just a few metres, then realised I’d forgotten a torch. Well, it never occurred to me… If I’d thought to bring a torch I would’ve brought one – I can’t forget anything… When I crawled back out I tried to ask for one at the equipment desk, but the bloke just stared straight through me. I vaulted the desk, went in the back and grabbed it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She flips the flashlight into the air, catching it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> He never said anything, didn’t even look… It’s like, I’ve <em>caught</em> it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She bites down hard on her thumb, then holds it to the camera, blood starts to run down her arm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> This could be useful to you: pain is good for clearing your mind for a second. It’s like, something deeper and more primal in our brains hushes the higher functions for a bit when there’s something urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">And you’ll need the quiet. Thoughts don’t fade anymore, every tiny seed of an idea grows. Taking up space and never never going away. Layering over each other, talking over each other. Every thought is a wound which won’t heal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She picks up the camera from the table and starts to climb towards the open vent.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Oh, and the eyepatch is for the visual data. It <em>burns</em>, I’m trying to halve it. I’ve got a perfect photoreal memory of every frame of my life. I can remember the regular shot and the upside-down blurry one before the brain does its interpolation… This is going to kill me. There’s no world where this doesn’t kill me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Barton points the flashlight and camera down the ventilation shaft. It is a narrow, featureless tunnel that extends for five metres before terminating at a T-intersection.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> I can’t see anything yet, there’s definitely a pressure though, something’s messing with my head in here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She inches forward slowly, groaning in effort and pain.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> I could’ve sent a drone… I could’ve dosed up a Class-D and sent him in here…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She takes the right at the junction, the shaft extends a further 15 metres, multiple other shafts connect along the left and right walls.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> But I came in myself. Me and a torch.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Her pace quickens, she takes the third left.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Because I’m arrogant. I always have been, it’s so clear now I see everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She speeds up again, her crawl more of a lurch. The floors and walls of the shaft thunder with her movements.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Even now, I’m taking up space and some poor bastard’s precious time… Is that just me? Do all foundationers have this entitlement? Or is it more the inevitable death?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She pauses to catch her breath, the reverberations in the vent eventually falling silent.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> I’m not gonna make it. It’s too far.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The camera’s movements suggest her clutching her head, she howls in agony.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> It’s like my skull is splitting. My- my brain is breaking down. I can feel the two hemispheres thinking independently… One of them is blind blind.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Another sound is heard deeper in the vent. Quiet, but growing louder. A metallic scurrying.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Shit. Gun. I didn’t bring a gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The scurrying gets louder. Barton tries to reverse, there isn’t enough room to turn around. She tries anyway, her legs get stuck against the walls.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Arrogant arrogant! How could you not think of a gun? Let me see!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She twists herself onto her back, her legs towards the sound. She points the torch and camera at her feet as she shuffles backwards. A small metallic creature emerges around the corner. It stops only briefly, then continues its scuttle towards her. Its shape is arachnid, with five short legs and a featureless silver-grey body. Barton screams.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> Help! Help me! Anybody! Please! Please hear me! Please help me!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She throws the camera at the creature, she misses. The camera tumbles past and lands facing back towards her. The creature begins to climb up her leg. She kicks, the creature lands on her chest.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She begins to thrash wildly, the creature is knocked out of sight. Her knees, feet and arms drum against the walls and floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Barton:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Her thrashing becomes more indicative of a seizure. The flashlight is knocked and deactivated. Sounds of movement are heard behind the camera, there is a loud hissing.</em></span></p>

<strong>Addendum 9055.3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I am Junior Researcher Matthew Sunns.<br/>
I am an accountant for the Ethics Committee, I work under Liaison Balakrishnan.<br/>
The date is 11/7/2021.<br/>
It is 13:04 local time.<br/>
I also don’t know how I was dosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I hope you can forgive my reluctance to climb right in after my predecessor. I’m going to see what else I can discover topside first.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">There are records of a Helena Barton working at Site-14 since 2012, and then she disappears from all records. Sudden employee vanishment is cause for alarm at any workplace, but particularly worrisome at the Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">And yet nobody has done anything. I asked her coworkers, her senior researcher Dr. Crane – I even called her cousin at Site-86, none of them have ever met somebody by that name or description. I pointed them directly at the gap in her registers, the idle cell on our spreadsheets. They couldn’t care less. It was the exact disinterest they show when informed of SCP-9055.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I think that vent is oblivion. Those that enter experience their second death before their first.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I also tried to inform my colleagues and superiors about my current overdose. My dramatic tale of how I had only hours left to live failed to capture their attention. My best friend of the last three years even yawned.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It seems the existence of Class-Z Mnestics is itself an antimemetically-guarded secret. I for one had never heard of them before it was killing me. How the first one, the guy that set this all up, knew what they were is another mystery I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Apologies, I’m rambling. Like the others, is that a symptom? A side effect?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Okay I’m heading for the vent now. I’ll bring a gun this time.</span></p>

<br/>
<em>The video shows the interior of a ventilation shaft. The walls are notably grimy, a fine, mould-like white-green dust is present.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> I’m a decent way past where Helena Barton got to, I think I’m heading for the same place she was. It wasn’t pleasant having to climb over her body. I would have liked to get her out of here and bury her, but there’s no time. She died in the dark, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He shuffles briskly forward, the shaft pitching slightly downwards.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> I don’t know if you can see this dust, but there’s definitely a build-up of it. Whatever it is, you should bring a gas mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Five minutes pass as he proceeds through the vents. He mutters the Lord’s Prayer to himself repeatedly.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Here it is, where the vents meet with one of the narrow shafts running up from SCP-9055.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>One of the walls of the vent ahead has been worn away, concrete is visible behind it. A small tunnel digs into the concrete and sinks downwards. Sunns approaches and shines his flashlight down it – no bottom is visible</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] I could drop the camera down it… [UNINTELLIGIBLE] I’ll go further.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:white;">[Recording Cuts]</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Another stretch of ventilation shaft, the dust on the walls is thicker and floating in the air.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] art in heaven hallowed be thy name [UNINTELLIGIBLE] done on Earth as [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Forgive us.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:white;">[Recording Cuts]</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns is descending a tight, natural tunnel. The walls are stone and earth, the air is thick with dust.</em></span></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:white;">[Recording Cuts]</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The video shows a metal staircase running up and down a tall, narrow concrete shaft. Neither end of the staircase is visible. The staircase itself and the surrounding walls have suffered severe structural damage, bare earth is visible in patches across the walls.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The camera is settled down into an alcove on the wall and spun to face Matthew Sunns. He is mostly shrouded in darkness, his clothes are torn and filthy and his eyes are bloodshot.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Welcome back! I clambered further and eventually found another tunnel, one I could fit through. It eventually broke out into <em>this.</em> Some kind of access, reminds me of a fire escape. I’m not sure where heading up would lead, maybe back to Site-14, but I’m pretty certain of where down leads… I’ll check back in whe-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He stops suddenly and points the flashlight and gun somewhere out of frame. There is total silence for ten seconds.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Okay, heading down.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He reaches towards the camera.</em></span></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:white;">[Recording Cuts]</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns is at the bottom of the staircase, the ground is covered in a heap of rubble. He climbs down the pile and into a larger cuboidal space. There is a large, rusted iron door flush with one wall; half buried by debris. The concrete surrounding its frame is cracked and crumbling.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns sets the camera, flashlight and gun down onto the ground and picks up a thick metal pole from the floor: a fallen rail from the staircase.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He begins to work at the concrete around the door frame, dust erupting with each strike. He has to stop several times to cough.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Minutes later, he kicks the door hard five times. The sixth sets the hinges loose from the wall – the door falls forward and slams against the floor. Some debris tumbles through the now open frame after it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns retrieves his equipment and crouches through the doorframe into the space beyond.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Here we are, SCP-9055.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The space is a corridor, the only light source is the flashlight. The mould-like substance is thick on the walls. In denser spots mycelial growths cluster together with thin branching tendrils spreading in all directions.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Lord grant me passage. Lord grant me safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns presses forward. He makes slow progress down the corridor, there is no other sound than his footsteps.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> The mnestic’s really doing its work now. I reckon I’ve got minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He reaches the end of the corridor and turns right onto another, it is visually indistinct from the previous.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Also, I’m really, <em>really</em> scared. The adrenaline isn’t helping. As if my brain wasn’t moving fast enough…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>His pace quickens, his gait starts to meander. He has no apparent target.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Talking’s helping though. I’m gonna keep talking, filling the air. Maybe that’s why the others did their rambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He sharply turns onto a third corridor. There are rooms lining each side, but his flashlight doesn’t illuminate them to provide sufficient detail.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Yes, that makes sense. It’s like, usually the subconscious conjures a handful of concepts, ideas, seeds, whatever. Then only a filtered few are passed on up, to the conscious mind, to <em>us</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>A patch of dried mycelium crunches under his foot.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> But now everything’s coming up, the filter’s torn apart. Nothing can be quietly forgotten anymore, everyone’s here! It’s like, consciousness diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He passes by an elevator shaft, and barges straight through a door onto further corridor. His breathing becomes ragged.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> And then again, only a certain few thoughts are promoted to speech, but that filter’s gone too. It’s all leaking out! But the rambling is like relief, the thoughts are being finally released, like a desperate exhale.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He makes another right turn, now heading back on himself.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> That might explain why this file has been such a garden of word salad… See! That pun shouldn’t have made it anywhere beyond the subconscious!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He giggles to himself, his meandering gait has now become so irregular he almost strikes the walls. He stumbles forward, then stops abruptly.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Oh, Oh no. [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>A small, metallic, five-legged creature is on the floor three metres ahead of him. He attaches the flashlight to his belt, then draws a SIG Sauer M17 pistol, his hands are shaking.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] please…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He approaches the creature slowly. He gets approximately one metre away from it, one of its legs twitches. He takes a quick step backwards, the floor gives way beneath him.<br/>
He yells, his whole body falls as a large section collapses.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He emerges into another, lower corridor. He crashes straight through that floor also.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He lands hard on the floor of the next corridor. He screams. The camera is dropped and lands upside-down beside him. The flashlight remains attached at his waist, the pistol is in his hand. He is lying on his back, his right trouser-leg is tented by a protruding bone. He screams again, his hand pounding the ground.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The corridor is completely infested with mycelial and fungal growth. The walls are thick with grey-brown caps and yellow gills. The air is thick with spores.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> God no. God please no!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He clutches his head and howls in agony, he arches his back and kicks his broken leg with his other foot.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> Mercy! Mercy! [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>A section of the wall stirs, pulsating and writhing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE] Mercy, Lord have mercy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Fungal tendrils snap and retreat as a section of the wall breaks away. It starts to fall, before further decomposition forms legs to catch itself. The mass reshapes until there are recognisable arms and a head. Its form is humanoid.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns screams. He fires five shots into the creature’s ‘head’. Chunks of material are torn away, but it is otherwise unaffected. Tendrils unfurl around a hole in the head which could be a ‘mouth’</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>It crouches down to Sunns and lifts him up by the collar. It pulls him into mouth-to-mouth contact.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Sunns:</strong> [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Sunns presses the pistol against the creature’s head and fires four further shots. It is not effective. He turns the gun on himself and fires, his body falls limp.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Tendrils begin to cover the camera’s lens.</em></span></p>

<strong>Addendum 9055.4:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">My name is Adekunle Ngoma.<br/>
My role at the Foundation is highly classified.<br/>
The date is 4/8/2021.<br/>
It is 11:53 a.m local time.<br/>
I also don’t know how I was dosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I sympathise that there should be no secrets between us mutually damned, but if I did explain my role — even in writing — the implanted cognitoworm would shut off my brainstem. I don’t really want that, yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">At the risk of being even more unpopular, I’m also not going into SCP-9055. Call it cowardice, you’re probably right.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’m going to attempt to cure this overdose myself, I figure my best shot is the strongest amnestic I can get my hands on, maybe there’s some ‘cancelling out’. If it works, and if I remember any of this, I’ll tell everyone I can.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">Actually, there is something I can do first.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I have recovered Helena Barton’s body. I crawled in, followed the trail of blood from her bleeding thumb, and dragged her back out. I laid her to rest in a nice patch by the west car park. That little spot with the magnolias? She’s under the trees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I don’t think I have the time to bury her, nor do I know where Site-14 stores the shovels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’m going to the pharmacy now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Addendum 9055.5:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I found that guy's body.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It looks like the combination of a powerful mnestic and a powerful amnestic had a reaction akin to matter-antimatter annihilation. His body was laying just outside the pharmacy, caked in antimemetic radiation. People have been stepping over him and holding benign conversation right beside him. It seems even the flies are ignoring him, even the bacteria, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">His inner ear was spilled out, he’d scratched his own neck to pieces – it was almost severed. And his eyes… Nevermind.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I laid him to rest next to researcher Barton</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’ve been checking security footage from today, tracking myself since I came in this morning. I was on the third floor, heading east from the security office to Dr. Brown-Lockwood’s office when one of the spider creatures attacked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It scurried straight up to me, I didn’t notice it, and I don’t remember seeing it (and I remember <em>everything</em>). On the camera, it looks as if it ‘bites’ me, right on my left achilles. Looking now, there is a little mark, a single red spot; I wouldn’t have noticed it if I wasn’t looking for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It was in Dr. Brown-Lockwood’s office when I started to feel the effects of the Class-Z Mnestic, so there’s one mystery solved:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><br/></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:white;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><strong><span style="color: red">The spider creatures are dosing Site-14 staff on Class-Z Mnestic.</span></strong></span> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
As to the ramifications of that, and what’s next, I’ve got no idea. I’m almost out of time, I spent about ten minutes just getting that text to be big, bold and red. Had to open a terminal and do it properly, the perfect eidetic memory of 2,073,600 pixels sixty times a second burns like The Sun through a telescope. Guess that’s why everyone’s been dictating these addenda orally.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I have no intention of waiting until I’m thinking through a brain that’s liquefying. I’m gonna lay down in the grass next to the other two and stick a gun under my chin.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">There’s not much space here by the magnolias, so do try to figure this out soon. I’ve done this a little backwards, but far be it from me to break protocol:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">My name is Zachary Wilson.<br/>
I am a facility guard at Site-14.<br/>
The date is 19/8/2021.<br/>
It is 16:16 local time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I <em>do</em> know how I was dosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Good luck, and godspeed.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Date:</strong> 3/9/2021</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Exploration Team:</strong> Mobile Task Force ε-0 (“The Cardinals”)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Team Lead:</strong> ε-0 Captain Hayes (E0-1)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Other Members:</strong> Bethel, Martin, Lee (E0-2, E0-3, E0-4)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hayes:</strong> Okay, let’s run checks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Oh, check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Did you just say ‘check’ or did you make sure your camera and microphone are working?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> No, no they’re working.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The team of five is standing in Site-14’s lower basement, gathered around an unmarked door. They are all clad in tactical gear, including: A M16A4 assault rifle, SIG Sauer M17 sidearm and a gas mask each. There is a portable Scranton Reality Anchor by Lee’s feet.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Very good. Dr. Douglas, do you want to fill in for the record? Make it brief.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Sure. Um- I am junior researcher Dr. Frank Douglas. I was dosed with Class-Z Mnestic this morning. I managed to discover this-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He gestures towards the door.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Antimemetically cloaked door in Site-14’s basement. I believe it is the other end of the access shaft that Matthew Sunns discovered in Addendum 9055.3. I enlisted the only MTF that was on site at the time for an armed excursion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Alright. Let’s-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Feel like you missed anything there Dr. Douglas?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> I, uh-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Like how your ‘enlistment’ boiled down to the forceful dosing of me and my entire team with a suicide drug?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> That’s enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Respectfully Sir, I believe the record needs to be clear in this. Dr. Douglas’ actions are undeniably unethical.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> This is standard procedure for the research phase of an anomaly! Several excursions have already been made to little success, it’s time to send in an MTF.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Don’t spout procedure at me asshole! You were too chickenshit to head down there and you dragged the rest of us into it!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> We’re on a time crunch here…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> This is bullshit, we’ve been poisoned!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Can we keep the shouting down please Martin?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> This is outside our expertise anyway, we’re a <em>paramathematics</em> squad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> We are the <em>Mobile Task Force</em> of the paramathematics division, we’ve had the same essential combat training as all mobile task forces with our clearance. We’ve got our gear, a skip and an accompanying researcher… This is <em>well within</em> our expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes stares Martin down until his demeanor calms.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> And there goes all the time I’m willing to tolerate spending on misgivings. Bethel, open the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Sir.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She opens the door revealing the top of a dark metallic staircase within a narrow concrete shaft. She illuminates the space with the underbarrel flashlight attached to her rifle – the staircase descends downwards out of view.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> But I’ll again put into the air what we’re all thinking. If there’s any hope for any of us surviving the hour, it’s down there. Regardless of how we ended up here, our mutual interest is now a comprehensive and productive investigation of SCP-9055.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They enter through the door and begin to descend the staircase. Bethel leads, then Hayes, then Douglas, then Lee, then Martin.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They descend five flights in total silence.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Anything?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Negative. EM radiation is above background but within tolerance. Humes are stable. No akiva or anything else nasty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Antimemetic radiation?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> We don’t have a tool for measuring that exactly, I’m not even sure if one exists. But I’m definitely <em>feeling</em> something. Maybe that’s what everyone else has been going on when they talk about ‘antimemetic radiation’ – a pressure in mnesticized minds. Something’s tryna make us forget, even if we can’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Where did you even get the Class-Z?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> I- the pharmacy stocks it. Not sure why, never seen it there before myself, but it’s there. I had to brute force my way into its container but the pharmacist didn’t seem to notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They descend thirteen more flights in total silence.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> You been putting your freshly superpowered mind toward a way to cure us?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Maybe… When it comes to the Class-Z, what is it doing to us? What do you feel?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> You’re asking? Fucking <em>everything</em> Doc. Extreme sensory overload. Clothes against skin, teeth against gums, an avalanche of data. And my head’s full of memories, I can feel the fresh pain of my first heartbreak whilst tasting our first kiss. <em>Not</em> helpful on a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> But that’s two separate things, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> The inability to disregard any sensory data in the <em>present</em>, and the uncontrollable recollection of memories from the <em>past</em> are two separate things.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> The glossary and footnotes both describe the primary effect of Class-Z Mnestics as the permanent destruction of the subject’s ability to forget. This would cause the sensory overload. Perhaps the memories are a side effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Matthew Sunns talked about how the filter between the conscious and subconscious had been torn away, that random seeds of thought that usually go nowhere are now being ‘passed up’ and fully forming to take up space. Well perhaps there is a sub-sub-conscious, and layers even below that, with <em>all</em> the filters between them torn away.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Your point?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> If for every lived experience at least some quantum was stored away in some layer of consciousness, then that experience would now be rising upwards, through the layers, to <em>us</em>. Our inability to forget in the present makes the whole of the past <em>now</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Okay… How does that help us?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> I’m not sure. It’s just a hypothesis. Perhaps there is a way to restore these filters? Deliver amnestic to only certain layers of consciousness? I don’t know, I haven’t been on this assignment very long.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Longer than some.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The rest of the descent is made in silence.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The team reaches the bottom of the staircase. They swiftly descend the heap of debris and head through the open doorframe into SCP-9055 in the same order in which they’d descended.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Still clear?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Still clear, no movement within 100 metres.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Okay, we move quickly but carefully. Stick near the walls, we know there’s significant structural damage. Myself, Bethel and the doctor will stay left, Martin and Lee you stay to the right. We don’t want to put too much stress on one spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Lee moves over to the right wall and tears off a piece of mycelia with a gloved hand, setting the Scranton Reality Anchor at his feet. He takes a test tube from a pocket at his waist and places the sample inside.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Is that safe?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> I’m already poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Let’s move.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The team advances down the first corridor and turns right onto the second.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> This… looks like Site-14.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>None of the MTF respond, they proceed halfway down the second corridor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> We’ve got an office up here on the left.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Let’s check it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel approaches the office door. She wipes a patch of mycelia off of the nameplate affixed to the door. It reads: ‘Dr. Ellaine Nestt’</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>All five enter the office. It is small and cluttered, two walls of bookshelves and a desk tucked into the corner. Fungal spores are in the air and settled on every flat surface.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel sits at the desk and powers on the computer, the screen lights up with a Foundation insignia.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> This <em>is</em> Site-14</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Maybe… Certainly foundation, only our terminals would still turn on after all this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Get what you can from it, I’ll guard outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Roger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes stands guard just outside the open office door.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Lee holds a small handheld scanner up to the test tube containing the mycelia sample.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> How long did the other guy survive exposure to this stuff?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> His name was Matthew Sunns. I’m not sure, he was inside SCP-9055 for no longer than two minutes, although there was the quasi-mould in the vent, maybe twenty minutes earlier? He didn’t show any adverse reaction to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Can you tell what it is?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> I’d wager it’s anomalous, but I’m not getting anything from <em>this</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He places the scanner back into a pocket.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Not much joy here, the whole system is massively corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She inhales sharply and turns away from the screen, covering her eyes with her hand.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Sorry, the screen hurts to look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes</strong>: What kind of corruption?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Not certain, but it seems to be deliberate, an organised attack. The latest activity I could find was…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She squints back at the screen.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> The 6th of February 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> If there was an attack could the fungus be a bioweapon?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> A bioweapon Matthew Sunns showed no reaction to over twenty minutes of exposure? A bioweapon that’s been in Site-14’s vents for possibly years?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Maybe Sunns was already carrying the cure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> What?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> We know SCP-9055 is potently antimemetically cloaked, we also know it’s likely infested with this fungus. Perhaps the fungus is the source of the antimemetic…-ness. And Sunns showed no effect as he was already dosed with mnestic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> That… makes a bit of sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Are we done in there? We do not want to waste time for ourselves or for anybody who may be reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> One second.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She stares at the screen with squinted, bloodshot eyes for several more seconds, before turning the monitor away and getting up from the desk.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Okay I’m done. Shit, that hurts – fuck. I managed to find some kind of layout, corrupted to high heaven like everything else, but I could see the place is <em>big</em> though, as big as we’re thinking. Looks like a lot of life support to me, like this place was built to be self-sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> You got a direction we should be heading?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> I’d guess downwards. You would want command/control buried deep where it’s theoretically safest? If this is a bunker or whatever?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Copy, <em>let’s move</em>!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>All exit the office and proceed further down the corridor, staying close to either wall as they were before.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They take the next left and proceed until they reach a staircase, they descend all four flights until the staircase ends. They emerge into another corridor – fungal presence has increased. They head north in silence until Bethel stops.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Got something here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes throws up a tight fist and the team stops.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The corridor widens into a small meeting space. There is a table and four chairs adjacent to a notice board. A low wall separates the table from the hallway, where two corpses are lying. Markings written in blood are visible on the wall above the corpses, covered by sprawling mycelia.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The rest of the team creeps forward behind Captain Hayes, they gather around the corpses.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Jesus, should we-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Hang on, eyes down.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Eyes down!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The team immediately flicks their heads downwards sharply. Lee and Martin place a hand against their forehead to block their view of the wall. Douglas takes a moment to catch on, then does the same.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel reaches up to her gas mask and flicks a small lever attached to the rim of the mask’s right eye: activating the SCRAMBLE filter. A purple light begins to shine above the mask’s right eye.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She approaches the wall and sweeps the mycelia away with her forearm. The growths crumble and disintegrate away. She stares at the wall for seven seconds, then flicks the SCRAMBLE filter back off, the purple light goes dark.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> All clear for cognitohazards.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The rest of the team look up to the wall. The markings made in blood are a perfect vertical rectangle – twice as tall as it is wide.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> What the fuck…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> These two are dead from stab wounds, they’ve both got cuts lengthways on the forearms… One’s got another along the neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> The eyes as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> God, yeah. Both have their left eyes gouged out, some cuts along the forehead… Missing two fingers on this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Ritualistic blade homicide, robotic arachnoforms and aggressive fungus… Whatever this thing is it certainly can’t decide on an aesthetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> This one’s got an ID card, ‘Level 3 Access, Dr. Ivan Hyde, SCP Foundation Site-14A’</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She unclips it and hands it to Captain Hayes.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Never heard of such a place, anyone?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They all shake their heads, Lee takes the ID card and pockets it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Maybe it’s-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Dr. Douglas groans in pain and stumbles. He trips over a corpse’s arm and steadies himself against the blood-covered wall.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes hurries to catch him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> We feeling okay Doctor?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> I- I- I’m- I need this mask off. I’m gonna puke.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> That’s not a good idea, try to breathe-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Martin steps forward and forcefully wrenches the gas mask up and off of Douglas’ head. He casts it aside.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> There we go, breathe nice and deep Doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Dr. Douglas begins to hyperventilate. Captain Hayes glares at Martin.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> I- I felt like I might throw up. And- and- and then the memory of every time I’ve ever vomited was in my head at once… The- the- taste. Fuck. Jesus Christ. Is that blood?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> You were dosed before us so you’re gonna feel it sooner. Are you good to carry on? You can stay here-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Fuck no, let’s carry on. I’m good. I don’t need the mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He rises quickly to his feet and staggers away from the wall and corpses.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> The taste is still fucking there. It’s never going away, is it? Shit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Alright back to it, let’s pick up the pace and get as deep as we can.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Site 14A… Could- Ah-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Try to stop the hypothesising, every thought is a wound that doesn’t heal, remember?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Yeah… I <em>remember</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>After two more corridors they reach another staircase. They descend all ten flights until the staircase ends, leading out into a further corridor. There were four corpses on the staircase itself, and a further two in the corridor just beyond it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The corridor is completely infested. Fungal growth covers the wall so totally that no concrete is visible – only the grey-brown caps and yellow gills. The air is thick with spores. Mycelia sprawls densely across the ground, but patches of flooring are still visible.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> (Hushed) Anything?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> (Hushed) Negative… This environment is similar to where the humanoid mycoform emerged though.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>While they speak, Martin walks over to one of the corpses sitting up against the wall. Its upper torso is mostly fused with the fungal growth, its legs covered with mycelia and thicker tendrils. Its arms are exposed between thick growth at the shoulders and hands. Writing is scrawled in pen across the inner forearm: ‘SITE-14A UNDER ATTACK. FREDERICK IN CHARGE’ is written on one, ‘GET TO SHELTER. THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST DAY.’ is written on the other. Martin does not report this to any member of the team.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> (Hushed) Okay, let’s keep comms minimal. Weapons ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>They proceed slowly and silently into the infested corridor. Bethel leads, then Captain Hayes, then Dr. Douglas, then Lee, then Martin – walking backwards with his weapon drawn to the space behind them.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel starts to separate from the rest, as Captain Hayes slows. He grunts in pain and stops in a stumble.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> (Hushed) Captain?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel stops and turns around. Martin does the same.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> (Hushed) Thought- thought I might be able to make it a bit further. My old head can’t quite manage like you kids… I’m slowing you down, go on without me. Bethel has the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Bullshit, we’re not leaving you here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> (Hushed) That’s an order order.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> We should still have time, what are your symptoms-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> (Hushed) We’ve got movement, three targets directly ahead of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel turns around to face the threat, Captain Hayes grunts in pain and collapses to the floor. Dr. Douglas fails to catch him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> They’re small, on the floor and walls. We’ve got- Shit. We’ve got four more behind us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> (Whispering) Jakarta… Jakarta…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Five- Six.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> What about the walls?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Contact!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Martin opens fire on the group of metallic spider-creatures approaching from the rear. They explode into shrapnel from a single round, legs detach and sparks fly. The hit creatures lie ripped open and inert.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel opens fire on the group approaching from the front. The riflefire is similarly highly effective.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The fungus on the walls surrounding the group begins to pulsate softly.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> Jakarta. Jakarta!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> Clear for now but more are coming. The captain’s in bad shape, do we retreat?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> The walls! They’re moving! They’re they’re they’re they [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Dr. Douglas presses his hands hard against his eyes and begins to scream.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes is twitching on the floor. He is lying on his back, legs drawn up with knees high, his palms are pressed against the floor either side of his head.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> One and a little bit more and one and a little bit more and one and a little bit more and one and a little bit more and one and one in Jakarta. Run. Run. Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Wait, shit. Jakarta.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> No… can’t be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> What’s happening? What the fuck is happening!?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The wall is now writhing. Martin storms over to Dr. Douglas and drags him up by the collar.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Jakarta is where the Captain saved our asses by exposing himself to a cognitohazard you motherfucker. He needed amnestic therapy to survive, your fucking mnestic’s making him remember!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> He needs amnestic, Class-A.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> It won’t work! We retreat. Now!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Captain Hayes begins to lift himself off the ground with his hands and feet. Once his back is fully off the ground, he opens his mouth to scream.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Shit! Wait!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel manages to flick a switch on her gas mask. A dull yellow light turns on above the gas mask’s left eye.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Hayes:</strong> [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED]</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Dr. Douglas, Lee and Martin cover their ears and scream in pain. They fall to the ground. Sections of the wall are now collapsing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> Why? Why? Why now? Why has it only activated now?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> It was a slow-burner even then…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> The reality anchor! You’ve been carrying it this whole time! Use it!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> None of this is ontokinetic…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel flicks the switch back off.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Focus! We are in full retreat!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Hayes howls in pain as his joints begin to invert. There is snapping and popping as his bones shift. His head begins a 180 degree rotation as his neck twists.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> I’m sorry Sir.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Bethel fires two shots into Hayes’ head, they are ineffective. A humanoid form erupts from the wall next to her. It tears the gun out of her grip and seizes her by the throat. She is elevated into the air. She struggles and kicks against the adjacent wall, breaking free of the creature’s grip.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>When she lands hard back onto the ground, it gives way beneath her. Her and the creature fall through the floor and vanish out of view. Her audio and video feed goes dead.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Hayes screams in agony, the sound inhuman. His jaw is last to extend, his skeletal structure is now canine. Two more humanoid-fungal forms emerge around him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Lee:</strong> No… I can't, I can't. It’s not. It’s not…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Lee opens fire on Hayes, it is not effective. Hayes pounces onto him, pinning him to the floor. Lee screams. The scream dies as Hayes begins to ravage his throat with his jaws.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> No more…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Dr. Douglas is shaking, the blood vessels in his eyes have completely burst. The whites of his eyes are now red, blood leaks slowly from his tear ducts. He turns to Martin.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Douglas:</strong> What do we do? What do we do? What? What? What…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Martin moves to Dr. Douglas and unholsters his sidearm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Martin:</strong> Fuck you Frank.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>He shoots him once in the head. His blood comes out steaming.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>An arm breaks out of the wall next to Martin and begins to pull him into an opening of dense fungal growth. He is pulled fully into the opening, tendrils begin to close around him. He does not resist.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Hayes continues to ravage Lee’s throat. Four humanoid-fungal forms converge on his position and begin to attack him. He swipes back and screams. Further forms begin to emerge from the walls.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>One by one, each of the members' video and audio feeds go dead.</em></span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>46 seconds later, Bethel’s audio and video feed resume. She is sprinting down the corridors of SCP-9055.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She continues for a further two minutes, before the corridor abruptly ends. She skids to a halt and falls to the ground in a tumble, coming to a stop on the lip of an enormous cavity. The pit is at least 50 metres across, and 200 metres deep. Other truncated corridors and offices are visible lining the edges.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> (Mumbling) I hear you… I hear you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She attempts to stand, but can only kneel.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> (Mumbling) You’re forgotten. This whole place is forgotten. You don’t want to be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She tears her gas mask off and takes several ragged breaths.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> (Mumbling) Howling… Howling… What happened? This pit…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She dry heaves.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> M- My… Gray matter… Dripping out my nose… Still… Thinking through it… Not even letting me die…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>There are sounds of movement behind her.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> It’s running down my throat like snot… I can <em>taste</em> it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The sounds get louder.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> You have to stop this… Whoever you are… Bring everyone you need… Everyone you can… This has to end… Half my brain is on the floor… Half in my gullet…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She turns, the altered form of Captain Hayes is behind her, preparing to pounce.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Bethel:</strong> Sir… I tried… To lead…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>She unclips a Level-6 Calamity Grenade from her belt and pulls the pin. Hayes pounces.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;">This is senior researcher Dr. Gerry Doakes. The date is 13/10/2021 — 13:01 local time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I am at the bottom of ‘the pit’ as the others called it. It’s like a huge three-dimensional bite has been taken out of the building. Perhaps the epicentre of whatever attack befell this place? Or just the physical part of it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">God- [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [UNINTELLIGIBLE] that hurts… What a cruel irony… We foundationers are the worst people to have this happen to. We’re trained to be constantly thinking, constantly hypothesising – layering thoughts over one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">No- No I still have time. I must be close to some administration… some command or control. I can end this. For all of you, for all of <em>us</em>.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I did it! I bloody did it!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I had to run a bit at the end there when the walls started to wake up, properly threw my back out, but that’s almost pleasant compared to the headache.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">There’s terminals and files in here, I will learn everything about this damn fungus… Stop this nightmare.</span></p>

<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I don’t know what moronic adrenaline I was running on, I have solved nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The fungus is a foundation creation, that’s why it’s so damn powerful – blowing the very concept of this place straight out of the noösphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Moreso, it was released <em>deliberately</em>. It isn’t behind the attack, it was released as a response to whatever the attack was.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Then what on earth happened here? What was the attack? Was it the spiders? But the spiders are here!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">In in a cupboard here, there’s eight of them! Damn near gave me a heart attack when I opened the door. But they’re dead, inert – missing their legs. How does that fit? How, how, how.</span></p>

<strong>Addendum 9055.12:</strong> Eulogy</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Hello, my name is Sam Crow.<br/>
I am an artificial intelligence specialist at Site-14.<br/>
The date is 22/10/2021 — It is exactly noon.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’m going to take mine a little slower, talk through some things. To this I feel entitled, as nobody will ever read it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">This is the last addendum, I’ve figured it out.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">Well most of it at least… We all have our limits, but I’m certain I’ve identified the key. The missing piece that starts to bring this all together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Maybe it takes an AI specialist to see it: the key is the <em>construct</em>.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">Heading down the stairs now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Huge areas of Site-14A are dedicated to life support systems, it’s indicative – as my predecessors have already theorised – of self-sufficiency. This place was meant to work away invisibly without outside help or outside notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">These systems need constant management; you either enlist more staff or use an AIC. Hell, even janitors. Do you hire janitorial and engineering staff to upkeep your secret site and never let them leave? Or do you let an AIC handle it with a fleet of droids.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Up to the directors really, but the droids are a pretty nifty option. They glide around the site, keeping out of the way, fixing and cleaning everything that needs it. They look like little silver domes hovering across the floor. In fact, they look a hell of a lot like those metallic arachnoforms – except without the legs.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">Entering SCP-9055 now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’m certain Site-14A had an AIC. Except, we know that whatever the attack was, whatever happened to this place, there was significant digital attrition and mass corruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The construct would have been torn to pieces then, right? But I don’t think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The automated functions and reports that have made it onto the system since the attack… Perhaps they looked normal to my predecessors, but I’ve worked with enough constructs to know that something is very odd here. It’s a shame that a psychologist will never get to see this, because it is truly fascinating.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The corruption and glitches in these reports are not just the physical results of the attack, but the <em>psychological</em> after-effects. I believe the AIC is still active, but it’s <em>traumatised</em>. These reports are skittish and nervous, the inter-system handshakes are weak and trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It’s scared. It’s screaming out for help, but nobody’s listening.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">Heading deeper now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">Maybe none of this makes sense. Maybe I’m not presenting my theory as well as I could be to my non-existent audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I mean, I still have no idea what in the flying fuck attacked this site in the first place… But I don’t think I need to. This nightmare ends when people stop being randomly dosed, when this place is left to rest in peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The AIC is sending its drones up to Site-14 and dosing people. You see that, right? Exactly why said drones now have creepy little legs attached to them I don’t understand – but I understand the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">The others did well to reach the command centre, but there’s only one room where this ends.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:white;">I’ve reached the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">It occurs to me that I should say a few words, nobody else can.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">I want to acknowledge the men and women of the foundation who died in their efforts to bring an end to this affair. Our sacrifices may not be perceived, but they are remembered. Remembered by us, by our comrades. We each led the next further in this mission, and now I stand at the close. I say these words in the knowledge that they are unheard, but also in the knowledge that they mark our victory. Victory over SCP-9055, and our victory in the preservation of our comrade’s memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;">So here’s to us, the gone but not forgotten.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:white;"><br/>
<br/>
<em>The security camera is mounted above the manual access door. The AIC_CORE room is cramped but empty. Screens and displays line the two walls to the left and right. The wall between those is blank except for ten circular rings of light.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>An unidentified person walks through the manual access door. Their clothes are filthy and their skin is pale and sickly. Their eyes are extremely bloodshot and twitching erratically.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Someone someone here. Are you Director Perry?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Unidentified Person:</strong> Hi Frederick. No, my name is Sam Crow.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Please find Director Perry as soon as possible. Site-14A is under significant memetic attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Sure thing, just got to do something first.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow walks over to the upper-leftmost of the circular lights. He works at it for two seconds, then a handle appears from the wall. He grunts as he pulls the handle, a white-blue cylinder extends from the wall as he pulls.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Counter-measures have been deployed. Maximum scrutiny counter-measures deployed. Efficacy unknown. Structural damage to Site-14A critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The cylinder is fully extended, Crow begins to work on the second just below it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> You did everything you could Frederick. You made the right choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Personnel casualties unknown, but likely high… I’m so sorry sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The second cylinder is fully extended. Crow sighs and turns around, he notices the security camera above the access door.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Is that recording?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Manual access to the core is automatically logged.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Could you set that to automatic transcription and upload and add it to the end of the SCP-9055 file?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Certainly, Director Perry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Heh, just did a nice little speech… But maybe this is a more fitting end-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow stumbles and catches himself against the wall. He groans in pain and reaches a hand to his head. He tears out a large tuft of hair.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Jesus, this never being able to forget anything… Must be what it’s like for you, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Protocol 184 was initiated. Site-14 hailed repeatedly, response negative. Response negative. Response negative. Ignored. Ignored. Forgotten. Forgotten. Forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow works on the third and fourth lights simultaneously, then pulls the two cylinders out together.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Needed orders. Needed help. Protocol 167 initiated. Class-W SOS failed. Class-X SOS failed. Class-Y SOS failed. Class-Z SOS pending…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow moves on to the fifth and sixth.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Memetic threat… Let the robot take charge… But it got you as well, didn’t it Fred? What the hell was it? What attacked Site-14A?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> The spider with five legs with five legs with five legs with five legs with five legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Okay… Okay… Tell me, the fungus isn’t gonna spread anymore is it? It’s in Site-14’s vents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Deployment already at theoretical maximum, counter-measure area of influence will not increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Good, good. So we’ve just gotta stop <em>you</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow screams in pain as the fifth and sixth cylinder are fully extended. He stumbles back to the wall. There is blood running from his nose and eyes. The handles extend, he begins to pull out the seventh and eighth.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Critical systems failing… Failing…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> You killed us all Frederick, this fucking drug. But I can’t blame you… You were scared, you were doing what you thought was best.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Director Perry? I am… forgetting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> A lot of the people who I thought did me wrong were just like you Frederick. Scared and doing their best. I can see that now… Now that I see it all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Forgetting… Data irretrievable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> That’s a gift really… You’ve given me some closure before the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The seventh and eighth cylinders are fully extended. Crow begins to work at the final two lights, his hands are shaking uncontrollably.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> That’s what people want right? Life flashing before their eyes?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> The spider… Gone?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> Thank you Frederick… (Choking) I’m going to end this end this now now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>Crow begins to pull the final two cylinders out of the wall – they are coloured a deep crimson. He pulls with his entire body weight, the cylinders creep outward from the wall a centimetre a second. Crow is screaming in agony. His mouth, nose and eyes are streaming with thick, steaming blood. The cylinders are fully removed, he loses his grip as his hands spasm. He falls to the floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> Director Perry? I’m scared… I- I- I- I-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> It’s okay… It’s okay…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>All of the lights in the room start to dim.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> It’s okay…</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><em>The room is in pitch darkness.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><strong>Crow:</strong> We’ll be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:white;"><span style="font-size:0px;"><strong>FREDERICK.aic:</strong> The spider sleeps furiously</span></span></p>

Class-Z Mnestics are the strongest biochemical fortification agents possible. Administration permanently destroys the subject’s ability to forget, resulting in perfect eidetic memory and perfect immunity to arbitrarily strong antimemetic interference. Other effects include uncontrollable recollection of previously lived experiences, accuracy of such recovered memories is between 90-100%</div>
