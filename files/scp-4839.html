</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4839</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Black <span style="color: black">•</span></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the large volume of SCP-4839 in existence, Mass Containment Zone-4839, hereafter MCZ-4839, has been constructed within <a href="/scp-2400">SCP-2400</a>. MCZ-4839 is composed of two warehouses for storage of SCP-4839, living quarters for staff, and barracks for guards. Each warehouse will be equipped with a Kullervo Suppressor, thereby neutralizing the dangerous effects of contained instances.</p>
<p>Items that carry SCP-4839 are to be contained as-is. Living instances are to be accommodated with nutrition and other sustenance. Deceased instances are to be contained, as well.</p>
<p>Acquisition of additional SCP-4839 is to be carried out through the use of Kullervo Detectors, available at every major Foundation site. Any usage of Kullervo Detectors that deviates from the provided instruction manual is grounds for immediate termination of employment with the Foundation and the administration of Class-C amnestics.</p>
<p>Though SCP-4839 poses no threat while contained, it is estimated that only 4% of SCP-4839 in existence is currently under containment. Failure to contain at least 70% of SCP-4839 by 12/2/2065 will result in a ZK-class reality failure scenario.</p>

It is discovered SCP-4839 cannot be transferred from its host object, and does not affect the object’s mass.</p>

<tr>
<td>The Bangka slow loris (<em>Nycticebus bancanus</em>)</td>
<td>All wild instances, approximately 70% previously captive specimens, and approximately 40% of deceased specimens have been captured and contained.</td>

<p><tt>STAFF MEMBER(S) RESPONSIBLE: Dr. Aaron Hamlin</tt></p>
<p><tt>EVIDENCE AGAINST AUTHENTICITY</tt><br/>
<tt>- Lack of testing records.</tt><br/>
<tt>- Incident 99-150-B, whereupon a Junior Researcher accidentally dropped a Barton-Salas Kullervo Detector. Disassembly of the broken unit revealed no capacity to detect anomalous energy sources.</tt><br/>
<tt>- Document-4839-Charlie: Written confession from Dr. Aaron Hamlin that the existence of GoI-4817 “Green Sky Tavern” was fabricated at the behest of an anonymous third party.</tt><br/>
<tt>- Document 4839-Delta: — a sworn declaration from GoI-419 “Three Moons Initiative” claiming that the Seventh Prince of Corbenic (their benefactor) was unaware of any of its alleged plans outlined in SCP-4839. In addition, the entity is not named “Dread Kullervo”, and is considering extradimensional legal action against the Foundation for libel. Document was provided by an SCP-2578-D instance and stamped with lie-detecting thaumaturgical glyphs.</tt></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, I know there’s been a lot of changes lately. More sad people. More screaming. More people not wanting to put things in the box. More people not wanting to be in the box. More people thinking that the boxes are bad, that there are too many boxes. That I can’t fit a whole planet in a box. That too many people are dying in the boxes. That we can’t put a box of all boxes in a box, that’s a pair of ducks or something. That there’s no real reason to keep putting things in boxes. That this was all some kind of K-class scenario in itself.</p>
<p>It’s confusing — I get that. It makes my head hurt. It takes really, really, really, really smart people to understand it. And that’s where you guys come in! I love all the work you’re doing. You do what I can’t, because I’m not human anymore. Which is okay — just a part of give and take, right? There was a story where a guy gave his right eye to another guy for wisdom. I forget how the rest of it goes. Point being, necessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>You don’t think I’ve been having problems too? There’s something that makes me sad. It goes like this: see, I’m the Administrator. That means I administrate. All the things in the Foundation are here because <em>I have them.</em> And even then, there are people who think that I’m going too far.</p>
<p>Putting things in boxes is bad. I get that.</p>
<p>You know what’s worse? <em>Stealing.</em></p>
<p>Love,<br/>
Aaron Hamlin, Administrator of the Foundation</p>
