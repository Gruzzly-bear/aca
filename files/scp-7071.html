<p>Depiction of SCP-7071 by Marcus █████, in 2019 at Little Footprints Day Care</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Recovery Information:</strong> SCP-7071 was first discovered in Little Footprints Day Care, in ██████ █████████ South Carolina. Anomalous activity was first indicated to the Foundation by accounts by staff and parents of children mentioning the same fictional entity without first communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Agent Simon Janecek posed as a writer for a childcare journal, looking into a potential article on local day care centers, in order to interview children and staff. SCP-7071 was identified and recovered at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Interview #06 - May 21st, 2022 - Lindsay ███████, aged 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: Hi Lindsay, can you tell me some of the toys you like here?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: I like my Barbie, and the big bear, and the super bouncy ball.</p>
<p><em>[Janecek points to SCP-7071]</em></p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: What do you think about this one?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Wiggly! I like Wiggly but he's not my favourite.</p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: Why do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: He's a kid like me but he can fly and he's big.</p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: He's big?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: He's as big as a giraffe!</p>
<p><em>[Lindsay leans toward Janecek to avoid being overheard by day care staff]</em></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Also his sister's name sounds like "poopy".</p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: I see. I see. And then why isn't it your favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: I don't like aliens. They're gross!</p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: And, um, Wiggly is an alien, then?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: No! He's normal but he goes with aliens. Plus also he's sad!</p>
<p><em>[Linday pats SCP-7071 on the head and speaks directly to it]</em></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Sorry Wiggly!</p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: Why is he sad?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: He only ever wants to find Billy. It's boring.</p>
<p><em>[Janecek points to SCP-7071 again]</em></p>
<p><strong>Janecek</strong>: The toy wants to find someone?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Not for real! You're being silly.</p>

<p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Can we be done now? I want to go run outside. Bye!</p>

<p>The first manifestation of SCP-7071's anomalous properties is not known, but the object was eventually identified by one staff member as the creation of Vanessa Lon-Johnstone<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, the parent of a previous member of Little Footprints Day Care, constructed in the year 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Day</strong>: Can you identify this object?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: This is a stuffed animal. It looks like a large worm, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Day</strong>: What name would you give it?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: If I was supposed to name it, maybe Wiggly?</p>
<p><strong>Day</strong>: Is there any reason for this name?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: He looks like it, right? I mean, it looks like it could wiggle.</p>
<p><strong>Day</strong>: How would you describe the object's personality?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: I guess I would say friendly, but worried, or maybe uneasy?</p>
<p><em>[Solanki hesitates, and appears embarrassed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: I mean that if he, or it, was real, that's how it seems like it would be. It doesn't actually have a personality.</p>
<p><strong>Day</strong>: I understand. Is there anything else you can tell me about the object from your superficial observation?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: It looks hand-made, or maybe like it was repaired a lot by hand. It looks like he, or it, is supposed to be a little kid, and it looks pretty soft. I guess that last part is most plush toys, though. I'm sorry, I don't know what else.</p>
<p><strong>Day</strong>: Have you observed any anomalous traits related to this object?</p>
<p><strong>Solanki</strong>: No, I don't think so. Are there any?</p>

<p><strong>Elaine</strong>: We're flying over the ocean, and a bunch of islands we've never seen before. Wiggly is carrying me on his back. There's an island full of little green men, and they're singing and dancing, but…</p>

<p><strong>Test 7071-C</strong>: SCP-7071 was given to Belinda Johnstone, the object's original owner. Scheduling conflicts with Johnstone's work<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> had previously delayed her participation in testing.</p>

<p><strong>Johnstone</strong>: Yes, I did! Just like I always said I would.</p>
<p><strong>Johnstone</strong>: It's a lot harder than I thought back then, but I love it.</p>
<p><em>[Johnstone laughs out loud.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Johnstone</strong>: I can't believe you remember that, but yeah, I still have the same CD. The kids in my class love that song, and the "Alien Food" song.</p>

<p><strong>Johnstone</strong>: Aw, don't worry Wiggly. I'll always be out there, too.</p>

<p><strong>Johnstone</strong>: Don't worry, you won't.</p>

<p>When asked by Senior Researcher Day following Test-7071-C, Belinda Johnstone reported that she was only pretending to converse with the object, and that she did not consider any part of the encounter to be unusual.</p>
<p>SCP-7071 has not demonstrated any anomalous properties since the completion of Test-7071-C. To this date, no member of the Johnstone family has been connected to any other anomalous phenomenon.</p>
