<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-8608 is a collection of five erotic anime episodes from a series titled "<em>ねえ、そんな目で見ないで〜あたしは妊娠可能な46歳、2児の母親で、まだJKなのよ〜？！</em>," roughly translated as, "<em>Hey, don't look at me like that — I'm 46 years old, fertile, a mother of two, and I'm still a schoolgirl?!</em>" While each episode follows a specific loose theme or premise as described on physical packaging, episodes vary greatly between viewings, with scenes, plot points, dialogue, and occasionally even genre differing each time an episode is viewed.</p>
<p>SCP-8608 follows "secondary protagonist" Ayana Shiragami, a woman "apparently in her late adulthood," as she navigates her way through Otaku High. I was two years behind in high school, held back because we moved to America when I was a young child and I didn't understand English very well. As the anime continues, Shiragami introduces her two "legally adult" children who also attend Otaku High. I was the oldest of three girls, but I felt like the youngest. My sisters were my "social coaches," as my parents put it. My middle sister, two years younger than me, was in my same grade. She's an adult now too, with a real job out somewhere safer. I'm so happy for her, and I miss her so badly.</p>
<p>SCP-8608's anomalous properties begin to manifest when I was thirteen years old. My parents asked me if I felt "funny" when I held hands with boys at church to pray. I didn't know what they meant and I didn't understand why they were worried when I said no. When I was fifteen I still couldn't get that "funny" feeling. My father, trying to comfort me but failing, reassured me that he knew I wasn't gay. I didn't know about that, myself. I didn't feel like <em>anything</em>. But next year, when my sexuality would finally come in, we'd find out for sure.</p>
<p>Or the next year, I guess. Or the year after that.</p>
<p>Attached is a complete list of SCP-8608's episodes, alongside notable features and details that both differ and remain consistent between viewings.</p>

<p>Growing up, sex was always this strange, distant thing. It was the topic of the night so many times at youth group, but nobody ever really bothered <em>explaining</em> it to me. I never had "the talk." I never wanted it. The boys talked about "struggling" with pornography and the girls talked about "purity" and "saving ourselves for marriage." By the time I was fifteen I had learned to just kind of pretend I already knew all about it. And then I hit college. I hit college.</p>
<p>Once, about halfway through our relationship, I had lunch with another classmate. We talked about a group project we were working on and a movie we had both seen recently. You were <em>furious.</em> You made me swear up and down I would never be alone with another man ever again. Because I was "yours." I was confused, and upset, and felt like I had done nothing wrong and everything wrong at the same time. I called my Dad for advice and he took your side. I <em>was</em> yours, he explained, and it wasn't right of me to be alone with other men. "Who knows what could happen." I still love my father, and I will never forgive him.</p>

Characters present within the show express awareness and knowledge of the viewer's identity, and/or personal background, often citing names, historical events, popular culture, or other related information throughout. SCP-8608 is nothing, it's fine. SCP-8608 is Adam Markley, the man I dated from my Freshman through to my Junior year of college. It's nothing. I was so excited to be out of that stupid Florida town. I was so excited to finally be a real adult, and nothing was more adult than <em>him.</em> He was funny, in a weird kind of way, and he <em>really</em> liked me. I felt like my hand was over a fire from the very beginning. I should have known better. Is it wrong of me to blame myself for not knowing better? It's nothing. It's <em>nothing</em>, it's fine. Nothing is ever nothing. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The first time I mentioned being asexual he stopped talking to me for a week.</span> He made jokes about my virginity to his friends, and, when we were alone, quietly confessed that he was one too. I had never been in love before and I guessed that this is what it was like. Nothing.</p>
<p>SCP-8608 is a joke at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my expense</span> nothing. SCP-8608 shouldn't make me feel this <em>small</em>. The first time it happened I felt like there were strands of string draped over my face and body. I couldn't shake them off. He wants to "try something" he saw in one of his shows. He wants me to watch them with him. He wants me to "just get used to it." We were driving to his dorm and I said I didn't really want to do it tonight. He was quiet for a long time and then said, very calmly, that he could swerve and crash the car right now. We did it that night after all. Watching (being?) SCP-8608 makes me shrink back into myself. It's nothing. If I didn't want this, I wouldn't still be here with him, would I? I must want this. I <em>must</em>.</p>

<p>My life was saved by, of all things, <em>Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa</em>.</p>
<p>It's this <em>terrible</em> Christmas movie. Animated, barely. It was Christmas break, and he was out of state spending the holidays with his family, and I was out of state spending the holidays with mine. I hopped on a Discord call with some friends of mine and somebody put the movie on. We watched, and we laughed, and we talked, and we <em>kept</em> talking, hours after it had ended. Just… leaving the play button up on the screen, cracking jokes and telling stories of shitty, shitty Christmas specials.</p>
<p>We didn't talk about anything important. I sure didn't bring up what was happening. It should have been nothing, but - well, you know the saying by now. It was <em>easy</em>. I was with people who <em>saw me</em> when they looked at me.</p>
<p>Adam didn't talk to me that week. He didn't call, and I didn't call, either. But when we got back to campus, he was in my dorm before I was. I'm still not sure how.</p>
<p>I wanted, more than anything, to just go back to that Discord call. He wanted, more than anything, to "make up for lost time." Things were finally starting to break down.</p>

<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>On 2/7/2019, Site Director Adam Markley allotted Junior Researcher Ayana Shiragami a one-week sabbatical from SCP-8608's standard physical maintanence procedures. This sabbatical would end on Valentine's Day, 2/14/2019, by which time Director Markley hoped Junior Researcher Shiragami would be refreshed and less resistant towards her mandatory tasks.</p>
<p>Shiragami, who believed Director Markley was overstepping his authority, submitted a letter of resignation immediately. It was the scariest thing I've ever done.</p>

<p><strong>K-CLASS DISASTER SCENARIO 8608:</strong> A K-Class Disaster Scenario 8608 will be declared in the event that Junior Researcher Ayana Shiragami becomes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unwilling or</span> unable to perform her assigned physical maintanence procedures. SCP-8608 (Site Director Adam Markley) is projected to become violently unstable. In the event of a K-Class Disaster Scenario 8608, take the following safety procedures immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call Mom.</li>
<li>Cry.</li>
<li>Hang up Christmas decorations in your bedroom because they make you feel like yourself again. Then never take them down for the next six years.</li>
<li>Spend a minimum of 5 (five) hours a day watching cartoons from your childhood. Avoid anime.</li>
<li>At the recommendation of your friends, save the voicemails he leaves you in case he tries anything and you need them in court. <strong>Do not listen to them more than once.</strong></li>
<li>Try to somehow focus on your schoolwork.</li>
<li>Call Mom again and cry again.</li>

<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 3/23/2025</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> SITE-119 MESS HALL (THE POPEYE'S ACROSS THE STREET FROM CHURCH)</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWED:</strong> JUNIOR RESEARCHER AYANA SHIRAGAMI</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> MOM</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Come on in, come on in. Goodness, babe. It's okay. I'm here. What do you want to eat? I'll get it this time.</p>
<p><em>I wipe the gunk out of my eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Fish sandwich would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> I was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><em>I go and find a clean booth to sit at while Mom orders two fish sandwiches and Dr Peppers. After a few minutes, she comes and sits down with me.</em></p>
<p><em>Mom gives me a fish sandwich, then reads my mind.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> You told your father already.</p>
<p><em>I nod.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> And, what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> He said he can't believe I'm still so hung up on "that gay little-"</p>
<p><em>Mom holds up a finger.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> That's… what I thought he'd say.</p>
<p><em>We both take a bite of our sandwiches.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> I've tried talking to him, but, well, you know how he is. He's stubborn.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I just wish he would understand that I'm still hurting, you know? I wish he didn't have to <em>understand</em> it in order to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> So do I.</p>
<p><em>Another bite of fish sandwich.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> You know, I was in high school the same time you were.</p>
<p><em>I look up.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Huh?</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> We moved to the U.S. when you were six, because your Dad had work here. But then, when you were a teenager, 2008 happened, his work dried up, and we had five mouths to feed and rent to pay without it. I… never really <em>got</em> a proper education, and I had an even harder time finding work in the recession than he did. So I went to school.</p>
<p><em>I think on that for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> How come I never saw you?</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> At school, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> …Ayana, I went to an adult high school. For adults.</p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> That's a thing?</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Across the street from the community clinic! There were about ten of us in that class, I think? Every morning I would drive you and your sisters to school, then take myself to mine. Study for six hours, eat at this Popeye's if I could afford it, and then drive over to the gas station where I worked part-time. Spent another six hours there, then came back home. Your father spent those twelve hours doing odd jobs for the people at church and looking for employment. If I was lucky, you girls were still awake when we got back and we all had time for a movie. If not… well, we saw you the next morning.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Wait, is that why Jessie's mom always drove us home from school?</p>
<p><em>Mom nods, and takes another bite of her sandwich.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> It was hard on all of us. I made sacrifices, your Dad made sacrifices, and we all got through. We tried to get through without you girls noticing too much.</p>
<p><em>I don't say anything.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Your father and I did a lot for you. We both love you, Ayana.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> …This isn't the best time to say this, but… you weren't always perfect. You and Dad.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You made a lot of decisions that ended up hurting me.</p>
<p><em>Mom nods. She looks… old.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Every parent does, some way or another.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Do they?</p>
<p><em>Mom seems a little thrown by the question. We both stay quiet, and take another bite of our sandwiches.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> So… what- <em>exactly</em> - happened today?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Not much to say about it. I saw him again. I don't know if he saw me, and I don't know why he's here. He was just… walking down the street. Looking the same as he always did.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> And you're sure it was him?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p><em>Mom finishes her sandwich and moves on to fries.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I shouldn't feel so scared all the time, I know. It happened <em>years</em> ago. I just— I keep feeling like I'm going to wake up and still be in my dorm bed again. And he's going to still be there, and I'm going to be <em>back</em>, and I'm never going to get to leave. I've moved on and I still feel stuck.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> That's trauma, babe.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Well, I don't <em>want</em> trauma. I have a <em>job</em> now. I don't have time for it!</p>
<p><em>Mom chuckles joylessly.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Welcome to adulthood. It sucks and then you die.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Were you always this bleak?</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> You're old enough for it now.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Hm.</p>
<p><em>We both sit in silence for a while and finish our food.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Mom?</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I'm glad we're still here. I'm glad we're both still around.</p>
<p><em>Mom smiles.</em></p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> Me too, sweetheart. …Do you want to spend tonight with us? Just to be safe?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MOM:</strong> We'll have the Christmas lights up for you.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM 8608-A:</strong> It's been a long time now. I still have to believe you did what you did because you genuinely didn't know to do anything else. I <em>have</em> to, even if it's giving you too much credit. I know you've been through hell just like me, and I know you hated yourself. And, to be fair, I'd hate myself too if I was you.</p>
<p>I want to end this whole thing with a nice little heartwarming bow. Because that's what I <em>do</em>, right? I tell stories with happy endings. What's the ending here? I lived. You're not in my life anymore. I've moved, and now you don't know where I live. Sometimes my dresser still goes up against my door at night anyways. <em>Yippee.</em></p>
<p>I don't have a happy ending this time. But I do have <em>hopes</em>. Adam, I hope you get better. I really, really do. I hope you grow up, live a good, healthy life, and forgive yourself, even when I don't forgive you. And above all, I hope you never fucking talk to me again.</p>
<p>You know, it occurs to me that, in all the chaos of our breakup, I never got the chance to say one last time that, through it all, I always loved you.</p>
<p>So, now that I have that chance here:</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
