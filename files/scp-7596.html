<p>SCP-7596.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to an ongoing investigation, SCP-7596 and the area surrounding it are to remain in situ. Following the completion of this investigation, the damaged infrastructure of Site-322 will be repaired, and SCP-7596 will be placed in a large vacuum chamber for further study and testing.</p>
<p>Site-322 personnel are being subpoenaed by a joint commission composed of the Ethics Committee and the Decommissioning Department upper-level staff. Failure to respond to meeting requests and interviews will be met with disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7596 is a stable singularity, roughly 4 meters in diameter, floating in an artificial cavern below Site-322. Foreign material that passes through SCP-7596's event horizon undergoes a spaghettification process, then vanishes into the singularity and becomes unrecoverable. SCP-7596 currently poses no known danger of expanding.</p>
<p>Floating inside SCP-7596 are eight bodies in a state of suspended animation, all wearing Foundation uniforms. Efforts to identify them are presently underway.</p>
<p>SCP-7596 is situated in Basement Level 34 of Site-322. An unknown series of events led to the destruction of this area, likely due to a tremendous release of force. Further information regarding its creation is currently unknown. The ongoing investigation has been divided between the Foundation's Decommissioning Department and the Ethics Committee.</p>
</div>
<p>The above file was created by Director Calvin Bold and Doctor Jeremiah Cimmerian (EC-1) for the SCP-7596 investigation, and has been distributed to all relevant parties. Below is the timeline of events that led to the creation of SCP-7596.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:140%;"><strong>TIMELINE</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>The Applied Paratechnology Department</strong></span></p>
<p>Following an Overseer Council mandate, Site-322 was assigned authority over the Foundation's collection of paratechnology, and the Applied Paratechnology Section was created, with Doctor Anthony Coix serving as its chairman.</p>
<div class="interview coix">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE’S INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What do you do, Coix? Lague has you here as ‘Co-Site Director’. That’s not an official position.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> O-Oh, well, It’s a… (<em>gestures</em>) personal relationship. If you, uh, read a little bit further down you’ll see I supervise the Research board and—</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> You’re the head of research?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> No, I supervise him. And— and I assist Director Lague in all matters personal and private, at his discretion. Like having another pair of arms.</p>
<p><em>EC-1 adjusts his glasses, and squints at Coix’s file.</em></p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> We’re under Security Clearance 4, you can drop the pretense.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Ah, my bad— sir. I’m the Chair for the Applied Paratech Section.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Anything in your background qualify you for that role, Coix?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> An amplitude of introductory engineering classes in my 20s, uh, over 15 years of experience overseeing Foundation projects, and an eye for picking the best and brightest.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> You’re a middle manager, Coix?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Project management and organization would be my specialty, sir. Regardless of the… ideological reception to Director Lague’s Integration Program, the Overseers wanted his directorial oversight on their projects. We had options; Applied Paratech seemed the most promising. And ethical, sir.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> So they wanted Lague for this and got you?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> He’s a very busy man.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> This department focuses on… (<em>Adjusts glasses</em>) “maintaining a modest database of paratechnology potentially useful to the Foundation. How it works, what it’s made of, what it does, and then sending it back to whatever Site it came from.”</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> That was our initial department focus. The Council demanded changes in exchange for leniency on the Integration Program.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Such as?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I need direct permission to tell you, sir. I do apologize, but—</p>
<p><em>(EC-1 slides a document to Coix, who examines it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Oh geez. <em>[…]</em> Well, uh, initially, between Lague and I, we were thinking more… technical archive, less Skunk Works.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Okay, so, Skunk Works was a laboratory at DARPA that was—</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> No, technical archive.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Oh. Well, we were more interested in recording interesting applications of paratechnology. Eigenweapons, physics-defiant mechanisms, anomalous computer viruses — after the whole <a href="/scp-7525-ex">SCP-7525-EX</a> thing, RAISA got on the Council's ass about keeping track of these things, which meant that Council got on <em>our</em> ass about it. But they were adamant that our primary goal was to assist the security of the Foundation. Whatever that meant was up to them. Now ethically, I tried to—</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Do you want to supervise a project ever again, Coix?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I, well, we—</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Then stop blaming everyone else and play some goddamn ball.</p>
</div>
<p>The Applied Paratechnology Section was assigned the main goal of researching and testing potential offensive, defensive, and containment capabilities of the Foundation's paratechnology. Before this current investigation, the breadth of the Section's operations and involvement with the Overseer Council's and Overwatch Command's projects was wholly unknown. With the aid of the Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), sealed files pertaining to a Level 6 top-secret project called "Isadore" were eventually unearthed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Project Isadore</strong></span></p>
<p>Project Isadore was a highly significant research endeavor that involved the entire team of the Applied Paratechnology Section, earning a reputation among the staff as a capital project.</p>
<p>Prior to Isadore’s execution, the Overseer Council had been aggressively advocating for all Foundation data to be transferred to Site-7's pocket dimension storage servers. Numerous Sites had yet to make substantial progress on the data transfers.</p>
<p>Despite the initial confidence placed in Site-7's pocket dimension storage, a number of issues were later identified. The most pressing issue was the occurrence of data corruption when attempting to transfer large quantities of information through the semistabilized Y-class dimensional gate. The resulting consequences ranged from file deletion to data corruption to the occurrence of inexplicable blackouts.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of Project Isadore was to design an interdimensional file transfer system that could be deemed indestructible. In the context of the project, "indestructible" was defined by the staff as a system that was self-repairing, self-updating, and impervious to all forms of external attack.</p>
<div class="interview davis">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> You were Isadore staff?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes, sir. I was responsible for heading the development side of the project.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Right, sorry. I— We get project requests sent based on levels of demand, I guess. 5 being pertinent and 1 being whenever, basically. Isadore was a 6. The hardware package we made was built with a monitor sourced from, uh, a digital terrorist. Gamers Against Weed, if I remember correctly. They used it for data storage, something like 500 petabytes. God knows what for, but it was what we had lying around.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> And this is the monitor Chairman Coix said was… “slapped together”?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Are you kidding? We didn’t have a quarter of the time we needed. We’re lucky it was “slapped together” at all. We put it into this empty steel frame where we hooked server connection ports, Internet and Bluetooth connectivity, and a perpetual generator from the Paratech archive. Again, it was a mess, but Coix set the deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> And you spoke for your team.</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Look, I tried to get my men on schedule as best as I could. I told him we needed more time, but there’s only so many times you can say something here before you’re on the other side of the door.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> If Coix wasn’t listening, then why not communicate these concerns to the Council, Davis?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Because that was Coix’s job.</p>
<p>(<em>EC-1 sighs, and continues typing.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> So it worked. This device.</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> <em>[…]</em> For a time, it did. Jones wanted to inspect it before she let us hook it up to RAISA’s hardware. So — uh, we brought it into the pocket dimension for a test run.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> And this is where th—</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Sir, I’d like to clarify that I had nothing to do with the Isadore testing parameters. Coix headed the experimentation. All Coix.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Cross Into Site-7's Pocket Dimension</strong></span></p>
<p>On May 24, 2023, Project Isadore was completed on schedule and transported to Site-7's pocket dimension. Maria Jones, the director of RAISA and Site-7, was granted authorization to test the Isadore machine on a secured test server.</p>
<div class="interview coix">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> I slept maybe five total hours that week — we all did. So when I had my team draft an outline for the testing procedures they—</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Oh, for the love of god.</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> They, uh, forgot that transporting a large amount of data into Site-7 led to corruption. This thing had 5000 terabytes of test files on it.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What do you mean, “forgot”?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Well, they— I mean, we had an experimental coating around the server that had been used in previous data transfer tests with great success.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Then <em>why</em> is there a black hole in Site-322’s basement?</p>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> It was experimental, sir.</p>

<p>Site-7 server farm CHRYSALIS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As SCP-7596-1 was linked to a power source and the quarantined server, and booted as expected. Researcher James Davis then triggered the data upload, immediately throwing Site-7 into a widespread power outage, the first in the Site's history. Concurrently, SCP-7596-1 emitted high levels of heat and vibrated vigorously, causing the server connected to it to explode. Isadore personnel immediately removed it from the power source, which temporarily resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Suddenly, SCP-7596-1, despite lacking a built-in power supply, independently rebooted, displaying a message on its monitor reading, "I MUST SELF-DESTRUCT." Personnel attempted to open the machine and inspect the internal structures, but discovered that their tools were entirely ineffective in removing the proper components.</p>
<div class="interview coix">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Coix:</strong> The shitshow started here.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Transport back to Site-322</strong></span></p>
<p>Maria Jones ordered the immediate removal of SCP-7596-1 from the server farm to prevent any further Site-wide damage. Upon examination, SCP-7596-1 was found to be entirely indestructible, with all known tools, weaponry, and anomalous influence proving to be completely ineffective against it.</p>
<div class="interview lague">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Lague:</strong> You guys don’t do discipline, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> That would be Internal Security, Director.</p>
<p><strong>Lague:</strong> Great. Listen, I kept my nose out of whatever Paratech was doing. Had enough on my plate with Integration. Wasn't my vibe, and the Council knew that. So I put Coix in charge. Consider him the Frank Wells to my Michael Eisner.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> I don’t follow, but your performance as a Site Director is not of the question, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Lague:</strong> I'm just giving some background; I wasn't involved. I would get weekly reports but they'd go into a pile. On top of everything else I had to read. I didn’t even know there were problems until Coix hits me at 4 in the morning with an emergency warning, begging me to get down to the Site as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<p>Director Paul Lague became involved in this case following SCP-7596-1's newly gained anomalous phenomena, despite being initially skeptical about his ability to assist Applied Paratechnology Section personnel. After the appearance of further anomalous phenomena, Lague ordered that SCP-7596-1 be contained as a precautionary measure.</p>
<div class="interview lague">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Lague:</strong> Apparently, it was given internet and Bluetooth connectivity. We don't know exactly what happened; we couldn't get into it to see. It started talking though — through text, I mean. Usually when something’s talking, my chances of getting it to shut up drastically increase.</p>
</div>
<div class="interview davis">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Our leading hypothesis is that when it connected to the server — quarantined or not — it downloaded data instead of uploading. Data on the structure and operating system the Foundation computers operated on, and, uh, the — what's it called — our file formatting, and the connection mediums of our internal systems. That was combined with a rudimentary form of sentience. I don't know how to describe it. It really wanted to be destroyed and made that abundantly clear.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> And Director Lague? How did he respond?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> He was drafting an integration proposal the second it spoke english.</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-7596-1, utilizing its Bluetooth connectivity and knowledge of Foundation procedures, unexpectedly linked to Site-322's early warning system and activated it, prompting a shelter-in-place command to be issued. Despite the team’s efforts to clarify the mistake, the alarm persisted for eighteen consecutive days, defying all attempts at deactivation. The relentless blaring of the warning caused significant discontent among personnel, leading to a general decline in morale. Meanwhile, SCP-7596-1 continued to display a variety of messages, including:</p>

<p>SCP-7596-1 remained unaffected by any attempt at conventional repair techniques, despite the efforts of Applied Paratechnology personnel. Its behavior and "mental state" grew increasingly erratic, angry, and aggressive. Below is a document discovered on Director Lague's personal computer, sent directly to the factotum of O5-6.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCIDENT ISADORE.2</strong></p>
<div class="incidenti">
<p><strong>Incident Description:</strong> SCP-7596-1 connected to Site-322's electrical system, intermittently enabling and disabling the Site's power connection in quick succession. Approximately three hours into the ordeal, Researcher Julian Hoover realized the pattern by which the power was connected and disconnected aligned with the dots and dashes system of Morse Code.</p>
<p>The following message was decoded:<br/>
"DO IT, COWARDS."</p>
<p>This message was repeatedly transmitted for 24 hours.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCIDENT ISADORE.4</strong></p>

<p><strong>Incident Description:</strong> All RFID scanners used to access the Site were disabled. Project Isadore researchers who were actively attempting repairs noted that SCP-7596-1's monitor displayed the message "I'LL LET YOU IN WHEN YOU LET ME INTO GOD'S GRACE."</p>
<p>Initially believing this message to mean that researchers would gain access to SCP-7596 internals, a digital upload of the Bible was attempted as a method to placate the anomaly momentarily. SCP-7596-1 rejected the upload, and researchers were then alerted to the Site's access issues.</p>

<p>Throughout the above events, Isadore staff were attempting increasingly esoteric methods to access SCP-7596-1's now-indestructible steel frame. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Localized bombings;</li>
<li>Application of heat;</li>
<li>Application of intense pressure;</li>

<li>Placing it into SCP-████;</li>
<li>Introducing it to similarly indestructible anomalies;</li>
<li>Ignoring it;</li>
<li>Attempts at gaslighting, under the assumption it was sentient;</li>
<li>Submerging it into a large pool of water;</li>
<li>Connecting <a href="/scp-5595">SCP-5595</a> to it in an attempt to communicate with it;

<li>[REDACTED]</li>
</ul>
<p>among others.</p>
<p>Following the swath of inconvenient, irritating, and dangerous incidents caused by SCP-7596-1, Site-322 leadership revised its approach to the situation and formally requested approval for SCP-7596-1's destruction from the Decommissioning Department.</p>

<p>Due to the secrecy surrounding Project Isadore, there was a clear lack of documentation for SCP-7596-1. Decommissioning Department Director Calvin Bold marked Site-322's initial request and applied a red flag to the ticket, later threatening to raise the issue to the Overseer Council for the repeated breach of protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Coix:</strong> Bold is a real hardass. I get that Decomm has to be rigid on rules and procedures, but it's not like we were asking for <em>much.</em> It was a pile of junk I forced nine geniuses to cobble into something workable. There was no real loss from its destruction. We weren’t killing the proverbial infant here.</p>

<p><strong>Bold:</strong> Thing was a piece-of-shit machine. "Geniuses", right? You got anyone I can point fingers at?</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> You don’t have enough hands.</p>
<p><strong>Bold:</strong> Christ. I was already pretty pissed at them over that DeComm request. Which— which— I’ve said this before, but we’re not your personal garbagemen. But that’s besides the point, they didn't even <em>mention</em> they might've created sentient digital life. You know the process!</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> I'm well aware.</p>
<p><strong>Bold:</strong> No Ethics Committee involvement! No attempts to interview it! No understanding of its anomalous capabilities! Hey, isn’t this guy like one half of the Integration Program? What, do you need both of them in the same room to make an intelligent decision? Or do they sincerely believe they have enough pull to just… stroll into my office and ask me to nuke their little fuck-up when it’s inconvenient for them? Doesn't fucking work like that, Jer. Fucking bullshit!</p>
</div>
<p>After inspecting SCP-7596-1, Director Bold began accosting Lague and Coix in a three-and-a-half-hour-long rant, highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every instance where protocol was broken over the last week, even including ones not associated with Project Isadore;</li>
<li>The gravity of Site-322's current situation and the possibility that Lague loses his position;</li>
<li>The ethical concerns of creating digital life and "slaughtering it like a pig;"</li>
<li>That decommissioning is a last resort not "some button you press when you're too busy eating glue and shoving crayons up your ass to do your job."</li>

<p>Results of Directors Bold and Lague's meeting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Director Lague attempted to appease Director Bold by providing an overview of the Applied Paratechnology Section's history. This only served to further enrage Bold, as he grew increasingly aggravated by the fact that Site-322 was pushing to have this matter escalated without the purview of the Overseer Council. Bold immediately stormed out of Site-322 and promptly blocked access to the Decommissioning request portal on the Site's terminals. However, Bold refrained from reporting the breaches of protocol to the Overseer Council.<br/>

<hr/>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What was your reason for not sending these "repeated fucking breaches of the protocol I sweated my ass off to make sure a midwit could understand" to the Overseer Council.</p>
<p><strong>Bold:</strong> Great, he recorded the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Probably to have witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Bold:</strong> The Site was a wreck. It’s always been a wreck, but this was something else. Alarms blaring, sprinklers going on and off, no internet— I saw people using typewriters. I mean, everyone looked like death. That was punishment enough from where I stand.</p>
</div>
<p>Two hours after Bold's departure, Site-322's request was officially denied.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Neutralization Attempts</strong></span></p>
<p>Following the Decommissioning Department's denial, Site-322 personnel once again opted to attempt containment on SCP-7596-1. This quickly proved futile, as, unbeknownst to Isadore researchers, SCP-7596-1 had slowly been embedding itself into Basement Level 32's concrete floor and could not be removed, despite the efforts of containment personnel.</p>
<p>Prior to the Decommissioning Department denial, Director Lague had been instituting a cover story for non-Applied Paratechnology Section staff, explaining the appearance of anomalous phenomena as the result of multiple Scranton Reality Anchor failures across the east coast's Sites.</p>
<p>Director Lague ordered Site-322 staff to meet in the Site's lobby, where the full extent of the issue was explained, including the decommissioning request denial and Overseer involvement. Acknowledging he would take full responsibility, Lague allowed the entirety of Site-322 staff to vote on whether they should continue containment attempts or move towards neutralization.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Lague:</strong> I felt bad for everyone. Eighty percent of my staff don't even have homes and depend on Sites to give them living quarters. No one could produce anything because that asshole computer kept closing the word processors when you typed. We tried using typewriters but that went to shit when it figured out how to trigger the sprinklers.</p>
</div>
<p>The resulting vote was split 1,472-342 in favor of neutralization.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Director Lague set up a pretty solid system. Him and I would receive neutralization ideas and we'd run them down to the basement to test them out.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> That seems convoluted.</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Ten people had access to where Applied Paratech was; it was either processing 2,000 access requests or getting in an elevator every few hours.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Was there anything else in the basement at the time?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Sure. I mean, we removed what we could once SCP-7596-1 went crazy, but we used that subbasement for storage of tons of paratechnology the Foundation had seized from everyone from Anderson Robotics to the United States government. We couldn't remove <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What did you do with the rest?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Packed up and extracted the dangerous stuff, and cut the power to or otherwise disabled the rest. It was mostly just useless stuff from old projects, anyway.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Destruction</strong></span></p>
<p>On June 11, 2023, SCP-7596-1 committed its final incident. There is currently no formal or informal documentation on what occurred, but recovered videotapes and tracking of Site-322's internal devices can create a clear picture of events leading to the destruction of SCP-7596-1.</p>
<p>This investigation led to an audit of Site-322's amnestic and mnestic dispersal system, finding that each container was critically low.</p>
<p>SCP-7596-1 gained access to Site-322's amnestic dispersal system. Amnestic dispersal follows the "Two-Man rule," a method of safeguarding since this system requires the simultaneous triggering from two separate terminals. This, of course, was overwritten by SCP-7596-1, who triggered the release of both mnestics and amnestics.</p>
<p>While dangerous in high dosages, mnestics and amnestics counter the effects of the other. Instead of death, high dosages of both place subjects in a temporary coma. Since the dispersal was Site-wide, the entirety of Site-322's personnel was rendered unconscious, including Director Lague, Doctor Coix, and Researchers Iglesias and Davis.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TIMELINE</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[20:31]:</strong> SCP-7596-1 eliminates RFID scanner connection to Basement Level 34's elevator.</p>
<p><strong>[20:42]:</strong> Cobb, manning a direct line from herself to Lague, is unable to contact him for 12 minutes. She alerts the remaining personnel of the issue.</p>
<p><strong>[21:05]:</strong> Wilkerson, Hardin, and Thornton all make futile attempts to connect with any Site-322 personnel. Meanwhile, Rice and Cobb attempt to operate the elevator, quickly discovering that they are trapped.</p>
<p><strong>[21:08]:</strong> Personnel meet with each other to discuss what's going on. Richards connects to their remaining terminal and accesses the Site's security cameras. SCP-7596-1 begins rapidly vibrating. Rice commands the machine to "shut the fuck up."</p>
<p><strong>[21:20]:</strong> SCP-7596-1 displays the following messages:<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> "YOU'RE ALL SICK"<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> "YOU'VE TORTURED ME ENOUGH"<br/>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span> "AND BRING THIS HATEFUL PLACE WITH ME"</p>
<p><strong>[21:41]:</strong> SCP-7596-1 initiated a download from Site-322's file servers, backup servers, and quarantined file systems. Upon receiving all of this information, the files were deleted from their original locations.</p>
<p>Applied Paratechnology staff were distracted by trying to escape until Wilkerson realized their attempts were futile.</p>
<p><strong>[21:46]:</strong> Rice notes that their file systems are empty. She accesses a virtual machine in an attempt to observe and mitigate the damage, only to find that everything was removed.</p>
<p>Rice alerts the rest of her colleagues. Thornton, having higher clearance, looks through the Level 4 files, locating a single SCP document with a corrupted name. She clicks on the file, finding it to belong to the quarantined <a href="/scp-7525-ex">SCP-7525-EX</a> file which serves as the containment chamber for the anomaly of the same designation. She relays this to the rest of the team; a number of them make noises of frustration and exclamations of anger.</p>
<p><strong>[21:47]:</strong> A 60 second countdown begins on SCP-7596-1's terminal.</p>
<p>Doctor Rice connects her terminal to SCP-7596-1 and triggers the upload of the SCP-7525-EX document.</p>
<p><strong>[21:48]:</strong> The upload completes. SCP-7596-1 stops vibrating; the countdown pauses at 00:00.</p>
<p>SCP-7596-1's monitor begins glitching, rapidly changing frames and text. The temperature of the room begins to increase as SCP-7596-1 glows an orange hue.</p>
<p>A final message is displayed through the glitched monitor display:<br/>

<hr/>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> The Slot <em>Goblin</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> It's a virus that affects Foundation documentation. Specifically it makes generated placeholder slots inaccessible and replaces them with a stupid JPEG telling us we've "been goblined".</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> … Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> It's <a href="/scp-7525-ex">SCP-7525-EX</a>, the whole damn reason the Council started Applied Paratech. No clue where it came from, so don’t ask. We had, uh, we contained it in a file and left it on an empty server on one of the basement levels so it couldn't access actual information to eat. I don't know what happened — if I had to guess, the goblin started eating away at all the files the Isadore machine had downloaded onto itself. It must've chewed right through them and then onto its software.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> So the indestructible machine was destroyed — the blackhole created as a result of that paradox?</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Looks like it. He's goblining in the stars now.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> What a charmingly convenient conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well, there's still a singularity of dead bodies in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>EC-1:</strong> Oh, right.</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-7596 was created as a result of the above events.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p>The eight members of Site-322's Applied Paratechnology Section, currently suspended in SCP-7596, have been awarded the Foundation Star for their sacrifice. The Ethics Committee is moving to conduct an investigation into the rest of the Overseer Council's confidential department assignments to prevent another issue from occurring. Site-322 is working in coordination with a combination of Exclusionary Sites to repair their on-Site records.</p>
<p>The events that led to the creation of SCP-7596 display the Foundation's continued encouragement of overwork on its personnel. That, combined with the stress of secrecy led to an entire Site being crippled by an anomaly which required expertise unavailable to the Applied Paratechnology Section. Due to the multiple breaches of protocol committed by Site-322 personnel and leadership, the verdict of the Internal Security Department has placed Site-322 under the direct supervision of a combined force of Ethics Committee staff, Internal Security leadership, and three Site Directors.</p>
<p>SCP-7525-EX is now considered neutralized.</p>
