<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>SCP-8250 interior. It is unknown where the light, as little as it is, comes from.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A 3-kilometer by 3-kilometer perimeter has been constructed around SCP-8250, which security personnel are to patrol regularly. Any civilians approaching the containment facility are to be redirected around it or amnesticised, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Should any SCP-8250-1 instancs attempt to breach containment, MTF Lambda-11 ("Night Terrors") is to either neutralize or capture them, depending on the danger.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8250 is a 2.5-kilometre squared forested area in Bragg Creek<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Provincial Park. Instead of a regular forest, the area appears to have been replaced by a visually pure black dome. This dome appears to have a smoke-like texture and is in constant motion. The surface of the dome, at last measure, absorbs 99.8% of all light, contributing to the darkness.</p>
<p>The inside of SCP-8250, designated SCP-8250-1 appears to be relatively unchanged. However, there are a few major differences. The biggest change is the lack of most light, though not all. This has not changed since SCP-8250 cropped up. The wildlife within, designated SCP-8250-2 instances also appears to be substantially more hostile. They have also been observed to have increased ability in certain areas.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. This change has been attributed to an anomalous form of radiation causing rapid change on an atomic level.</p>
<p>At the center of SCP-8250-1 is a sphere shaped entity, designated SCP-8250-4. It resembles SCP-8250 and appears to display a memetic effect on those who come into contact with it, as well as theists who enter SCP-8250. The reason why theists are affected so drastically is unknown. It also appears to be the source of SCP-8250.</p>
<p>Guarding SCP-8250-4 is SCP-8250-3, a mutated creature once known as Squad Leader Vasquez. Currently, SCP-8250-3 stands at 7 meters tall, and a lopsided form, shorter on the left side than the right. SCP-8250-3 has also displayed tremendous strength and musculature, being stronger than any SCP-8250-2 instance.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-8250 was discovered after several groups of hikers went missing in the area over the summer of 2022. Park rangers dispatched to the location also went missing. Several viral videos of the area were recorded and posted before being taken down and cited as misinformation. Foundation personnel were finally alerted following this and a Foundation presence was established.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 8250.1: Documented SCP-8250-2 Instances</strong></p>
<p>The following log details the 4 kinds of SCP-8250-2 instances found inside SCP-8250 and their differences to their non-anomalous counterparts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-8250-2-A<br/>
<strong>Type of Animal:</strong> White-Tailed Deer<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Substantial increase in strength noted. Subjects capable of breaking through 7 inch thick steel walls over the course of 15 minutes. Canines<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> observed. Subject also seen eating live prey. Eye contact advised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-8250-2-B<br/>
<strong>Type of Animal:</strong> Blue Jay<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Subject has dramatically increased in size, by nearly 12 times. Talons noted to be similar to those found in birds of prey. However, the beak has remained the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-8250-2-C<br/>
<strong>Type of Animal:</strong> Beaver<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> No outwardly obvious signs of change. However, massively increased intelligence has been observed. SCP-8250-2-C instances seen building highly advanced structures out of wood, and engaging in activities that generally only humans engage in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> SCP-8250-2-D<br/>
<strong>Type of Animal:</strong> Eastern Gray Squirrel<br/>
<strong>Notes:</strong> Subjects seen engaging in hive-mind behaviour, swarming prey in an attempt to kill.</p>

<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> All present?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> I'd like a present.</p>
<p><em>Head Researcher Williams looks at Researcher Collins sternly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Some people, man. Lighten up, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Can we just get on with it? Now, are we all present?</p>
<p><em>Chorus of yes' heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Good. What do we have?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> We discovered that SCP-8250 is emitting some sort of energy. So yesterday I sent some guys over with Geiger counters. The energy it's emitting? Radiation, or some anomalous form of it. I've decided to call the type it gives off A-Radiation.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Why Geiger counters?</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Based on the imaging we've already done, I thought it was reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> I did take the liberty of asking for assistance from MTF Lambda-11. They're uniquely suited to entering such territory.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Excellent. Collins, I need you to prepare them when they arrive, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Aye aye captain.</p>
<p><em>Head Researcher Williams sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Take this seriously, please.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Collins shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Yeah, sorry. Can't help it.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> I can understand that, I really do, but please just tone it back.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Of course. Apologies.</p>
<p><em>Head Researcher Williams nods at Researcher Collins.</em></p>

<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Obviously it's highly radioactive in there, at least, we think so. The radiation has extremely mutagenic properties. Not your normal radiation. I'm not sure how long the suits will protect you for. So my suggestion? Get in and get out as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><em>Head Researcher Williams enters and nods a greeting at the squad leader.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Welcome. I assume Collins gave a short briefing?</p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Chen:</strong> Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Good. All we want you to do is do a bit of observation. Don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. And if you feel like you need to draw back, do it.</p>

<p><em>Lambda-11 finally reaches the base of SCP-8250 after a long hike.</em></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> In and out, as quick and efficiently as we can. Alright, let's move.</p>
<p><em>Entry into SCP-8250 is achieved. Radio contact lost for 3.3 minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> - you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Loud and clear.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Chen:</strong> It is <em>dark</em> here. Like, darker than anything natural.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Hold one moment, Lambda-11.</tt></p>
<p><em>There's radio silence for 33 seconds before Head Researcher Williams talks again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>SCP-8250-1 appears to have inherited many of the same properties of SCP-8250. That includes its absorption of nearly all light. The fact there is light at all is odd. And on that note, I would advise you switch over to night vision. Please continue.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> Copy. Lambda-11, move out.</p>
<p><em>As they move, the darkness makes even the night vision struggle. Squad Leader Vasquez soon spots what appears to be a small herd of SCP-8250-2-A instances.</em></p>

<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Copy. Appears to be a herd of SCP-8250-2-A instances. I'd advise you back away very slowly. They don't look like much, but they're much stronger than you. And don't break eye contact, whatever you do.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> Copy that. Lambda-11, we're moving out. Back away slowly, don't break eye contact, alright?</p>
<p><strong>Lambda-11:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, Corporal Barry sneezes and the deer tense up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Run!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Vasquez:</strong> Run.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> We got too complacent. We didn't expect SCP-8250 to surprise us. Now we'll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> I hate to be that guy, but we need another MTF out here.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Didn't they just all die?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> No. That was merely a detachment of them. The rest are off doing whatever MTF's do in their spare time.</p>

<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Disconcerting?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> What was that?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> I just did a quick vitals check, and before he transformed, for lack of better word, he was emitting A-Radiation on a similar scale to SCP-8250.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> What? Why?</p>
<p><em>Researcher Collins shrugs and Head Researcher Williams speaks up.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Perhaps you were right, Davis. I've asked for another detachment of Lambda-11 to come and assist us.</p>

<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Apologies.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>Head Researcher Williams sighs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> The reason I asked for them is because we need to find whatever it is Vasquez was talking about. The Great Orb, he called it.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Didn't that drive him crazy?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Or perhaps something else did.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Comforting.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> We can, at the very least, try and make sure they don't take their suits off.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> Then do it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> On that topic, can we talk about what happened to Vasquez?</p>

<p><strong>Researcher Collins:</strong> Well, he mutated into some weird Wendigo<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> thing in seconds. Is no-one going to comment on that?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Actually, he's got a point. We're going to have to assume this new Vasquez is just as hostile as the other SCP-8250-2 instances. What do we do if we meet him.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Neutralize him. End of.</p>
<p><em>An argument broke out following this statement. For the sake of brevity, it has been omitted from the record.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> If he acts hostile towards Lambda-11, they'll neutralize him. If not, they'll leave him be. Simple enough.</p>
<p><em>There's some grumbling, but no-one says anything.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> If that's all, this meeting is adjourned.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 8250.9: Head Researcher Williams' Notes</strong></p>
<p>The following details Head Researchers Williams thoughts on SCP-8250. They were taken shortly after the last meeting.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p>That was quite painful. It's like all the personnel here are children. But alas, I am not here to bitch about other people.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about what Vasquez said. He said he saw God. I am not convinced he did not. Perhaps what we're witnessing is natures evolutionary ascent. I mean, look at it! Beavers with enhanced intelligence, squirrels with hive minds, deer strong enough to rip through steel. Life evolved in the dark, after all. And what is this if not evolution?</p>
<p>It's ironic. I have been a theist for all these years despite my work at the Foundation. I have been called crazy for it. And yet, here I stand, about to discover God. Maybe I was right. Maybe it was all worth it.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm just a tired old man who's had too much time to think, who's going crazy. But regardless of what it is, I <em>will</em> figure this out. Lambda-11 shall be the surgical tool I use to cut this mystery open. And then we shall see what I am.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>MTF Lambda-11 is seen in a truck this time around. As they pass through SCP-8250, the light level immediately drops.</em></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Butler:</strong> Sure is dark.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Humanity evolved in the dark. You'll be fine.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Roger.</p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Belson:</strong> What does that even mean?</p>
<p><em>Squad Leader Klein shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Johanna:</strong> That's what we're trying to figure out, right?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Squad Leader Vasquez of the detachment went crazy after finding something in there. We need you to find it.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Belson:</strong> Er, he sees the paradox in that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Yes. It seems crazy.</tt></p>
<p><em>Sergeant Belson jolts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sergean Belson:</strong> Oh shit. He can hear me?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Yes. And I agree, it is paradoxical. That's why you have updated SCRAMBLE goggles as part of your gear. It should prevent any visual cognitohazards.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Johanna:</strong> Should? That's comforting.</p>
<p><em>The truck comes to a stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Alright. Let's go.</p>
<p><em>MTF Lambda-11 disembarks from the truck and starts moving on foot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Command, are you getting any readings?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Yeah. I'm getting some really weird radiation readings 3 klicks north of you. Odd that I can see it through SCP-8250.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Copy. Lambda-11, we're heading north.</p>
<p><strong>Corporal Butler:</strong> Boy am I glad we have these suits.</p>
<p><em>Approximately 1.7 klicks into their journey, MTF Lambda encounters a hive of SCP-8250-2-D instances, who immediately attack. Luckily, Lambda-11's reinforced RPS' prevent any damage while the instances are taken care of.</em></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Butler:</strong> Command, have you ever fought a horde of hive minded squirrels before?</p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Can't say that I have Butler. Certainly wasn't on my to do list.</tt></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Johanna:</strong> Good.</p>
<p><em>Squad Leader Klein shoots her a look of warning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>Keep heading north. You're only about a click away now.</tt></p>
<p><em>MTF Lamdba-11 keeps walking and enters dense forest area. And there, in between the trees, is the Great Orb.</em></p>
<p>[UNSUCCESSFUL IMAGE UPLOAD] [IMAGE CORRUPTED]</p>
<p><em>The entire squad wince once they see it, presumed to be a reaction to the large amounts of radiation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Belson:</strong> Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>Corporal Butler:</strong> Oh my God</p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Command? What the fuck is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>It's… it's everything I imagined. It's beautiful.</tt></p>
<p><em>Corporal Johanna drops to one knee and unsteadily gets up again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Corporal Johanna:</strong> Painful is what it is. Can we go, Clark<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>?</p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Command, we're getting out of here!</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>No! Stay! Please!</tt></p>
<p><em>A piercing roar is heard as what used to be Vasquez enters the area. It's a very tall, muscular creature, slumped to one side. Lambda-11 immediately opens fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Squad Leader Klein:</strong> Let's go!</p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>This is the culmination of everything I've ever dreamed of! You won't take that from me!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Unknown<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>:</strong> <tt>What in Gods name are you doing?!</tt></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>I'm doing it for them!</tt></p>
<p><em>A scuffle ensues on the other end of the radio, a few bangs heard, before it's reactivated.</em></p>
<p><strong>Head Researcher Williams:</strong> <tt>I'm sorry for this.</tt></p>
<p><em>An electric shock passes through each of the members of Lambda-11, incapacitating them. Head Researcher Williams walks away from the radio as a series of squelching noises occur.</em></p>

<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers and Senior Researcher Davis enter the room carefully and sit down.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Where's Collins? I want to apologize to him. I was an asshole. It's been a rough few days is all.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers doesn't answer immediately, just slumps over onto the table for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Collins is… is dead. Killed by POI-8250</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis clenches his fists and starts crying.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> We need to go after him. Before he kills someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> I'm not so sure that's a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Listen, I asked for a detachment of Lambda-11 again. Want to know what they said?</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers looks at Senior Researcher Davis expectantly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> They said they can't afford to help us like that anymore and that we better cut our losses.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> You must understand where they're coming from.</p>

<p><em>The two men stare at each other for a minute before Senior Researcher Meyers relents.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers and Senior Researcher Davis walk through SCP-8250. The drop in light is barely perceptible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Or rather, not see that?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> I'd hazard a guess that SCP-8250 has gradually been spreading and we just didn't notice.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> This may be stretching a bit, but doesn't it seem awfully convenient that Williams enters SCP-8250 and <em>then</em> it starts expanding?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Yes. But the more important question is where are all the SCP-8250-2 instances?</p>
<p><em>The two senior researchers look around, and see nothing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Somehow I wish we could see them. I don't like this.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Neither do I. But you made me come here.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis glares at Senior Researcher Meyers for a moment before relenting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to be responsible for someones death.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers shakes his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> You'd go without me anyway. I can't let you go alone. Besides, I understand why you're going.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> I… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Shall we get a move on?</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis sniffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Then lets head north, shall we?</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis nods. No SCP-8250-2 instances are spotted on the way there. As they approach the center of SCP-8250-1, they start to slow down. Sensors detect a spike in A-Radiation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Yep, I feel that.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Get down!</p>
<p><em>The two crouch down. Roughly 50 meters away, a group of SCP-8250-2 instances can be seen. Oddly they appear to be doing nothing except standing in a circle around something. SCP-8250-3 presumed to be nearby.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Can you see what they're doing?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> I'm not sure I want to.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> I'm getting a better look.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> No!</p>
<p><em>Despite Senior Researcher Meyers' warnings, Senior Researcher Davis starts to creep closer. Senior Researcher Meyers sighs and follows. They both stop 50 meters from the circle of SCP-8250-2 instances to reveal SCP-8250-3 and POI-8250 both in the center of the circle.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Williams.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers looks at Senior Researcher Davis, who's gone pale. He then pulls out a pistol.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> No. Davis, no. Davis!</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis rushes out of hiding towards the circle, screaming. The SCP-8250-2 instances fail to react.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Williams!</p>
<p><em>POI-8250 looks towards Senior Researcher Davis with a sorrowful look.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> Hello Davis. Are you here to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> After what you did, yes!</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis' hands start shaking. Back behind cover, Senior Researcher Meyers curses.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> Yes, Collins. You must understand -</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> That you killed him in cold blood? Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> No. That he <em>had to die</em>. God demands sacrifice. Evolution demands sacrifice.</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Davis scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> God? What god?</p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> The Great Orb. The one true God.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> The one true…</p>
<p><em>From out of the trees, SCP-8250-4 emerges. Akiva and A-Radiation levels spike. Everyone in the area except Senior Researcher Davis kneel as best they can. Suddenly, Senior Researcher Meyers is yanked out of his hiding spot into the air, presumed to be by SCP-8250-4. Senior Researcher Davis quickly follows suit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> Sonuva -</p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> Meyers. I was wondering where you were. Hiding, were we?</p>
<p><em>Senior Researcher Meyers spits at POI-8250. POI-8250 doesn't react.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> No matter. God loves you anyway. He shall help you evolve, just as he helped all these beings.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Davis:</strong> Evolve? Help us? You're a crazy bastard, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> No no no. I only want what's best for humanity. I want us to be better, to evolve. Is that so bad?</p>
<p><strong>Senior Researcher Meyers:</strong> The way you want it? Yes.</p>
<p><em>POI-8250 looks at the two sadly.</em></p>
<p><strong>POI-8250:</strong> So be it.</p>
<p><em>Tendrils extend from SCP-8250 and pierce straight through Senior Researcher Meyers and Davis and their bodycams shut off. They are presumed compromised. There has been no further contact with Observation Post-12.</em></p>
<p>[END LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Shortly after the events described here, several more SCP-8250 instances began to show over the country. A new religion calling themselves the Church of Evolutionism, designated GOI-8250 also showed up roughly at the same time.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum 8250.13: Excerpt from POI-8250 Opening Speech</strong></p>
<p>The following details POI-8250 opening speech as the Church of Evolutionism was established. It is unknown how he remains as he is, unmutated.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc0"><span><strong>Our Goal at the Church of Evolutionism</strong></span></h3>
</div>
<p>Evolution. It brought us to where we are today. It brought us money, electricity. It brought us cities and towns, running water, and clean clothes. It brought us everything we have today. But humanity did not evolve in the light. It evolved in the dark, before lights, before fire.</p>
<p>Now, we at the Church of Evolutionism do not believe we need to stop evolving simply because we have everything we have. No, we believe the most noble goal to strive for is to evolve. And to do that, we need to accept the dark. We need to accept the Great Orb, the trigger of all evolution, and the final destination of it.</p>
<p>Accept the Great Orb my friend. Accept it, and you can have everything.</p>
