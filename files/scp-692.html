            <h1>SCP-692</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-692</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Each package of SCP-692 is to be stored in a sealed plastic container. Any cloth, synthetic textile or other coming into contact with SCP-692 is to be incinerated within one (1) hour of incident, unless it is being used for testing, in which case it is to be incinerated after testing.</p>
<p>Security personnel present at testing are to be equipped with standard-issue gas-based flamethrowers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-692 comprises 57 packages of "Weisser Riese" washing powder secured by the Foundation from a general store in ██████, Czech Republic, and several households nearby. All of the packages belong to the ████/███ production series.</p>
<p>Chemical testing reveals no statistically significant deviations from composition with respect to "Weisser Riese" washing powder of unaffected production series.</p>
<p>When an article of clothing exposed to SCP-692 comes into uninterrupted contact at least fifteen (15) minutes long with a living, multicellular organism, within following four (4) to fifteen (15) hours, the article, (referred to as SCP-692-1) will spontaneously animate.</p>
<p>SCP-692-1 at this stage show the contours of the imprinting organism, although bisection of several instances of SCP-692-1 has revealed that the inside of such contour contains air at ambient pressure.</p>
<p>Through an as-of-now unknown mechanism, SCP-692-1 is capable of locomotion, manipulation of objects, and at times, accretion of more articles of clothing into its mass. Furthermore, SCP-692-1 with a single "nucleating" item will behave as a single entity, even if there is no physical connection between the items.</p>
<p>The mode of behaviour of SCP-692-1 depends on the length of exposure to the imprinting organism, longer times resulting in a higher quality of simulation - approximately three hours of uninterrupted contact are sufficient for the imprinting of most mammals.</p>
<p>SCP-692-1 are unaffected by most mechanical damage, and as such, incineration is the recommended method of disposal.</p>

<p><strong>ITEM:</strong> 0.5m x 0.3m sheet of cloth<br/>
<strong>IMPREGNATING AGENT:</strong> A housecat<br/>
<strong>EXPOSURE TIME:</strong> 5 minutes.<br/>
<strong>RESULT:</strong> No effect observed even after 10 hours. Cloth incinerated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ITEM:</strong> 0.5m x 0.3m sheet of cloth<br/>
<strong>IMPREGNATING AGENT:</strong> A housecat<br/>
<strong>EXPOSURE TIME:</strong> 15 minutes.<br/>
<strong>RESULT:</strong> Two hours after impregnation the sheet has wrapped itself as if enveloping the body of a housecat of equal size to the impregnating agent. Resulting SCP-692-1 showed no traces of animation. Cutting resulting SCP-692-1 into several segments produced no adverse effects. Resulting SCP-692-1 was subsequently incinerated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ITEM:</strong> 0.5m x 0.3m sheet of cloth.<br/>
<strong>IMPREGNATING AGENT:</strong> A housecat.<br/>
<strong>EXPOSURE TIME:</strong> three (3) hours.<br/>
<strong>RESULT:</strong> One and half hours after impregnation, the sheet has wrapped itself as if enveloping the body of a housecat of equal size to the impregnating agent. Resulting SCP-692-1 has exhibited behaviour consistent with that of the impregnating agent. When presented with a live mouse, resulting SCP-692-1 appeared excited, and proceeded to capture and kill it. Resulting SCP-692-1 isn't adversely affected by machine-washing, though doing so appears to anger it. This instance of SCP-692-1 currently resides within the office of Researcher E████████.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ITEM:</strong> A standard D-class jumpsuit.<br/>
<strong>IMPREGNATING AGENT:</strong> D-835 , a 25 year old white male.<br/>
<strong>EXPOSURE TIME:</strong> three (3) hours.<br/>
<strong>RESULT:</strong> Two and half hours after impregnation, the jumpsuit appeared as if filled with a human body. The resulting SCP-692-1 became active when approached, slamming present technician into a wall, and attempting to escape the test room. Resulting SCP-692-1 failed to escape as its lack of digits didn't allow for manipulation of door mechanisms and was subsequently incinerated by security personnel.</p>
