            <h1>SCP-1239</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1239</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-███ has been established around SCP-1239-2. When not in use for testing, SCP-1239-1 and removable instances of SCP-1239-3 are to be kept outside of SCP-1239-2 in dedicated storage lockers to prevent accidental activation. SCP-1239-2 should be soundproofed, with all windows obscured from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1239 consists of 3 (three) components:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-1239-1, a lamp with a standard low voltage power cable, containing artificial flora with 4 (four) flower-like lightbulbs. The words “Hey Kids!” are engraved on the lid.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-1239-2, a residence in ██████████, ███████.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SCP-1239-3, a specific set of objects present within SCP-1239-2 at time of recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The anomalous effects of SCP-1239 manifest if SCP-1239-1 is powered and viewed by a post-pubescent human subject while both are within SCP-1239-2. Following this, the subject will experience a series of conditional hallucinations until exiting SCP-1239-2, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjects will perceive samples of SCP-1239-3 to be different objects. This is apparently consistent between subjects, as all subjects tested have perceived respective SCP-1239 samples in the same way.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Objects present within SCP-1239-2 other than SCP-1239-3 will be perceived normally by affected subjects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects will perceive any prepubescent or pubescent individuals present within SCP-1239-2 as highly amiable, despite the subjects' prior dispositions or relationship with children, and will express a desire to engage in play activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subjects will perceive all expressions of discomfort, pain or displeasure produced by pre-pubescent and pubescent individuals within SCP-1239-2 as expressions of pleasure or enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon exiting SCP-1239, the hallucinatory symptoms caused by exposure to SCP-1239-1 will cease, and are removed retroactively (i. e., the subject will remember observing SCP-1239-3 samples as they would normally appear, and will be unable to recall experiencing the hallucinations previously caused by SCP-1239). Behaviour caused by SCP-1239, however, will be recalled with an expected degree of detail. As a result of this, subjects are able to recall actions made under the influence of SCP-1239, but are unable to recall the motivation for said actions.</p>
<p><strong>Summarised Recovery Log:</strong> SCP-1239 was first identified shortly after an incident occurring in SCP-1239-2 on ████-07-██, in which the respective parents of 10 (ten) children, who had agreed to meet as part of a social event, were exposed to SCP-1239-1. The affected individuals (of which there were 6 (six)) were interviewed and dealt with as per Recovery Protocol 8. A cover story regarding a toxic gas leak was later circulated, and the remains of the children incinerated after analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Testing regarding SCP-1239 has determined that no direct or compulsive behavioural alterations result from exposure to SCP-1239-1.</p>
