<p>SCP-9777-A Instance of "大爆発恋心宮＝アンド・ロイ子 (Daibakuhatsukoigokoromiya Ando Roiko)", also known as "恋心 (Koko)" from "恋する爆弾ガール (Bomb Girl in Love)". Image captured by Hamazuka (the subject) as first encountered. Lately designated as SCP-9777-A-5.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment efforts intensively focus on the handling of affected subjects. Subjects that have only been affected by SCP-9777 once or twice are to be amnesticized with Class C amnestics and inoculated with the counter-meme "ENGI". Afterwards, subjects are to be released and monitored for three months. Subjects with multiple SCP-9777 encounters will be housed in Site-06-3, -59, -174, -330, -8124, -8171, -81HM, -81VC.</p>
<p>Agent Miou Fujina (海桜 藤奈) has been assigned as the most important person with this object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9777 refers to a phenomenon wherein fictional characters, depicted in the style of Japanese anime, act with autonomy. Analysis of recorded incidents indicate that during the occurrence of this phenomenon, the character with whom the subject individual (hereafter referred to as "subject") holds the strongest positive feelings at the time of the event (defined as SCP-9777-A) is active in the subject's vicinity. Each SCP-9777-A instances shows a particular fondness towards the subject during manifestion. Furthermore, only one instance of SCP-9777-A exists per subject.</p>
<p>SCP-9777-A instances are able to perceive the real-world through display screens, paper, and other recorded media. The anomaly is able to interact and communicate with the subject through dreams and hallucinations. As such, the subject becomes more acquainted and favorable towards SCP-9777-A. These actions have no effect on the story or work in which SCP-9777-A originated. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Attempts at observations of actual activity of SCP-9777-A have been unsuccessful.</span> <strong>See Addendum 9777.2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Since 2024, individuals who have witnessed the phenomenon reported their experiences on social media sites and forums. Japanese witnesses online describe a phenomenon in which subjects perceive anime characters communicating with them. Initially, due to the small number of reports, it was thought to be caused by non-anomalous factors such as hallucinations, false beliefs, and illusions. However, due to the emergence of more similar reports, visual recordings, and other evidence, it was comprehensively designated as SCP-9777.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from two initial SCP-9777 interviews with affected members of the public and one with a Foundation staff member (Agent Miou).</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Seimei Saneaki (晴明 心灯)</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Hamatsuka Soya (浜塚 颯也)</p>
<p><strong>Interview Location:</strong> Site-8171</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following interview was conducted in Japanese.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Now I've started recording, so, first tell me about the character you saw in action—</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> <em>(Speaking quickly)</em> Yeah! The one I met was the main heroine of "恋する爆弾ガール (Bomb Girl in Love)", "大爆発恋心宮＝アンド·ロイ子 (Daibakuhatsukoigokoromiya Ando Roiko)", commonly known as "恋心 (Koko)"! Koko-cha is a robot developed by a certain doctor. The goal was to equip robots with human emotions, and true to her name, she's specialized in love!</p>
<p><em>(Hamatsuka waves his right hand vigorously.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> And get this! It's not just about learning love— she's designed to explode if she doesn't fall in love within a year. That's just crazy, right? Well, she admits she doesn't get it either. So, Koko-cha was deployed for testing at a high school, and there—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you, thank you. I understand a bit more about this Koko-chan now. It seems you are quite fond of her.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:500px;"><img alt="Koko_8000" class="image" src="http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-54-zz6p/Koko_8000"/>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Ah, sorry. I just found out about her recently and got completely hooked. Been hooked for half a year!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see. Now, getting to the main point, how long ago did you start being able to talk or speak with this Koko-chan?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> About two weeks ago… It was late at night, if I remember correctly….</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Do you remember the specific circumstances at the time?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Hmm… Well I think I was watching anime on my computer? Then, I saw the sunrise and decided to go to sleep, so I went to turn off the computer. But then the desktop screen looked weird. Like, the whole thing was glitching out. Then it made this weird buzzing noise, and suddenly I faintly heard Koko-cha's voice. Like, "Ahh, hello," as if she was doing a mic test.</p>
<p><em>(Hamatsuka tiltes his head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Then, ah— my desktop background is an illustration of Koko-cha, and the moment the glitch fixed itself, the illustration started moving! Not only that, but after wandering around the screen for a bit, she noticed me and asked, "Are you my fan?" It was weird that she recognized me, but the way she said it was totally her! That's when I realized— my love power had somehow caused a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …Thank you. So, you've been talking to her nonstop ever since?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Yep, yep. Well, obviously I still had to attend university lectures and manage my daily routines, but I tried to be with her as much as possible. I mean, right? If your favorite idol is actually living in real life, that's what you'd do, right? Well, according to Koko-cha, it was great that we could communicate not just on the PC but also on my smartphone. Maybe because I have Koko-cha as my phone wallpaper too. So maybe we're together 90% of my waking hours? I mean, I'm just… happy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you for the detailed explanation. So Koko-chan is still on your phone now?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Ah, well, lately she's started moving on to the next stage. Instead of appearing on my phone or computer, I can sometimes see and hear her directly now. Well, I think it’s a hallucination, of course. But what she remembers and what she says is too coherent for a hallucination. Could she be evolving?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Evolving, you say….</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I can't quite put it into words, but it feels like fiction is steadily becoming more real. Maybe soon, Koko-chan will actually come into the real world!? I really hope that happens! <em>(Silence for several seconds)</em> Ah!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Any problem?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I just saw another hallucination, just now. Koko-cha said "Someday we'll be able to touch each other"!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Now that's an intriguing statement. I'd like to take this information back and process it, so we'll end the interview here for now. I'd like to check in on you and Koko-chan periodically for a while. Would that be alright?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Yeah, yeah! No problem at all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you. Then we'll conclude the interview here. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Thank you for your time too!! <em>(Loud voice)</em> I'll always love you, Koko-chaaan!</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Seimei Saneaki</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Okura Yuuki (大蔵 裕紀)</p>
<p><strong>Interview Location:</strong> Site-8124</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following interview was conducted in Japanese.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Wait, you're saying a video game character is talking to you? Could you tell me more?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Sure. The character I encountered is named "ツクヨミ サクラ (Tsukuyomi Sakura)," from the game "アルタネームリバティ (Alt-name Liberty)". She has this mysterious aura, doesn't say much, and comes off as this solitary gem mage. But actually, she's just shy, and as she bonds with the protagonist, she gradually opens up… that's the kind of character she is. I started playing this game because I'd gotten bored with the other mobile games I have been playing. But when she appeared, I was drawn to that gap between her image and her true self.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you. So, what was the situation like when you first encountered her?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Hmm, I don't remember the exact details… but I do remember it happened in the break room at work, during lunch. That was about a week ago. I was sitting there eating a rice ball while playing Alnali… Alt-Name Liberty, petting Sakura-chan through the screen. Then she started saying things she normally wouldn't. That's when I immediately realized.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Do you remember what she said then?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Not completely, but I think I remember most of it. I think it was something like, "You always work so hard." or "Yuuki-san, you're doing great in real life too." She definitely couldn’t have said those things, but it was unmistakably her voice and mannerisms!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see… And you've been interacting frequently with her ever since then?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Yes. After that, it wasn't just at the office- at home, on the train, every time I opened it, Sakura-chan would interact with me. It was truly astonishing. I looked it up online, but no one else reported similar symptoms, and there was nothing official about it either. Still, I was happy. Knowing my favorite character was definitely looking at me, just me. Sakura-chan's opal-like rainbow eyes are usually hidden, but she moves around a lot, so I can see those red eyes clearly…</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you. Now then—</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Sorry, there's more. Lately, when I'm sleeping, I get this feeling I'm not alone. I thought it might just be my imagination, but I heard Sakura-chan's voice saying "Good night." That's when I realized it wasn't a hallucination. When I asked her about it the next day, she looked embarrassed, and that's when I knew for sure she was "there.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you for the detailed explanation. If it's okay with you, would it be possible for me to observe the actual phenomenon?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Sure, I'll open the app. <em>(Takes out her smartphone, launches the game app ‘Alt-name Liberty’)</em> This is her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> <em>(Peering at smartphone)</em> Is this character Tsukuyomi Sakura?</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Yes, that's her, but… Huh? Hey. Sakura-chan? <em>(Taps screen)</em> Sorry, it seems to have reverted back to normal. This hasn't happened recently….</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> In that case, please contact me again when it happens. Or, if you could record it, that would be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Okura Yuuki:</strong> Thank you, my apologies.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Not at all. This concludes the interview.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following interview was conducted in Japanese.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Okay so, first, could you describe the character you encountered?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yes, mine was "マギアブロッサム (Magia Blossom)", the main character of an anime called Magi-Pri… excuse me, "マギア☆プリズム (Magia☆Prism)". Erm, this is a character is a girl named "春風智恵理 (Harukaze Chieri)", she transforms with an item called "Magiaprism", and she and two other Magia Wizards fight. Is this enough?</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you very much. That's enough for now. So, may I ask about your contact or interactions with this SCP-9777-A instance?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Well… it was in a dream three days ago, and I found myself in a park or a field, and Blossom was next to me. We were walking together, chatted and laid down together on the grass… thinking back on it, it was fun. She even called me by name. I don't remember all the details, but we talked about trivial things. That was our first encounter. I was very happy. I had seen Chieri in my dreams several times, but I've never been that close to her.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see. What was your second encounter like?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> The second time, yes, it was yesterday. I was writing a report, and when I sighed heavily from the exhaustion, I heard Chieri's voice saying: "Don't give up!" When I turned towards the direction of the voice, I saw the Blossom strap on my backpack waving back at me. I was confused when I saw it. But when I looked back at it, it was still moving, smiling. So I decided to go for it, and after that I wrote with a little support. So when I finished, she said: "Good job". After that, she came into my dream again, and we talked about various things, her red eyes were twinkling…. To be honest,</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> <em>(Pauses)</em> Hmm… What happened to the strap now?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> It stopped moving when I took my eyes off it for a moment. But it's kind of strange to call it just a hallucination.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> May I see the strap?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yes, here. <em>(Removes the strap from her backpack and hands it to Dr. Seimei)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Thank you. <em>(Examines the strap he received.)</em> Looks like you've been using it for a very long time?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I've been using it since elementary school. I've always loved it, and after watching Magi-Pri, I wanted to be a hero who could do world peace and stuff. Even when the series development had stopped for now, she was my inspiration. I think that's probably what I'm doing now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see. I will send it in for inspection once. If we find nothing anomalous with this, I will probably be able to return it to you.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> <em>(Pauses)</em> I understand.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Sorry, this is the job….</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> You don't seem too pleased from earlier, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Well, yes… but as a Foundation staff member, I think I should remain calm and professional here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> It is important to be calm, but you are the only one who is <em>this</em> calm.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I've already looked interviewed several Foundation personnel who are also experiencing similar phenomenon to this case, and they are all like excited, happy, or panicked. It appears they were making sense of the situation in their own way on the surface though.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I see.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> But you seem to be calm and still have something itching in your mind. Care to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yes…. There was some kind of, discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Discomfort?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I always felt some discomfort when I was talking with her. She is in front of me and talking to me, and her figure and personality are that of Magia Blossom, but there is something different about her, or perhaps my mind is questioning it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> That's new to me. I've already interviewed dozens of people, but this is the first time I have heard such an opinion, including other Foundation staff.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Is it just me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Maybe you just happen to feel that way, but I think we need to look into this further.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following interview was conducted in Japanese.</p>

<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>(Dr. Seimei enters the room assigned to Hamatsuka. The room is littered with numerous sheets of paper covered in character drawings. Dr. Seimei's eyes widen momentarily, but he quickly regains his composure.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Good morning, Mr. Hamatsuka.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> <em>(He does not notice Dr. Seimei's greeting, and instead continues drawing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Mr. Hamatsuka?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> <em>(Notices)</em> Ah, Doc, morning.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Um, what exactly is this? I don't recall you doing this yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I couldn't hold back anymore. Right after the first time, my love just kept growing until I couldn't control it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Even so, this amount is quite substantial, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I just can't stop drawing. I can't skip the toilet or meals, of course. But when I draw, I get cheered on.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> By your feelings?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Exactly. When I keep drawing like this, sometimes I hear a voice or they show themselves, praising me. They whisper to me, gaze at me with those red eyes, and make their wings glow.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …I see. The Koko I know seems different in character, though.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Oh, hey! Doc, if you'd like, would you take a few sheets while you're looking? You could use them for promoting her or something.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> <em>(Thinking)</em> I suppose I could take a few. Should I just pick up the ones lying around?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Yes, yes, that's fine.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> <em>(Picks up 3 sheets of paper. Each paper depicts a character with angelic red eyes,)</em> …This is.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I drew well, didn't I?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Yes, I think they're drawn well. But this is… <em>(Pauses)</em>Excuse me, just to confirm— you drew Koko-chan, right?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Yep, I did.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> The head accessory is different, and the clothing looks different too. There are no wings or halos, for instance. And the eyes….</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Hmm, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Here, this is the official image. <em>(Takes out his smartphone and shows the image of Koko-chan.)</em> Don't they look different?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> <em>(Looks at the images for several seconds.)</em> Huh? I thought I drew Koko… Huh? Hmm?</p>
<p><em>(Hamatsuka repeatedly compares his own illustration with the image of Koko.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Something's off. <em>(Looking at the original Koko)</em> This is the original Koko-cha? Then what about this one?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I don't know either.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> …Is this really what Koko-cha is like?… Ah, ah, I guess it is? But….</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> It does seem like my type, but… nothing’s stirring inside me. It feels cold. Who is this? Is this Koko-cha?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> The Koko-chan you described earlier were for this one. <em>(Shows image of Koko-chan on his smartphone)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> <em>(Comparing them)</em> Is, is that so…?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Sorry, I just can't get interested in this. I guess I just realized again that the Miino-cha I love is this one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …Wait, who is "Miino"?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Huh? Miino, right? The singer with cute yellow hair and red eyes, mostly black and red.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> As for Koko-chan, I'd say light blue leans more pink….</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Hold on, quiet for a sec.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> I can hear it. I can hear her voice.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Her?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> Glowing red wings, her red light guides me. Doctor, can you see it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …See what?</p>
<p><strong>Hamatsuka Soya:</strong> The Wrathful Tengu God is coming.</p>

<p>As a special note, the appearance of the SCP-9777-A instances that appear to the subject in such a state has changed to have certain characteristics. Details include the appearance of red-and-yellow eyes, a halo, and wings.</p>
<p>As a notable point, some of the subjects have not been observed to have deteriorated in their mental state, and the appearance of the favored SCP-9777-A instance has not changed or altered when depicted.</p>
<p>The following is a registered letter from Agent Miou, one of the long-term effected subjects whose mental state did not change.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I've encountered SCP-9777-A several times since then, but my suspicions have only grown stronger. I'd like to ask the other subjects for more information, but I shouldn't be communicating with them right now. I shouldn't even consider the possibility that I am sane as long as I am under the influence of an anomaly. Even this skepticism may have been created by some manipulation. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">They may be the sane ones.</span> I should consider the worst case scenario. I'll assume we're all insane. I need to make decisions based on the information at hand.</p>
<p>I compared the reports and the transcripts of each interview. There was something strange in each interview transcript, but when I looked back at my own interview transcript, a statement stuck with me. It says I called her eyes red. Would I call them red? Blossom's eyes are light blue and pink. I also looked at the images in other records. All of them were red. Sometimes yellow is mixed in, but they are clearly red. The eyes were clearly different. It was as if someone had put on another one's skin and had become someone else.</p>

<p>Comparison of SCP-9777-A Instance and actual character. Note the difference in the eyes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I read the transcripts of people's interviews one more time. It is trying to deceive them. It is trying to get into their minds. And it is trying to get to me. It seems irritated at not being able to win hearts and minds, but is this an act? And why on earth?</p>
<p>When I get permission, I want to question SCP-9777-A. Only I can do this.</p>
<p>Who am I meeting with?</p>
</div>
<p>Based on the testimony of Agent Miou, a reexamination was conducted and found a weak memetic hazard in the parts where there was a discrepancy from the original character. Based on this result, a counter-meme "ENGI" was developed. However, at this time it is only functioning to prevent meme contamination, and has not yet succeeded in removing the meme from already affected subjects. It has also been confirmed that subjects with no confirmed change in mental state, including Agent Miou, are more resistant to the cognitohazard, but a causal relationship is yet to be ascertained.</p>
<p>Of the 15 Foundation employees currently under the long-term influence of SCP-9777, only Agent Miou has been seen to not experience serious mental deterioration. Based on this situation, Agent Miou has been marked as the most important person in relation to SCP-9777. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Researchers plan to contact and secure SCP-9777-A using the Agent.</span> <strong>See Addendum 9777.2.</strong></p>

<p><em>(The two Foundation personnel follow her out of the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>End Report</strong> Psychoanalysis reveals that the two personnel who attacked Agent Miou became subjects of SCP-9777. No other SCP-9777 subjects were provided with any information regarding Agent Miou's whereabouts at the time of the incident, and the foundation is currently investigating the parties involved on the basis that they concealed contact through SCP-9777-A, and some information was provided or actions were instigated through SCP-9777-A.</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-9777-A, or the entity believed to be the source of SCP-9777, has infiltrated Foundation assets and is expected to engage in hostile actions on a large scale in the future. An analysis of this entity, and an updated document is planned.<br/>

<p>SCP-9777-B will be secured by Mobile Task Force Eta-79 ("Bound Hands"), Eta-80 ("Rustmaker"), and Yo-5 ("Discouraged Declarant"). Immediately upon capture, SCP-9777-B instances are to be housed at the nearest dedicated facility. All items and data related to the anomaly, including those describing SCP-9777's appearance, will also be recovered and, with exception for research purposes, incinerated. Other alterations of SCP-9777 in online spaces, will be reverted by corresponding methods as soon as they are identified.</p>
<p>Under Area-85 is conducting research on how to contain SCP-9777 and is gathering resources that will be needed in an SCP-9777's Manifestation Event. The Area is a highly classified security facility located in the basement of Tokyo Big Sight (Tokyo International Exhibition Center). Tokyo Big Sight is a facility that hosts numerous large-scale events in the subculture genre, including Comic Market and Comitia. Consequently, the facility exhibits a significantly higher incidence of abnormal events by groups of interest and encounters with anomalies deeply connected to subculture. For this reason, Under Area-85 was constructed directly beneath the facility.</p>
<p>Under Area-85 is responsible for handling anomalous entities derived from events at Tokyo Big Sight and other subcultures. Due to the high volume of anomalies related to faith and religion that are handled as a result of these activities (See Addendum 9777.2), and the particularly sensitive nature of these anomalies, it was decided that activities related to SCP-9777 would be conducted primarily at Under Area-85.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-center" style="width:500px;"><img alt="Above85" class="image" src="http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-53-9o4t/Above85"/>

<p>In the event that SCP-9777 is confirmed to manifest in the real world, Mobile Task Force Eta-77 ("Spheres Within Spheres") and Yo-4 ("Dr. Nietzsche") will take charge in suppressing and containing the anomaly. Other Mobile Task Forces will join in if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9777 is a fictional character named "Nitaka Miino (二鷹みいの)", depicted in the style of Japanese anime. The entity possesses a weak memetic agent in its appearance. SCP-9777 is a Level-7-or-higher Pistiphage Entity<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and its interference with reality expands in proportion to the number of followers who show a strong liking or belief for it.</p>
<p>SCP-9777 in a state of mimicry of another character is designated as SCP-9777-A. In this state, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it is believed that the mimicked character must be depicted in a Japanese anime style similar to the anomaly itself.</span>SCP-9777 does not achieve perfect mimicry. Instead, it incorporates some of its own features, such as with its eyes, enabling it to exert its own memetic hazard.</p>
<p>This entity alters its appearance as SCP-9777-A to mimic the character the target individual (designated as SCP-9777-B) most admires at that moment. It then contacts SCP-9777-B through display screens, printed media, dreams, and/or hallucinations. At this time, SCP-9777-B does not recognize the discrepancy between SCP-9777-A and the original character, perceiving the subject character as moving autonomously. Upon contact, it behaves as if harboring affection toward SCP-9777-B while simultaneously exposing it to its memetic hazard, thereby inducing affection toward itself. For specific details of this behavior, see the previous file.</p>
<p>By repeatedly exposing the subject to this contact and gradually replacing SCP-9777-A's physical characteristics with those of SCP-9777, the subject becomes fixated upon and dependent on SCP-9777.</p>
<p>As the deterioration of the subject's mental state progresses, SCP-9777-B exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostility to the Foundation</li>
<li>Manipulation of consciousness from SCP-9777</li>
<li>Aggressive desire towards the dissemination of the SCP-9777</li>
<li>Strong aversion to new works, mainly in Japanese subculture</li>
<li>Weak activation of favoritism toward previous characters of interest, mainly in the Japanese subculture</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently impossible to permanently eliminate these effects through the use of amnestics. However, some subjects do not experience deterioration of their mental state or transformation to SCP-9777-B. The cause of this is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>SCP-9777 is hostile to humanity and operates under the name of "The Wrathful Tengu God (怒れる天狗の神)" with the goal of dominating humanity, resulting in an HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario. In particular, it views the Foundation as a hindrance that impedes on its activities; hence the Foundation is perceived as a priority threat. Additionally, SCP-9777 exhibits a mental state resembling schizophrenia, characterized by sudden panic attacks, frequent shifts in speech patterns, and incoherent behavior.</p>
<p>SCP-9777 was initially thought to be a phenomenon of autonomous behavior of a fictional character mainly in Japan, but after reexamination of some of the deviations and similarities in the characters and the contact in Incident 9777-1, the entity that is the source of the phenomenon was discovered and redesignated. The origin of SCP-9777 is unknown.</p>

As a result of the increased desire to share the image, which was inherent in some SCP-2223 instances, intensified by the memetic properties of SCP-9777, the viewer's potential fondness for SCP-9777 is amplified. Due to differences in some physical characteristics, Protocol 56-Ackerman used to contain SCP-2223 was initially ineffective, resulting in a worldwide outbreak of images. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Currently, the use of Protocol 269-Ackermann, a modified version of Protocol 56-Ackermann with the counter meme "ENGI", is being used to prevent its expression.</span> Protocol 269-Ackermann is unusable due to SCP-9777 interference. Further improvements are currently underway.</p>
<p>Currently, reports of unusual effects and hostile actions against the Foundation by SCP-9777 and affected persons have been confirmed worldwide, especially in Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9777.1: Incident 9777-2</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<br/>
On 09/13/2025, multiple personnel at Site-15 became SCP-9777-B, resulting in a large-scale information leak directed at SCP-9777. It is believed SCP-9777 recognized Site-15's coordinates from the metadata of SCP-2223-6. Consequently, SCP-9777 is believed to have transmitted SCP-9777-A media, specifically that of SCP-9777-2223, to Site-15.
<p>Following the incident, elements of SCP-9777 were found in the altered properties of numerous anomalies. The followings are examples.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>(The six participants are seated in chairs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> That raging-mad Japanese anime being a god, with the world and Foundation scheming with malice to disrupt it— I still find that hard to accept. This meeting is about reporting on countermeasures, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> Correct, but first we're also sorting out that anomaly’s data. I intended to hear the specific report from Dr. Seimei, but, (looks at Dr. Tallis) why you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Dr. Seimei was attacked by several instances of SCP-9777-B just a few hours ago and is unable to attend the meeting. I am his substitute.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> What.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Since my attendance was rather sudden, there are many parts I haven't fully grasped yet, but this area itself is a facility specializing in Japanese subculture, right? It seemed like anti-divine weapons were deployed here on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Yes. In fact, it's precisely because it's deeply connected to the subculture that it has ties to deities. Characters and creators from "nijigen" content often receive such intense devotion bordering on worship that they become prone to deification… both metaphorically and literally.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Is that how it works?</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> That's how it is. In fact, some staff in this facility have been using parasites designed for anti-Pistiphage purposes—</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Let's save that tangent for another time. Anyway, subculture and faith are highly compatible, making this facility necessary to counter entities like the one we're facing now. I don't see any issues with confidentiality either. Assuming there are no moles here, that is.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> You haven't neglected employing countermeasures, have you?</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> We've confirmed all personnel here have been preemptively inoculated with counter-memes. Miou, the Administrator, and I have already consumed about a month's worth of that honey. Dr. Tallis is likely constantly benefiting from it as well. The Administrator has several other measures too. I believe you two should be fine as well….</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> <em>(Nods)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Then, shall we get down to business? <em>(glancing at Dr. Tallis)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Yes. SCP-9777, the subject of our discussion today, is considered to be a conceptual deific entity, or a visual-based metafiction structure, that infiltrates people's mind from online and fictional creative works. This anomaly mimics the fictional characters preferred by its targets, gradually implanting its own image to contaminate and brainwash them. Furthermore, this entity exhibits significant personality breakdowns, observable in the acting and incoherent speech of the characters it has mimicked.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Like <a href="scp-4028.html">Don Quixote</a> with his madness and rage in overdrive.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> And it's trying to come over here.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> Regarding this agenda, was it really necessary to exclude departments other than Tactical Theology? Like Pataphysics, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> The presumed contamination methods and manifestation processes are primarily based on theological methodologies, so metafiction isn't particularly relevant. In fact, no textual alterations have been confirmed, so that aspect isn't crucial this time.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> I see. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Yes, ma'am. SCP-9777 harbors resentment toward humanity for consuming creative works, with its ultimate goal being the complete cessation of creation— and in the worst case, humanity's extinction to achieve this. To accomplish this, it seeks to physically manifest into this base world through the faith of its followers, SCP-9777-B, and execute an HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario. Based on SCP-9777's statements, it is believed to likely utilize "live" performances involving music as a theological ritual. This manifestation is likely the timing at which the K-class scenario occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> Viewing it as aiming for human extinction seems somewhat excessive.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> True, it does occasionally yell things like "Go to hell." But the probability it genuinely intends to exterminate humanity is extremely low. In fact, while SCP-9777's activities have injured several hundred people, no fatalities have been confirmed either within or outside the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> That said, the followers are a valuable source of nourishment for 9777. It's possible it keeps them alive for that purpose, only to kill them once they're no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> We've considered that possibility, but it's hard to say. It's not certain that SCP-9777 can maintain a physical body in the real world without faith. Also, something our research group noticed: there's been a noticeable global decrease in tobacco consumption and alcohol intake, particularly centered around Japan.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Is that… relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Based on observations of SCP-9777-B, we determined there is a connection. In fact, dozens of B instances have reported comments like "Miino stopped me."</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> I just can't wrap my head around this.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> The video footage from the subject seems to suggest something, but the statements are too inconclusive.</p>
<p><em>(The five excluding Agent Miou groan.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Let's put this off too for now. Next, please.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Yes. This will likely be the final point: SCP-9777 is focusing its attention on Foundation Agent Miou Fujina. This individual is notable not only for being employed here but also for having neutralized SCP-9777's memetic contamination. While several thousand individuals worldwide have been confirmed to possess this complete and natural meme resistance, her status as the first identified case not only for the foundation, but also for SCP-9777 is likely one reason for the heightened attention. Furthermore, the possibility of Agent Miou secretly colluding with SCP-9777 has been ruled out based on routine monitoring and her lack of reaction during consumption of SCP-5993 honey.</p>
<p>(All five look at Agent Miou simultaneously.)</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Sorry, I'm not really following….</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> How much did you explain to her?</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> She's read extensively about 9777, but not much about 5993. Also, Agent Miou isn't very knowledgeable about theology. Her primary duty has always been protecting civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I didn't expect to be placed in this situation or given this role, and I'm still feeling a bit nervous. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> No need to force yourself to talk. We'll cover what's necessary later.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> So, have we identified any common traits among individuals resistant to the SCP-9777’s meme yet?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> Not at all at this point. We've shared it not only with our department but also with the Memetics Department, but there's been no breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Could you send that data to this area later? We'd like to analyze it here too.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> I'll forward everything shortly. Now, regarding Agent Miou's resistance to SCP-9777- it seems fixated on her. I find this somewhat peculiar. There's a contradiction in what it's attempting to do.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> A contradiction?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> If there are people who won't obey SCP-9777, it could simply incite its followers to abduct them and interrogate their reasons. Yet no such disappearance reports have been confirmed. Given the numerical disparity, suppression should be straightforward. Moreover, despite the risk of breaking its own mind control, it specifically tells Agent Miou to come, to a manifestation event, no less. Is it just me, or does it seem like it's asking to be stopped?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> It's possible, but we shouldn't expect reconciliation from that. It could just be consumed by rage, unable to make rational judgments.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> I wonder if there's any real intent behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Why don't we make Miou ask it directly?</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> Isn't that a bit reckless?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> It seems difficult. However, I agree to include Ms. Miou as a key member in the containment plan I'm about to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I'm not very skilled at negotiations, so I think myself unsuitable.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> You're a perfectly capable candidate. You possess physical skills trained for civilian protection. Among Foundation personnel who are Japanese speakers and possess meme-countering aptitude, there aren't many as battle-hardened as you. Furthermore, you have the highest potential to have a "decent" conversation with SCP-9777. We don't intend to rely on dialogue for reconciliation, but it's worth prodding further to understand its true intentions.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> …So that's why I was called in today.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> What if that encounter reveals the cause of her meme resistance to them? What if that then neutralizes that resistance?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Since we don't know the cause either, it's unlikely they'll figure it out first. They might be better at memetic contamination, but that thing seems weak at tasks requiring actual thought. What 9777 is actually doing here is just brute-forcing its way through. Sure, it attacks Foundation facilities using other anomalies, but its main activities are brainwashing Foundation staff to steal data and repeatedly spreading its own doctrine. How should I put it? It seems too consumed by madness to engage in complex rational thought.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> That seems like a hasty conclusion. Besides, haven't you forgotten that the opponent is a deity capable of mimicking any character? It wouldn't be surprising if it fully became Godzilla, would it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> We'll address that in the upcoming operation plan. For now, I want to discuss speculations regarding SCP-9777's future movements— or rather, its manifestation. Currently, the Tactical Theology Department is exploring methods for engaging SCP-9777 during its manifestation. The crucial point at this stage is that its manifestation represents the sole opportunity for containment or elimination. Even disregarding a K-class scenario, numerous factors are foreseeable immediately after manifestation, such as the entity's incomplete abilities and lack of self-awareness regarding its own capabilities. Therefore, the general approach currently under consideration is as follows: We will ambush SCP-9777 at its predicted manifestation site, pre-positioning all conceivable containment measures, including Scranton Reality Anchors, Non-Physical Displacement Neutralizers, and SCP-5993-1. This plan aims to secure SCP-9777 immediately after manifestation while it is hopefully incapacitated. Deployment of SCP-5993 itself is also planned, but due to concerns about attacks on SCP-9777-B, this likelihood is low.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> Is there a contingency plan in case of failure?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> We plan to draw SCP-9777 and its followers into combat, then exploit that distraction to redeploy containment. The second unit, currently on standby until failure occurs, will be the primary force. We should be wary that SCP-9777 is not only aware of our presence but has also been monitoring our database, meaning it knows some of our tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> The main framework is solid. However, the response if too much time has passed remains a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> I believe it's essentially too late, though it depends on whether we can pinpoint SCP-9777's location.</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> We'll need to refine that further. So, have you confirmed any signs of SCP-9777 manifesting?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> It appears to be relatively imminent. Numerous abnormal gatherings of SCP-9777-B have been confirmed in the vicinity of Aomi, Koto-ku Ward, Tokyo— commonly known as "Odaiba."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> We've confirmed that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Actually, they were just handing out concert flyers normally. Just moments ago, around this Area.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Just a moments ago, right above us?</p>
<p><strong>Yotsuboshi:</strong> I wonder if they haven't noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tallis:</strong> What about the possibility of a trap?</p>
<p><strong>Nue:</strong> I can't rule it out, but if they've noticed this place, I suspect we're already under attack.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> How far apart is that location and this Area, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Dir. Yanagisawa:</strong> Odaiba is only 2 kilometers from here.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> I have mixed feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9777.3: Outbreak of SCP-9777's Manifestation Event</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<br/>
At midnight of 10/05/2025, a crowd of what appeared to be unidentified SCP-9777-B gathered in Aomi, Koto-ku Ward, Tokyo. The SCP-9777 containment team saw this as an omen of an SCP-9777 manifestation event and dispatched several mobile task forces. However, due to the failure to specify the more detailed manifestation point and the interference from SCP-9777-B's overwhelming presence, it was impossible to carry out preparatory work at the manifestation site. As a result, the SCP-9777 manifested in the real world and engaged the mobile task forces. The following is a reconstructed record of the combat based on the recording media that accompanied the task force members and foundation staff in the area, as well as surveillance camera footage.

<p><strong>Η80-VIRGO:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><em>[OMITTED]</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-AMETHYST:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-RUBY:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Check, Check.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Yo-4 all makes five, seven. D' You hear all nineteen?</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> All clear, check.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Good. We've now reached the flow of SCP-9777-B instances originating from Under Area-85. Our first priority is to track the flow and observe them from a distance without being detected. We will report as soon as we identify the point.</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> Got it. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> How's the drone search going?</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> It hasn’t. Too many people— can't make out the original terrain.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> We're heading out first.</p>
<p><em>(Suppression team moves while visually confirming SCP-9777-B instances from a distance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-TOPAZ:</strong> CORAL, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-EPSILON:</strong> It's dark and hard to see, but a lot of them have that guy's gear.</p>
<p><em>[OMITTED DUE TO RELOCATING]</em></p>
<p><em>(The team arrives near the entrance of the venue believed to be the manifestation event site.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-ONYX:</strong> We're probably here?</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> I see something similar to a gate. Looks like they're processing admissions.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> Mind if I check something? I have a hunch.</p>
<p><em>(よ4-SAPPHIRE pulls out a smartphone and searches for something.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> Looks like there's another live event here that started this morning. Unrelated to 9777.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-DELTA:</strong> Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-AMETHYST:</strong> So they're hijacking not just the characters, but the live event too?</p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> Command, do you have any relevant data on upcoming events at our current location?</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> Give us a moment.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-BETA:</strong> Looks like something's been draped over the gate sign. Seems to say "Nitaka Miino's Descent Live". Staff identities unknown, but likely part of SCP-9777-B. They're doing something with the audience?</p>
<p><strong>よ5-EPSILON:</strong> Seems like they're checking luggage.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-VIRGO:</strong> Anywhere we can go inside?</p>
<p><strong>Η80-PISCES:</strong> <em>(Looks around.)</em> I can’t tell 'cause of all this darkness and the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> This is Area Command. Our investigation confirms SAPPHIRE's report: it appears this venue was originally set up for a different live event. But thanks to that, we were able to learn its internal structure from the website. I'll send the map data to everyone now.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> That's a big help. <em>(Checks the map data.)</em> Hmm. Looks like sneaking in from the back of the venue would be the best approach.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-ALPHA:</strong> This map shows three stages. Where should we go?</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> We’ll have to split up depending on which direction SCP-9777-B is facing at.</p>
<p><em>[OMITTED DUE TO RELOCATING]</em></p>
<p><em>(The team moves around to the back of the venue.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Η80-LEO:</strong> Not as crowded as the entrance, but still, a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-GAMMA:</strong> How about entering from that spot behind the parking lot? The cars provide cover, making it easier to avoid being noticed.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> <em>(Scans the surroundings.)</em> Let's do it. Everyone, stay on guard just in case.<br/>
<em>(The unit enters the parking lot, advancing without being detected by SCP-9777-B.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777-B Instance:</strong> Hm?</p>
<p><em>(Η80-LIBRA swiftly restrains the SCP-9777-B instance and administers a sedative.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Η80-LIBRA:</strong> I'll head there later.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> Counting on it.</p>
<p><em>(The team, excluding Η80-LIBRA, reaches the fence separating the parking lot and the venue, crouching down.)</em></p>
<p><em>(よ5-ALPHA scanns the venue.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> How's it looking?</p>
<p><strong>よ5-ALPHA:</strong> SCP-9777-B numbers in the thousands. The flow is heading towards the largest stage. If we circle around from the perimeter, we should be able to get behind the stage.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Copy. Area Command, request supplies for the main stage. Also send some to the other two stages as a precaution. Contact Eta-77 as well.</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> Roger. Sending drones. Also dispatching Cleopatra's coffin loaded with honey.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> I appreciate it. ARIES, LIBRA, PISCES, GEMINI, AMETHYST, and RUBY, handle the two stages.</p>
<p><strong>Five mobile task force members:</strong> Roger.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-LIBRA:</strong> Roger.</p>
<p><em>(The team crosses the fence and enters the venue one after another. Η80-LIBRA enters slightly behind the other 18 members.)</em></p>
<p><em>[OMITTED DUE TO RELOCATING]</em></p>
<p><strong>Η80-LEO:</strong> Quite a few cameramen here too. Is this being streamed?</p>
<p><em>(Team arrive behind their respective stages.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Main Stage Group arrived. SCP-9777-B covertly sedated. How's your end?</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> Substage 1 group arrived on site. Staff sedation complete.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-RUBY:</strong> Substage 2 group also arrived and sedated.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Good. Supply boxes should be arriving. Can you locate the ones with the Foundation logo?</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> Here.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-RUBY:</strong> It's here on this end too.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Good. Start preparations.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES, よ4-RUBY:</strong> Roger.</p>
<p><em>(よ4-DIA receives a box from the drone and opens it. Inside are supplies including a small hive box for SCP-5993, jars containing SCP-5993-1, and some small Scranton Reality Anchors.)</em></p>
<p><em>(よ4-DIA, Η80-ARIES, and よ4-RUBY deploy supplies at their respective points.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Don't touch the hive.</p>
<p><em>(At each point, the team retrieves SCP-5993-1 and other control devices.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Set up complete?</p>
<p><strong>よ4-RUBY:</strong> Complete.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Good. Now—</p>
<p><em>(Chime sound)</em></p>
<p><strong>Venue Announcement:</strong> The current time is 1:17 AM. I have a request for all attendees. Due to suspicious objects being placed on various stages, there have been delays to the schedule. I am currently seeking volunteers to assist with the removal of these objects. <em>(Chime sound)</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777-B Instances stir.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> No way.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777-B Instance:</strong> There it is!</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777-B instances attempt to remove devices placed at each stage while attacking the team.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Hold your supplies at all costs!</p>
<p><em>(The team at each stage deploy sedative gas. Numerous SCP-9777-B instances fall, but subsequent instances overcome them.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Team attempt to defend the device while being restrained by SCP-9777-B instances.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Η80-PISCES:</strong> Crap.</p>
<p><strong>Η80-ARIES:</strong> This is Substage 1. One small Scranton Reality Anchor was taken, but we should be able to find it soon.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Um, the box with the main stage supplies is gone!</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> It should have a transmitter attached. Find it!</p>
<p><em>(Η80-LIBRA, よ5-ZETA, Agent Miou exit from backstage and begin searching for the items that were taken.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Chime sound)</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777-B instances' moves stop.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ5-EPSILON:</strong> What now?</p>
<p><strong>Venue Announcement:</strong> The current time is 1:19 AM, 1:19 AM, AM 19:1. <em>(Noise sound)</em> The event will begin momentarily. will begin. <em>(Noise sound)</em></p>
<p><em>(The main stage lights up, and the screen glows white.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-ONYX:</strong> Dammit, we're screwed!</p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Command! Where's the vehicle!?</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> Roads are blocked, no vehicles can get through! Eta-77 will take an alternate route.</p>
<p><strong>よ5-ALPHA:</strong> Anyway, to the main stage—</p>
<p><em>(Music begins playing from the main stage speakers. SCP-9777-B instances begin clapping in rhythm.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ5-GAMMA:</strong> It's insane.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777-B Instances:</strong> Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! Miinon! <em>(The chant repeats over and over)</em></p>
<p><em>(Several SCP-9777-B Instances begin hurling SCP-9777-themed merchandise onto the stage. The items begin to levitate on the stage.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-DIA:</strong> Here it comes, brace yourselves!</p>
<p><em>(The floating merchandise begins spinning like a tornado. As the screen brightens, it displays the black silhouette of SCP-9777.)</em></p>
<p><strong>よ4-SAPPHIRE:</strong> Hume fluctuation minimal, Akiva radiation surging, Morris value climbing to 117!</p>
<p><em>(Flash. Team surrounding the stage open fire.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><em>(A figure stands surrounded by multiple bullet-riddled items, its black, asymmetrical twin tails standing out.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Red eyes reflect in the figure, a halo and wings unfolding. Glitches run across the figure's form.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> And this too!</p>
<p><em>(Agent Miou activates her smartphone and displays the home screen to SCP-9777. The home screen shows an illustration of Magia Blossom.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> My home screen is Blossom too. Not just that— I still have her plushies and stuff at home. When my family told me to throw them away, I just ignored them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> <em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I've loved Magia Blossom for over 20 years, ever since kindergarten. Even though the show ended over 15 years ago and there's no new merch anymore. I wanted to be like her, which is why I got this job. She's become a pillar of my life.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> …Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> You took over people's favorite works, replacing them. You thought they'd eventually tire of them. Thought they'd switch their favs. And honestly, maybe that's true for the audience here too. But, if I do say so myself, I was different. Sure, I enjoyed other works too, but I never changed my No. 1 fav.</p>

<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Eh, huh!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> There was never any chance of winning from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Even if I did something to you, it wouldn't solve the problem. In fact, blaming someone honest would make me a despicable, rotten criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> You're saying that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> And people like you… even Japan alone needs quite a few of you, right? My premise was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> And that's enough for you to admit defeat?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> It's more than enough. Besides, you guys… are strong. Even if I gained enough control over humanity to become a kaiju, you'd still have countless ways to fight back. Without you… things would be different.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Miino-san….</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> In the end, it was all for nothing. I tried my best, but if the fundamentals were wrong…. Haha…. I don't want to be forgotten…. I don't wanna die…. I wanna be loved….</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> …A little while ago, a friend of mine got interested in 'Magia☆Prism'. She said she stumbled upon it while surfing the net, even if it 15 years past its prime. And we ended up having this great conversation about it. It made me think it still gets its spotlight. I checked online and found others who got hooked after it ended and have been actively loving it for over 10 years. I never know what life will bring, huh.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> <em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> <em>(Looking at SCP-9777-B instances)</em> So, couldn't you just let them be free? The work they're into now might become the one that stays with them for life, or maybe they just haven't met their destined character yet.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Haha… I don't agree with everything, but I'll go along with it for now. But….</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> But?<br/>
　<br/>
<strong>SCP-9777:</strong> I have nowhere to go back to. My world… well, it was discarded by something like a "mother," and we were dragged along with it. Some survived… but I couldn't face them for them.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Do you know anything about this "mother?"<br/>
　<br/>
<strong>SCP-9777:</strong> <em>(Sinks into a cross-legged sitting position.)</em> Nah. I don't remember her face or name anymore. Too much time's passed. She probably forgot about us too. <em>(Clicks tongue, hits own head.)</em> Seriously, I've got nowhere to go, nothing left….</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I think you have a place here. Our mission includes protection. And I don't think everything you've done up until now was for nothing. I think that's who you are now. The person you built from scratch. I think there are people who would like you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Haha… I can't beat you, no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> <em>(Extends her right hand.)</em> Can you stand?<br/>
　<br/>
<strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Yeah, sort of.</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777 places its left hand on Agent Miou's right hand. At that instant, SCP-9777's left hand disintegrates.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou &amp; SCP-9777:</strong> <em>(Loudly)</em> WHAAAAA!?</p>
<p>(The surrounding mobile task force members also wore expressions of utter shock.)</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Huh!? Wait, what happened!?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Well, if you don't know, I don't know either! Why!? Huh!? Why!?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Let's just back off for now. <em>(Walks backwards.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Ah, yeah. Right. <em>(Walks backwards.)</em> Whoa!?</p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777 stumbles backward. Instinctively, SCP-9777 grabs a cable hanging from the ceiling to steady itself. The cable snaps.)</em></p>
<p><em>(As the cable snaps, lighting equipment falls from above SCP-9777's head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-9777:</strong> Wha—</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Watch ou—</p>
<p><em>(The lighting equipment collides with the top of SCP-9777's head. Instantly, a crack appears in SCP-9777's skull, and its left eyeball pops slightly out of its socket.)</em></p>
<p><em>(An explosion originates on SCP-9777's head, accompanied by a screech resembling a hawk's cry.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The blast wave throws Agent Miou back about 1 meter.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Smoke clears to reveal lighting equipment lying on the ground, now ablaze. One of SCP-9777's eyeballs lies nearby, but no other part of its body is visible.)</em></p>
<p><em>(SCP-9777-B instances faint simultaneously.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> …Why.</p>
<p><strong>Area Command:</strong> What happened? Give me the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Η77-VEDANTAM:</strong> <em>(Wireless)</em> This is Eta-77 Vehicle Team. The crowd has thinned, we can finally come pick you up. Also, we managed to link up with Mobile Unit Nn (ん)-19 en route, so we're heading over together. …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>End Report:</strong> The following factors, either individually or collectively, are considered causes for SCP-9777's structural collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absorption of Akiva radiation through contact with Agent Miou, who had ingested SCP-5993-1, rendering it unable to maintain its physical form.</li>
<li>SCP-9777 excessively consumed the power of "Faith" through its own transformations or the summoning of new humanoid entities, rendering it unable to maintain its physical form.</li>
<li>There was a time limit on its ability to maintain its physical form.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event venue occupied and destroyed by SCP-9777 during combat was successfully restored to its original state before sunrise through Foundation efforts. The live event "███ █████████ ████ 2025" scheduled for that day proceeded normally without incident.</p>
<p>The eyeball, the sole trace left behind by SCP-9777 in physical form, has been designated SCP-9777-C and is currently stored in Under Area-85.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The verification of the conditions for acquiring resistance to the SCP-9777's memetic hazard, as presented by Agent Miou during combat, is currently underway.</span><strong>See Addendum 9777.4.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 9777.4: Combat Report</strong></p>
<hr/></div>
<br/>
After the encounter with the SCP-9777, all SCP-9777-B and SCP-9777 subjects who had not yet reached the stage of transformation to SCP-9777-B suffered from temporary blackouts or clouding of consciousness. Interviews with some of these individuals revealed that they had lost all their memory and knowledge of SCP-9777. Those who were captured were successfully cleared of SCP-9777's memetic contamination through memory processing. Those who were resistant to the SCP-9777 memetic hazard, including Agent Miou, did not experience blackouts or clouding of consciousness, nor did they lose their memory or knowledge of SCP-9777. No fatalities have yet been confirmed as a result of SCP-9777's series of actions.
<p>All effects of SCP-9777 on the real world and the Internet were neutralized, images related to SCP-9777 automatically disappeared from the Internet, and the affected areas were restored to their previous state. SCP-2223 was reverted to its original nature and thus again restored to its proper containment status by Protocol 56-Ackerman. All physical media containing SCP-9777 in the real world were recovered and incinerated, leaving a select few for archival purposes.</p>
<p>SCP-9777's current condition is unknown. Although there is a hypothesis that the anomalous feature was lost due to the loss of memetic hazard associated with the appearance, the possibility that SCP-9777 is still "alive" cannot be ruled out, as such the Neutralized classification is withheld. The search for SCP-9777 continues.</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of an interview with Agent Miou.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Seimei Saneaki</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Agt. Miou Fujina</p>
<p><strong>Interview Location:</strong> Under Area-85</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following interview was conducted in Japanese.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> How are you feeling, Agent Miou?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> …Welp.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> How about your injuries?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Not fully healed yet, but I'm back to duty. Honestly, the Foundation's insurance system is fantastic. <em>(Chuckles lightly)</em></p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I think I can guess what's on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> I couldn't save her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I suppose there was we can do about that.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> If only I'd tried a different approach.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I think some of it was just bad luck coming back around. <em>(Sighs)</em> I know these words won't help.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> In the end, I let her die.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> We can't be sure of that yet. …Nope! Actually, the probability she's alive is quite high. SCP-9777 is a conceptual deity. Didn't she… ah, that anomaly said something like "If I am forgotten, I die"? Then conversely, as long as we remember her, she might still be clinging to life somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> <em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> No, it's my personal matter.</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Would it be okay if I drew pictures of her?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> That might be pushing it… wait, if you apply for it as part of SCP-9777's life extension protocol, it might pass. But I wonder if it would be assigned to someone else….</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Could this mere thought also be influenced by SCP-9777?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> OK….</p>
<p><em>(Silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Regarding your hypothesis about the conditions for resistance to the meme- it was largely correct.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Where did that hypothesis come from?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> When I first saw the real SCP-9777 up close, its eyes didn't just look angry. It was more… mixed with anxiety. Its pupils kept darting around. Like it was terrified of us. Like it desperately wanted help. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see. Hmm, that's quite an interesting perspective.</p>
<p><em>(Dr. Seimei takes notes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Speaking of which, I hear a new series of 'Magia☆Prism' is unexpectedly launching soon.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yeah, I heard.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see you've been waiting for it.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Yeah, well.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Could it be you're dissatisfied with the new series?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Huh!? Well, I mean, it's not like there aren't any issues— I do feel a bit of discomfort with the new character. But change is inevitable. Even if it's hard to accept now, I think my future self will be enjoying it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> I see. She'll understand your thoughts eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Still, if I could, I wish I could've told her… I wanted to show her the drawings I made back then.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> …It seems you need a bit more rest. But I do think you're improving. I believe you'll be able to return to duty soon. Any final questions?</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> Nothing in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> Understood. That concludes this interview. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(Just before leaving, Dr. Seimei pauses once.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Seimei:</strong> It's okay. Everything will get better. It doesn't end here.</p>
<p><strong>Agt. Miou:</strong> …Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Based on Agent Miou's statements, similar interviews with other memetic-tolerant individuals were conducted and found that they all have a character or work that they have had a prominent liking for at least seven years. This specific causal relationship is still under investigation.</p>
