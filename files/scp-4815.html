            <h1>SCP-4815</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4815</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4815's remains are to be kept in containment locker #4805 at Site 12. Testing of SCP-4815's remains are not permitted in line with current humanoid EC protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4815 is a 56 year old woman named Theresa Miller. SCP-4815 claims that in the future she will experience a temporal phenomenon which will allow her to telepathically communicate with herself at previous points in her life. SCP-4815 claims that the voice communicating with her is 85 years old. This voice, or the instance of SCP-4815 that exists in the future, is referred to as SCP-4815-1.</p>
<p>SCP-4815 is capable of predicting events that she will experience, although this accuracy is entirely dependent on information that SCP-4815-1 has chosen to relay to her. SCP-4815 states that SCP-4815-1 is not always honest regarding events that will occur.</p>
<p>SCP-4815 experiences behavioral and emotional difficulties relating to SCP-4815-1's influence, experiencing obsessive behaviors and thoughts stemming from severe anxiety. Information relayed to SCP-4815 from SCP-4815-1's is sometimes inaccurate or malicious. Further information and personal accounts can be found in the attached addenda.</p>
<p>SCP-4815 claims to have heard this voice since early adolescence. SCP-4815 has otherwise lived an unremarkable life, only coming to the Foundation's attention after checking herself in to a local mental health center, and demonstrably proving her precognitive abilities to the medical staff [After which medical records in the area were parsed and containment protocols were enacted by staff at Site-18].</p>
<p>SCP-4815-1 is not known. SCP-4815 claims SCP-4815-1 is in a coma, or a place where "she's not awake".</p>

<p><strong>2/25/2000</strong> The Old Me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been hearing from her since I was little. It seems like she doesn't ever shut up. She tells me what to do, where to go, how to get out of this and that. How I'm supposed to be, you know? I tell her that if I just did it my way it might turn out different, but she says she knows better since she already went through it. The longer I've been listening to her the less I think that's really true. I think it's a self fulfilling prophecy; if I hadn't heard from her I woulda' been fine, really. What she's doing, living vicariously.</p>
<p>She fucked up at one point is what I think what it was. Not me. I don't think I'm really her, not really. When she tells me not to do something, it's because she didn't do it right the first time. I wised up to that quick. If she didn't do it the way I did, she's not me.</p>
<p>I think I'm her second chance. If I ever run into this woman, if I really do hit 85… If I start seeing me back when I was young, then I'm going to lay down and die right there, or at least I hope you'll put me to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>3/26/2002</strong> Trust</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was 19, I think. I was walking away from the bus stop. I hear tires screeching, some asshole cut around the bus and almost slammed headlong into a truck. Old Theresa told me to run, <em>seconds</em> before I heard the noise, and this dumb-ass flies past me into a streetlight. Clipped my arm on his mirror passenger side mirror.</p>
<p>I had so many "near misses" that I wouldn't have gotten through without Old Theresa, and that's what really got me thinking about her. Seemed like every other week, there was my mortality lurking around the corner. No one is that unlucky, not in this part of the world, not even for me, not even in the neighborhood I grew up in would someone run into that kind of trouble so often.</p>

<p><strong>1/15/2008</strong> Agency</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think everyone is going to hurt you, some people just aren't as good at it.</p>
<p>I was my parents more than they were. I taught myself the basics. I didn't have much choice though. Old Theresa taught me because they didn't, I think. I heard a saying that you have to be the adult you needed when you were a kid, and I think she took that to heart.</p>
<p>The problem is I never did it <em>my</em> way. I couldn't. Old Theresa will flood my head with noise if I don't think the right thing. I went to therapy. They teach you this technique where you can categorize thoughts, pick the ones that aren't of any use to you, and you can put them in a mental bin. Works for a lot of bad cases, lots of people go in wrecks and come out even.</p>
<p>But me… I have an old woman flooding my head with noise, I have a sealed globe attached to my neck filled with swirling sound. I can't toss that out. She wakes me up when I'm sleeping. I hear her in my dreams free associating about what's happening. The stupid bitch.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of trepanning? I looked into it.</p>

<p><strong>12/12/2012</strong> Why I Haven't Won The Lottery</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am old Theresa, then old Theresa doesn't deserve the good life.</p>
<p>She says that's a self fulfilling prophecy. The audacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1/29/2014</strong> I Hate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Theresa heard the voice “When she was younger”, and she still does. She’s just running out of creative ways to fuck with me.</p>
<p>When I meet her I'm going to kill her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm going to meet her soon.</p>
