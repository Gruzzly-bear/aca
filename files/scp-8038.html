<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>SCP-8038 refers to Episode 79 of the 1993 Japanese anime <em>Sparkling Butterfly</em>. On June 1st, 2022, SCP-8038 began to appear on both illegal and legal anime streaming sites and platforms online, as well as retroactively on previously-released physical media (VHS, Laserdisc, Blu-Ray, etc.). As only 78 episodes were produced, the sudden existence of a fully-created 79th episode, as well as its appearance on physical media was determined significant enough for Foundation intervention.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the original 78 episodes of <em>Sparkling Butterfly</em> would often focus on either regular life for Fujimiya or her battles against the evil Crystallizing as the mahou shoujo<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> Sparkling Butterfly, SCP-8038 focuses on the titular character reconciling with the main villain of the series. It is also notable that SCP-8038's run time is significantly shorter than any of the episodes of the original series with a run time of approximately 10 minutes, as opposed to the normal 24 minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sparkling Butterfly</em></strong> (<span style="color: #3366cc">Japanese</span>: 煌めきバタフライ, <span style="color: #3366cc">Hepburn</span>: <em>Kirameki Batofurai</em>) also stylized as <strong><em>Sparkling! 🦋 BUTTERFLY</em></strong> ( キラキラ🦋タフライ, <em>Kirakira Batofurai</em>), is a Japanese <span style="color: #3366cc">magical girl anime television series</span> written and produced by <span style="color: #3366cc">Sakura Animations</span> which aired from 1993 to 1995 on MiraiTV and ran for two seasons with a total run of 78 episodes. The series follows Ageha Fujimiya, a 15-year-old high school student who is recruited by the mysterious Dumach and taught how to transform into the magical Sparkling Butterfly, a superheroine with the ability to fight the evil empress Crystallizing who wishes to corrupt the world. While not fighting evil, Fujimiya deals with her daily life and growing up.</p>

<p><strong>Ageha Fujimiya</strong> (藤宮 揚羽, <em>Fujimiya Ageha</em>) / <strong>Sparkling Butterfly</strong> (スパークリング・バタフライ, <em>Supākuringu Batofurai</em>)</p>
<div class="indenter">
<p>Voiced by: <span style="color: #3366cc">Masuyo Inoue</span></p>
<p>A kind 15-year-old girl that attends Itogahara High School. She is cheerful and upbeat, with many friends in her class. After being given the power to transform into the superheroine Sparkling Butterfly by Dumach, she promises to fight the monsters sent by her arch-rival, Crystallizing. She loves gardening, insects, and nature. Aspires to be an entomologist. At the end of the series, she chooses to be the last holder of the Sparkling Butterfly title.</p>

<div class="indenter">
<p>Voiced by: <span style="color: #3366cc">Chiho Yonemura</span></p>
<p>A 15-year-old girl who is Fujimiya's best friend. She is the only one who knows about Fujimiya's ability to transform into Sparkling Butterfly. Although powerless, she supports her best friend and often covers for Fujimiya in class so she can defeat Crystallizing. She is a lot shyer than Fujimiya but very friendly once she is able to connect with someone new.</p>
</div>

<div class="indenter">
<p>Voiced by: <span style="color: #3366cc">Tetsuya Kagawa</span></p>
<p>A popular 17-year-old boy who also attends Itogahara High School. He is charming and elegant, which has caused almost every girl in the school to fall for him, including Fujimiya. He is friends with Fujimiya and Suzuki, and it is implied that he has a crush on Suzuki. One of the series's running gags involves him loudly praising Sparkling Butterfly's efforts in front of Fujimiya.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Nobu Shimada</strong> (島田 城, <em>Shimada Nobu</em>) / <strong>Crystallizing</strong> (クリスタライジング, <em>Kurisutaraijingu</em>)</p>
<div class="indenter">
<p>Voiced by: <span style="color: #3366cc">Yūri Kai</span></p>
<p>An evil, chaotic adult woman with the ability to cocoon people and turn their greatest desires into a monster called a Chrysalis. Her plots are often disrupted by Fujimiya, who she considers her greatest enemy. She works in disguise at Itogahara Middle School as a PE teacher, but is initially unaware that Fujimiya is Sparkling Butterfly.</p>
<p>In the final several episodes, it is revealed that she was the original Sparkling Butterfly. Unwillingly forced into the position by Dumach, she rebelled and was subsequently cursed by him, leading to her becoming Crystallizing. She is heavily injured in the finale, and implied to have died.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mashhit Dumach</strong> (マッシュヒーツ・ドゥーマック, <em>Masshuhītsu Doūmakku</em>)</p>
<div class="indenter">
<p>Voiced by: <span style="color: #3366cc">Kaneto Shiozawa</span></p>
<p>A mysterious, well-dressed young man who gives Fujimiya the power to become Sparkling Butterfly. Claiming to be an emissary for good, he instructs Fujimiya to fight Crystallizing's attempts to debauch the world.</p>
<p>At the end of the series, it is revealed that he is directly responsible for Crystallizing's condition. While mostly appearing to be an affable and friendly man, he is actually a very vindictive spider-like being that feeds on chaos and fear. In the finale, both Sparkling Butterfly and Crystallizing work together to defeat him.</p>

<p>SCP-8038 first came to Foundation attention on June 1st, 2022, when a Foundation webcrawler picked up possible anomaly keyphrases on a popular forum board dedicated to anime wherein fans of <em>Sparkling Butterfly</em> discussed a mysterious new 79th episode of the series.<br/>

<p>So this might not really be the place for this, but this is the anime board after all so I thought I’d post here. I was going to rewatch Sparkling Butterfly so I could make some more fanart, and on PlaceForAnime I noticed there was a 79th episode. I thought this was a mistake at first and was just like a copy of one of the other episodes, so I decided to watch it to make sure. NOPE. It’s a completely new episode and it’s still in the animation style of the original series. The plot was really strange to me, as it was about Fujimiya forgiving Crystallizing for everything she did seven years after the series ended. It also was way shorter than a normal episode at just 10 minutes. But there was one really major change that stood out. Crystallizing was a dude. Like we all know she was a woman (yes I'm aware of what the writers planned originally and all but it unfortunately doesn't count). Is this like their way of starting a reboot or something? And why didn’t they announce its release? Why dump it straight to streaming platforms? Did anyone else see this?<br/>

<p>I saw this too, and I honestly wondered if I was going crazy. They even brought back OP1, Kagayaku! Shining Butterfly. Not that I mind the changes, but it’s something that was really strange to me. Feels like a pretty good follow up to the kinda depressing ending though.</p>

<p>Sakura Animation actually posted about this on their socials</p>
<p>They stated that they didn’t make the episode there are no plans for a reboot or anything and they’re actually trying to figure out where it came from</p>

<p>I just checked their socials and yep, it’s true. They also clarified that Crystallizing was "open to interpretation" but written as a woman. In the new episode, she talks about how she’s happy to finally be herself. Or uh, his self? She says that he's a guy now. Do you think a fan made this trying to project a headcanon onto the character? Like rewriting the finale? It's too high quality to be a fanwork though…</p>

Possibly</p>
<p>But then how would it have gotten on official streaming platforms if it was a fan project</p>
<p>Maybe it's a leak of an anniversary special or something and they're trying to cover it up. It's almost the 30th anniversary in a couple of years so</p>

<p>you guys may not care about the change, but i do. like the whole point of crystallizing is she's meant to be a WOMAN. if they wanted her to be some fugly dude, it woulda been in the show. she was supposed to be the hot and sexy anime villain that fans could love like what the fuck is this woke shit</p>

Found the media illiterate.</p>
<p>It's always the damn Crystallizing fans man. Do you have enough braincells to pick up on subtext? The show always hinted that there was something off with him, that he was longing for something he couldn't have (and no it wasn't fucking defeating Sparkling Butterfly)</p>

<p>Could anyone find out anything about who the new voice actor for Crystallizing is? Ageha sounds the exact same too which is really weird considering it's been almost 30 years and her original voice actress is in her 50s now. Plus if you look back at the promos from a couple of years ago for the blue ray she sounds noticeably different. There are no credits and I've never heard this voice actor for Crystallizing before.</p>

I looked into it, and I couldn't find a thing. Someone asked Masuyo Inoue, Fujimiya's seiyuu, since she's active on twitter, and she said she hasn't done any voice work for Sparkling Butterfly since the HD release.</p>

<p>OK so I grabbed my HD Blu Ray to check if I could find anything in the extras on it but I swear im going crazy. The freaky part is that this episode shows up in the episode list on my DVD. My Blu Ray DVD from four years ago. Like, it's there, labeled as Episode 79. It was absolutely NOT there before man this has to be some Mandela Effect shit.</p>

Her hair falls out of the low pigtails it's in, now flowing loose. Fujimiya waves the wand over her head, her hair growing longer, then moves to tie itself up in two large high ponytails. Next, she points the wand over her torso, a puffy-sleeved top and a short but multiple-layered frilly skirt appears. She points the wand at her legs, thigh-length stockings with lace at the top appearing. She then points the wand to her feet, two orange heels with golden butterflies at the toe of each shoe forming. Short gloves form around her hands. Lastly, she points the wand at her face. Makeup appears on her face, and her eyes turn from brown to orange.<br/>

<p>Fujimiya and Suzuki approach a bench in the park covered by a tree. Suzuki is wearing a jacket and a t-shirt with slacks; Fujimiya is wearing dress shirt and dress pants.

<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Addendum 03:</strong> Containment Procedure Deliberation</span></p>
<p>After a period of discussion with media containment specialists, it was decided that the containment procedures will be as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Foundation will conduct a disinformation campaign with the assistance of Sakura Animations that SCP-8038 is the 79th episode; while unreleased on television, it was included in all home media releases and also remastered in 2018 for the 25th anniversary. Any previous online activity that contradicts this cover story is to be erased. Monitoring of changes in SCP-8038 behavior will continue. However, due to the acceptance of SCP-8038 by the show's community and lack of further anomalous activity, it is highly likely that any further Foundation intervention (if at all) will be extremely minimal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A suggested object class change to <span style="color: green"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><tt>Safe, pending Neutralized</tt></span></span> is in the process of being approved as well.<br/>
