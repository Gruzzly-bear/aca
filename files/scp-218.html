            <h1>SCP-218</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-218</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-218 is contained within a standard aquatic specimen tank (saltwater). Tank maintenance is to be carried out by remote drone only. No further procedures are required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-218 is a predatory colonial organism weighing approximately 1800 kg, consisting of several hundred parasitic lampreys of the family Petromyzontidae, designated <em>Petromyzon anomalis</em>. Individual <em>Petromyzon anomalis</em> specimens average between 50 and 90 cm in length, and are similar in appearance to the common sea lamprey, (<em>Petromyzon marinus</em>) with the primary exception of complex ultraviolet-spectrum skin patterning. Individual lampreys can break off from the primary mass and move under their own power, acting similar to non-anomalous specimens. These motile units will remain in the vicinity of SCP-218’s primary body, until captured and eaten by colony members. The central mass of SCP-218 contains the organism’s primary organs, as well as a muscular foot for locomotion. SCP-218 is capable of surviving out of water for up to an hour, though it is greatly inhibited in mobility.</p>
<p>Motile units of SCP-218 produce a paralyzing toxin, applied by bite or through the lamprey’s mucus sheath. This toxin inhibits locomotor muscles and will numb the target to pain – all other internal and mental processes will continue unaffected. The paralyzing effect has not been observed to dissipate, and no effective counteragent has yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Early observation led researchers to believe that SCP-218 reproduced through the parasitic implantation of motile units into a host body – this behavior has since been determined to be atypical feeding behavior, where numerous motile units will burrow within the body of still-living prey for upwards of 48 hours before normal consumption resumes.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-01:</strong> Physical examination of SCP-218 shortly after containment revealed that the primary mass contained several foreign objects preserved within the main body cavity. SCP-218 was removed from its containment tank and tranquilized to allow for surgery.</p>
<p>Objects removed from SCP-218 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>33 pearls, averaging 3cm in diameter. Holes bored through each indicate that they were previously part of a necklace.</li>
<li>1 dolphin figurine carved out of smoothed coral.</li>
<li>2 gold bracelets</li>
<li>4 bone hair pins</li>
<li>1 tortoiseshell hair comb</li>
<li>1 bone figurine of SCP-218. Shows signs of heavy wear through handling.</li>
<li>1 human skeleton, being that of a female child estimated to be between 4 and 6 years of age. Skeleton was similar to chalk in consistency, and embedded with 135 pearls.</li>
<li>Scapula (believed to be that of a red deer) – engraved with three humanoid figures, two adults and one child. Presumed to be the subject and parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the skeleton and artifacts date to approximately 7500 BCE, though do not resemble the artifacts of other Neolithic groups in the region of recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum-02:</strong> SCP-218's behavior became significantly more agitated after removal of the aforementioned objects: entity would repeatedly beat against the walls of its tank or attempt to scale them.</p>
<p>When one of the hair pins was placed back in the containment tank, SCP-218 used one of its colony members as a manipulator to retrieve the pin, and then place it back inside its central cavity through means of a large sphincter. This dorsal sphincter was not present until the removal of the body and artifacts.</p>
