<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5017</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5017 is to be housed at Site-71, which is disguised as a logging operation south of Lake Merwin in Washington. At least 12 members of an armed security detail are to be posted at all times, four of whom should be outside scouting the perimeter and eight of whom should be inside observing SCP-5017, with at least two people directly observing SCP-5017 at all times. Any staff members on-site observing strange behavior must be detained immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5017 is a large opal geode standing roughly 3 meters tall and 1.8 meters wide. The exterior of the geode is engraved with approximately one thousand different inscriptions of an ancient language using the Beith-luis-nin alphabet.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> All attempts to translate the oghams<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> have not found any coherent sentences or phrases carved onto the geode. The geode emits a dull hum of around 6 decibels and 120 Hertz, described by most observers as a relaxing sound. It is currently theorized that SCP-5017 allows for some form of teleportation of an indeterminant distance.</p>
<p>SCP-5017 was discovered during a joint Foundation-Unusual Incidents Unit search for Person of Interest #305, commonly known as D.B. Cooper. SCP-5017 was discovered at the end of a trail from Cooper's deployed parachute 6 kilometers south. Alongside SCP-5017 was a briefcase containing USD 200,000. The briefcase was collected by an Unusual Incidents Unit agent after it was determined it had not been affected with any anomalous properties. Site-71 was immediately established to contain the object and to determine the location of PoI-305. PoI-305 is considered incredibly dangerous and an enemy of the Foundation and his capture and interrogation is a top Foundation priority. As PoI-305 has a history of posing as a Foundation employee, all employees are required to report any employee with similarities to PoI-305 who displays unusual behavior. Please read the Person of Interest file for PoI-305 for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dr. Eric O'Reilly</p>
<p><strong>Known Aliases:</strong> D.B. Cooper</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> White male, balding, believed to have been between his mid-thirties and early forties in 1971.</p>
<p><strong>Date of Birth (If known):</strong> Presumed to be some time between 1930 and 1938.</p>
<p><strong>Reason For Interest:</strong> Assassination of six high ranking Foundation employees, assassination of numerous Global Occult Association members, theft of dozens of anomalous objects.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Engagement:</strong> Immediately engage with intent to subdue and capture. Interrogation is the Foundation's highest priority.</p>
<p><strong>Biography:</strong> D.B. Cooper was originally known to the Foundation as Dr. Eric O'Reilly. O'Reilly worked as a researcher with an impressive knowledge of world history who was often consulted on numerous anomalous objects. O'Reilly worked as a Foundation employee for over a decade, reaching the rank of Senior Researcher and achieving security clearance level 3 before committing several crimes against the Foundation. After a review of O'Reilly's documents following the incident, all documents related to his identity were found to be elaborate forgeries. An investigation into the person of interest's true identity and affiliation is still ongoing by Foundation investigators. A possible link to a Group of Interest previously thought to have been disestablished many years prior is seen as the consensus among involved Foundation personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Memo on SCP-5017 and PoI-305</strong><br/>
Foundation employees often question the validity of the Foundation's assertation that famed air pirate D. B. Cooper was a former Foundation member turned criminal mastermind. Some employees further doubt that the geode in containment has anything to do with Cooper and that the backstory is just there to cover up some sort of harmful effect of SCP-5017. The Foundation is an entirely transparent organization when it comes to telling employees what they need to know. The geode does not cause any form of ill health, it isn't part of a secret stone creature that is sticking out of the soil. It is nothing more than an ancient device used for some type of teleportation. The Foundation has yet to determine how it was used by PoI-305 to escape from a search coordinated by the FBI and assisted by Foundation personnel. The primary focus of containment is to learn how to properly use SCP-5017 and to have multiple security members on-hand to apprehend PoI-305 should he return. The high-risk information is simply more details on PoI-305's crimes to be used as a standard of proof for his identification. This is in order to prevent a "witch hunt" among Foundation personnel as PoI-305 may have changed in appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Unknown</p>
<p><strong>Known Aliases:</strong> D.B. Cooper, Dr. Eric O'Reilly, Senior Researcher Kernan McInnis, Head of Personnel Liam Collins</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Most recent known appearance was as a white male in his late thirties to early forties. Consistent with most appearances of the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Date of Birth (If known)</strong>: Presumed to be some time before 1500 AD.</p>
<p><strong>Reason For Interest:</strong> Assassination of six top-level Foundation employees in 1971 during critical negotiations with the Global Occult Coalition, who also lost several top-level employees. Previous assassination attempts on Foundation members. Theft of over one hundred anomalous objects.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Engagement:</strong> Immediately engage with intent to subdue and capture. Interrogation is the Foundation's highest priority. The person of interest has proven to be remarkably perceptive and incredibly intelligent. The target often poses as a member of the Foundation or a Foundation ally to gain access to highly secured anomalous objects. Interrogation of PoI-305 is considered critical to Foundation goals due to his ownership of several Keter level objects and his in-depth knowledge of SCP-5017's functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Biography:</strong> Person of Interest 305 has been a persistent threat to the Foundation and its precursors for the last several centuries. Person of Interest 305 is presumed to be an individual who has access to a network of oghamstones that serve as a mass teleportation relay, allowing for near-instantaneous travel to multiple locations across the world. Currently, the Foundation has discovered 10 oghamstones that are considered possible candidates for usage by PoI-305, although only SCP-5017 is confirmed to have anomalous properties. It is currently unknown whether PoI-305 is himself an anomalous individual or whether his extended lifespan is a result of using SCP-5017. PoI-305 is the only person known to be able to use the anomalous effect of SCP-5017.</p>

<p><strong>Memo on PoI-305</strong><br/>
Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, nothing else is known about PoI-305. Details of PoI-305's crimes against the Foundation have been withheld so that the O5 Council can better weed out false suspects when accusations are brought forward. This assignment is not, as some employees have previously complained "a wild goose chase" or "an elaborate form of punishment". The assassination of Foundation personnel is taken extremely seriously, and the events of the "D.B. Cooper Incident" are directly linked to a large scale assassination attack that left the Foundation incredibly vulnerable. Please take all possible sightings of PoI-305 seriously and report on anything out of the ordinary that occurs in or around Site-71. The immediate capture of PoI-305 is one of the Foundation's top priorities for a reason. Employees like you could very well be the next victim. Jokes about D.B. Cooper's current whereabouts and the futility of SCP-5017's containment do nothing but damage morale. Containment and observation of SCP-5017 is the best method we have for preventing another attack.</p>

<p>Welcome to the O5 Council. As part of our orientation process, we are obligated to warn you about Person of Interest #305 and his access to SCP-5017. The following documents will explain the history of the Foundation, the history of the Person of Interest, and a detailed explanation of the 1971 assassination of the Foundation's original Administrator. All details you were told previously regarding these topics were elaborate fabrications designed to prevent a repeat of previous high profile assassinations which have often crippled the Foundation's ability to coordinate and build better relations with other groups.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Person of Interest File #305</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Cathbhadh</p>
<p><strong>Known Aliases:</strong> Well over two hundred known aliases, in all cases these aliases are used once and disposed of afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Most recent known appearance was as a white male in his late thirties to early forties. Consistent with most appearances of the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Date of Birth (If known):</strong> Sometime before 750 BC</p>
<p><strong>Reason For Interest:</strong> Assassination of the Foundation's Administrator in 1971 following several prior attempts. Collateral damage from these attempts with death tolls in the thousands. Active attacks to use violence to isolate the Foundation and prevent it from making allies with other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Engagement:</strong> Immediately engage with intent to subdue and capture. PoI-305's attacks are believed to be a precursor to a full-scale attack on our reality deployed from another dimension that can be reached via SCP-5017 and possibly through other oghamstones. A preemptive first strike to recover numerous Keter level objects is largely agreed to be the only chance for the Foundation's survival.</p>
<p><strong>Biography:</strong> Cathbhadh was a prominent druid in ancient Ireland, eventually commanding troops and leading other anomalous humans across the British Isles as well as in modern-day Spain, France, and Belgium. Later in his career, he began supporting the army of Ambiorix of Belgae in his war to prevent the Roman occupation of the Celtic homeland. After the fall of the Belgae and the united Celtic forces, Cathbhadh and thousands on Celts loyal to him disappeared. Cathbhadh has reappeared under different identities numerous times since then, having his most recent confirmed appearance in 1971 during which he assassinated the Foundation's administrator. Please see the attached document for a timeline of known attacks by PoI-305 on the Foundation and other groups.</p>

<p><em>Sunt tenebrae et lumen nos sumus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Timeline of Notable Incidents related to PoI-305 "Cathbhadh"</strong><br/>
<strong>54 B.C.:</strong> Cathbhadh and a large number of his supporters and allies disappear, last known location in northeast Belgae.<br/>
<strong>53 B.C.:</strong> Ordo Praesidio is formed, a precursor organization to the Foundation. Surviving documents lead Foundation historians to believe that Cathbhadh was present at this event using a false identity.<br/>
<strong>44 B.C.:</strong> First known assassination by Cathbhadh, the leader of the Ordo Praesidio is assassinated by various political opponents conspiring with Cathbhadh to bring down the Ordo through the death of its Antimagum Dux. Ordo immediately reorganized under a new leader who took on the title of Administrator.<br/>
<strong>14 A.D.:</strong> Administrator of the Foundation assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape frequent assassination attempts.<br/>
<strong>41 A.D..:</strong> Prominent Ordo member is found to be an accomplice of Cathbhadh. Member is executed and an internal review of Ordo members becomes an annual requirement.<br/>
<strong>395 A.D.:</strong> Two high profile members of the ΑκτΚ, a Constantinople organization similar to the Ordo. and a high profile member of the Ordo are assassinated during a conference between the two organizations. Plans for the organizations to merge are postponed indefinitely.<br/>
<strong>837 A.D.:</strong> Factional dispute causes a three-way split between Ordo members. Two prominent members at the center of this split are found to have connections with Cathbhadh. Split leads to severe security issues within the Ordo during which Cathbhadh begins his theft of anomalous objects.<br/>
<strong>1144 A.D.:</strong> Ordo is ousted from its primary base of operations in Rome after political circumstances change quickly, with Cathbhadh's involvement considered incredibly likely. Relocation to Venice begins later that year.<br/>
<strong>1453 A.D.:</strong> Foundation secondary base in Constantinople, established roughly one hundred and fifty years prior, is destroyed by non-anomalous attackers. Witness reports make it seem likely that Cathbhadh performed a large scale heist of anomalous objects immediately before the destruction.<br/>
<strong>1653 A.D.:</strong> First direct act of violence by Cathbhadh in over one thousand years. During successful negotiations between the Ordo and the English Bewerigend Frýgyld on whether to merge, 7 security team members are killed protecting the administrator and the leader of the Bewerigend Frýgyld who would later become O5-1.<br/>
<strong>1658 A.D.:</strong> In a second attempt, Cathbhadh successfully assassinates O5-1. This leads to the break up of the British branch of the Ordo.<br/>
<strong>1789 A.D.:</strong> Ordo secondary base, relocated to Paris, is destroyed by large scale rioting. Again, witnesses report the theft of anomalous objects by someone speculated to be Cathbhadh only minutes prior.<br/>
<strong>1932 A.D.:</strong> Ordo successfully merges with two other organizations, Mitteleuropäische Truppe zur Ausrottung der Hexerei and the Meijihantā. Two security team members are attacked by a man presumed to be Cathbhadh, although both eventually recover from the attack.<br/>
<strong>1939 A.D.:</strong> Assaults on the Ordo by persons assumed to be Cathbhadh become a weekly occurrence. Hundreds of personnel are killed, hundreds of objects are stolen, and thousands of anomalous individuals escape containment.<br/>
<strong>1945 A.D.:</strong> Most of the Ordo merges with various other organizations to become the Foundation. Breakaway group hoping to continue several of the rules established in 1932 becomes the Global Occult Coalition.<br/>
<strong>1959 A.D.:</strong> Attack on joint operation of Foundation agents and members of the GRU Division P results in nine deaths. Cathbhadh is the primary suspect.<br/>
<strong>1971 A.D:</strong> The Foundation's administrator, O5-4, O5-7, three senior researchers, the Undersecretary-General of the Global Occult Coalition, the Council of 108's Minister of Collaborative Efforts, and several dozens members of a Foundation security team are killed in a bomb attack during a meeting in the United States to discuss a possible merger of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition. Days later a plane is hijacked by Cathbhadh in a related scheme.<br/>
<strong>1977 A.D.:</strong> Newly selected Administrator of the Foundation takes over from the interim administrator appointed after the 1971 bombing. Later that evening she is approached in her residence by a man claiming to be Cathbhadh. The suspect was incredibly calm and peaceful. After a conversation that lasted several minutes, the person of interest presented a note which was immediately taken to Foundation researchers for study. As of yet, the note has not been translated. A transcription of the encounter by memory is attached below.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transcript: Recreated Interaction with PoI-305</span></strong></p>
<p>The Administrator was bathing at the time of the incident. PoI-305 somehow made it past her personal security detail without their notice.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-305:</strong> Oh, sorry I can wait for you to put on a towel.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Oh fuck. Please don't kill me.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> No such plans. Just here to talk. Much like I talked to your predecessor so long ago.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Help! Someone get in here!<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> They can't hear you. [Pauses] They aren't dead, I've just sealed off the room as far as sound goes. Like I said, just here for a brief conversation. Let's not make it any harder than it has to be.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> You killed Gus. You killed him and so many others. Don't act like you had some sort of friendly discourse with him.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I did at one point, but that was so long ago and before I had to kill his father. At the very least I warned him.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Are you just here to taunt me before you start planning to kill me?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I'm here so that I never have to kill you. Perhaps this isn't the best time to give a compliment, but you are the kind of person that Augustus became. You're not like Oliver either. Sure, you're just as ambitious, you have that same fire in your eyes… but I've watched you for some time, making sure I could even have this conversation. I know you are incredibly intelligent and incredibly cautious. You'll try to make sure that you never make the wrong decision for the Foundation, and I admire that. I want to give you an honest chance.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Why should I believe you?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I understand that you have questions about my motives, my methods, my…well, just about everything. I'm an open book.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Why did you murder Gus?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> Because that amadán spent a couple thousand years doing everything possible to put a target on his back. I'm here to make sure you don't make the same mistake.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> What mistake?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> The destruction of my people.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> The Foundation has nothing to do with the political situation in Ireland…<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> No, not that. Druids, bards, filis, mages, wizards, witches, shamans, you know the type. The kind you've locked away or lead to the deaths of. Although since you mention it I'm not entirely convinced you aren't fucking around in Eire either. Irrelevant though, all I ask is that your little Foundation stop locking people up. You can lock up every picture that makes you crazy or knife that travels at jet speed all you like, but you can't shut people away simply because they seek out Danu or some other connection.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> They're a threat to…<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> To your worldview. You've never taken the time to consider that just because someone doesn't conform to your view of what the world ought to be, that doesn't make them wrong. Certainly doesn't make them a criminal. Locking them away is good for no one.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> You will be locked up with them, you can't possibly hope to escape from here, I'll get the entire Site-17 staff to go out and search for you.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I have a shifting stone mere miles from here. I'll be gone before the sun rises and long before your security even knows something was wrong.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Shifting stone?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> A oghamstone, safe passage from your realm back to mine, and the other way around.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> The geode we found in Washington?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> That's one of them.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> One?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> Please tell me that's not the first one you've found.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> What do you mean? How many are there?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> [laughs] It took you this long to find one of them? And you don't even know how it works? Your organization is worse than I thought.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> How many?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> Thousands. In caves. In the thickest parts of the forest. In the parts of the swamp no fool would walk through. In tundras and deserts. On forgotten little islands in the vast blue ocean. Everywhere that Danu lives, you may find a way back to the home we made. To a druid, they are the easiest thing in the world to find. To the untrained eye, you'd have to get in kicking distance of it. Or separate it from nature. I truly and honestly thought you'd have found at least a few dozen by now. You've had about two thousand years to do so.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Where do they take you.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> Home. Where my people rest and recover, heal from the wounds you inflicted. [pauses] Your friend… Gus… he kept trying to build his power. From a little coup in Rome to his constant flirtation with authoritarians. He was so caught up in the world as he thought it out to be he didn't stop to consider the world as it was. His place in it, and a more natural kind of change and growth. So we left. We waited and watched until I could watch no more.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> You've been trying to kill him for thousands of years. You didn't wait…<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I gave him a thousand chances to redeem himself, but he never did. I'd like to think I'm not about to make the same mistake with you. I had this conversation with your friend so long ago. Futile… but you are smarter. A woman like you does not end up in a position like this without being incredibly intelligent. I'll be gone soon, and I've decided that I won't be back for some time unless something changes. I haven't truly slept in such a long time, I can't quite remember what it is like to dream.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> We will find you, we will find your stones and lock all of them up. We will stop you.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> You've found one. One in two thousand years. I'd suggest that you reconsider your strategy.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Does your offer to answer questions still stand.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I'm not about to tell you where the stones are, now.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> No. Not that. You got away perfectly. You had no reason to hijack a plane and lead us right to your stone. Nothing about that makes any sense.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I had one more organization to cripple.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> I don't follow.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> How is the budget for the Unusual Incident Unit looking these days? It was pretty robust just six years ago. Then the first time they put their foot down and demand all the resources they can for an investigation, they've taken a bulk of the organization's resources fourteen hours away from the most high profile crime of the decade. By the time they catch up… they find a pile of money, which you take… and they find my shifting stone. They come back to headquarters saying that "we couldn't catch the air pirate but we found his magic rock". There was never any coming back from that. Your Foundation was headless, the Coalition is still in turmoil over it, and I've neutered your friends in the FBI. You had the makings of a great alliance. My friend Ambiorix built a great alliance. He fought well with it, but an alliance is only as strong as what bonds it together. When then cavalry charged… the bonds broke and the men scattered. And your good friend Gus, his father killed Ambiorix right then and there. Such a fool… had he lived just another day… I had to stop your organization from getting any more power. You have thousands of innocent men and women locked away. Your friends in the Coalition have graveyards that put your prisons to shame. Please consider an alternative. I don't take any joy in what I do. I don't consider myself a hero. I could live happily in the little realm my people have carved out, tucked away in a demiplane you'd have a hard time ever finding. But it'd be wrong to let your idea of a world order exist. Do the smart thing. Have a heart. You have the power to change to Foundation. I suggest you use it.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> You're awfully calm about all this.<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I've had a conversation much like this one before. Similar situation, a smart woman… attractive woman. Bathing, making plans… I miss her.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> What happened?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> Julius butchered her the day he defeated Ambiorix. She was a Celt after all. Why take any chances? Too many mages to start sorting people out.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> I'm…<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> I think you'll need to consider my offer. You won't like the alternative. Here are a few pages I wrote in case you weren't here. I hope there isn't an issue translating it. This was an old code the druids in Sasana used to get messages past the Romans. The code was never cracked. and when the rest of us left or died out, there was no one left to use it. When I visit you again, maybe you can tell me exactly what it says. I'll still visit your plane, but I need to tend to my people back in my realm. They're growing a bit restless. They want to come back home.<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> When will you be back?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> [holds up left hand with the pointer finger and thumb extended]<br/>
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Two years? Two decades?<br/>
<strong>PoI-305:</strong> [laughs] Gus would have understood that one. In truth, I'll still return to this plane, just not with violent intentions. So much has changed since I last took the time to explore your world. So many new places and new pieces of technology. I've got bars to visit, I've got musicians to meet, hell I might even take a stab at making one of those moving pictures you invented. I'll need a little bit of a vacation if I'm going to bring a war to the Foundation. See you someday, ma'am… and put some clothes on before you try and wake up your security.</p>

<p>This conversation is presumed to be the most recent appearance of PoI-305, immediately Foundation personnel began searching for oghamstones resembling one found in Washington. The Foundation immediately approved Emergency Plan Augustus-1971 to permanently resolve the issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Emergency Plan Augustus-1971</strong><br/>
1. Translate the text that appears on the five paper notes given to the Administrator from PoI-305.<br/>
2. Find and contain other oghamstones similar in function to SCP-5017<br/>
3. Study SCP-5017 to learn how to access the other reality it allows travel to.<br/>
4. Successfully attack and destroy any forces hostile to the Foundation in this reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a decade long searching involving hundreds of Mobile Task Force members, seven candidates were found of which four have been conclusively ruled to be false positives. Containment sites have been built around the remaining three for further observation and in preparation for a large scale counter-attack. There have also been no major discoveries towards how SCP-5017 functions, although hundreds of possibilities have been ruled out. To date, there has been no successful translation of the documents received from PoI-305 in his final known appearance. Foundation personnel with experience decoding ciphers and appropriate security clearance are highly encouraged to attempt a translation of the cipher.</p>
