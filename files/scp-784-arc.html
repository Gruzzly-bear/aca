<p>SCP-784 was kept in a reinforced concrete containment cell with interior dimensions 10m x 10m x 10m and walls 2m thick. Said container was to be kept immersed in a 100 percent acetone bath to a depth of at least one meter: under no circumstances was the holding container to be removed from this acetone bath, except for weekly cleaning and resupply (see below).</p>
<p>SCP-784's biological components require a supply of nutrients, to be provided in an oxygenated electrolyte and glucose bath (see Supplemental Document 784-A). As SCP-784 was capable of filtering and circulating said liquid on its own, all that was necessary was for the reservoir to be recharged on a weekly basis. At least two Class-D personnel with acetone sprayers were to be kept on standby while the third performs the resupply and a sonar inspection of the holding container: any weak points were to be immediately patched. Should the assessment determine that the structure was dangerously unstable, said container was to be sealed within a secondary shell with interior dimensions 14m x 14m x 14m.</p>
<p>No electronic devices, silicon glass, or metals were to be permitted within 500m of SCP-784. Personnel maintaining SCP-784 were to be briefed on the dangers of working around a 100% acetone solution, and to be provided respirator gear and hazardous materials suits.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-784 is the remains of Agent A████████ A██████. Officially killed in action by [DATA EXPUNGED] during recovery operations at Prometheus Labs ████, Agent A██████ actually survived his injuries and was approved to undergo enhancement by <a href="scp-212.html">SCP-212</a>. Unusually enough, SCP-212 chose not to repair A██████'s extensive injuries (including traumatic amputation of all four limbs) or to remove a shard of [DATA EXPUNGED] that had become lodged in Agent A██████'s cerebrum. Instead, SCP-212 integrated the shard of circuitry more completely into Agent A██████'s brain and performed a standard organ maintenance.</p>
<p>Said shard of circuitry immediately began to repair itself and replace Agent A██████'s glial cells, leaving the neurons intact. Upon replacing the entirety of Agent A██████'s neuroglia, said circuitry bored several holes through the back of his skull, then removed the entirety of the parietal and occipital bones and replaced them with reinforced metal plating. Agent A██████ was then declared KIA and reclassified as SCP-784.</p>
<p>SCP-784 consists of two components: the biological portion consists of the Agent A██████'s neurons, spinal cord, and portions of his cranium and vertebra: the remainder of his body became necrotic over time and was debrided to prevent infection from spreading.</p>
<p>The second component is made up of a nanomachine colony and takes the form of a network of steel and silicon tendrils emerging from the back of Agent A██████'s skull and spine. The mechanical portion of SCP-784 has shown itself capable of reforming into a variety of different forms, including but not limited to: cutting tools, prehensile tendrils, interfaces for electronic devices, and molecular assemblers. SCP-784 is capable of breaking down and incorporating any silicon or metal object into its nanomachine network, and has shown a capacity for integrating electronic devices as well. Nonmetallic or silicon-based items can be broken down, but are not easily integrated.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum ██-██-████</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/784incident1">Following the events of ██-██-████</a>, the remaining .5 liters of nanomaterial recovered from the late Director Valentine are all that remain.</p>
<p>The nanomachine colony shows two weaknesses: first, individual nanomachines cannot function without a physical connection to the biological portion. Secondly, exposure to heat (above 100 degrees C) or certain solvents will cause the nanomachines to denature in a manner similar to proteins: a 100% acetone solution has shown to be both effective and easy to obtain in large quantities, and has been selected as the containment medium.</p>
<p>Despite its nature, SCP-784 is normally not hostile to life, except as a means of nourishing its biological component. The only casualties inflicted by SCP-784 were caused before a means of communication could be established, and the need for a nutrient bath were known. In that incident, SCP-784 attacked and entangled a Class-D personnel inspecting its containment cell, and proceeded to liquify a portion of its flesh, converting it into a nutrient solution which it then administered to its biological component.</p>
