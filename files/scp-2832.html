            <h1>SCP-2832</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2832</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Prototype Testing Facility 145 has been evacuated, with only a skeleton crew remaining to monitor SCP-2832. Site-22 will no longer be used to contain anomalous objects<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, instead serving as a staging area for the SCP-2832 containment team.</p>
<p>A circumference and <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes">Hume reading</a> is to be recorded once every 24 hours at 13:45, five minutes prior to SCP-2832's regular activation event. Testing equipment should be relocated away from the perimeter at a rate of 1 meter every 250 days, to a point 5 meters away from SCP-2832, and a new perimeter chalked at 1 meter from the threshold. At least two redundant Kant counters are to be kept on-site at all times, along with at least one set of backups for all other monitoring equipment. All personnel will be briefed on Foundation survivor benefits packages prior to taking assignment with SCP-2832.</p>
<p>Mobile Task Force Kappa-7 ("Faux Bull, Masked Horse") is stationed on-site and is to be mobilized prior to any activation events or testing. MTF Kappa-7 must remain in the testing chamber while SCP-2832 is in its active phase. When not engaged in active defense, MTF Kappa-7 is to focus efforts on maintaining the structural integrity of the testing chamber.</p>
<p>Research is to focus on the link between Hume levels and activation effects, as well as ways to reduce, halt or counteract the expansion of SCP-2832. SCP-2832 will make contact with SCP-████ in approximately 120 years. The consequences of this event cannot be foreseen.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2832 is an unstable cylindrical spatial anomaly with a radius of 11.45 meters<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, centered around SERS Prototype Unit Xi-2 in Prototype Testing Facility 145<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Once every 24 hours, SCP-2832's radius expands 1-4mm while the anomaly simultaneously enters its active phase. The particular effect present during any given active phase varies per event, and no pattern in or repetition of the effects of SCP-2832 has been determined. In 65% of activations thus recorded, the effect has lasted the entire 24 hour period. In the other 35% of events, SCP-2832 enters a passive state upon expiration of the effect. During its passive state, the anomaly becomes impermeable, with the exterior taking on an appearance similar to frosted glass, and the SERS unit visible at its center.</p>
<p>Scranton Reality Anchors have no measurable effect on SCP-2832, and no method of reducing its expansion has thus far been devised.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Prototype Testing Facility 145 was an autonomous wing of Site-22 built for research and development in 1997. SERS Prototype Unit Xi-2 had been commissioned on 08/01/2009 for modifications meant to counter non-Euclidean intra- and extradimensional incursions. A routine test on 28/02/2009 resulted in the appearance of a transparent shell around the unit once it was powered on, causing damage to floor and ceiling tiles in the testing chamber. After ascertaining that the unit could no longer be accessed or controlled, either remotely or directly, the chamber was cleared and preliminary containment procedures enacted.</p>
<p>The first activation event, and subsequent expansion of the anomaly, was recorded at 13:50 on 01/03/2009, five minutes after a baseline Hume reading was taken inside the chamber. SCP-2832 was classified Keter on 02/03/2009, by unanimous vote of the O5 Council.</p>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> After SCP-2832 enters its active state on 13/08/2013, D-9883 is provided hands-free audio and video recording equipment, along with a steel tether, and enters SCP-2832.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>00:00:</strong> Begin recording. Test of equipment conducted, ascertaining working condition through anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>00:05:</strong> D-9883 instructed to look around. Location determined as Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan. Park is entirely in shadow, though midday sun visible beyond. View to the northwest determines shadow cast by large cubical structure. All other views show expected landmarks. SCP-2832 appears as glowing ellipsoid shimmer in air, approximately 3 meters high and 0.3 meters from ground. D-9883 instructed to proceed towards cube, walking north up West 8th Street towards Washington Square Park.</p>
<p><strong>00:25:</strong> D-9883 reaches destination. No signs of human life have been observed during transit. Washington Square Park, along with New York University and other nearby buildings, have been completely replaced by cube structure. D-9883 instructed to measure one side.</p>
<p><strong>00:41:</strong> Side of cube estimated at slightly longer than 1 km. Surface is smooth, uniform dark material. D-9883 reports texture "feels like recycled plastic". Doors, closed, observed spaced evenly along exterior, at intervals of approximately 5 meters.</p>
<p><strong>00:45:</strong> D-9883 turns corner, instructed to open nearest door. Despite lack of exterior handle or knob, door is easily opened. Door opens into small room, well-lit, just large enough to hold one individual, with roof not quite touching individual's head. Interior space seems to be divided into nothing but rooms of a similar size. Each holds precisely one individual. Visible individuals appears to be of African descent; nearest is male.</p>
<p><strong>00:46:</strong> Nearest individual takes notice of D-9883. Individual turns to D-9883, placing a finger on his lips and shushing, before returning to previous position. It is noted all visible individuals are aligned facing northeast, to D-9883's left.</p>
<p><strong>00:47:</strong> D-9883 expresses discomfort with current situation. Individual startles and turns to D-9883, shouting in Igbo for aid. Other individuals in structure turn to observe D-9883. Without awaiting further instruction, D-9883 runs from structure toward entry point.</p>
<p><strong>00:53:</strong> D-9883 ignores commands to cease retreat. Occasional glances behind reveal continuous stream of people exiting cube structure from multiple doors and giving chase. Greater detail cannot be ascertained due to shaky footage.</p>
<p><strong>01:04:</strong> D-9883 overtaken by mass of individuals. Persons appear to be of African and Indian descent. Individuals proceed to assault D-9883.</p>
<p><strong>01:11:</strong> Monitoring equipment reports cessation of D-9883's life signs. Testing chamber is evacuated, and MTF Kappa-7 readies to counter potential extrauniversal incursion.</p>
<p><strong>01:20:</strong> Decision is made to attempt retrieval of equipment and personnel. Retrieval is halted when movement of D-9883's body attracts attention from nearby persons. Female individual of East Asian descent lifts camera to face. Visible in background are human beings of every age, sex and ethnicity. All appear to be in a state of severe distress, wandering aimlessly about area while weeping. No further violence witnessed. Individual examines camera, frowning and shaking head. Says in Thai, "Now what are we supposed to do," and drops camera.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> No further attempt was made to retrieve equipment or personnel. No attempt was made by individuals within SCP-2832 to enter the anomaly from their side. Battery of monitoring equipment expired three hours later. After 24 hours, a Hume reading was taken, after which SCP-2832 entered its active state as expected.</p>

<p>In the 26 years I have spent studying anomalies, no invention has improved our ability to contain them more than the Scranton Reality Anchor. It is a triumph of engineering, allowing us to assert our collective will over the chaotic and sometimes frightening reality in which we live. It provides a modicum of surety in the face of the unsure, a light by which we may drive back the darkness seeping in through the cracks in the universe. The SRA is a cornerstone in the Foundation's quest to preserve normalcy and protect the human race from the unknown.</p>
<p>The possibilities presented by the Scranton-Eamon Reality Sink, derived from the Reality Anchor, are as numerous as they are tantalizing. Its creation is a testament to the capability of our research and development scientists to rise to the occasion of any obstacle. The Foundation would not be anywhere near as successful as it is without their tireless work. The malfunction of Prototype Unit Xi-2 should not be taken as a setback, but as an opportunity to increase our understanding of the nature of reality. It is also a reminder that anomalies can appear when we least expect them. We must ever be on our guard.</p>
<p>As for SCP-2832…</p>
<p>We've no idea how it came to be. It resists our technology, is heedless of our every attempt to turn it back, and defies common knowledge of what anomalies can be, let alone what they can do. It exists in spite of all evidence that it should not. It is terrifying and wonderful all at once. In its presence, I again become a student of the strange and terrible universe I had once thought myself a master.</p>
<p>When I look at SCP-2832, I feel as though I do not know the first thing about anomalies or their containment.</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues to come to Prototype Testing Facility 145 and experience SCP-2832 for themselves. The feelings this anomaly evokes in the scientist's heart are truly liberating. Fall not into the hubris of complacent understanding: wonder again at the world.</p>

<p>With all due respect to Dr. Kaas — her bravery and leadership are on full display in the body of this article — SCP-2832 is no great wonder of the world. It is dangerous, a menace, and we have a limited time in which to deal with it, even if 119 years, give or take some months and days, seems to be forever from now.</p>
<p>And while I agree that the SRA and SERS are fantastic machines, that make our jobs infinitely easier, it stands to reason that <em>we</em> created SCP-2832. Whether it was an accident of design, pure misfortune, or… Hell, maybe we inadvertently summoned some kind of demon. There's no way to know. Regardless, SCP-2832 is our mistake, our burden, our mess to clean up. And given how resistant it is to our technology, I frequently despair that we will ever find a fix for that mistake.</p>
<p>I often wonder if any of this has purpose.</p>
<p>It does, of course. Our purpose is, as ever, to protect humanity and maintain normalcy. Though I would argue the methods the SCP-2832 containment team has been utilizing to do so have run the gamut from haphazard and reactionary to downright backward-thinking.</p>
<p>My point is, if you're going to come here and put yourself in danger for the sake of gawking at a rip in space-time, do it for the right reasons. Don't waste time wondering at the boundless beauty of the universe: get mad. Become extremely angry that this aberration, this <em>abomination</em>, dared exist where we tried to exert control. Use SCP-2832 as inspiration, to further the development of technologies that keep the Foundation's mission strong. Dr. Kaas and I may differ on much, but on one point we are agreed: With our combined skills, we have conquered and contained thousands of anomalies. SCP-2832 will be no different, given time.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A portion of Prototype Testing Facility 145 has been reopened for its original purpose of research and development. Preliminary tests suggest the new prototype may have functionality in containing SCP-2832 and other temporospatial anomalies. The O5 Council has tentatively provided funding for the full implementation of the new Scranton-Ettinger Reality Filter as of 13/01/2017.</p>
